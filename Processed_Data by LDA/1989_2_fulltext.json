She will become the Government's main spokesman and an important policy maker, replacing one of Mr. Kaifu's closest aides, Tokuo Yamashita, who resigned today after admitting to a long affair with a bar hostess. **********But Mr. Yamashita, who is married and 69 years old, denied that the $21,000 he gave the 26-year-old bar hostess recently was meant as hush money to assure her silence while he was Chief Cabinet Secretary. He had held the job only since Mr. Kaifu took office 15 days ago. Day of Crisis **********Mr. Kaifu's quick acceptance of Mr. Yamashita's resignation came after a day of crisis for the new Government. Many feared a repetition of the troubles that forced Sousuke Uno out of the Prime Minister's office after only a month on the job amid revelations that he had affairs with at least two geishas. Mr. Uno, in turn, had taken over for Noboru Takeshita, who was implicated in a stock- and influence-peddling scandal involving the Recruit Corporation, a data-services and real-estate conglomerate. **********Despite the quick action, the disclosures about Mr. Yamashita - particularly the suggestion that he was trying to buy the young woman's silence -seriously undercut Mr. Kaifu's promises to clean up Japanese politics. His choice of Mrs. Moriyama, a highly regarded two-term member of the upper house of Parliament and one of the few influential women in the Liberal Democratic Party, is clearly part of an effort to win back the support of women who have defected in droves from the Liberal Democrats, contributing to the party's resounding defeat in an upper- house election last month. **********Mr. Kaifu is expected to meet President Bush in Washington next week and that is probably a major reason why he moved quickly to resolve the crisis brought about by the Yamashita disclosures. **********Today, Mrs. Moriyama, 61 years old, played down the significance of being the first woman to serve as Chief Cabinet Secretary and said she did not view herself as someone who had overcome major obstacles. ''In my 40-year career,'' she said at a news conference, ''I have never felt disadvantaged because I am a woman.'' Change in Rules of Conduct **********For the Liberal Democrats, Mrs. Moriyama's appointment could prove to be a coup. The Chief Cabinet Secretary appears on television virtually every day, and party members are hoping she will provide a clear counterpoint to Takako Doi, the woman who leads the opposition Socialist Party. **********Perhaps more importantly, the resignation of Mr. Yamashita appeared to indicate how swiftly the rules of conduct have changed for Japanese politicians. While money scandals are a regular event in Japan, public discussion of sexual conduct was considered irrelevant and off-limits until June. That was when one of Mr. Uno's former mistresses, saying that she had been mistreated, took her story to a weekly news magazine. **********Emboldened by the revelations of the Recruit scandal and general distrust of the Government, the magazine published the account after several competitors declined to do so. Mr. Uno tried to ignore the charges, but they were soon repeated on the floor of Parliament and in the foreign press. 'I Felt Responsible' **********Now, apparently, party leaders believe that Mr. Uno's stonewalling was a major mistake. So when another weekly magazine, the Shukan Shincho, published details of Mr. Yamashita's affair with the bar hostess between 1984 and 1987, he made no effort to deny it. But he has yet to give a clear explanation about why he offered the bar hostess three million yen on Aug. 3, two years after their affair reportedly ended and just as the Kaifu Government was being formed. **********''I felt responsible for her because I had left her alone for so long, and thus ended up giving her more than I originally intended,'' he said. He added that the timing of the gift with his political appointment was coincidental. **********Mrs. Moriyama has been an outspoken proponent of women's rights in Japan and in an interview in July was openly critical of the Liberal Democratic leadership for being out of touch with the thoughts and values of young Japanese, both men and women. A Party Loyalist **********''I don't think they understand why this kind of behavior is no longer acceptable,'' she said of Mr. Uno and his advisers shortly before the Prime Minister was forced out. **********Nonetheless, she is also a party loyalist. She was the youngest Japanese woman to hold a leading post in the Labor Ministry and represented Japan at a United Nations conference on women in 1985. She was placed in charge of the environment this month when Mr. Kaifu took office. **********Mrs. Moriyama has served as head of the upper house's committee on foreign affairs and speaks English fluently. She is the widow of Kinji Moriyama, who was a leading member of the party faction to which Mrs. Moriyama and Mr. Kaifu belong."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/12/business/car-makers-weigh-gasoline-changes-to-cut-pollution.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1989-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1034, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAR MAKERS WEIGH GASOLINE CHANGES TO CUT POLLUTION", "print_headline": "CAR MAKERS WEIGH GASOLINE CHANGES TO CUT POLLUTION", "body_text": " **********The Big Three auto makers are close to joining leading oil companies in testing the feasability of using reformulated gasoline instead of methanol or other alternative fuels to meet stricter clean-air standards proposed by the Bush Administration. **********The Administration proposal, submitted to Congress in June, calls for the auto industry to begin producing up to a million vehicles annually by the mid-1990's that would burn an unspecified ''alternative fuel.'' **********Officials of the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as some officials in Southern California, are thought by the oil and auto industries to favor methanol, but those industries have serious reservations. Pilot Models Being Tested **********The Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation have all expressed confidence that they can build methanol-burning vehicles in quantity, if required to do so, by the mid-1990's; Ford and G.M. are now testing pilot models in California. **********But auto executives also worry that short of a law requiring the purchase of such vehicles, consumers may ultimately reject methanol vehicles, leaving the companies to bear the financial brunt of the law. **********The research project under discussion would examine various reformulations of gasoline, as well as fuels like methanol, ethanol, natural gas and perhaps others. Tests would provide data on the nature of emissions and performance characteristics of the fuel when burned by engines now built by Detroit, said Helen O. Petrauskas, a Ford vice president. Vote by Early 1990 Seen **********Mrs. Petrauskas said she hoped the project could begin ''within a few months'' so a great deal of data would be accumulated in advance of rule-making hearings that would start 18 months after the passage of a bill. Many in the industry and the Government believe a bill could be put to a vote by early 1990. ''The sooner we get started, the more data we'll have when rule-making starts,'' she added. **********In the past, the auto makers and the oil companies have conducted joint research on other issues of mutual interest, like motor oils and lubricants, through committees of the Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association. But few projects have held as much potential for making an impact on the way cars are designed - of the way fuel is processed and delivered - as the project under discussion. **********Oil companies have billions of dollars invested in gasoline refineries in the United States and abroad, and industry officials say they prefer to comply with provisions of any new law by providing a reformulated gasoline. **********''What we're looking for is a level playing field so that every fuel that might be a cost-effective solution to the problem might have a chance to compete,'' said Keith McHenry, a senior vice president of the Amoco Corporation, a major oil refiner. ''We want to find the truth. We'd prefer to sell reformulated gasoline, but if the research shows that methanol is the best solution, we'll sell methanol.'' **********Privately, Federal environmental officials insist that oil industry lobbyists are waging a behind-the-scenes political battle to remove methanol and other non-gasoline alternatives from consideration. Many Issues Not Resolved **********Conversely, auto and oil industry officials believe E.P.A. officials are predisposed in favor of methanol, even though many technical and other issues have not been resolved, like how to inhibit emission of formaldehyde from methanol-burning engines. Another serious drawback of methanol is that it contains less energy than gasoline, and thus vehicles would have to be redesigned to carry a significantly bigger tank of fuel to equal the range of current models. **********''The oil companies are working hard to get the alternate fuels provisions killed,'' said Richard D. Wilson, director of the E.P.A.'s office of mobile sources. ''We know for sure that ethanol, methanol and compressed natural gas can meet the emissions targets we've set. If the oil industry can come up with a reformulated gasoline that can meet the standards, it's fine with us.'' **********Gasoline is a combination of many hydrocarbons, sometimes more than 100, that can be varied in amount to affect the fuel's properties, like volatility or how easily the fuel evaporates in the atmosphere. Statement by Sununu **********One Big Three lobbyist in Washington, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the companies had been told by John Sununu, the President's chief of staff, that the Government has not already decided the case in favor of methanol. ''Sununu has told us it's a level playing field and may the best and most economical fuel win,'' the lobbyist added. **********Although the specific emissions standards would be set in the rule-making phase of the legislative procedure, the President's bill would generally lower the amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and other particles that could be emitted legally from a car's tailpipe. Auto makers have said they are not sure whether such reductions will do much to clean up the air, but they have said they will support the legislation. **********Auto makers have suggested for some time, however, that reformulation of gasoline could reduce so-called running losses, or gasoline evaporation, which contributes to air pollution. Recently the oil industry has begun to respond. The Atlantic Richfield Company, a major gasoline marketer, last month announced a lower-polluting formulation of a new fuel for cars that still burn leaded gasoline; the company said it was working on a version for cars that burn unleaded fuel, too. **********Denying a report in the automotive trade press that the purpose of joint research was to kill methanol as an alternative fuel, Arthur E. Wiese, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, said: ''We're not against methanol per se. We're against doing it before we can answer the various technical and environmental questions.'' **********Several major oil companies are testing reformulated gasolines -sometimes referred to as ''designer'' gasolines, while others, including ARCO and the Sun Company, are test-marketing methanol in areas where experimental vehicles are being studied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/29/business/company-news-omi-stock-bought.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OMI Stock Bought", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; OMI Stock Bought", "body_text": " **********Storebrand A.S., a Norwegian insurance company, has acquired 6.9 percent of the OMI Corporation, a cargo-fleet operator based in New York.

Stakes Are High **********After several years of debate, pamphleteering, canvassing and speeches, the health and safety of Nissan workers has emerged as the central issue in the union's attempt to organize the Smyrna plant. The stakes are high. Nissan fervently wants to retain what it sees as a competitive advantage in dealing directly with employees, in contrast to the big American auto makers, who must go through union officials. **********The U.A.W. believes it must preserve its role as protector and representative of American auto workers, particularly as the Japanese have established a wave of United States auto plants and other industrial unions have withered. **********Ultimately, the U.A.W.'s tremendous bargaining power with the Big Three and numerous automotive suppliers rests on its size and pervasive coverage of the industry. **********So far, the union has not organized any of the plants operated in the United States by Japanese auto companies. Honda and Toyota, Nissan's biggest rivals, have not opposed union organizing efforts, insisting that their employees will decide if they want a union. An embryonic organizing effort has begun in Toyota's plant in Georgetown, Ky. So far, the U.A.W. doesn't believe support from Honda workers is strong enough to risk a vote at a plant in Marysville, Ohio, despite a vigorous organizing drive there. **********The U.A.W. has not been able to argue effectively that it can improve compensation, since Nissan's pay and benefits, starting with hourly wages in a range of $13 to $14 and hour, are competitive with the rest of the domestic industry. Nissan workers also receive fringe benefits like subsidized car and truck leasing, unheard of in other American car plants. **********''We were handed a full package right at the beginning,'' said Cheryl Schou, 36 years old, who works on the paint line. When a tree fell on her leased car during a storm, the company scurried to arrange a replacement in 30 minutes, she said. **********Another point in Nissan's favor is that it has never laid off workers here. The union takes credit for that, saying its organizing drive forced Nissan to retrain workers rather than lay them off in slack periods. **********Thus, the union's campaign has emphasized broken bones, carpal tunnel syndrome - a hand injury thought to be caused by repetitive motions -and other job-related ailments. Richard Davidson, 28, said he needed back surgery after hurting himself while installing drive shafts. Although Nissan benefits covered his medical care, he is bitter that his job had not been changed to prevent injuries. **********''Others before me told Nissan the job was unsafe,'' he said. ''After the union put out a leaflet telling my story, the company finally changed it.'' Mr. Davidson is on long-term disability leave, and he contends that Nissan has not assigned him a light-duty job, as it has other injured workers, because of his union activism. Nissan says it does not have a job for him. **********Other workers dispute the contentions that Nissan is indifferent to safety, but most agree that work in an auto plant is often hazardous. Gary Maddox, 34, a tool-and-die maintainance worker who describes himself as an opponent of the union, said he broke his wrist in a fall on a floor made oily by a stamping press. ''No one can deny there are some very demanding jobs, he said. ''Hey, carpal tunnel syndrome is here.'' **********But Mr. Maddox hastens to add, ''We also have some people who don't want to work, who think they can hide because this is a large company.'' **********Earlier this year, Mr. Davidson and the three other injured workers requested a copy of a plant-wide medical log from Nissan, which they said they were entitled to inspect. Nissan refused on the grounds that the log contained confidential employee information and that the workers were acting as agents of the U.A.W. Tennessee state officials agreed with the workers and fined Nissan $5,000. The company is appealing. **********Nissan, which says its health and safety record is better than average, last year recorded 151 injuries requiring seven days or more off the job, up from 95 such injuries in 1987, and the most since the plant opened in 1982. It has been cited twice in the last four years by state inspectors for minor safety violations. **********Nissan's open opposition to the U.A.W. has been unusual, for no other Japanese auto maker operating in this country has dared to oppose the union. Several of the companies have joint ventures or cooperative agreements with American car makers, which recognize the U.A.W., so they recognize it as a precondition to opening a plant. **********But since 1985, when the U.A.W. signed a labor agreement with the United Motor Manufacturing joint venture in Fremont, Calif., that granted the company unprecedented flexibility on work rules and job classifications, the union has been trying to adopt a more cooperative stance. **********Hence, Some labor experts believe Nissan's opposition to the U.A.W. may be a mistaken and outdated strategy. ''Even if Nissan wins this election,'' said Harry C. Katz, a labor relations professor at Cornell University, ''there will be many angry and disgruntled workers. And a loss by the union doesn't mean it can't and won't organize other Japanese plants.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/22/world/beijing-journal-revel-planned-where-goddess-of-democracy-fell.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1079, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Beijing Journal; Revel Planned Where Goddess of Democracy Fell", "print_headline": "Beijing Journal; Revel Planned Where Goddess of Democracy Fell", "body_text": " **********Near the spot in Tiananmen Square where the Goddess of Democracy held vigil over the democracy movement several months ago, the Government has put up what it regards as a more appropriate mascot of China: a giant statue showing a worker, a farmer, a soldier and an intellectual united in a heroic revolutionary pose. **********The sculpture is the centerpiece of the Oct. 1 celebrations that will mark the 40th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. The official press is getting the festivities under way by releasing a confetti of statistics intended to convince Chinese that they have benefited from Communist rule. **********But the anniversary celebration, after more than a year of eager anticipation, is clouded by a wave of disillusionment that even many Chinese officials privately admit has reached a new peak. **********The increased disaffection with the Government, reflecting public annoyance with corruption, nepotism and inflation, as well as anger at the use of force to crush the democracy movement, now coincides with the Communist Party's official gala of self-congratulation. Polls Reveal Discontent **********It is impossible to gauge public attitudes precisely, but two opinion polls confirm the anecdotal impression that discontent is very high. **********A poll of 865 Beijing residents in May by the psychology department of Beijing Normal University found that 96 percent of those interviewed thought the democracy movement's demands were reasonable, while fewer than 1 percent thought the demands unreasonable. The others did not answer the question. No margin of sampling error was given. **********Another survey this summer found that 83 percent of the residents questioned in the central city of Hefei were ''not satisfied'' with the Government. **********While the newspapers and television stations are full of praise for the party's economic achievements since the revolution in 1949, many intellectuals complain that the Communist Party has sunk into the same abyss of corruption and repression and economic mismanagement as the Nationalists four decades ago. **********''It's part of the cycle of Chinese history,'' a prominent intellectual mused the other day. ''A new dynasty arrives full of hope, and then it gradually sinks into corruption and weakness and despair.'' Discontent at the Center **********The General Office of the Communist Party Central Committee experienced a minor uproar recently when a cadre school that it runs arranged a screening of ''Wei Wei Kunlun,'' a new movie about the period when the Communists were pitted against the Nationalists. A party official with first-hand information said the students clapped enthusiastically at the first appearance in the movie of the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. **********''The problem is that even people in the central party apparatus are now against the central party,'' the official said ruefully. **********To insure that the 40th anniversary celebration goes smoothly, despite the discontent, the Government is stepping up security checks. Since Friday, Chinese adults have been obliged to carry identity cards with them at all times and show them to the police upon request. **********Occasional roadblocks have resumed at night in some parts of Beijing, and the troop presence has been modestly increased on some streets after several months in which the number of soldiers fell steadily. Travel Is Curbed **********Chinese say residents of other cities who wish to come to Beijing in the next few weeks must have special permission to buy a ticket. **********''We can travel to Beijing only if we have a letter from our work unit,'' said a woman from a central Chinese province who arrived recently. ''You can only travel for business, not for tourism or visiting relatives.'' **********For all the increased security, dark rumors are being whispered around Beijing that violent protests will take place on Oct. 1. One account, perhaps founded more on hope than fact, suggests that suicide squads are preparing huge interruptions of the festivities. **********The Government has pledged that supplies of vegetables in the markets will be increased so that no one should have reason to grumble during the celebrations. **********But people are grumbling, and there are still occasional signs of dissent. Calling themselves the People's University Revolutionary Committee, 19 students of Beijing's People's University put up four posters on Sept. 6 calling for continued struggle for democracy. **********Another underground organization of seven workers put up anti-Government posters on Sept. 13, and then called an American reporter to make sure they got some publicity. **********Communist Party officials are very aware of the morale problems, and the solution decreed from above is to stress ideological education and try to rebuild the enthusiasm for Communism that swept China in the 1940's and early 1950's. The 40th anniversary celebration is part of the program to nurture such enthusiasm. #40 Slogans to Bloom People's Daily has a special feature page these days called ''National Celebration Page.'' And the Politburo has published a list of 40 slogans for the celebration, including ''Warmly hail the victory in stopping turmoil and quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion!'' and ''Practice family planning to control the growth of the population and improve its quality!'' **********In keeping with the current emphasis on austerity, because of China's economic difficulties, the Government has announced that the celebrations will somewhat restrained and held in a ''frugal and thrifty atmosphere.'' **********Still, the celebration will be a considerable event. Indeed, where money is needed to make a point, the Government has provided it.

A hemophiliac infected with the AIDS virus denounced the bitter jokes and discrimination aimed at people like himself. Experts referred matter-of-factly to oral and anal intercourse, terms used widely in the era of AIDS yet still viewed as uncouth in South America and rarely uttered in public. **********Latin America, where sexual promiscuity is carefully cloaked in pretense and euphemism, is starting to confront its growing AIDS epidemic. New Insights on Sex **********According to the Pan-American Health Organization, which organized a regional conference on AIDS here in December, 9,453 cases of AIDS have been reported in Latin America and 1,146 cases in the Caribbean. Experts believe that the real numbers are much higher, and they also say that half the known victims have died. **********But the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Latin America is altering some long-held images and producing new insights into the customs of a region where few studies about sexual behavior exist. **********''We have been going on assumptions, not on research,'' said Dr. Fernando Zacarias, coordinator of AIDS programs at the Pan-American Health Organization. ''We are finding very different habits and attitudes even in conservative countries.'' The Spread Among Women **********While the Latin culture, for example, celebrates masculinity, researchers say AIDS is showing that the number of homosexual and bisexual men is far greater than previously known. **********In Latin America, the disease overwhelmingly strikes homosexual and bisexual men, but its incidence among women is slowly rising. The numbers vary widely. In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, a third of all AIDS patients are women; in Venezuela, there are 30 men with AIDS to every woman with the disease; and in Brazil, there are 11 men with AIDS to every woman with the disease. **********In Brazil, 4,439 cases of AIDS have been reported as of December 1988, giving the country, which has 145 million people, the highest AIDS rate in the region. In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 83,000 AIDS cases have been reported as of Jan. 9 among a population of 250 million. More than half of those patients have died, and United States health officials say they believe that more than 1 million Americans have been infected with the AIDS virus. Rate Among U.S. Women **********In the United States, women account for 9 percent of the AIDS cases reported among adults. Federal officials believe that about half those women were infected with the AIDS virus through the sharing of intravenous needles, while about 30 percent of those women were infected through heterosexual intercourse, in most cases with men who were drug users. **********Doctors from nations including Mexico, Honduras, Venezuela and Brazil attributed the incidence of AIDS among women in their countries to transfusions with contaminated blood as well as to sexual relations with bisexual men. Intravenous drug users are few. **********But experts in Latin America also say they are now discovering that men frequently insist on anal intercourse in their relationships with women and that this form of intercourse may be a reason why more and more women are contracting AIDS. Because anal tissue is more vulnerable to tearing during intercourse than vaginal tissue, the experts say, the AIDS virus is more likely to enter the bloodstreams of women who take part in anal intercourse. **********''Everything we know indicates that anal intercourse without condoms is the most dangerous of all sexual practices that people have studied,'' said Dr. Don Des Jarlais, a coordinator for AIDS research for New York State, who attended the conference. ''Anal tissues will often rupture and bleed. There is more trauma and more exchange of blood.'' A Taboo on the Topic **********Doctors say the subject is usually avoided in a region where people are largely uncomfortable talking about sex. But experts now believe that they must address the question in research and in educational campaigns. **********''Anal sex is much more common than people think, and we will have to warn women about this,'' said Dr. Gloria Echeverria Perez, a member of Venezuela's national AIDS commission. But experts stress that any unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner, anal of vaginal, carries the risk of spreading the disease. **********Gabriela Leite Silva, the leader of a Brazilian organization of prostitutes and a speaker at the AIDS conference, said, ''We, the prostitutes, who work with a lot of men, know that the men in our country often want anal sex, regardless of whether they are heterosexual or homosexual.'' **********The AIDS crisis has also brought to the surface a quandary: in a region with scarce medical resources, should fighting AIDS be given priority over endemic diseases like malaria, dengue fever and tuberculosis, all of which affect much larger numbers of people. The Cuban Approach **********The Cuban approach to the AIDS question drew attention at the Latin conference. Dr. Hector Terry, the Cuban Deputy Minister of Health, surprised experts by disclosing previously restricted information about the Cuban campaign against AIDS. Dr. Terry told the conference that Cuba has now tested 3.2 million people to see if they carry the antibodies to the AIDS virus, or about 32 percent of the nation's population of about 10 million. **********The Cuban minister said that the number he gave represented 46 percent of the sexually active population, and that 246 people have tested positive for the AIDS antibodies. He did not say how many had shown symptoms of AIDS or had died from the disease. **********Dr. Terry did not discuss what medical treatment AIDS patients were receiving and did not address assertions by Cuban exiles that AIDS victims were being held in partial quarantine. Visitors to Africa Tested **********''We checked everyone returning from Africa,'' Dr. Terry added, referring to Cuban troops, foreign aid workers and technicians who had done stints in a region where AIDS is a major health crisis. ''Among slightly over 300,000 people, we found 84 who were positive,'' he said. **********Cuba's screening, which experts said was proportionately the largest known anywhere, drew criticism from doctors and health officials. ''We consider it a waste of resources,'' said a regional official who favors testing high-risk groups and emphasizing education. **********But educational campaigns are hampered throughout South America by traditional reservations about discussing sex, experts say. Roman Catholic Church and education officials, for example, have widely opposed promoting the use of condoms on television. **********''In every country in the region we are finding it difficult to get teachers involved in the educational programs,'' said Jonathan Mann, director of the World Health Organization's AIDS program. ''Teachers feel unprepared or are concerned to talk about the issues or they may get pressure from parents who do not like the idea.'' #5,000 Brazilians Die of Malaria As in other third world regions, experts say the cost of helping aids victims has become an obstacle to more effective programs. Brazil, the country with the most AIDS cases, last year had 500,000 cases of malaria, and the disease killed 5,000 people. **********''The question we hear most often is, 'What if you find a drug, can we afford it?' '' said Ronald St. John, a senior official at the Pan-American Health Organization. ''People are aghast that it can cost thousands of dollars a year to obtain medicine. This is a continent where many physicians just earn $400 or $500 per month.'' **********Experts said a priority for the coming year was to make testing more easily available. The cost of tests has been a barrier to widespread screening of risk groups, Dr. Zacarias said, and even simple protective devices like condoms are not always available. 'Cases Will Grow Rapidly' **********AIDS experts said they feared that the number of cases of AIDS would grow dramatically in Latin America. **********''Even if the reporting is incomplete, you just have to look at the curve to see that cases will grow rapidly,'' said Dr. King Holmes, a director of the Harbor View Medical Center of Seattle. **********By some estimates, perhaps half a million people have been contaminated by the AIDS virus in Latin America and the Caribbean, creating long-term problems. ''Given the long period of incubation, the number of cases due to blood transfusion and drug abuse will definitely increase in the coming years,'' said Dr. Jaime Sepulveda, director of epidemiology at the Mexican Ministry of Health."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/business/week-in-business-michael-milken-is-indicted.html": {"writer_name": "William Niederkorn", "pub_date": "1989-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 911, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Michael Milken Is Indicted", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; Michael Milken Is Indicted", "body_text": " **********Michael R. Milken was indicted last week by a Federal grand jury on charges of violating the Federal racketeering law. Prosecutors are seeking the unprecedented financial penalty of $1.8 billion in the case against Mr. Milken, the Drexel Burnham Lambert executive who pioneered the use of ''junk bonds'' to finance corporate takeovers. Two others are also charged in the criminal action, the largest ever undertaken against Wall Street figures: Lowell Milken, a senior Drexel executive and brother of Michael Milken, and Bruce L. Newberg, a former trader in Drexel's high-yield, high-risk bonds. All three pleaded not guilty. Arthur L. Liman, who was Senate counsel during the Iran-Contra hearings, will lead the defense team. If there is no out-of-court settlement, the trial may begin as early as the end of the year.  * **********Two executives pleaded guilty in the Pentagon procurement fraud case. William L. Parkin, a consultant to military contractors, admitted guilt on charges of bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy. Fred H. Lackner, a Woodland Hills, Calif., consultant, pleaded guilty to similar charges in connection with a scheme involving the bribing of a Navy official for information on contracts. **********Litton Industries was sued by a former employee accusing the military contractor of deliberately overcharging the Pentagon from 1981 to 1988. The Justice Department joined the suit, brought under Federal laws encouraging people to report fraud by Government contractors.  * The index of leading indicators fell three-tenths of 1 percent in February. Analysts said the decline was not a sign of serious trouble in the economy. Economists, who had predicted slower growth this year than the inflation-adjusted 3.9 percent rate of 1988, saw nothing in the numbers to suggest a recession. The apparent weakness of the leading economic indicators and other data for last month - including a decline in retail sales, flat industrial production and a 9.4 percent drop for sales of new single-family homes - followed strong gains in January. **********The market gained back the ground it lost last week and then some, as the Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.58 points for the week, to 2,293.62. The dollar rose against the West German mark and the Japanese yen, while Treasury bonds also rallied. Crude oil prices in the spot market remained above $20 a barrel, as Alaska's oil output was halved by the Exxon tanker spill. **********NCNB offered to buy Citizens and Southern, the largest bank company in Georgia, in a move that would create one of the nation's 10 largest banking companies. Citizens and Southern said its board would consider the offer, which figured to be worth about $2.4 billion. For NCNB, with about $55 billion in assets, the merger would mark its second significant expansion in less than a year. Last summer, NCNB was the winning bidder for First Republicbank, the largest bank company in Texas. **********Twenty Mcorp banks were seized Wednesday by Federal regulators, who said they acted to halt heavy withdrawals that could have threatened the stability of the banking system in Texas. The move followed an announcement earlier in the week by Mcorp that it planned to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Analysts estimated the takeover would cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation more than $1 billion. **********The battle for Harrods department store took a bizarre turn. The Observer, a London Sunday newspaper, published a special edition Thursday that included lengthy extracts from what the paper said was a previously unpublished report of a British Government investigation into the $1.05 billion 1985 purchase of House of Fraser P.L.C., which owns Harrods, by the Fayed brothers of Egypt. After a few thousand copies were sold, the Government got a court order to prevent publication and distribution of the edition on the ground that disclosure of the report could prejudice an investigation of the takeover being conducted by its Serious Fraud Office.  * **********NWA got a takeover offer valued at about $2.6 billion, from a group led by Marvin Davis, the oilman and investor. On Friday, share prices of NWA, which owns Northwest Airlines, rose 16.625 on the New York Stock Exchange, to an all-time high of $84.875.  * **********Miscellanea. Competing bids for Eastern Airlines came from Jay Pritzker, the Chicago financier, and Peter V. Ueberroth, the departing baseball commissioner. And after hesitating two weeks ago, Donald J. Trump has again agreed to pay about $365 million for Eastern's shuttle. Sears, Roebuck announced a reorganization aimed at strengthening its store management and eliminating 800 of 7,700 jobs. Sears said it would offer early retirement to older employees and financial incentives to encourage younger workers to resign. The company planned to offer a buyout deal to about 2,500 employees . . . A Federal appeals court overturned last year's convictions of two top executives of Beech-Nut Nutrition for distributing phony apple juice.

But until today, the Prime Minister did not actually reverse his stand and adopt what has become the governing Liberal Democratic Party's official, yet seldom-spoken, position: that Japan acknowledges an aggressive role during the war, though many of its members disagree on the question of who touched off the conflict. **********The barrage of criticism aimed at Mr. Takeshita and the Government came at a particularly bad time for the Prime Minister. His administration is already under siege from the widening investigation into an influence-peddling and bribery scandal. That scandal struck closer to the Prime Minister's office today with the arrest of Hisashi Shinto, the former chairman of Japan's recently privatized telephone system and a major political force.  [ Business Day, page D1. ]  In the last few days, Government officials have suggested that Mr. Takeshita's original comments about war responsibility were an oversight, made after he had been taken by surprise during questioning in Parliament. **********''He was not prepared,'' a senior Government official said late last week. But he could not correct the comments, the official said, because Parliament was out of session until after the Emperor's funeral was concluded. **********Meanwhile, there were protests around the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, and the English-language China Daily suggested that some Japanese were still ''nostalgic for their vanished glories.'' Other critics said Mr. Takeshita's comments revealed that Japan had yet to learn any lessons from World War II, a comment Japanese officials dismissed. **********Then last week Mr. Takeshita, who is renowned for the vagueness of his speech, acknowledged that ''there were actions of aggression'' during the war. But his critics, both at home and abroad, said that statement was too vague to mean anything. It seemed to leave open the possibility that some Japanese actions were motivated by self-defense or were the result of accidents. 'There Was an Aggression' **********Today, again in questioning in Parliament, Mr. Takeshita was asked if he agreed with past comments made by his Foreign Minister, Sosuke Uno, that World War II was a result of ''aggression by Japanese militarism.'' **********This time Mr. Takeshita was prepared to agree. ''I think there was an aggression by militarism,'' he said. **********In later exchanges, Mr. Takeshita would not say if his comment applied to the entire war, or just parts of it. So far, he and other Government officials have gone out of their way to distinguish Japan's behavior during the war from Nazi Germany's. **********It is unclear whether his comments today will close the issue. Rightists tended to applaud his earlier comments, saying Japan has paid too long for its war role. But other nations, particularly those like China and Korea that were occupied by Japanese forces, feel it is important to constantly remind the world of Japanese aggression, particularly as the country's influence grows."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/19/world/10-are-killed-in-beirut-as-shells-hit-building.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "10 Are Killed in Beirut As Shells Hit Building", "print_headline": "10 Are Killed in Beirut As Shells Hit Building", "body_text": " **********Ten people were killed and nine seriously hurt when an apartment block collapsed in the Muslim part of Beirut overnight after being hit by artillery fire during renewed heavy gun battles, police and hospital officials said today. **********The new fighting, between Syrian troops and Lebanese Muslim militiamen on one side and Christian forces on the other, continued today despite the presence here of an Arab League envoy who is trying to get the warring factions to observe a cease-fire called by an Arab committee on Saturday. **********Local radio stations quoted security officials as saying that Muslim militiamen had kept an ammunition dump in the apartment building and that it blew up when the structure was hit by a shell fired from the Christian side. **********The building was a few yards from the residence of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian Party of God.

That proposal would rebuild Eastern to perhaps 90 percent of its former size. **********One of the sources said the creditors had decided to back the plan despite its risks because they think they will have a good chance of being fully repaid, plus interest, on their investments in the airline. No Alternative Plans **********Yesterday the creditors told their advisers to stop developing alternatives to the management plan. **********That was a turnabout by the committee, which on Oct. 18 had voted unanimously to have its advisers work quickly to come up with alternatives to Eastern's plan. **********The creditors took the step after they received very negative assessments of Eastern's plan from their advisers, Goldman, Sachs & Company and Ernst & Young. **********Eastern, which is owned by the Texas Air Corporation, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 9, five days after its machinists union went on strike. The pilots and flight attendants unions honored the picket lines, effectively crippling the airline. **********Initially, Eastern's management said it hoped to emerge from bankruptcy as a slimmed-down airlines, perhaps 65 percent of its former size. But it said recently that it hoped to rebuild to 85 to 90 percent of its former size, helped in part by many strikers who were returning to work. **********Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air, and Philip J. Bakes, the president of Eastern, have been lobbying the group to support their plan. Plan Goes to Committee **********The person who discussed the creditors' turnabout, who did not want to be identified, said Eastern was expected to present its plan to the committee this week and that parts of it had already been reported to it. The committee is scheduled to meet next Tuesday when it is expected to take final action on Eastern's plan. **********Both Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes have expressed optimism about their rebuilding plans, selling major assets with the approval of Judge Burton R. Lifland, the chief judge of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. In May, Donald J. Trump, the New York real estate developer, acquired the Eastern Airlines shuttle for $365 million. Eastern sold its Philadelphia gates, landing rights and Canadian routes to Midway Airlines for $206.5 million. **********Judge Lifland has repeatedly made it clear that he wanted to see Eastern revived because the carrier was a major employer and airline serving the East Coast. **********Thus any plan that might have been presented by the unsecured creditors that did not seek a major revival of Eastern could have run into tough questioning by Judge Lifland. **********The picture presented to the creditors by their own advisers was in sharp contrast to Eastern's projections. Under its plan, Eastern anticipated a profit of $621 million from 1990 to 1993, but Goldman, Sachs had concluded that there would be a loss of $521 million in the same period. **********Goldman also estimated that Eastern would have to borrow $1.12 billion to cover the cost of rebuilding. Eastern, which ended last year about $1.98 billion in debt, had projected that its debt would drop significantly and that after 1993 it would end up with little debt.

Conditions became so hectic that the police had to clear the Dresden terminal by force and the doors of trains were sealed from the outside to block them. **********The reports from Dresden said that thousands of East Germans descended on the station there soon after the announcement on Tuesday that trains would be sent to Prague to carry out the 11,000 or more East Germans who had overrun the West German Embassy and refused to leave until they were granted passage to the West. **********First Train Crosses Border  [ Early Thursday, the first train arrived in the border city of Hof, West Germany, after a trip marred by frequent delays. About 1,000 passengers, many appearing more fatigued than jubilant, were greeted by Bonn officials, then readied for another train trip to Ahrweiler, where they were to be processed for resettlement. ]  Horst Waffenschmidt, state secretary in the West German Interior Ministry, said in Hof that more people had entered the embassy in Prague after the last of eight trains left the Czechoslovak capital for the West and that they would also be allowed to emigrate.  [ A West German border-police spokesman said that East Germans hoping to board the trains blocked the tracks near the border and that some were injured, the Reuters news agency reported. West German officials said they were aware of the report but could not confirm it. ]  Such events contrasted starkly with a formal celebratory atmosphere in East Berlin, where flags and banners have been strung across the city in preparation for the commemoration this weekend of the 40th anniversary of the East German state. One huge banner in the city center read, ''Long Live the German Democratic Republic,'' and all newspapers carried exultant articles hailing the achievements of the ''first workers' and peasants' state on German soil.'' **********But at the level of ordinary East Germans, some held extraordinary hopes. West German Government and railroad officials said that many young East Germans were still hiding along train lines in the southern part of East Germany, concentrating at points where the trains had to slow down for grades or curves. **********Rail workers in Hof, the destination point for the East Germans after their overland trip through East Germany from Prague, said the woods at a border spot where the East German locomotives were replaced with West German ones were filled with would-be emigrants hoping to board. **********The new level of desperation among East Germans came the day after their Government announced that it was suspending unrestricted travel to Czechoslovakia, thus sealing off the last major route out of the country. Precautionary Deception **********Mr. Waffenschmidt said that the trains from Prague, in addition to being locked from the outside, were using differing routes. Preparations had been made to receive as many as 15,000 people, he said. **********Diplomats said that all these efforts reflected a growing sense that the door to the West, open throughout the summer, was now closing. **********The exodus began when Hungary lowered its borders with Austria. When travel to Hungary was curtailed, East Germans hoping to leave began seeking refuge at the West German Embassy in Prague, which they could reach without special permission. **********By last weekend, the grounds there were full, and East Germany agreed to let about 5,500 of its citizens travel to the West. That decision inspired thousands more to flee to Czechoslovakia, and in three days, as many as 15,000 East Germans were said to be in Prague. **********On Tuesday, East Berlin agreed once again to transport the refugees out, but this time it closed its border with Czechoslovakia. **********Today, reports about an occupation of the American Embassy by 18 East Germans eager to leave drew 200 other East Germans to the mission, and some began to pound on the locked door. The police drove them back and sealed off all approaches. Extra policemen were posted outside Western embassies and at the Hungarian Consulate, where groups of East Germans gathered from time to time. Communist-World Festivities **********This weekend in East Berlin, the highlight of the celebrations will be a torchlight parade on Friday night and a big military parade on Saturday along the broad Karl-Marx-Boulevard attended by all the leaders of the Communist countries, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. **********Today, though, the mood of the city seemed far from exultant. **********New Forum, a group formed last month to press for reforms in East Germany that already has about 8,000 supporters, issued an urgent plea to its sympathizers not to try to demonstrate this weekend, warning that this could provoke violent retaliation. **********But the group's leaders, as well as Western diplomats, thought it inevitable that protests would be mounted. **********And many East Berliners thought the presence of Mr. Gorbachev would fan protest, given his image as a messenger of change. **********Leaders of New Forum spoke of despair among young East Germans. **********''There is a tremendous hatred and anger in the population,'' said Jutta Seidel, a 38-year-old dentist. **********Sebastian Pflugbeil, a 42-year-old physicist, said: ''In principle, either East Germany will reform or it will become like China or Rumania, and people feel there is not much hope. We try to convince ourselves there is hope. But people don't want to wait. And now they feel they have missed their last chance to flee.'' **********East Germans and Western diplomats talked also of a sense of anxiety and doubt spreading from the public through middle ranks of the Communist Party. They spoke of a feeling that there were no good choices available to the Government. 'Old Men' Out of Touch **********Any reform would have to include liberalized travel, and given the atmosphere in the country, this would probably revive the exodus. Yet the lack of tangible reform might fuel greater despair and anger. **********''People are nervous, jumpy, they don't know how to deal with the situation,'' a Western diplomat said. ''Rumors are rampant. People in the party are openly talking about what should be done. But there is a sense that the old men in charge don't even see that there is a problem.'' **********The health of Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old East German leader who is thought to be ailing, continued to be the subject of speculation. **********But critics questioned whether even his departure would herald change. ''It might be that Honecker isn't even the worst,'' Mr. Pflugbeil said. ''At least he was in a concentration camp and was willing to fight for his ideals with his life.

Kulikov would be replaced after 17 years as military commander of the Warsaw Pact by Pyotr G. Lushev, a four-star general regarded as a strong supporter of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's military policies. **********The change in the Warsaw Pact post, regarded as the top field command in the Soviet forces, had been widely expected. General Lushev, 65 years old, who joined the Soviet Army in 1941 and was wounded in the siege of Leningrad, will be deeply involved in carrying out military cutbacks that the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations have announced in Eastern Europe, including the removal of 50,000 Soviet troops and 5,000 tanks. **********On a broader level, the decision to transfer Marshal Kulikov, 67, to a relatively unimportant post in the military inspectorate in Moscow and to replace him with General Lushev reflected a new step in the far-reaching renewal of the Soviet military hierarchy that has taken place under Mr. Gorbachev. Many Commanders Replaced **********Since becoming the Soviet leader nearly four years ago, Mr. Gorbachev has replaced all but a handful of the Soviet Union's top 20 military figures, including the Defense Minister, the armed forces' Chief of Staff and most of the top theater commanders. **********Marshal Kulikov's transfer marked another, more symbolic change, the removal of the last serving Soviet marshal - the rank is equal to five-star general in the American armed forces - from an operational command. **********In the United States, five-star generals are appointed only in time of war, but since World War II the Kremlin, particularly under Leonid I. Brezhnev, has appointed numerous marshals. **********In line with other steps to lower the profile of the military in Soviet life, Mr. Gorbachev has apparently decided to abolish the practice of routinely promoting top commanders to marshal rank. The Defense Minister, Dmitri T. Yazov, has remained a four-star general since assuming his post 19 months ago, as has the new Chief of Staff, Mikhail A. Moiseyev, 49, who was vaulted into his position as the top operational commander in December. **********Western military analysts said Marshal Kulikov had given no overt sign of resisting the cutbacks in the Warsaw Pact. A Difference in Attitude **********Military experts said Mr. Gorbachev may have been seeking to allay unease about the cutbacks among Warsaw Pact allies by choosing as the new commander an officer who belongs to the same generation of officers as Marshal Kulikov. But in other respects, the experts said, the two officers' attitudes on matters of military doctrine, as reflected in their speeches and writings, showed significant differences. **********Among other things, Marshal Kulikov was known for his view that any confrontation with Western forces in Europe would rapidly grow into a nuclear exchange. This view has been implicitly rejected by General Lushev. **********Perhaps more important to Mr. Gorbachev, General Lushev has also established himself as a proponent of the view that effectiveness is dependent on troop discipline, tough training and a flexible command structure. **********His pronouncements to this effect have distanced him from others in his generation of officers, including Marshal Kulikov, who have laid heavy emphasis on the need for new generations of high-technology weapons, a position that is likely to receive less favor under Mr. Gorbachev."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/06/business/company-news-olivetti-is-chosen-for-bank-project.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Olivetti Is Chosen For Bank Project", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Olivetti Is Chosen For Bank Project", "body_text": " **********The Olivetti computer group of Italy said it had beaten strong American competition to win a contract worth at least $350 million, the largest order in its 80-year history.

As the respective presidents of the nation's fourth- and fifth-largest chip companies, the National Semiconductor Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Mr. Sporck and Mr. Sanders worked to bring about the semiconductor trade agreement with Japan, the Sematech research consortium and the recently announced joint venture to produce memory chips, U. S. Memories Inc. **********Now, however, near the twilight of their careers, the two well-known industry giants face a final challenge. This time it is not the semiconductor industry they must save, but their own companies. **********The two men are entirely different: W. J. Sanders 3d is a super-salesman who owns several Rolls-Royces and is invariably the best-dressed person in the room; Charles E. Sporck is a down-to-earth type who drove a pickup truck for years and gave his company offices the decor of an Army barracks. **********But both now face a common predicament. Their companies are ailing, not only compared to the Japanese but compared to the other three major American chip producers - Motorola, Texas Instruments and Intel. To be sure, the companies have plenty of cash and are in no imminent danger, but some analysts say the long-term prognosis may be bleak. **********''They lag the other three in product positioning and manufacturing muscle,'' said Daniel L. Klesken, a semiconductor analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''There is some question about their long-term viability.'' Pierre Lamond, a venture capitalist and former National executive is blunter: ''They both are going to be acquired,'' he said. ''I don't see these two companies remaining independent.'' **********How the companies fare is important not only to the two men but to the nation. With competition having already claimed the lives of several medium-sized chip companies like Mostek and Fairchild Semiconductor, National and Advanced Micro are now standing closest to the edge of the eroding cliff that is the American semiconductor industry. **********Indeed, much of the recent business and Government development aimed at helping the industry is designed mainly for companies like Advanced Micro and National - broad-line suppliers driven out of major parts of the memory chip market by the Japanese, who have been accused of unfairly low pricing. But as their stories reveal, it is not just the Japanese but management decisions that brought these companies to their present state. And it is management that must rescue them. **********Some industry experts say the two companies have already entered the long, slow downward spiral that characterized the decay of Fairchild, the once-shining star of Silicon Valley that was acquired by National in 1987. **********In boom times - like last year - Advanced Micro and National lag in returning to profitability. In the inevitable downturns - and some say another lies ahead - the two lose money. Such performance is not enough for long-term survival in an industry where technology changes rapidly and huge investments are needed just to stay even. **********One problem faced by the companies is that they are smaller than other non-specialized chip producers. Both have more than $1 billion in chip revenues, but with the rise of the Japanese, that doesn't even qualify them for the top 10. **********What's more, both make semiconductors only while other chip companies also make computers, which are more profitable. They also lack a major position in computer memories and microprocessors, two of the hottest product areas. In addition to being attacked from above by Japanese giants, the companies are being eaten from below by American start-ups with advanced products. **********The troubles are taking a toll on the reputations of the two men, who have run their companies for two decades. Around the Valley now, there is talk that both businesses need new blood.  Back Into the Fray **********But Mr. Sporck, who is 61 years old, and Mr. Sanders, who is 52, have no intention of retiring. Rather, they have stepped back into the fray. In the past few months, both have been laying off and reorganizing staff, closing inefficient factories and lining up the products that will carry their companies into the 1990's. **********Mr. Sporck, saying that he neglected the company to concentrate on industry affairs, has nudged some former lieutenants into early retirement and now has 17 people reporting directly to him. **********Mr. Sanders has put aside plans to step down as chief executive when he turns 55 in 1991 and says he will stay five more years: ''My plans are to see this company through parity with the best of the best in technology.'' **********Silicon Valley was essentially born in the late 1960's with the exodus of executives like Mr. Sporck and Mr. Sanders from Fairchild Semiconductor. Mr. Sporck, a manufacturing expert who headed operations, was recruited in 1967 to run National Semiconductor, then a $7 million company near bankruptcy. Mr. Sanders, who had headed Fairchild's marketing, formed Advanced Micro Devices in 1969. Around the same time, three technology gurus left to form the Intel Corporation. The trio of companies immediately took on characteristics of their leaders. Intel was known for innovation, National for mass manufacturing, Advanced Micro for marketing. **********As head of Advanced Micro, Mr. Sanders became known for the witty remark and the lavish gesture. He held a $700,000 Christmas party that starred the rock band Chicago. At sales conferences in Hawaii, he would lead his troops, chanting, on a march from the hotel to the ocean, or wave from his penthouse balcony as inebriated salesmen shouted his name from the beach below. He once told his sales force that if anyone was merely putting in time for a gold watch at retirement, he should take his watch now and go. Then he spilled a basketful of watches onto the floor. **********The company thrived, mainly by finding clever products with higher profits and fewer competitors, like chips for use in telephone switches. It was also helped by its license to manufacture Intel's microprocessors, which went into all I.B.M. personal computers and compatibles. By 1984, Advanced Micro was one of the industry's most profitable companies. **********At National, Mr. Sporck favored a straightforward strategy: rolling over rivals with low prices and high volume. Its idea of motivation at a company meeting was to show a picture of Whistler's Mother making an obscene gesture, an expression of what it thought of rivals. Some employees took pride in National's nickname, ''animals of Silicon Valley.''  Tougher Competition **********The business strategy worked well at first. But it turned out to be the same as that adopted by the Japanese, who were better at it. Thus, like most other American semiconductor companies, National was forced, after huge losses, to drop out of the market for dynamic random access memory chips. Without the so-called D-RAM's, the industry's highest-volume product, National found it tougher to compete as a mass manufacturer. Meanwhile, another big chunk of its product line, logic chips, began to be superseded by semi-customized chips, known as ASIC's, for application-specific integrated circuits. **********Mr. Sporck started to diversify into mainframe computers, becoming a distributor for Hitachi machines. But the business distracted attention from semiconductors. Critics also say Mr. Sporck failed to recruit enough outsiders to replace departing executives and did not focus enough on the long term. **********Indeed, asked what ails his company, Mr. Sporck talks only about isolated, short-term ''unusual issues:'' National overestimated demand last year and produced too many chips, and it has taken longer than expected to complete the consolidation following its Fairchild acquisition. **********However deep the problems, they resulted in an operating loss of $187 million for the fiscal year that ended in May, including a $45 million fourth-quarter restructuring charge. **********Advanced Micro began to have noticeable problems, as well, starting in 1985. It was slow in moving into a new technology called complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, or CMOS, which is supplanting the older bipolar process for making chips. And the new semi-customized chip technology allowed customers to make many of the specialized chips that the company used to manufacture. Advanced Micro also had excess capacity as a result of its 1987 purchase of Monolithic Memories. **********A further blow came when Intel denied Advanced Micro a license to manufacturer its powerful 80386 microprocessor. Intel maintains that Advanced Micro did not live up to its part of an agreement to develop support chips for earlier microprocessors. Mr. Sanders, accusing Intel of ''duplicity,'' says Intel is merely trying to monopolize the chip. The dispute, in arbitration, has soured relations between the two companies.  Absentee Management **********As Advanced Micro's problems have mounted, critics have focused more attention on Mr. Sanders's management style. For the last nine years, commuting from Silicon Valley to his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, he has been away from the office on Fridays and many Mondays. Employees say he takes long vacations. While he is a brilliant strategist, former executives say, absentee management doesn't work in a competitive industry nor at a company that revolves so much around one man. Without him, decisions have been delayed and products late getting to market. **********Mr. Sanders's increasingly lavish style also became contagious. Salesmen who did not wear Rolex watches were likely to find their less-expensive time pieces thrown away by high-level executives who wanted the company to have a certain image. It was an atmosphere, former employees say, that encouraged loose spending throughout the company - a far cry from the early days at Advanced Micro, when Mr. Sanders once rejected a request for an electric pencil sharpener because it was too costly. **********''Its major problems aren't on the sales side but on the operations side,'' said T. J. Rodgers, a former Advanced Micro executive who now heads the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a successful Silicon Valley start-up. He believes, however, that Advanced Micro's product portfolio is still good. ''I'd pick up their product line in a minute,'' he said. **********In his defense, Mr. Sanders said he commuted to Los Angeles when the company was in peak form and that his style of living bears no relation to company performance. ''If I drove a Chevrolet and wore a brown suit, everyone would say I'm just a diligent, hard-working guy,'' he said. As for hands-on management, he said, ''I don't fix yield problems,'' referring to problems with defective chips. Rather, he said, ''I employ and deploy a resource that fixes yield problems. Anyplace there's a telephone, that's headquarters.'' **********Both Advanced Micro and National say they are quickly getting their houses in order. Advanced Micro, after a sudden drop in demand in the third quarter of 1988 that produced a loss, has slashed employment, including severe cuts in its vaunted sales force. It returned to the black in the fourth quarter and made money in this year's first quarter. **********At National, Mr. Sporck recently sold computer operations, netting more than $500 million in needed cash. He vows that after one more quarter of operating losses, the company will turn profitable for the fiscal year. ''Most of that stuff is behind us now,'' he said, referring to his 1988 chip glut and the consolidation problems with Fairchild.  Shifting Strategy **********The two men are also realizing that each company's strategy is not enough. So each is becoming more like the other. **********''A.M.D. must be committed to being a commodity supplier to the industry,'' said Mr. Sanders, adding that withdrawing from low-margin businesses was a mistake. ''Anyone who is in margin retreat is basically throwing away its future.'' The company is building an advanced pilot production line to enable it to match advances in manufacturing techniques made at Sematech, the research consortium dedicated to improving manufacturing techniques. **********Mr. Sanders also said the company had finally mastered its CMOS process. And in an alliance with the Sony Corporation, it is re-entering the market for static RAM's, the memory chips that have proved so lucrative for newer companies like Cypress. **********National, for its part, wants more proprietary products and has created a division to sell complex chips for computers and telecommunications. Mr. Sporck says commodity products now account for only 40 percent of National's sales, down from 80 percent several years ago. ''The company, from a product standpoint, has never been in better shape,'' he said. ''The credibility of that statement will be proven by performance.'' **********According to Mr. Sporck, National is experiencing ''tremendous demand'' for the special high-speed chips being made with technology acquired with Fairchild. National is also strong in analog chips, a solid but slower-growing business, and is moving into semi-customized chips. **********National and Advanced Micro are also strong in chips for use in computer networks and are developing chips for the integrated services digital network, a new type of phone system. Such chip sales in the United States could grow to $700 million by 1995 from virtually nothing today, said Dataquest, a market research firm. **********Both companies also say their microprocessors, shunned by personal computer makers, are catching on for use in laser printers, facsimile machines and other devices. Mr. Sporck said National's 32000 family of microprocessors is its fastest-growing product. Mr. Sanders said sales of Advanced Micro's 29000 microprocessor will triple or quadruple in 1990 from $10 million in 1989. **********In memories, both companies are selling a type of chip known as Eprom's, whose prices are controlled by the United States-Japan semiconductor agreement.  What's Ahead **********The two face challenges. They must license more technology from start-ups, analysts say. And they must add management and groom successors to dispel suspicions, denied by both, that they are just sprucing up the companies to be sold. **********Industry experts see some progress. ''Most of my negatives have disappeared,'' said Millard H. Phelps, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, talking about Advanced Micro. **********National gets lower marks, but analysts say there is better spirit now that Mr. Sporck is focused on the company again. David Angel, an analyst at Dataquest, said: ''They are doing a lot of the right things.''

It has also long viewed NATO as something of an instrument of United States policy. **********Le Monde today quoted the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, as saying it was premature to create ''a new architecture'' for Europe as suggested by Mr. Baker. He also expressed distrust of NATO's tendency ''to take care of everything in every area,'' the paper said. **********''Europe within the alliance, but also Europe as an independent and responsible entity should reaffirm its political and security roles on the East-West scene,'' Mr. Dumas was quoted as remarking after the NATO session in Brussels. **********Although President Mitterrand is expected to echo France's concerns when he meets Mr. Bush on Saturday, he is also well placed to speak for Western Europe as a whole since, over the six months ending Dec. 31, he has held the rotating post of President of the 12-nation European Community. An Impromptu Meeting **********In this capacity, he called an impromptu summit meeting of community leaders in Paris on Nov. 18 to organize a regional response to events in Eastern Europe. He also presided over a regular twice-a-year summit meeting in Strasbourg last week, where community leaders spelled out the conditions under which German reunification would be acceptable. **********Further, after the Soviet-American summit meeting off Malta this month, Mr. Mitterrand traveled to Kiev for talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. His meeting with Mr. Bush, scheduled a month ago, also fits into his strategy of insuring that the European Community is not forgotten in the new Soviet-American dialogue. **********French and American officials said Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Bush were in broad agreement on many aspects of the Eastern European challenge, above all on the need for German reunification to take place gradually in the context of existing East-West accords and recognized borders. **********''I can only observe that, regarding the issue of German reunification, Mr. Baker spoke in terms very close, if not identical, to the view expressed in Strasbourg last Saturday,'' Hubert Vedrine, Mr. Mitterrand's spokesman, said. This week, NATO also endorsed the conditions laid down by the community. Strengthening Relationship **********French and American officials said that, having known each other since the early 1980's, the two Presidents have a good personal relationship, and that it has been strengthened by frequent meetings and telephone conversations since Mr. Bush became President. **********''It's clear that Bush and Mitterrand prize their ability to talk to each other about their views and concerns,'' an American official said, ''and this has not always been the case with French and American Presidents.'' **********Yet with Britain dragging its feet on European integration and West Germany increasingly distracted by events in East Germany, political experts here said Mr. Mitterrand now believes France has the primary responsibility for keeping the community on the fast track toward economic union. **********The French leader has made no secret of his view that a strong European Community offers the best opportunity of insuring that West Germany - or a united Germany - remain committed to the values of an integrated Europe. France has even suggested informally that the community assume a security role."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/business/s-p-to-rate-protection-on-takeovers.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1989-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 843, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.& P. to Rate Protection on Takeovers", "print_headline": "S.& P. to Rate Protection on Takeovers", "body_text": " **********The Standard & Poor's Corporation said yesterday that it was starting a new service to evaluate takeover-related protection that corporations offer investors. **********The ratings agency said its new Event Risk Covenant Rankings were a response to the tumult in the corporate bond market caused by leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers. Such turbulence was particularly intense last fall after the bidding battle broke out for RJR Nabisco. The company was eventually taken over, for $25 billion, by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, a leveraged buyout firm. **********During the struggle for RJR Nabisco, the value of many investment-grade industrial bonds plummeted, as investors concluded that any company, no matter how big, was vulnerable to a takeover. **********Many takeovers add billions of dollars of debt to a company's balance sheet, which has an adverse impact on the company's financial health. **********Since the RJR Nabisco battle, a number of companies have written so-called event-risk language into debt agreements that protects bondholders against takeovers or recapitalizations. **********The most common type of protection has been ''poison puts,'' which under certain circumstances and for a certain period of time allow bondholders to ''put'' the bond back to the company at a value of $100, or par, in the event of a change in control at the company. **********Standard & Poor's said yesterday that it had evaluated 14 such issues, applying its new system's 5 ratings ranging from E-1, the highest, to E-5. The new ratings are a supplement to the agency's basic rating of a company's debt securities. **********''The RJR situation galvanized our resolve to do something to provide the marketplace with more information about event-risk covenants,'' said Solomon B. Samson, a managing director and chairman of the rating committee for the corporate finance department at Standard & Poor's. ''Investors still have to decide if a company is takeover bait, and will probably demand some sort of protective covenant if it is. Now we will help investors assess the quality of protection they are getting.'' **********While including event-risk provisions in bond offerings adds to legal costs, issuers are generally rewarded with lower interest rates. Indeed, in some cases it is unlikely the debt could have been sold at all without such protection. 14 Offerings Reviewed Based on the ratings released yesterday, Standard & Poor's does not seem to think much of the protection offered to investors in the 14 offerings it reviewed. **********Of the total, only one, a $100 million 9 1/2 percent bond sold by the Enron Corporation, the oil and gas company, received an E-1 rating on its event-risk language. The company has an underlying rating from Standard & Poor's of BBB-minus. **********No issue received a rating of E-2, the second highest. Six were rated E-3, and four were given the lowest rating, E-5. Event-risk covenants at that level are described by the agency as providing investors with ''insignificant or no protection.'' **********John Carmont, a vice president and treasurer of the Eaton Corporation, whose event-risk covenants in a $100 million offering of 30-year 9 percent debentures due in 2016 received an E-5 rating, said, ''That issue was sold in 1986, and was one of the first with event-risk protection.'' **********He added: ''Holders at that time would have thought our event-risk clause was great. Most bonds of corporations don't have any event-risk language at all. You would think they would be ranked even lower than 5. I am afraid that this issue could be misconstrued by investors.'' Called a Mixed Blessing **********On Wall Street, investment bankers and analysts viewed the new ratings as something of a mixed blessing. **********''It should be good for the market and add to liquidity,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, a vice president and senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch. **********An investment banker said the new ratings could further limit the potential marketplace for issuers who are considered potential takeover targets. **********''There are accounts out there that are restricted to what they can buy,'' he said. ''A lot of accounts, for example, can't buy issues rated AA or A. Those same accounts may now have new parameters where they can't buy an event-risk bond rated below E-2. And if they have it in their portfolio, they will have to explain why it is there.'' **********At the moment, Standard & Poor's main competitor, Moody's Investors Service, has no plans to offer a similar product. **********''We try to make an assessment of event-risk up front, when we assign a rating,'' said Christopher L. Baldwin, a vice president at Moody's. But he said that since the RJR Nabisco situation arose, Moody's has been telling issuers that ''they may get a higher rating if they have strong event-risk protection in their issue and if we think there is a strong event-risk possibility'' for the company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/19/business/company-news-cilluffo-slate-wins-seats-at-amdura.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cilluffo Slate Wins Seats at Amdura", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Cilluffo Slate Wins Seats at Amdura", "body_text": " **********Cilluffo Associates L.P. has won its battle to replace the board of the Amdura Corporation, a Denver hardware distributor, after gaining the consent of shareholders representing about 3.6 million, or nearly 51 percent, of Amdura's shares, the companies said. **********On Tuesday, Cilluffo Associates' seven-member slate will replace Amdura's board, including its president and chief executive, Robert H.

W. Botha returned to his office here today, preparing to confront a united opposition of National Party legislators who want him to yield his post to the new party leader, F. W. de Klerk. **********But Mr. Botha, who has been recovering from a stroke suffered on Jan. 18, offered no response to the political insurrection here Monday night in which the party's leadership and parliamentary caucus threw their support solidly behind Mr. de Klerk in insisting that his post again be unified with the presidency. **********Mr. Botha's decision to resume his presidential duties two weeks earlier than he had announced reflected his rush to reassert authority in the face of an unparalleled rebellion from the party that he led for the last 10 years. Showdown Could Come Thursday **********By speeding his return to take charge again, Mr. Botha in effect challenged Mr. de Klerk, who succeeded him as party leader on Feb. 2, to stand up to him or lose political credibility. But this backfired by compelling party members of Parliament to choose between the autocratic Mr. Botha, who is 73 years old, and the more popular Mr. de Klerk, who turns 53 on Saturday. **********Mr. Botha is scheduled Wednesday to make his first official appearance in nearly two months by presiding over a meeting of his Cabinet, whose members backed Mr. de Klerk. **********Because the occasion will be dominated by the presentation of the annual Government budget, some South Africans said they did not expect a showdown over Mr. Botha's future before the weekly caucus meeting on Thursday. **********There were indications that Mr. de Klerk still hoped to thrash out a compromise that would be face-saving for Mr. Botha. **********One formula raised last week but brushed aside by Mr. Botha would allow him to stay on temporarily as President if he called a new parliamentary election later this year and then retired. It would be understood that Mr. de Klerk would succeed him. **********Mr. de Klerk hinted at this when reporters asked after the party caucus Monday night whether he would ask Mr. Botha to step down. The party leader replied that ''there will be discussions with him in regard to his position.'' **********''And there is nothing in these decisions which says that he must now step down,'' Mr. de Klerk added. Timing of Election **********The life of the current Parliament expires in September, though the President has authority to extend it until next March. Disagreement over its timing underscores the quandary confronting the National Party since Mr. Botha separated the duties of party leader and head of state early last month. **********Many Nationalist legislators want an early election, which they believe would give them an additional edge over opponents on both the left and the right. But only Mr. Botha has the constitutional power to call the election, and he has signaled that he intends to serve out his full term. The Constitution obligates the President to resign within a week after an election. **********Under the Constitution, the President may be removed from office only for proven misconduct or inability to perform his duties efficiently. If Mr. Botha, who is not accused of venality or incompetence, digs in his heels, the party might be forced to resort to political strategems. **********Under Section 39 of the Constitution, the President can be forced to call an election if the white, mixed-race and ethnic Asian chambers of Parliament each pass a motion of no confidence in his Government or if they reject the annual budget being presented Wednesday.

That is a remarkable performance for an industry that not long ago suffered severe losses in the face of competition from abroad. But it would be premature to conclude that Detroit has vanquished its rivals: in many crucial areas, Japanese car makers still set the pace. **********There is agreement among a wide array of automotive engineers, marketing specialists and business consultants that the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation have managed to diminish drastically the defects and poor workmanship that did much to send customers to the Japanese. But so far, the American companies have been unable to match their Japanese counterparts in the design, engineering and marketing of cars and trucks. 'I Have a Lot of Hope' **********''We're clawing back,'' said Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler's automotive division. ''I have a lot of hope for the U.S. auto business and more for Chrysler. I don't think the Japanese are 10 feet tall and perfect.'' **********One reason for the continuing American lag is that Japanese companies also continue to improve. Indeed, American car executives grudgingly acknowledge the Japanese industry's superiority in many areas, but maintain they are close to drawing even. **********It is a sign of Japan's achievements that Detroit has been forging alliances with Japanese competitors. Chrysler is building a car in Bloomington, Ill., with the help of the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation; Ford and the Nissan Motor Company recently agreed to build a mini-van together near Cleveland, and G.M. and the Suzuki Motor Company have a joint venture in Ingersoll, Ontario, to built light utility vehicles. If these ventures proliferate and work to the domestic companies' favor, they may ultimately make the gap with the Japanese less relevant. Unfazed by Higher Yen **********Yet Japanese auto makers have scored impressive managerial and technological feats on their own, allowing them to hold a sizable chunk of the American market despite a strengthening Japanese yen that has raised the prices of their cars. **********In many cases, the changes in relative prices are striking. Ford, for example, was charging $7,960 for its best-selling Escort in September 1985, a price roughly comparable to the competitive Nissan Sentra SE, which sold for $8,199. Today, the Escort costs $9,167, an increase of 15.2 percent; the Sentra is $11,784, a huge rise of 44 percent. **********Yet the Japanese industry's share of the American market, including Japanese models built in the United States, has increased to 24.1 percent this year, from 20.2 percent in 1986. Europeans Lose the Most **********Since 1981, American companies have lost only a small share of the domestic market, while the Japanese have gained market share at the expense of European auto makers. One reason is that Japan has been sending more luxurious and expensive cars to the United States, encroaching on a European stronghold. **********The Japanese have raised their share even while selling cars to Americans under voluntary export restraints established by the Japanese Government eight years ago, under pressure from the United States. The quotas have since been relaxed, but remain in effect. **********The reasons for Japan's improved position: its auto makers are expanding their manufacturing in the United States, which reduces the effect of the strong yen. They are lowering their production costs in Japan, giving them the financial and operating flexibility to keep pressure on American competitors. And because the Japanese have been offering more and more luxury products that have been rated superior by automotive reviewers, they can expand their customer base despite the pricing disadvantage created by their strong currency. Big Three Aim at Niches **********American auto makers have won some marketplace skirmishes, though, by exploiting market niches with products like full-size pickup trucks and mini-vans, for which there has been little or no Japanese competition. ''The new Mazda mini-van closes the lead on mini-vans'' held by Chrysler, said William Pochiluk of Autofacts Inc., a consulting firm in Paoli, Pa. ''So far, however, the Americans have done a better job of understanding mini-van customers -period.'' **********By exploiting its mini-van advantage and by acquiring the American Motors Corporation, Chrysler has increased its share of the truck market. But it faces $14 billion in expenditures through the 1990's to make long-overdue model replacements in its Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler car lines. **********Speaking of the domestic industry's improvements, Jerry Jurek, a former Chevrolet engineer who is a consultant for the Industrial Technology Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich., said: ''Our improvement in domestic quality is the single biggest one the industry has made. People say to me, 'I just got a new Chevy Cavalier and I can't find a single thing wrong with it.' I hear more and more of this sort of thing.'' **********From 1985 to 1988, Ford and G.M. pulled to within 80 percent of the quality standard set by Japanese companies, based on the number of problems per car, according to surveys conducted by J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive research company in Agoura Hills, Calif. Ford had been at 60 percent of the standard and G.M. at 10 percent. Chrysler reached about 60 percent of the Japanese standard in 1988, up from 50 percent three years earlier. Trend Setters Prefer Imports **********Even so, younger buyers and others who have been on the leading edge of trends continue to prefer Japanese cars in disproportionate numbers. Mr. Jurek recently noticed that the parking lot at Bill Knapp's restaurant in Farmington Hills, Mich., fairly overflowed with Cavaliers, Cadillacs and other American products. But Bill Knapp's mainly caters to an older crowd. **********''When I look across the street at McDonald's, where the kids eat, it's all Japanese,'' Mr. Jurek said. ''We're losing market share, especially with the young.'' **********Tom Peters, an author and consultant on quality and productivity based in Palo Alto, Calif., said: ''Anyone who thinks we're caught up just needs to see what they're driving in California. We're keeping pace, but that's not saying a lot considering how far behind we still are.'' **********Research supports those anecdotal impressions. In 1988, Japanese and South Korean brands captured 25 percent of the total new-car market in the United States, and 44 percent of the buyers 45 years old or younger, according to J. D. Power & Associates. G.M., Ford and Chrysler each had smaller percentages of younger buyers than their percentage of the overall market. Japanese Lead in Engines **********Younger buyers may be attracted in part by the more efficient, sophisticated and powerful engines and transmissions offered by the Japanese. ''It might not be a reason by itself to buy the cars, but when other things are comparable, it becomes a reason to choose one product over another,'' said Christopher Cedergren of J. D. Power. **********American companies clearly know how to build advanced engines and transmissions, but it takes a huge investment - as much as $1 billion for a new engine. In recent years, they have spent the money on other priorities, like upgrading plants and machinery, or on acquisitions. **********''They always argued they could hold off for a year or two, and that turned into a few years, but now it's become a serious weakness,'' said Mr. Pochiluk. ''Honda has the standard when it comes to engines.'' **********Specifically, Japanese companies pioneered multi-valve engine technology and electronic transmissions, and these features are now standard equipment on most models. Multi-valve technology doubles the number of intake and exhaust valves for each cylinder, creating more power and efficiency. Electronic transmissions allow drivers to select the speed at which automatic transmissions shift gears, depending on whether they want quick acceleration or improved fuel economy. G.M. Cuts Capital Spending **********G.M. is the only domestic manufacturer to build its own multi-valve engine, the Quad Four. But that engine is available in very limited numbers and is an expensive option. (Ford offers two multi-valve engines, one from Mazda and another from the Yamaha Corporation; Chrysler buys some from Mitsubishi.) G.M., the most advanced of the Big Three from a technological standpoint, has nonetheless been cutting its capital spending to improve profits, after a $40 billion spending program over several years that focused on acquisitions and new plants. **********Still, G.M. can claim some victories: Its new line of light pickup trucks, for example, has helped it raise its share of the truck market. The No. 1 auto maker has also been working hardest to foster a cooperative spirit among employees. **********But encouraging more cooperation and productivity among engineers and workers remains a problem for the domestic auto makers as they race to produce new models faster. David Cole, head of the University of Michigan's automotive study office, cited a survey showing that American auto makers need 60 months to design completely and produce a new car, compared with 42 months for the Japanese. Frequent Japanese Redesigns **********The practical effect of bringing a new model to market 30 percent faster is evident in competition between Ford and Honda. Ford scored a huge success with its Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable models, which came out in 1986. That same year, Honda brought out a new version of its successful Accord. **********But while Ford does not plan to restyle the Taurus until 1992, and will not change its chassis and power train until 1996, Honda plans to introduce a completely new Accord, replete with new technology, this fall, many people in the industry say. **********''Because Honda can keep the car updated, it can maintain a stable level of sales,'' Mr. Cedergren said. ''Typically, sales peak and then trail off as the model gets older, but the Japanese change models so often that they don't lose sales.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/28/business/data-bank-may-28-1989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA BANK: May 28, 1989", "print_headline": "DATA BANK: May 28, 1989", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/08/business/review-set-on-f-16-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 292, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Review Set on F-16 Deal", "print_headline": "Review Set on F-16 Deal", "body_text": " **********The National Security Council has asked six agencies to submit recommendations by Friday on whether the United States should proceed with a project under which Japan would develop a new version of the F-16 fighter, Administration and Congressional officials said today. **********Administration officials said Secretary of State James A.

But this morning, as people went about their errands under a light snow, many spoke openly about their concerns and hopes for the future. **********Petrzalky, a mammoth housing development across the Danube from old Bratislava, is home to more than a tenth of the city's residents. A city in itself, it has stores, schools, and factories set within a square-mile maze of multistory concrete apartment blocks. The complex stretches right up to the first of a line of barbed wire fences marking the approach to the Austrian border. Few Playgrounds or Gardens **********''It's impossible here, horrible,'' said Sona Sekova, a 29-year-old woman who works for Drevounia, a state-run foreign trading company. ''There's no green, no plants. Everything is gray and ugly, and there are few playgrounds for the children.'' **********Another woman, who said she was afraid to give her name, said that her two children were often sick because of the environment. ''And I can speak on behalf of other mothers, too,'' she said. ''Every other child has the same chronic respiratory problems. The construction just goes on and on, and the air is filled with construction dust.'' **********Helena Ferkicova, 70, is one of the original residents of Petrzalky, which was built in the early 1970's on the site of a village of the same name. ''I lived here in a house with a little garden,'' she said. ''Sure, it was hard to leave the house,'' she said. ''But now I've gotten used to it.'' 'Destruction of Nature' **********According to an army major who lives here, the site was once on wet land. ''It was a specific environment for one species of waterfowl,'' he said, also asking that his name not be used. ''The birds kept flying in even after they built the place, but the area was drained. Eventually, they just stopped coming.'' **********''I disagree with this destruction of nature to give priority to economic things all the time,'' the major said. **********Similar complaints are frequently heard here, and campaigners for a better environment have been among the loudest voices in the demonstrations for political change. Bratislava, the most important industrial city in Slovakia, is the home of several large chemical and petroleum industries. **********''Not enough has been done here to protect the environment, mainly because of our construction capacity and financial problems,'' said Tomas Urban, an environmental specialist with Slovak Breweries. Mr. Urban was watching students and otherss set up the public address system for the sixth consecutive afternoon of anti-Government demonstrations here. The protests have drawn as many as 70,000 people, including a increasing number of older citizens and workers. Lighthearted Protests **********The atmosphere of these well-organized protests has been almost lighthearted, with a well-known Slovak actor, Milan Knazko, serving as master of ceremonies. The parade includes students, writers, workers, actors and pop singers, and they are just as likely to offer a poem or song as to proclaim their support for a pluralist, democratic society. **********Most Slovak Catholics have supported the protests, though their role has not been as visible as that of the artists and students. According to Frantisek Sulka, a lawyer and active Catholic layman, 60 percent of Slovaks are practicing Catholics, even though they often face discrimination at work for attending church. **********On weekdays, groups of worshipers, often old women in fur coats and hats purchased before World War II, pray during the brief time that the city's churches are open. **********Along the main pedestrian shopping street, Christmas decorations brighten what is often a sparse display of consumer goods. Although Bratislava is the country's second-largest city, it is not as well-stocked as Prague, where stores are supplied with tourists in mind.

When the economy turns down, sales slip for cardboard boxes, business stationery and newsprint.

But three companies - the International Paper Company, the Mead Corporation and the Scott Paper Company - are worth considering because they have some reasonably stable product niches. **********Paper stocks are the classic cyclicals. When the economy turns down, sales slip for cardboard boxes, business stationery and newsprint. As long as investors fear the economy will slow, the stocks will continue trading at below-market multiples. But three companies - the International Paper Company, the Mead Corporation and the Scott Paper Company - are worth considering because they have some reasonably stable product niches. **********A recession, or even the popular soft-landing scenario, is especially threatening to paper companies. Since 1986, several of them have become downright euphoric as their profits jumped 59 percent last year. **********Most companies have responded by adding capacity that is scheduled to go into operation over the next two years. Now they have too much capacity, it appears. With a sluggish economy, analysts believe that the paper companies' prices and earnings will suffer. Prices of some products, like newsprint, are already slipping.  Even the prospect of a soft landing has failed to revive the paper stocks. Those buying many of these stocks over the summer were disappointed. ''The valuations on the paper stocks had gotten to the point where they were so low some people started to be impressed,'' said Lawrence A. Ross, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. **********At the end of July, a group of 11 paper stocks was selling at 8.3 times earnings, according to PaineWebber's most recent calculation, compared with more than 13 for the Standard & Poor's 500. Since then, the paper stocks have remained depressed. **********But one stock that seems positioned to weather a downturn well is International Paper. Analysts believe its earnings may soften in the next two years but not collapse. **********In the past, International Paper's earnings have suffered whenever the industry weakened. Earnings per share peaked in 1981 at $5.04, then plummeted to 94 cents by 1984. **********But since then the company has protected itself by moving into less cyclical businesses. It has reduced its lumber sales - which are notoriously undependable - and expanded in paper for copiers and computer printers, where demand is more stable. **********International Paper's major bulwark against a slowdown is its position as the nation's leading seller of bleached board, used for milk cartons, food packaging and file folders. Growing demand for microwave food containers has increased sales and added to an order backlog. Sales of milk cartons have strengthened as concerns about the environment have led some companies to shun plastic containers. **********International Paper also has the advantage of improved margins from heavy spending on much-improved plants. ''They have gone from being one of the least efficient paper makers to one of the most efficient,'' said Gary Palermo, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, who has a buy recommendation. **********Mr. Palermo does not look for International Paper stock to enjoy another big run-up, but believes it can surpass the Standard & Poor's 500 by 5 percent in the next 12 months. He expects the company to earn $7.60 a share this year, up from $6.57 in 1988. **********One caution about the stock: Some money managers are already alert to the company's appeal. The stock advanced from the mid-40's to the mid-50's over the summer. **********After spending $2.6 billion on acquisitions since 1986, International Paper's sales have climbed from $4.5 billion in 1985 to $9.5 billion last year. Buyers also have been attracted by the company's strong earnings growth. **********Because it is the largest company in the industry - with sales of $11 billion expected this year - and has broad lines of products, some investors choose International Paper as a proxy for the entire paper sector. **********But at a low earnings multiple of about 7, International Paper still looks relatively safe. The stock closed at 55 on Friday, slightly off its 52-week high of 58 3/4. **********Another strong segment of the industry is tissue paper. Demand is growing worldwide, with little capacity being added. Tissues tend to be the only area of the paper industry not affected by recessions. **********One company that should benefit the most from tissues is Scott Paper. The company is gaining market share as growing foreign demand keeps its tissue plants operating at full capacity. The company is also a leader in producing quality papers for annual reports and catalogues. **********Mr. Palermo recommends the stock for cautious investors. He estimates that earnings will move steadily from $4.01 a share last year to $4.40 this year and $4.90 in 1990. He believes the stock can move up along with earnings. **********Kathryn McAuley, an analyst for the First Manhattan Company, also recommends Scott, with more optimistic earnings estimates of $4.80 a share this year and $5.50 in 1990. **********Ms. McAuley is also keen on Mead. The company has moved out of lower-margin pulp operations into more specialized businesses. One of Mead's most promising new products is coated cardboard, used to hold six-packs of beer. But start-up costs will prevent the product from contributing to earnings until 1991. **********Ms. McAuley recommends the stock only for investors who can afford to wait several years. She looks for earnings of $3.35 this year, down from $3.70 in 1988."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/06/world/he-s-got-a-missile-off-followed-by-good-kill.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 805, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'He's Got a Missile Off,' Followed by 'Good Kill'", "print_headline": "'He's Got a Missile Off,' Followed by 'Good Kill'", "body_text": " **********A Navy cockpit tape of the confrontation between American and Libyan jet fighters offers only flashes of video images, but provides in sound the drama of American aviators unexpectedly caught up in combat. **********The tape was made public late today at the Pentagon to support Administration officials' assertions that the two Navy F-14's repeatedly tried to maneuver away from two Libyan MIG-23 fighters pursuing them.

Concern About Libyans' Intent **********Pentagon officials, after making the cockpit tape public, announced they were also making public a still picture taken from the videotape to prove that the Libyan jets were armed. Libya said after the confrontation Wednesday that the United States shot down two unarmed reconnaissance jets. **********The audio portion of the cockpit tape is about 7 1/2 minutes in length, while the video portion is less than 30 seconds. The audio portion shows that early in the encounter, the American aviators became concerned about the Libyans' intent. **********After the second attempt to maneuver away from the MIG's, the F-14's went to a ''warning yellow, weapons hold'' status. That is an intermediate stage in the process of preparing to fire in self-defense. **********Shortly after that, the Americans again tried to maneuver away. **********''Bogeys have jinked back into me now, for the third time, noses on, at 35 miles, Angels 7,'' the lead pilot reports. **********Angels 7 means the plane's altitude is 7,000 feet. 'They're on My Nose Now' **********When the Libyans drew to a distance of 27 miles, the tape indicates, the F-14's move again and again, their maneuvers matched by the Libyans. **********Then after a fifth evasive maneuver, the pilot says, ''Bogeys have jinked back at me again for the fifth time. They're on my nose now, inside of 20 miles.'' **********At this point, the lead aircraft commander decides to defend himself. **********''Master arm on,'' he says, turning on the switch that enables him to fire his weapons. ''Master arm on. Centering up the T. Bogeys have jinked back into me again. Sixteen miles. Centering the dot.'' **********The phrases ''centering up the T'' and ''centering the dot'' refer to the use of a cockpit steering cue to insure an optimum missile launch position. When ready, the pilot calls out ''fox one'' when he fires a Sparrow missile and ''fox two'' when he fires a Sidewinder. ''Fourteen miles. Fox one. Fox one.'' At this point, the backseat radar weapons officer can be heard saying, ''Aw, Jesus.'' 'Good Kill. Good Kill' **********''Ten miles. He's back on my nose. Fox 1 again,'' the pilot calls out. ''Six miles. Six miles.'' **********Then another voice - again apparently the backseat weapons officer -can be heard saying, ''Tally two, tally two,'' meaning the two Libyans have just come into visual sight. **********The pilot of the F-14 then says, ''Five miles. Four miles.'' **********The second F-14 flying as wing then fires a Sparrow and the weapons officer in the lead F-14 reports to his pilot, ''O.K., he's got a missile off.'' **********At this point, it becomes almost impossible to determine who is talking at each point, but the tape continues: **********''Good hit. Good hit on one.'' ''Roger that. Good kill. Good kill.'' ''I've got the other one.'' ''Select fox two. Select fox two.'' ''All right, fox two.'' ''Those  [ expletive ]  . . . .'' ''Shoot him.'' ''I don't got a tone.'' ''Lock him up. Lock him up.'' ''Shoot him. Fox two.'' ''I can't. I don't have a  [ expletive ]  tone.'' Pilots Seen Ejecting **********At this point, the lead F-14 finally succeeds in maneuvering behind the MIG and gets a missile tone, firing the Sidewinder. ''Good kill. Good kill.'' ''Good kill.'' ''Pilot ejected.'' ''O.K. . . . Let's head north. Head north.'' **********''Let's go down low, on the deck. Unload, 500 knots.

But it was unclear whether Members of Parliament were ready for the television age. **********About 50 Members of Parliament reportedly took courses to prepare for the first televising of the House's proceedings in its 694-year-old history. They studied body language, grooming and presentation skills, hair care and color coordination. But their studied charm was rarely in evidence amid the usual spluttering, muttering, jeering and general raucousness of Britain's parliamentary deliberations. **********Perhaps they could have taken a few lessons from Queen Elizabeth, who opened the new session of Parliament today. In purple crown and flowing robes, she spoke from a golden throne to a joint session of the House of Lords and House of Commons, in one of London's grandest state occasions. A Heavy Program **********In a voice without excesses or extremes, she unveiled a heavy program of legislation from the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in what is forecast to be a stormy session. After outlining the Government's plans to shake up broadcasting, change the legal profession, change the National Health Service and further weaken labor unions, among other proposals, Queen Elizabeth gently told the lords and members of the House of Commons that she would ''pray that the blessing of almighty God may rest upon your counsels.'' **********In the House of Commons, the Speaker, Bernard Weatherill, put aside gentleness and repeatedly shouted ''Order! Order!'' But everyone seemed too busy with their oral sneers and jousts to pay much attention to his pleas. **********Although Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher resisted the move to allow televising of the activities of the House of Commons - television coverage began in the House of Lords five years ago - the Commons approved the plan overwhelmingly last June. The House will review the success of the televised proceedings next June and vote on whether they will be continued. Reaction Shots Limited **********But strict guidelines restrict what viewers can see and in how much detail. The camera must generally stay on the member who is speaking, limiting reaction shots to those of legislators who have been mentioned by their colleagues by name. Some overview shots are allowed to show the two opposing benches and the Speaker of the House. **********The cameras cannot move away from the speaker to show situations of extreme disorder or demonstrations in the galleries. Nonetheless, viewers will no doubt be able to hear disorder, as some British lawmakers go so far as to make what are euphemistically called ''animal noises'' at opposition speakers. **********Newspapers here have been awash with stories about the arrival of television in the House of Commons. The Sunday Correspondent this week carried photographs of 10 Members of Parliament and graded their star potential. **********One member was said to be ''quick-witted and dapper,'' and capable of delivering asides that ''will have you rolling round the living room carpet - if the microphones pick them up.'' Another was described as ''possibly the loudest of the rent-a-quote M.P.'s,'' who ''frequently has the chamber - and soon the nation -laughing at him as much as with him.'' 'Never Be the Same Again' **********But whether the debates leave viewers star-struck or cause them to turn the channel, the newspaper predicted that the advent of television to the House meant that ''politics will never be the same again.'' **********''Downing Street and Whitehall will suffer a blow,'' the newspaper said. ''Some of the power steadily concentrated there this century will be seized back by Parliament as soon as televising begins. Humble backbenchers will find themselves armed with a new weapon: increased publicity, caused by the sudden availability of cheap footage to television companies.'' **********It appeared today that some members were quite aware of the possible strength of that new weapon and people long familiar with Parliament insisted that most members had made a huge effort to appear witty and warm. Most had also apparently made a huge effort to attend. Reporters in the press gallery noted that the chamber was so full that two senior politicians had to move to the side galleries above the chamber. **********Neil Kinnock, the Labor leader, began his speech with a series of jokes before launching into a serious attack on the Government's program. As he did so, opposition Members of Parliament jeered ''Smile! Smile!'' at a stony-faced Mrs. Thatcher, the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency reported.

Someone at the meeting asked what he thought ITT would look like in the year 2000. All Mr. Araskog could do was laugh. **********''Only one person in the room had been at the first management meeting in 1963, and of all the companies that had been in the ITT stable back then, only four tiny businesses remained,'' Mr. Araskog recalled. ''All I could say was, 'With a track record like this, how could I possibly know what we'll be a decade from now?' '' **********How, indeed. It is probably just as well that Harold S. Geneen, the retired ITT chief whom many business historians credit with touching off the acquisition craze of the 1960's, hardly ever drops by ITT anymore. For Mr. Araskog, the 57-year-old former West Pointer who took ITT's top spot in 1978, has been tinkering mightily with the legendary ''Geneen Machine.'' **********In the Geneen tradition, ITT is still a hodgepodge of nine product and service businesses as diverse as hotels, timber, automotive parts and insurance. But a huge number of businesses - baked goods, consumer appliances and cosmetics, to name just a few - are gone. ITT's core telecommunications business is now part of Alcatel N.V., a joint venture with France's Compagnie Generale d'Electricite. The headquarters staff is down to 400 people, from more than 2,000. And ITT will soon vacate its plush Park Avenue headquarters for smaller, cheaper offices on Manhattan's West Side and in Secaucus, N.J. **********The slash and burn process was a necessity for ITT, which was mired in debt just five years ago. But for Mr. Araskog, who had been with ITT since 1966, it was traumatic. **********''Rand Araskog demonstrated a victory of mind over emotion,'' said Michel David-Weill, senior partner at Lazard Freres & Company and an ITT director. ''It took courage.'' **********But the payoff has been considerable. ITT may still be structured like the quintessential 1960's conglomerate, but a 1980's manageability has been superimposed on it. ITT's debt, once over $5 billion, is now less than $3 billion. Its return on equity, which had plunged to 4.7 percent in 1985, is back in double digits. Even the dividend is inching back up, and first quarter earnings rose to $200 million from $180 million a year earlier. **********Just two weeks ago the company announced an employee stock ownership plan that will put 11 percent of ITT's shares in employees' hands. That, perhaps more than anything else, characterizes the new ITT. The company, which once made almost all of its sales in Europe, is so rooted in the United States now that foreign tax credits no longer keep its tax bill down. Thus, for the first time an ESOP made economic sense. **********ESOP's generally serve two other goals, too: they are strong employee motivators, and they help ward off takeovers. That these considerations now matter at ITT - and Mr. Araskog concedes that they do - represents a sea change for the company that once reflected Harold Geneen's acquisitive and autocratic style.  Applause on Wall Street **********The changes have not gone unnoticed on Wall Street. For the first time in a long time, analysts are predicting that ITT's stock - which has been trading in the high $50's, not much above its book value - may begin to climb. **********''They've cut costs and improved productivity, and each of their nine businesses is doing decently in its respective marketplace,'' said Phua K. Young, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Jack L. Kelly, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, concurs. ''The direction has clearly been up,'' he said. **********Last year, in fact, was a particularly good one for ITT. Except for electronic components, which was down 16 percent, the operating profitability of all of its major businesses was up. Net income - $817 million on revenues of nearly $19.4 billion - was down about 15 percent, but most analysts say that is more a reflection of one-time extraordinary gains in 1987 than of any real problem in 1988. **********But while ITT's 10.5 percent return on equity last year may have been an excellent improvement for the company, it was still well below the market average return of close to 16 percent. And most of ITT's businesses - insurance, pulp and paper, Sheraton hotels, financial services, even electronic components - are prey to cycles that are beyond the company's control, which means that a terrific year is not necessarily a harbinger of things to come. Thus, despite its new fans on Wall Street, ITT is trading at a little better than 11 times earnings, when the market average is 12 or 13. **********Take ITT's Hartford Insurance Company - with $8.6 billion in revenues last year, by far ITT's largest business. The division contributed a respectable $400 million to operating income last year, but most of that was from group health and foreign property-casualty operations. Hartford's property-casualty business, its most important, remains soft. **********Similarly, ITT Rayonier, the pulp and timber business, has been whipsawed by cycles. The segment had income of $194 million last year on sales of nearly $1.1 billion, more than double the $92 million it earned in 1987. While some of the increase comes from lowered costs, a lot comes from a turnaround in the market - but that turnaround could just as easily reverse itself. **********Mr. Araskog has unsuccessfully shopped Rayonier around in the past. Although he now insists that the segment brings in more income than he could get by selling it, analysts see that as myopic reasoning. ''Pulp and timber are just too cyclical,'' said Carol Neves, an analyst with Merrill Lynch who is neutral on the stock, at least for short-term investors. **********Indeed, even Mr. Kelly and Mr. Young, who have strong buy recommendations on the stock, are uncomfortable with the cyclical nature of insurance and of pulp and timber. They would like to see ITT spin off at least part of those segments to the public, get out of Alcatel and use the proceeds to buy back stock, pay down debt even more, and perhaps beef up automotive parts, which at $2.8 billion is ITT's second-largest segment. **********''If they're going after a 15 percent R.O.E. - and that's what Araskog says he wants - then maybe they should emphasize different businesses,'' Mr. Kelly said.  Chasing the Car Market **********ITT is, in fact, emphasizing automotive parts. The segment's antilock braking system has been a winner both in Detroit and overseas, and ITT is ''putting a lot of money into growing the company,'' said M. Cabell Woodward Jr., vice chairman. **********But as for all the other advice, Mr. Araskog, a tall, genial man, takes it in good humor, but discounts it nonetheless. ''Every one of our business areas has a projected growth rate of 8 or 9 percent, and I see no reason to change the mix,'' he said. **********These days, Mr. Araskog is less concerned with pruning than with whipping remaining businesses into shape. He has loosened headquarters' clinch on subsidiaries, giving managers more authority and cutting down on reports and meetings. **********And he has moved many of the divisions out of the nest. The Hartford has always been in Connecticut, and Sheraton has headquarters in Boston. But Defense Technology moved to Washington just two years ago, and last year the automotive segment relocated to Detroit. Fluid technology is now in Midland Park, N.J., while electronic technology operates out of West Germany. ITT Finance has gone to Greenwich, Conn., ''because they found a great building and that's where the executives wanted to be,'' Mr. Araskog said.  A Kinder Company **********For an ITT chief to care where employees want to live represents a radical departure from the Harold Geneen days. Indeed, in many ways Mr. Araskog is the exact opposite of Mr. Geneen; in many others, the two are clones. **********Mr. Geneen believed that a good manager could manage anything, and that a company needed a polyglot of unrelated businesses that could hedge each other. And, in fact, he vaccuumed up more than 250 businesses before he stepped down. **********''Hal really believed that if you knew how to manage a business, it did not matter if you were making chocolate-covered peanuts or high-tech defense equipment,'' recalled Thomas W. Keesee Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Geneen and an ITT director. **********Mr. Araskog, too, sees the lack of overlapping products or distribution methods as irrelevant. ''No, there's no synergy, but we've built those companies up in ways they could never have done alone,'' he said. **********But in managerial style, Mr. Araskog and Mr. Geneen are worlds apart. In the Geneen days, ITT seemed a glamorous high roller to outsiders. But inside, it was a dismal place. Mr. Geneen insisted on copious reports and read them voraciously. And woe to the manager whose numbers did not meet his expectations. Midnight phone calls, public humiliations, summary firings all became part of the ITT experience. **********Ethics, on the other hand, did not. ITT managers quickly learned to do whatever was expedient to avoid the chairman's wrath. ''Geneen gave people the sense that their entire careers depended on how well they did with each project,'' recalled Howard J. Aibel, ITT's general counsel and a 25-year company veteran. ''So people would proceed without caring much about how what they did affected ITT's reputation.'' Thus, no one was terribly surprised when ITT's house of cards started tumbling down. **********In the early 1970's, ITT was accused of helping plot the overthrow of Chile's President, Salvador Allende Gossens, and of using campaign contributions to influence a Justice Department antitrust decision regarding its acquisition of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. (ITT had to divest some of its largest companies, including Avis Rent-a-Car and the Canteen Corporation, to hold onto the Hartford.) Several ITT executives were also accused of insider trading on the stock.  Cleaning Up the Image **********The company's later involvement in questionable payments to foreign governments further darkened its image. It is an image that Mr. Araskog spends a lot of time trying to brighten. Even the slightest hint of unethical behavior unleashes a maelstrom at ITT. When an employee in the ITT defense division was accused of trying to defraud the Defense Department last year, Mr. Araskog ordered an internal investigation, and six executives were dismissed. **********''I'm not trying to ride a white horse, but the C.E.O. has got to make himself clear,'' Mr. Araskog said. ''We're finally killing the 'anything goes' culture that existed here.'' **********Mr. Araskog has also finally got the monkey of huge debt off ITT's back. Mr. Geneen's acquisition binge, combined with a disastrous attempt to market the company's European-designed System 12 switching system in the United States, had created debt of almost $5 billion. Moreover, European governments had been forcing ITT to sell its overseas assets at a fraction of their fair market value, slashing ITT's revenues and profits from Europe without giving the company much in return. **********Mr. Araskog's only option was to start dismantling ITT. By the end of 1984, he had sold 69 companies for close to $2 billion. **********But still, ITT was reeling. Hartford was besieged with damage claims; Rayonier had lost a major order from China; West German operations were beset by strikes. ITT cut its dividend to $1 from $2.76. Disgruntled shareholders started dumping stock - and corporate raiders started smelling blood. Mr. Araskog spent most of 1984 and 1985 fighting off takeover attempts from Jay Pritzker and Irwin Jacobs - fights he recently chronicled in ''The ITT Wars.'' **********By 1986, with the takeover battles behind him, Mr. Araskog took the actions that probably changed ITT the most. He bit the bullet on System 12, taking a $105 million write-off and abandoning his pursuit of a United States market. And he spun off the remaining European telecommunications companies, which had accounted for 30 percent of sales, into Alcatel, of which ITT holds 37 percent. **********Mr. Araskog insists that ITT's divesting and acquiring habits are in its past. But no one is betting that nothing else will be sold - or bought. **********''We should get out of Alcatel, and find a good strategic investment in manufacturing,'' said Mr. Aibel. Mr. Woodward, the vice chairman, is a bit more circumspect. But he, too, says: ''We wouldn't turn down a good acquisition if one came around.'' **********Wouldn't turn one down? Harold Geneen, the man who once gobbled every business in sight, would surely wince. It remains to be seen whether shareholders smile.

War Over 'Scarcity of Water' **********''Water is the future of the whole area,'' he said in an interview reflecting a concern that water will soon replace oil as a source of Middle East turmoil. ''It's very critical.'' **********Meir Ben-Meir, a prominent Israeli expert, discussed the same problem in an interview in Tel Aviv. ''I cannot promise that sufficient water will prevent war,'' he said. ''But poverty and scarcity of water will cause war - no doubt about that.'' **********In a region splintered by disputes of faith and nation, riven by shifts and suspicions, competition for scarce water resources is looming as an additional cause for tension, if not war, according to experts on the subject in Tel Aviv, Amman, Cairo and Washington. **********Populations are growing fast, and cities swell with thirsty people. From North Africa to the Persian Gulf, farms demand water from lands known more for pale deserts and skies that begrudge all but meager rains. **********The reasons for the coming crisis are complex but one factor is common. From the Nile to the Euphrates, rivers slice through already charged frontiers, and governments of conflicting visions seek to mold events in their neighbors' lands and to grasp for whatever water they can control. Many of the nations concerned about their water lie downstream from a hostile or unsettled neighbor. **********''I don't believe that any party is able to share a single drop of his water,'' said Ibrahim Dakkak, an East Jerusalem analyst of political issues related to water. **********War and upheaval have left water supplies vulnerable to insurgency. In the southern Sudan, the country's long-running civil war has stilled a major project to dredge the swamp known as the Sudd and release more water into the Nile; the project's machinery has been bombed and its foreign technicians have been driven away. **********The goal of the Sudd project is to carve a canal through the swamp to increase the water flow and reduce the amount lost to evaporation. That way, more water would flow into the Soviet-built Aswan High Dam on the Nile -the towering barrage that sheltered Egypt from the ravages of Africa's recent drought. **********The Nile, however, is the lifeblood of Egypt's agriculture, a slender ribbon of verdancy hemmed by desert and threatened by a growing population that consumes farmland for housing. Thus, what happens upstream in Ethiopia and East Africa, where the Blue and White Niles rise, and in the Sudan, where they join at Khartoum, is held by senior Egyptian officials to be a matter of high national interest. Water as Leverage in Disputes **********If the drought had not broken, Western and Egyptian officials say, Egypt would have confronted its own water crisis. Egypt's share of the Nile is rationed under an agreement with Khartoum. **********Western water experts in Cairo say that if the river is to meet the drinking-water needs of a fast-growing population - which leaps by one million every nine months - and if agriculture is to be made more productive to help feed that population, Egyptian farmers will need to use water more efficiently. Some Western estimates suggest that efficiency ratings will have to increase by 60 percent over the next 11 years to meet the needs of the population, projected to reach 70 million in the year 2000. The disputes spread wider. Western diplomats and Turkish officials say Syria supports a Kurdish separatist movement in eastern Turkey that is fighting the central government, in part to maintain leverage with Ankara over the waters of the huge Ataturk Dam and 12 other dams on the Tigris and Euphrates. **********The dam itself is part of an ambitious development program that is supposed to enhance the underdeveloped region's economy and so undercut the Kurdish revolt after its completion, projected for next year. Water Shortfalls Expected **********But, some specialists assert, the dam's use of the waters of rivers vital to Syria and Iraq could so reduce the flow that those two countries could become hostages to non-Arab Turkey's regulation of the water supply. ''Turkey,'' said an Arab who is an expert on Arab water affairs, ''does not always mean well towards the Arabs.'' **********Some experts, moreover, have quoted Syrian officials as saying a part - if only a small part - of Damascus's reasons for its large military presence in Lebanon is to protect the headwaters of the Orontes River, which is important to Syria's agriculture. **********Of all the areas of dispute, it is the water supply in the slender wedge of territory from the Jordan catchment area to the Mediterranean that seems the most explosive. **********Israel is already using virtually all its renewable water and needs more for agriculture and drinking water. Jordan is expecting a water crisis within a decade, and a dearth of new water resources by the year 2005. Syria anticipates significant shortfalls by the year 2000, despite a joint plan with Jordan to use a new dam on the Yarmuk River within the next few years. Jordan and Syria say their water resources cannot be expanded, though their populations are growing fast. Water and Political Planning **********The occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Arabs now call the state of Palestine, face Israeli water use restrictions, and are in a competition with Israel for a resource that both sides see as vital for survival - and thus as a source of major conflict. **********The overcrowded refugee districts of the Gaza Strip, home to 650,000 Palestinians, are already thought to be consuming 40 percent more water than the aquifer below them can replenish. As more and more fresh water has been drawn from Gaza's aquifer under the Mediterranean shoreline, brackish sea water has seeped in to replace it. West Bank Palestinians assert bitterly that water is not shared equitably, and that Jewish settlers are permitted to dig deeper wells than Arabs. **********Mr. Dakkak, an analyst at East Jerusalem's Arab Thought Forum, a Palestinian research unit, said water ''has become intertwined with political things.'' He continued, ''Water is very much related to political planning.'' The 1967 Middle East war, he said, ''was started simply because there was conflict about water.'' **********With the collision between Israelis and Palestinians over the occupied territories the competition over water seems likely to sharpen. Few Ideas on Averting Crisis **********''Judea and Samaria boast 40 percent of Israel's available fresh water resources,'' the right-wing Likud party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in campaign literature before the Israeli election last November, using the Biblical name for the occupied West Bank. ''Water is our life. As such, it makes no sense to place it in the hands of those whose intentions towards us might not always be the kindest.'' **********Mr. Dakkak said, ''If you could trap the water from the occupied territories. Israel wouldn't live.'' Mixed with the corrosive alchemy of Arab-Israeli hostility, such assessments seem to lead to dire predictions, clouding Middle East peace diplomacy and seeming to defy the idea that Israel should trade land for peace. **********''The Middle East stands at the precipice of another major natural-resources crisis,'' said a recent report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''Before the 21st century, the struggle over limited and threatened water resources could sunder already fragile ties among regional states and leaded to unprecedented upheaval within the area.'' **********Water has long been contentious in the region, but there are few ideas on averting a crisis caused by meteorology, geography and the politics of survival. Neither, said Dr. Salameh of Jordan University, is there any international legislation governing the sharing of water. That has led to conflict. Water and Military Action **********Four-fifths of Iraq's water, for example, originates outside its borders, and Baghdad threatened military action in 1975 and 1984 as tension rose with Damascus over the sharing of the Euphrates waters when Iraq accused Syria of seeking to use its dams to hold back river flows from Iraq. **********Jordan asserts that Israel's National Water Carrier - an aqueduct running from the Sea of Galilee to just outside Tel Aviv that is one of the most important sources of Israel's water - has reduced the Jordan River south of the lake to such salinity that its waters cannot be used for irrigation. **********As Israel pumped fresh water out of the Sea of Galilee for the aqueduct, Jordanian hydrologists assert, it pumped saline spring water back into the lake. As a result, Dr. Salameh said, the rain-waters and Jordan River waters that provide the lake's fresh water were largely pumped to Israel, while saline water came to replace the fresh water that had once flowed out of the Sea of Galilee into the Jordan Valley. **********As long ago as the 1948 Middle East war, according to Jordanian officials, Israeli troops occupied a pocket of East Bank territory to maintain access to the waters of the Yarmuk River. Turkish 'Peace Pipeline' **********The quest for a solution, however, seems crippled by the very disputes the problem exacerbates. Some schemes suggest lively imagination -the towing of icebergs, for example, or Turkey's idea of a ''peace pipeline'' of water running from its Seyhan and Ceyhan Rivers to the deserts of Arabia, at a cost of $20 billion. **********On another possible solution, while oil-rich Persian Gulf countries have invested in costly desalinization plants, experts such as Dr. Ben-Meir say that for most other countries the technology will remain too expensive for Mediterranean countries until agricultural productivity goes up."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/14/world/sri-lankan-editor-is-killed-38-more-are-slain-in-unrest.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sri Lankan Editor Is Killed; 38 More Are Slain in Unrest", "print_headline": "Sri Lankan Editor Is Killed; 38 More Are Slain in Unrest", "body_text": " **********Two Sinhalese radicals assassinated a prominent broadcaster in his house near the capital today during political violence that also killed 38 other people across the country, officials said. **********The broadcaster, Kulasiri Amaratunga, the 62-year-old chief news editor of state television, was shot in the neck, military officials said.

In Britain the product's image and attributes were conveyed by an unseen husband and wife conversing in their car. In the Netherlands the visuals were identical but a voice-over announcer did the talking. In the Philippines the spot used emotional scenes of families reuniting, while in Brazil the ad ended on a visual joke, with an angry bald-headed man complaining to a startled couple that they had connected his trailer to their car. **********Both the consistency and the contrasts were the doings of the International Team, McCann-Erickson's global advertising unit, which this year is celebrating its 10th anniversary. Once a daring experiment in the nascent science of worldwide marketing, the team is now a fixture at the world's sixth-largest ad agency and represents one firm's successful effort to translate American products for increasingly affluent audiences around the world. **********Starting with a crew of four people, the International Team now has a staff of 25 in McCann's New York headquarters. The team, a veritable United Nations of creatives from Japan, Africa, Brazil, China and Great Britain, invents advertising for 43 clients in three or more countries and has grown from handling $750,000 worth of production in its first year to more than $20 million worth in 1988. **********Recently, Marcio M. Moreira, McCann's vice chairman and international chief creative officer, sat in his office surrounded by cans of Coca-Cola - his agency's most significant client - and reflected on the operation's past decade and the tricks of the global trade. **********The unit originated as a ''firefighting team,'' dedicated to solving problems around the world, from pitching new business to writing a critically needed spot for a short-handed office. **********''But it cost money to have these highly paid people sitting around waiting for problems,'' said Mr. Moreira, a 41-year-old native of Brazil. **********As is often the case at McCann, the Coca-Cola Company helped to change the situation. The soft-drink maker was worried that its advertising was subject to what ad people call the ''brown envelope syndrome.'' (Mr. Moreira said the syndrome occurs ''when something is created in New York and sent in a brown envelope to offices overseas with instructions to translate.'') What Coke wanted was a division comprised of people from different countries who could help it develop its campaigns and adapt them around the world. And like the proverbial 800-pound gorilla, the company - which spends upwards of $700 million a year on advertising - gets what it wants. **********Starting with the ''Coke Is It'' ads in 1981, no Coca-Cola campaign has been created without the participation of the International Team. When the current ''You Can't Beat The Feeling'' campaign was being developed by McCann, the team was busy testing alternative slogans - including ''There's Nothing Like A Coca-Cola'' - in countries like the Philippines and England. **********Coca-Cola's recent ''General Assembly'' commercial, a latter-day version of Coke's ''I'd Like to Teach The World To Sing'' television ad, featured children from all over the world singing about the drink's virtues. Twenty-one versions of the spot were shot in Liverpool, England. **********McCann bases variations among its clients' ads on careful research on the customs of different countries. In the Goodyear campaign, for example, the specific product being promoted - the Eagle high-performance tire -already existed in Britain, hence the desire simply to set a mood. But in the Netherlands, the tire was just being introduced, thus the need for a voice-over. **********The Philippines focused on family reunions because ''emotionality is more important in the Philippines than in Britain,'' Mr. Moreira said. And in Brazil, the commercial ended on a joke because Goodyear's ads in that country had long used humor and maintaining the association between the company and a belly laugh was important. **********Sometimes, the reasons for the variations are parochial. McCann's International Team made several versions of a recent television ad promoting to teen-agers the delights of Coke with food. Each spot was built on a single main ''pattern'' ad, showing the same kids at the same party dancing to the song ''Pink Cadillac.'' The only difference was a focus on a specific regional food in each ad. **********But for Argentina, a completely new spot was filmed with different actors. Yet shot-for-shot it was identical to the ''pattern'' version, down to the actors' costumes. **********The reason for the new spot, Mr. Moreira said, was an Argentine law that prevents the broadcast of commercial film shot outside the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/28/business/economic-scene-the-arms-budget-and-global-goals.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1989-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 832, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; The Arms Budget And Global Goals", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; The Arms Budget And Global Goals", "body_text": " **********THE Bush Administration's effort to reduce the budget deficit, seen as a source of national economic weakness, is coming to focus on cutting military spending, with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney leading the attack on the budget. **********This week Mr. Cheney proposed $10 billion in cuts, spread widely among the services. These would result from delaying production of the B-2 Stealth bomber for a year; trimming funds for the Strategic Defense Initiative; eliminating 60 of the Navy's F-14D fighters; dropping one attack submarine and retiring the aircraft carrier Coral Sea; reducing Army troops by 8,000; canceling the Marine Corps' Osprey aircraft; suspending 80 percent of the Pentagon's financing for the development of a National Aerospace Plane, and other cuts. **********This is, in effect, the Chinese torture of a thousand cuts. Inevitably, many members of Congress are complaining about cuts they fear will hurt industries and jobs in their districts. Yet the warm reception Mr. Cheney got from the House Armed Services Committee suggests that much of what he is proposing will go through. **********But the question many military experts are asking is whether Mr. Cheney's politically astute way of spreading a limited amount of pain adds up to a strategy that will best serve the nation's strategic and economic interests in the longer run. **********No consensus exists among the experts and former Defense officials on how to cut the military budget more deeply without impairing American or Western security. John F. Lehman Jr., who as Navy Secretary during the Reagan years championed building to a 600-ship Navy, now proposes to save money by shifting about one-third of active forces and their equipment to reserve status. **********Richard A. Stubbing, who worked on the military and intelligence budget for 20 years and is now a professor at Duke University, regards the Lehman proposal with profound skepticism. He contends that the largest area for potential savings, without weakening forces, is in military procurement. He has spelled the needed reforms out in a book, ''The Defense Game,'' just published by Harper & Row. **********Mr. Stubbing notes that Robert Costello, the Pentagon's top procurement official, has made public his view that the Defense Department wastes 20 to 30 cents of every dollar it spends. That would be $50 billion a year - an estimate that Mr. Stubbing regards as conservative. But he stresses that cutting the Pentagon budget presupposes agreement on a comprehensive military strategy, which neither the Bush Administration nor the Joint Chiefs of Staff has yet thought through. **********As one example, Mr. Stubbing, together with Harvard's William Kaufmann, challenges the Navy's case for building 15 aircraft carrier groups, supposedly the means for carrying an attack to the shores of the Soviet Union. That strategy, he said in an interview this week, would bring American ships within disastrously close range of Soviet aircraft, missile and submarine defenses. **********Neither Mr. Cheney nor the other strategists in the Bush Administration have had time to determine strategic priorities, much less how to achieve them within the severe constraints of the budget. The two most critical issues, Mr. Stubbing said, are, first, the emphasis to be put on nuclear versus conventional weapons and, second, the commitment of forces to NATO versus the building of mobile American forces to deal with third world crises, as in the Middle East. **********For the time being American policy makers seem eager to hold on to the status quo at NATO, while reducing its costs. Washington's desire to avoid overstraining the American economy has been intensified by the emergence of an economically powerful Japan, perceived both as ominous rival and valuable ally to this country. **********The immediate political weakness in both of America's strongest allies and former enemies -Japan, with Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita falling from power and no successor in place, and West Germany, with the Kohl Government assailed from both the right and left - means that the United States continues to have global leadership thrust upon it, willy-nilly. **********In this tricky and shifting situation, President Bush and Mr. Cheney are waging a holding operation: trying to scale down military spending without reducing America's military roles and missions. This is the approach that Prof. David Calleo of Johns Hopkins University has labeled ''defense on the cheap.'' **********A more deep-going solution will take time to work out within the Administration, Congress and the armed forces, and time to negotiate, not only with the Europeans and the Japanese but, perhaps most important, with the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is now in more secure control of his own country but still in need of cuts in military spending for the sake of his stagnating economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/19/business/dow-chemical-net-off-7-monsanto-s-earnings-up-9.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1989-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 474, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Chemical Net Off 7%; Monsanto's Earnings Up 9%", "print_headline": "Dow Chemical Net Off 7%; Monsanto's Earnings Up 9%", "body_text": " **********The Dow Chemical Company reported yesterday that its earnings had fallen 7 percent in the third quarter, primarily because of lower demand for polyethylene, a main ingredient in plastic products. **********Separately, the Monsanto Company said its third-quarter earnings had risen 9 percent, mostly because of strong results in its chemical business and higher profits from sales of its artificial sweetener, Nutrasweet. **********Dow said its net income had fallen to $589 million, or $3.29 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $632 million, or $3.36 a share, a year earlier.

But wheat prices eased on profit taking after surging late last week. **********At the close of the Chicago Board of Trade, the spot May corn rose 6 cents a bushel, to $2.76 3/4; spot soybeans advanced 14 1/4 cents a bushel, to $7.47 1/4, while wheat for delivery next month slipped 2 1/2 cents a bushel, to $4.10 1/4. But new-crop wheat deliveries starting in July posted moderate gains. **********Meanwhile, energy prices continued to soar. The spot May crude oil delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed 53 cents a barrel, to $21.22, driven further by strong demand for byproducts. Unleaded gasoline surged a further 2.06 cents a gallon, to a new contract high of 72.08 cents. Even heating oil rose, adding 0.85 cent a gallon, to 53.76 cents. **********One problem facing farmers in the Corn Belt this spring is the low subsoil moisture resulting from 1988's severe drought and the light snowfall this past winter. The other problem is the relatively large amount of chemicals from last year that remain in the soil. Farmers usually count on normal rainfall and winter snow to leach these chemicals before spring planting time. **********The situation is particularly bothersome to Midwest corn and soybean growers who normally rotate the two crops. Corn, the nation's largest and most important crop, depletes the soil, while soybeans tend to add nutrients. But herbicides, fungicides and other chemicals applied to corn fields are not suitable for soybeans and vice versa. **********Most wheat growers do not rotate crops and generally use the same chemicals and fertilizers. But roughly 75 percent of the nation's wheat crop is planted in the fall and should soon be germinating, provided the dormant seeds receive sufficient moisture. Much of the subsoil in the Midwest's fall and spring wheat growing region is relatively dry. **********One reason why grain and oilseeds prices have not reflected last year's drought, which was the worst since the Dust Bowl days of the early 1930's, was the rather large surplus of stocks from previous harvests in private and Government hands. **********Also weighing on prices this past winter was the sharp decline in animal feed usage. As with humans, livestock feed requirements rise as the temperature falls. Because of the relatively mild winter livestock raisers used an estimated 1 billion bushels of corn in the first three months of 1989, compared with the 1.4 billion fed to the same number of cattle, hogs and poultry in the first quarter of 1988, according to Cargill Investor Services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/world/bonn-ties-more-aid-for-east-germany-to-free-elections.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1989-11-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1020, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BONN TIES MORE AID FOR EAST GERMANY TO FREE ELECTIONS", "print_headline": "BONN TIES MORE AID FOR EAST GERMANY TO FREE ELECTIONS", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Parliament today that Bonn would be ready to provide ''comprehensive'' aid to East Germany if it allowed free elections and made fundamental changes in its state-planned economy. **********If the East German Communist Party gives up its monopoly on power, allows independent political parties and assures free elections, Mr. Kohl said he would be ready ''to talk about a new dimension of our economic aid.'' Nationally Broadcast Speech **********Speaking of the possibility of German reunification, suddenly alive again because of the continuing flight of emigres from East Germany, Mr. Kohl said in a state-of-the-nation speech: **********''Let us avoid the temptation to assume that a solution to the German question can be arranged in advance with a script and a calendar. History doesn't follow a schedule.'' **********''The precondition for reunification in freedom is the free exercise of the right of self-determination by all Germans,'' he said. ''I am certain that if they get the chance, they will choose freedom and unity.'' **********Mr. Kohl made it clear that the new East German leadership still had much to do before the time would be right to talk about economic aid, even though East Germany already gets about $1 billion a year from Bonn in return for permitting family visits between East and West. Its goods have access to the European Community through trade with West Germany now totaling about $7 billion this year. Slightly more than half of that is in East German exports to the West. Seeks to Reassure Allies **********Mr. Kohl sought to reassure the allies that Bonn's policies toward the East were not at the expense of its longstanding adherence to Western military, political and economic alliances.. **********''We have less reason than ever to be resigned to the long-term division of Germany into two states,'' Mr. Kohl said. But he added, ''The Federal Republic of Germany will remain irrevocably anchored in a strong and lasting relationship with the Atlantic alliance and in the community of values of the free peoples of the West.'' **********''After what is happening now in the German Democratic Republic, nothing will be as it was before - not there, not here and nowhere in Europe,'' the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said in a speech after the Chancellor's. 'We Will Not Close the Door' **********''We will do nothing to encourage the Germans in the G.D.R. to leave their homeland,'' he added, as more than 10,000 East Germans crossed the border from Czechoslovakia for the fifth straight day to claim their automatic right to West German citizenship. ''But we will not close the door.'' **********Mr. Kohl said: ''In the end, it is up to the leadership of the German Democratic Republic to offer a worthwhile prospect to the people there. Only that way can those who are still agonizing over the difficult step of emigration be impelled to stay.'' **********Stopping the hemorrhage of East Germans into the West is a major concern of the Bonn authorities, who have run out of temporary and permament housing for the arriving immigrants - often entire families who get here with a few suitcases piled in their small cars. **********West German officials and industrialists have begun to think of concrete ways to help modernize the East German economy if the new leadership under Egon Krenz some day moves as far away from orthodox Communism as Poland and Hungary have. Suggestions for Modernization **********Heinz Durr, board chairman of the giant AEG electronics group, speculated openly in Der Spiegel magazine this week about how West German companies could help modernize outmoded East German factories, and Chancellor Kohl's national security adviser, Horst Teltschik, suggested recently that West German businesses might gladly invest in whole industrial plants in East Germany if they could. **********The West German Chancellor, speaking on the eve of a five-day visit to Poland, did not cite any specific figure for East German aid, but he is expected to pledge at least $1.5 billion in economic aid and loan guarantees to the Solidarity-led Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland, who took office only last summer. **********Bonn's legislature removed the last obstacle to the visit this afternoon, with the Government and most of the opposition supporting a resolution assuring the inviolability of Poland's postwar borders and assuring Poles ''that their right to live in secure borders will not be questioned now or in the future by territorial claims by us Germans.'' **********Disputes within the governing Christian Democratic Union about the continuing legal status of the eastern German border before the Nazi invasion of Poland had previously prevented Mr. Kohl from giving such a public reassurance, though it was also contained in the 1970 treaty that normalized relations between the two. **********But increasingly, politicians and ordinary people in West Germany are openly expressing anxiety about what will happen if tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, more East Germans arrive on top of the 210,000 who have already come this year. **********Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said in the debate after Mr. Kohl's speech today, ''Above all it is important to stanch the flow of resettlers from the G.D.R. quickly - first of all in the interest of the G.D.R. and secondly because of the problems this flow causes for us.'' **********Mr. Kohl, acknowledging that ''some of us are having a hard time with the new arrivals,'' called on West Germans to do all they could to help them. But he and Mr. Vogel agreed that only the real prospect of free elections would keep more people from giving up and leaving for the West. **********''Cosmetic change is not enough,'' Mr. Kohl said.

And indeed, once passing press interest has evaporated, cover-ups or judicial maneuvers have served to confirm that money, influence or authority are sure shields against the law. **********Yet after a tourist boat sank at the mouth of the bay here on New Year's Eve, drowning at least 53 partygoers, reports of overloading, corruption and incompetence have resulted in an outcry that suggests that public attitudes toward the usual impunity are beginning to change. **********''Perhaps we are seeing the germ of a new kind of citizen who no longer accepts the old litany of corrupt justice and seeks the recovery of moral standards long buried in the basement,'' the Rio de Janeiro daily Jornal do Brasil noted in an editorial last week. A New Self-Examination **********The immediate focus of attention has been on public demands for punishment of those responsible for the disaster, with indignation mounting as the wealthy owners of the boat, the travel agency that chartered it and the Navy Minister, Adm. Henrique Saboia, have all refused to accept blame. **********But the loss has also provoked unusual soul-searching about the moral state of the country. A news magazine, Veja, said this week that the sinking of the vessel, the Bateau Mouche IV, is ''the inevitable consequence of the disorder created in the country by the failure of the authorities to guarantee the most elementary rights of Brazilian citizens.'' **********Mario Amato, president of the Confederation of Industries of Sao Paulo, was even harsher in his verdict. ''Brazil is characterized by lack of respect for human life, by systematic violation of the law, by omissions by the authorities, by generalized corruption and by the decadence of its customs,'' he said. **********But while the powers that be are the principal targets of the recrimination, the minimal respect that many Brazilians have for the law has also come up for analysis. ''From tax evasion to paying off a cop, everyone is somehow responsible for the moral crisis,'' a businessman said. Making Things Work **********In Brazil, there is even a professional intermediary called a ''despachante'' who knows who should be bribed to speed documents through the country's Byzantine bureaucracy. **********''Everyone wants to take advantage of everything,'' said Antonio Emirio de Moraes, an industrialist and possible presidential candidate in elections this coming November. ''We shouldn't be ashamed to be honest. It seems that today, everyone is ashamed to do things correctly.'' **********Some political experts maintain that indifference to the law is a legacy of the military regimes that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985, imposing their will on the judiciary and Congress and establishing the idea that actions by the executive branch could not be questioned. **********This perception was reinforced when many unresolved corruption scandals were quietly forgotten after the armed forces left office. The new Government of President Jose Sarney also chose to ignore human rights violations by the armed forces after a general amnesty was decreed in 1979. Press Scrutiny **********With the end of military rule, however, the Brazilian press became more aggressive in exposing abuses of power, ranging from links between the police and deaths squads operating against criminals in shantytowns to bribes extracted by national Government officials in exchange for approving loans to destitute municipalities. **********And even before the ship disaster, there were signs of mounting public irritation. In a town near here last month, for instance, the police had to protect a judge from an angry crowd that discovered he was using his official car for a family weekend. In another place, protesters stopped municipal council members from voting themselves a 400 percent raise. **********The killing last month of a peasant leader and environmentalist, Francisco Mendes Filho, who had been fighting to prevent deforestation of the Amazon by local landowners, also came as a shock to many Brazilians who had grown accustomed to reading about the lawlessness that prevails in remote areas of the interior. **********But it took the boat disaster to crystallize indignation over what the Rio de Janeiro daily O Globo called ''the misery of our ethics.'' And sensing the public's mood, politicians have taken up the cause. The governor of Rio de Janeiro has appointed a special prosecutor and last weekend city council members cast flowers into the sea in a tribute to those who died. **********Already, though, the investigation is in danger of bogging down. The 75-foot boat was originally built for 20 passengers, but the current owners, a restaurant called Sol e Mar, said they had Navy approval to carry 153 people. On New Year's Eve, it was reportedly carrying 123 people, of whom 53 drowned and 10 are missing. A Deadly Indifference?  Maritime experts have also charged that the flat-bottomed boat was not equipped for the open seas outside the Bay of Guanabara, although dozens of other boats braved rough water that night, some reportedly motoring past the sinking Bateau Mouche so as not to miss a midnight fireworks display along Copacabana Beach. **********The strongest accusations, though, have been leveled at the Brazilian Navy, with some survivors asserting that although the Bateau Mouche was ordered by a patrol boat to return for inspection, it was allowed to set sail after two navy petty officers were paid a $120 bribe. Further, at the time of the disaster, no patrol boats were on duty. **********Fears of a cover-up mounted over the weekend when the Navy Minister said a police inquiry into the sinking had ''no legal value'' because only a navy tribunal could establish responsibility. The Governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Wellington Moreira Franco, said the remarks were ''unhappy'' and ''incorrect from a legal point of view.''

Haig to promote the Trump Shuttle. Switch to another and he shows up clutching a chicken drumstick to inquire about a Commodore computer. And on a third, Mr. O'Neill climbs out of a suitcase to advertise Quality Inns hotels. **********Mr. O'Neill is also appearing in a regional television campaign for the Bank of New England and has done commercials for Miller Lite beer and Hush Puppies shoes and a widely published advertisement for the American Express card. High-Profile Pitchman **********But the current crop of commercials all began showing in the last three weeks, which has made Mr. O'Neill almost as high-profile a pitchman as Bill Cosby. **********Now, political commentators have accused him of cashing in on his political career. And several advertising executives who are using the former Speaker are worrying that he is becoming too visible. Moreover, they say, his choice of ads - particularly the Quality Inns commercial - could diminish the qualities that make him an effective salesman. **********''I think he will be overexposed now that all these things have started running,'' said Sam Scali, the president and creative director of Scali, McCabe, Sloves, which created the Trump Shuttle ads. ''The more you see of him, the less effective he becomes, even as a personality.'' **********Howie Carr, a columnist for The Boston Herald, criticized Mr. O'Neill for the ads. ''It just rings false after all the things he said during the Reagan years about being the tribune of the common man,'' Mr. Carr said. ''How much money does he need?'' And Andy Rooney, who has criticized Mr. O'Neill on the CBS program ''60 Minutes,'' said: ''Anyone who has an independent position or opinion has to be awfully careful about saying something for money. It makes all their other opinions suspect.'' **********Mr. O'Neill declined to be interviewed. But Peter Kelley, his agent, said Mr. O'Neill decided to appear in commercials to earn extra money for his wife and family. **********''Tip O'Neill didn't get rich in government,'' said Mr. Kelley, a vice president of the William Morris Agency, which has represented Mr. O'Neill for three months. ''Here is a man who spent 40 or 50 years serving the people for modest returns. The money is nice.'' **********The former Speaker's annual pension is $65,640, according to the Government's Office of Personnel Management. That is supplemented by the fees he earns on the lecture circuit, where he receives $20,000 a speech, Mr. Kelley said. Mr. O'Neill makes between 35 and 45 speeches a year. So his annual lecture income would total $700,000 to $900,000. **********Mr. O'Neill charges from $50,000 to $400,000 to appear in commercials, depending on the size of the campaign, how long it runs and the extent of his role, Mr. Kelley said. Selective About Products **********Mr. O'Neill has been selective about the products he promotes, Mr. Kelley said, and has declined to be the sole spokesman for any product. **********Mr. Scali said his agency sought Mr. O'Neill for the Trump campaign because they wanted a well-known liberal politician to pair with the conservative Mr. Haig. The television commercial depicts the two men debating political issues; they only agree that the Trump Shuttle is best. **********Another agency executive said the biggest problem for Mr. O'Neill was what he was doing in the commercials. ''Having the Speaker of the House come out of a suitcase is a little weird; there's a kind of goofiness about it,'' said Ron Berger, a partner at Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer, which created the $11 million campaign for Commodore's Amiga personal computer. **********Margot A.

'The Ad Is a Fantasy' **********Mr. Kelley said Mr. O'Neill appeared in the Quality Inns ad because the concept was ''fun.'' **********''The ad is a fantasy, not a possibility,'' he said.

The goal is to discourage poachers who sell the horns for tens of thousands of dollars apiece. **********For the last several years, these majestic plains and riverbeds, surrounded by flat-topped basalt mesas and conical hills strewn with rocks, have harbored the only rhinoceros population in the African wild that has increased rather than decreased. **********But when 5 of the 100 or so rhinoceroses in this parched region known as Damaraland were poached at the beginning of this year, the Namibian Directorate of Nature Conservation decided to dehorn the animals, a step that had been widely debated but never taken in other parts of Africa. **********The value of rhinoceros horn on the black markets of Asia, where it is reputed to have medicinal powers, particularly in enhancing male sexual potency, and in Yemen, where it is coveted for daggers, has made the rhinoceros the ultimate quarry of poachers, far outstripping elephant tusk as an illegal prize. 'A Drastic Step' **********''The dehorning of the black rhinoceros is a drastic step,'' said Brian Jones, an official of the directorate. ''But there seems to be a new wave of poaching, and we decided, because of the desperate situation, that this action had to be taken.'' **********The rhinoceros horns are used in mating, in fights with one another, in defense against other animals and to browse. **********Because of these various uses, some conservationists argue that dehorning might be detrimental to the animal. In Zimbabwe, for example, David Cumming, the director of a World Wildlife Fund project there, said dehorning had been considered but discounted as a way of saving the black rhinoceros from increased poaching because a horn was fundamental to the animal's ability to browse through the thick Zimbabwean underbrush. Independence a Factor **********In addition to concern about poaching simply for money, conservationists said the action was also prompted by the fear that as Namibia gains independence from South Africa, white farmers, resentful of a black majority government, would leave the country and poach rhinoceroses as a last defiant gesture. Namibia, the territory long known as South-West Africa, has been ruled by South Africa for more than 70 years and has begun a transition to independence under United Nations supervision. **********About 3,500 black rhinoceroses are estimated to remain in Africa, the bulk of them inside game parks in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Small numbers survive under protection in Kenya and Tanzania. **********In the early 1980's, when aggressive poaching began to reduce the continent's rhinoceros population, said to be 65,000 in 1976, the black rhinoceros was classified as an endangered species by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Despite the classification, a step intended to halt the trade in rhinoceros horn, the trade has flourished and prices have risen, conservationists say. **********The black rhinoceros, like the white rhinoceros, is a pale, whitish gray. But unlike the white rhinoceros, which grazes on grassland with a mouth that functions much like a vacuum cleaner, the black browses on shrubs and bushes with a prehensile lip. $18,000 a Kilogram Esmond Bradley-Martin, a Kenyan expert on the rhinoceros, said that African rhinoceros horn, which like a human fingernail consists of densely packed hair with keratin, is fetching $18,000 a kilogram in Taiwan. A horn can weigh 4 or 5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. **********The sawed-off horns have been stockpiled in an undisclosed place, kept secret for fear of theft. **********The dehorning in Damaraland, where the black rhinoceros has adapted to the harsh environment along with rare desert elephants, pale coffee-colored springboks, ostriches and zebras, was done over a three-week period last month. In an effort to further ward off the poachers, the Directorate of Nature Conservation has tried to create the impression that all of the 100 or so rhinoceroses were dehorned. Officially, the number has not been disclosed. **********But nongovernmental conservationists involved in the effort, which used tractors, trucks and a helicopter, said about 12 had been dehorned in an operation that, for each animal, took about 25 minutes after anesthetizing. Each animal's two horns, which arc skyward one behind the other above the mouth, were sawed off and the base filed down. The animal's ears were tagged for monitoring purposes and another drug was administered to wake it up. Described as Last Resort **********''We're going to have to monitor to see what effects there are on their social life,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The horn is used for fighting between bulls for females. We'll have to see the effect on that.'' **********Blythe Loutit, the founder of the Save the Rhino Trust Fund in Namibia, is confident that the hornless rhinoceros will fare well. She described dehorning as a last resort after her organization had failed to raise funds to hire more game guards and purchase a light plane that would have been used for observation against poachers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/28/business/fleet-norstar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fleet/Norstar", "print_headline": "Fleet/Norstar", "body_text": " **********Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. tapped the debt market yesterday with a $100 million issue of 10 1/4 percent notes due 1992 at a price of 99.875, to yield 10.30 percent, through Salomon Brothers Inc.

I don't think the Government will sue or that the main deal will be attacked. In terms of defining the outlet, the Government won't find any market in which Time-Warner would be too dominant.

Bagdikian  Author of ''Media Monopoly'' and professor, Graduate School of Journalism, University of California at Berkeley. **********The merger means there will be a further concentration of power over programming and an enormous increase in private power as well. Warner's lobbyists in Washington will now combine with Time's lobbyists. And when the co-chairmen of Time-Warner go to Washington, everyone there will stand at attention. **********This merger also means more uniformity of content in the media because the big companies all have the same goal. For instance, the three networks have similar news content because they all have to aim at the same target audiences if they are to make the very large profits they need. This leads them to the same conclusion about content - don't pursue any one story too long because if you do, some of your audience will drop out. **********Another reason why the merger will create more uniformity of content is that one objective of vertical integration is to take material and use it in as many different outlets as possible.

The other aggregates, M-1 and M-3, a much broader measure, also posted healthy increases. **********M-2 consists of currency and checking accounts, plus savings account deposits, individuals' money market fund balances and certain overnight bank borrowings. Fed Concern About Growth **********In recent weeks Fed governors have expressed concern about the sluggish growth in M-2, which until recently had been rising at a rate slower than the 3 to 7 percent target the Fed had set for the measure to expand on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. **********With the increase reported yesterday, M-2 is now growing at a 3.1 percent rate, or within the lower end of the Fed's target range, up from 2.5 percent during the week ended July 3. **********Aside from recent weak economic statistics, private economists have assumed that the slow growth in M-2 may have been a factor that persuaded the Fed to ease its grip on credit conditions in recent months. **********The increase reported yesterday may have been partly aberrational, analysts said, but the rise was so large that it should remove concerns about monetary growth from the Fed's list of worries. **********''The rise in M-2 during that week almost exceeds the amount the aggregate grew from December to June, and is probably the biggest increase ever,'' said Wayne Smith, an economist at Ried Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn. **********''I think this says that slow money growth is over, and that the Fed will need further signs of economic weakness before it eases policy further.'' **********Credit market participants, who had been looking for a rise of $4 billion to $4.5 billion in M-2, shared that view, because prices of Treasury notes, bonds and bills fell sharply after the figures were released. **********In late trading, the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent bonds that mature in 2019 were offered at a price of 108 10/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.13 percent. Before the money supply figures were released, yields on the closely watched issue had fallen as low as 8.08 percent. Secondary Treasury Issues **********Prices of secondary Treasury note issues were also impacted, although by late in the session most securities still registered small gains. **********For instance, the 9 1/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 107 9/32, up 7/32, to yield 8.03 percent. And the 8 5/8 percent 5-year notes were offered at 103 5/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.84 percent. **********Treasury bill rates, which had eased early in the day, moved higher after the money figures were released. **********Three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 8.04 percent, up 14 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills rose by 2 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.70 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.43 percent, up 3 basis points. **********In his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before a House Banking subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan appeared to make an understated reference to the money numbers released yesterday afternoon when he noted that ''the latest data on thse aggregates suggest that relatively rapid expansion'' experienced in June has continued into July. **********Earlier, the focus of attention had been on the Fed chairman's comments on the economy and inflation. **********Mr. Greenspan made it plain that while the economy had slowed, the Fed would work diligently to prevent a recession. However, at the same time he offered lower forecasts for growth for this year and 1990 than were presented in February, the last time he offered his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. **********''He was very clear about not wanting to go into recession, but the Fed seems willing to allow more acceptance of risking slower growth and a recession in order to knock down inflation than I anticipated,'' said Darwin L. Beck, a money market economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''The tone of the testimony suggested that the easing in policy that the market anticipates might not come as quickly or as easily as one might have thought previously.'' **********In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had pared its economic growth targets for this year to 2 percent to 2.5 percent, and to 1.5 percent to 2 percent for 1990. **********Activity in the secondary markets for corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds was subdued yesterday, and most traders had left for the day before the money supply figures were released. **********Corporate traders said that prices of most issues improved by about one-quarter of a point.

''When they hired me, I was so relieved,'' Mrs. Mardis said. ''Now I pay $44.80 a week for Ashley, who goes to work with me and leaves with me.'' **********Indeed, as the first and one of only 200 companies that operate child-care centers, Stride Rite is among the nation's most socially progressive corporations. Few companies can justify the cost of such projects. ''Sometimes it is just not appropriate, even for large companies,'' explained Eleanor Nelson, managing director of Workplace Connections, a child-care management and consulting firm. ''Maybe it would be difficult to find space. Or perhaps a greater proportion of the work force is older, making it an equity issue.'' **********Such was not the case at Stride Rite. Since it opened its first center in 1971, the company has started an additional day-care operation to satisfy employee demand. Handling about 100 preschoolers together - half of them employees' children - each center costs about $325,000 a year to operate. While the Massachusetts Department of Social Services pays about $6,500 for most of the children from the community, employees pay varying fees of up to 14 percent of their salaries to enroll their children. Stride Rite contributes the balance, about $200,000 a year. **********Some companies actually offer day-care services for free, although their programs are more limited. In 1980, Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, a law firm in Washington with 170 lawyers, established what it calls an emergency day-care facility for up to 10 children. Used on a first-come basis by both staff and lawyers, the center has paid for its $50,000 cost three times over in saved employee time, the company said. When one of its lawyers is out even for an hour, the firm loses $150 to $200. **********A few companies have formed day-care consortiums to avoid the high cost of going it alone. In September, six companies in Portland, Me. opened a child-care consortium called Downtown Childcare Inc. Some consortium members further defrayed costs by contributing services toward the center rather than cash. Mercy Hospital pledged food, an architectural firm designed the space and a law firm provided legal services in purchasing a building. **********The 130-child center accepts children from infancy through kindergarten.

The Vatican statement was a model of brevity: two dry paragraphs noting the ''noble tradition'' of relations that go back many centuries between the church and the predominantly Catholic Polish nation. **********A simultaneous announcement was made in Warsaw, where a Foreign Ministry spokesman described it as ''a very important fact that crowns a long process of normalization of relations between the state and the church.'' **********Poland's bishops also issued a statement in which they welcomed the restored links with ''great joy.'' **********There was no public mention of who would be the papal nuncio or the Polish ambassador, but announcements are expected in next few weeks. **********John Paul, who has returned to his homeland three times since ascending to the papacy in 1978, was on vacation today in northwestern Italy, and issued no statement of his own. But his position on this issue is clear. On his last trip to Poland, in 1987, he said that the Vatican maintained diplomatic relations with 116 nations, and that therefore the absence of formal ties with a Catholic country like Poland was ''something rather abnormal.'' **********Poland's Communist rulers broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican after they took power in 1945. But there already had been an interruption in normal ties because the last papal ambassador left Warsaw on Sept. 5, 1939, after the start of World War II. Talks Proceeded Slowly **********In the decades that followed the war, relations were often bitter, but they began to improve 20 years ago after a series of high-level visits. Both sides agreed in 1974 to establish permanent contacts, and negotiations over resuming relations have proceeded ever since, although not always smoothly. **********John Paul's strong support of the Solidarity trade union irritated the Warsaw Government, a point that was underlined last spring when Solidarity's leader, Lech Walesa, came to Rome and said that his movement's roots were ''inspired by the social doctrine of the church.'' **********At the same time, Vatican officials were suspicious of overtures made by the Polish authorities in recent years, and they expressed concern that the real goal in Warsaw was a breakthrough that would perhaps reduce internal dissent. The Pope insisted in Warsaw two years ago that the Vatican was prepared to establish relations if local bishops were willing to press the struggle for political freedom and if the Government did not interfere. **********A Vatican official familiar with Polish affairs said Warsaw's recognition of Solidarity this year, coupled with the elections won by the union's candidates last month, had removed many doubts about Poland's direction. **********A more concrete hurdle was overcome in May, when the Polish Parliament passed three laws guaranteeing the church's legal status. Among other things, the legislation established freedom of religion and affirmed the church's right to teach religion, build churches and operate schools."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/17/business/executive-changes-592789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** American Savings and Loan Association of Florida, Miami, named Roger C.

The current matches on the fight card include Apple Computer Inc. v. the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company; the Ashton-Tate Corporation v. Fox Software Inc. and the Santa Cruz Operation; the Intel Corporation v. NEC; the International Business Machines Corporation v. Fujitsu; the Lotus Development Corporation v. Paperback Software and Mosaic Software; Digital Communications v. Softklone Distributing, and even Apple Corps Ltd. v. Apple Computer. And these are just the main events. **********The industry is relatively young, and new technologies are appearing faster than the body of law can embrace them. The established legal concepts of patent and copyright are not yet elastic enough to fully cover such nebulous computer-age products as microcode, instruction sets and software's ''look and feel,'' the latter an intangible but recognizable combination of screen layout, command and menu structures, and functions. **********''The rules have become so uncertain that people are taking an adventurous attitude toward litigation,'' said Jonathan D. Wallace, a lawyer in New York who specializes in computer-related law. ''The game is wide open, and some companies, after the last few look-and-feel cases, apparently are being encouraged by their lawyers to rush in and try their luck.'' **********Companies in any industry have an obligation to protect vigorously their intellectual property, which often is developed through huge sums spent on research. And some companies, along with testing new products, seem to be testing how high and wide they can build the legal fences. Advocates of such aggressive protection say it fosters innovation and competition. **********Ashton-Tate, for example, claims that it owns not only the ''look and feel'' of its leading dBASE data-base program but also the computer language in which it was written and the file formats that it uses. The ''look and feel'' concept has never been applied to hardware. But I.B.M., which has seen billions of dollars go to the makers of personal computers that mimic the original I.B.M. PC, has served notice that its legal department will descend on anyone who flirts with the distinguishing features of its Personal System/2 machines without licensing. **********On a separate front, Intel, which lost a copyright infringement suit against NEC last month, nonetheless established that the software code embedded in microprocessors is copyrightable. **********But critics of these legal skirmishes say the lawsuits and threats are so broad in scope as to stifle competition. A company may build a better mousetrap, but it is unlikely to take it to market if it would be snared in an an expensive legal trap for doing so. **********From a user's standpoint, the substantially similar expression of ideas is the best thing to happen to computers since the machines moved to the desktop. None of us want to learn an entirely new set of commands for each new application. Nor do users benefit when a company pre-empts a good idea. Ashton-Tate's dBASE was a fine idea, but Fox Software's FoxBase Plus is a better program. Lotus 1-2-3 was a good idea, but other similar programs long ago left it in the dust. Beyond the substantial financial implications for the companies directly or indirectly involved in the proceedings, the outcomes of these suits are likely to have a significant impact on the way the average user works with computers. **********If Apple Computer prevails in its copyright suit against Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, for example, it would at least delay the efforts by makers of PC's and compatibles to develop a common user interface. If Ashton-Tate prevails in protecting a computer language that consists of English-like words and abbreviations, the precedent would draw every other software developer into a legal morass. **********A ruling last week in Federal District Court in San Francisco held that Microsoft may have at least partly overstepped its 1985 licensing agreement with Apple. Microsoft essentially conceded it had drawn on some looks and some feel of the Macintosh graphical user interface in developing its Windows graphical user interface. (A graphical user interface replaces long strings of typed commands with pictures that represent the tasks to be performed. Users issue orders by pointing to the appropriate picture, usually with a mouse.) The ruling was but one part of the case, applying only to the licensing agreement. The larger issue is whether Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which has a graphical user interface called New Wave, infringed Apple's patents. The next phase of the trial begins next month. **********Another suit with broad implications is the breach of contract accusation leveled by Apple Corps against Apple Computer. The three surviving Beatles and the estate of John Lennon say Apple Computer broke a 1981 agreement not to sell under the Apple name devices that synthesize music. Apple Corps wants damages estimated at $50 million to $200 million, and either wants the computer maker to change its name - to ''Peach or Prune, perhaps,'' one lawyer for the plaintiffs said - or stop selling the computers. **********Look and feel, though, has become perhaps the most rambunctious legal area. **********''Look and feel has been taken by the courts to the point where it broadens copyright laws well beyond where they ought to be,'' Mr. Wallace, the lawyer, said. ''The copyright law was intended only to protect expressions of ideas and not the ideas themselves. Until the look and feel cases first came out it was generally understood by computer lawyers that the user interface and the structure, sequence and organization of a program constituted the unprotectable idea, and not the expression.'' **********It seems obvious that there are substantial similarities among the programs being contested. Xerox Parc came up with brilliant ideas for the user interface in the 1970's, including menus, icons, windows and mouse control. Those same ideas are expressed in similar ways by Apple, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Next, Sun, Tandy and many others. While vexing or perhaps amusing to most users, the court battles are needed to establish the rules for competition in the industry. Once those rules are defined, companies can resume spending money on creative programmers and system designers, not lawyers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/03/world/blunder-at-beijing-dinner-us-chides-embassy.html": {"writer_name": "R.

The visit was seriously marred by the incident and its aftermath. **********The Chinese, in a statement distributed by the New China News Agency on Wednesday, called the invitation to Mr. Fang ''irresponsible'' and said it ''can only be interpreted as support for this kind of individual and disrespect for the host country.'' **********''Some of these things they are extraordinarily sensitive to,'' the White House official said. ''Others they let go by without saying a word about. Sometimes it's hard to tell which is going to be which, but it turned out that they were extraordinarily sensitive to this particular individual.'' **********The official, who accompanied Mr. Bush on his five-day Asian swing, said the embassy, which is headed by Winston Lord, had sent a proposed guest list to Washington some time ago. He said neither the embassy nor the State Department had ''flagged'' Mr. Fang's name to suggest that a dinner invitation might stir a controversy. **********''Communications in Washington,'' the White House official commented drily, ''are less than perfect.'' Chinese Clearly Unhappy **********A State Department official said the Chinese had been aware of the invitation for some days before the banquet. They complained several times, the official said, leaving American officials in doubt as late as Sunday afternoon about whether the Chinese leadership would attend the dinner or stay away. **********''Then when they called back and said that the leaders would be coming, we and the embassy assumed that meant they had accepted Fang's presence,'' the department man explained. ''That seemed to be the natural inference, so we didn't send anyone to accompany Fang and his wife to the hotel.'' **********Selig S. Harrison of the Carnegie Endowment, a longtime China watcher, described that conclusion as ''foolish'' and the whole notion of asking Mr. Fang to the hotel as ''a terrible, incompetent, very clumsy blunder.'' **********''Here is a President who's supposed to know China who doesn't even know how resentful these people are of anything that injures their self-esteem,'' he added. ''Bush had every good reason to want to see Fang, because we need to demonstrate our concern about human rights, but he should have invited him to the embassy, where there could have been no question of us abusing their sovereignty. It's our turf.'' **********Other China experts, both conservatives and liberals, agreed with Mr. Harrison, but the State Department man, who like the White House official spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said that a meeting at the embassy or in Mr. Bush's hotel suite would have looked worse. **********''At the dinner, he would have been one of 250 people, representing all strata of Chinese life and all segments of opinion,'' he argued. ''There would have been little opportunity for a conversation with the President. But a one-on-one meeting would have put him on the same level, symbolically speaking, with the four major Chinese leaders whom the President did met with.'' **********Asserting that ''no one at any point in the planning process said the invitation was a bad idea,'' the State Department official said that ''it wasn't a wholly unanticipated thunderbolt when the Chinese took offense, but it wasn't preordained, either.'' **********He and the White House official both said they expected no major long-term damage to relations between Beijing and Washington."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/03/world/the-un-today.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Gorbachev than amid a few hours ennui in the hope-burdened, promise-ridden Congress of People's Deputies, where the legislators have just been ordered into weekend overtime to labor like makework elves under the oratorical lash of the ultimate red Santa. **********The Soviet leader exhorts and smiles, more jolly and quick with their agenda than most of the 2,244 members in the yawning Palace of Congresses, where a giant statute of Lenin seems to glare that they had better watch out. **********The sense of weariness and doubt marking this Congress is in contrast with the first session last spring, the forum for so many sensational ''firsts,'' from the first denunciation of the K.G.B., to the first public bearding of a Soviet leader over his grand dacha and limousine perks. **********This session offers such firsts as the first look at campaign financing (passing curiosity), the first call to disclose personal wealth (a collective blink of nonendorsement), the first deputy caught by constituents lying about his vote (pretending he did not vote for the party's continuing power monopoly), and the first public relations spokesman hired by a deputy (a shy and refreshingly unconfiding man who cannot afford to do lunch). **********''Yesterday I stood in line to get a half-kilo of butter,'' one complaining citizen telephoned a local newspaper. ''Then I came home and watched the congress on television and realized why I would be standing in lines for the rest of my life.''  Random 'Dark Corners' **********Outside on the Kremlin estate, the pristine snow mantle has long since turned to mauve slush and evaporated under the wheels of the party limousines as the agenda clogs after nine days of debate. The grounds for this palatial vox pop are groomed by cleanup crews selected from an estimated pipeline of several thousand Moscovites recently arrested for minor internal passport violations, traffic infractions, hooliganism, currency speculation and drunk tank recidivism - ''all the dark corners of Moscow,'' according to one news account. **********Maybe so, but at least they're a model of non-Communist randomness, something the Congress itself is not allowed to be under the party monopoly law that bars pluralism in politics. Such party hegemony is fast disappearing from much of the Soviet bloc while the Communist majority here prepares to debate street crime for hours and dwells for days on the latest Gorbachev economic plan that many doubt yet virtually all salute. **********Inside the hall, Mr. Gorbachev remains attentive to everything, usually doing most of the talking, often leaving the deputies resembling Wagnerian spear carriers for his frequent arias on perestroika. One congressman made it to the floor microphone the other evening to briefly complain he had been pleading for a week for three minutes' speaking time. Mr. Gorbachev simply ignored him, smiling amiably as the television cameras focused in, his ever-present glass of khaki-colored liquid, a mystery to the nation, at hand for sustenance for each long day's journey into talk.  Defining Vagueness **********A few deputies began questioning on their own what the rules are, what they are doing there, how a bill becomes a law so impervious to amendment. One, Fyodor M. Burlatsky, piped up like a contumacious elf to say he was encouraged by vital signs in a few unexpected speeches that did not have the usual ring of party careerist boilerplate - ''like real speeches made in a parliament,'' he said rather awestruck. **********He therefore proposed that it was time to start defining everyone's vague function in the new Government, beginning with Mr. Gorbachev. It may be good to see Mikhail Sergeyevich flitting abroad like some summit-top Santa and signing agreements, but Mr. Burlatsky noted that ''in our country his functions are not defined.'' In reply, Mr. Gorbachev proved the point by simply having the Congress move on to other business. **********Tonight, the deputies approved a set of rules that keeps them subject to Mr. Gorbachev's diktat and relatively unchallenging. Even at that, the leadership wants enthusiasm in the house. **********''We cannot just be passive,'' growled Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the ranking Kremlin factotum, sounding like a coxswain on a galley ship as he sat up on the Congress presidium, filling in for Mr. Gorbachev, his career-long party patron since university days.  Privileges of Rank **********Some of the Soviet press covering the Congress from within Moscow's ring road already are leaning toward voice-of-authority legislative commentary reminiscent of the sepulchral tones that so often distinguish reportage from within the Washington beltway. **********''Prince Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' dilemma was solved in a positive way on Tuesday,'' invoked Andrei Orlov, congressional watcher for Tass, as he reported with relief still another victory by the party in wielding its one-party mandate against all congressional comers. **********But others, like Yevgeny Beyshenaly of Sovetskaya Kultura, remember what the voters remember, the firm pledges of deputy candidates in those salad days of open campign oratory last winter to prevail as everyman and slash the scandalous privileges of ranking politicians. ''Many of them in the election campaign assailed the existence of V.I.P. Rooms for deputies at airports and train stations but now they do not say a word,'' Mr. Beyshenaly said. ''Now they go to the head of the line everywhere.'' **********Another muckraker, Dmitri Belovetsky of Literaturnaya Gazeta, has been carefully measuring the deputies' special menus at the Moskva Hotel, finding a day's offering includes a shocking cornucopia of at least 22 dishes at an average price three times lower than in a typical Moscow restaurant, exclusive of fruit, drinks and pastries so richly at hand. Frozen constituents waiting in long lines outside nearly barren food stores beyond the Kremlin are making a repast of his accounts. The 57-kopeck (10-cent) fried steak entree, the 29-kopeck boiled tongue with fresh tomatoes (fresh tomatoes!) dance in their heads like angrifying sugar plums.  The Opposition Tries **********The original fear for this winter was of a bout of material deprivation, of food and fuel shortages to make the political will of the Congress cringe. Instead most of the members merely slouch pre-emptively in their red chairs, addressed as ''esteemed comrades,'' too timid to casually cluster for gossip and parliamentary intrigues as in the world's cockier legislatures. **********To its credit, the ragtag minor opposition of deputies has been trying to stir the majority, but has failed on such crucial issues as the Communists' power monopoly and the search for legislative input into the annual centrally planned juggernaut, the economic plan that has so much sway over the daily misery of Soviet life. **********This minority is now so plainly wounded with the loss of its moral leader, Andrei D. Sakharov, that they can be painful to watch. ''I am blinded,'' said Arkady N. Murashev, an opposition deputy usually incorrigible with unwarranted optimism. **********The one bit of rebelliousness of late within the party hierarchy, that of Boris Gidaspov, the disgruntled Leningrad chief, finally ended with a whimper. Once he had been confronted by Mr. Gorbachev's partisans at a party meeting for having questioned the riskiness of perestroika in this winter of discontent, Mr. Gidaspov said no, no, he was not intriguing, all he was doing was experimenting in something he now terms ''liberal conservatism or conservative liberalism.'' **********''I belong to the happy breed of people who were the first to support Gorbachev, and I stick to these positions,'' he declared, making his smile clear to the house, flaunting fealty before the understanding majority."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/20/business/executive-changes-203789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Atmos Energy Corp., Dallas, a natural-gas distribution company, said Dennis S.

Weapons were silent only for brief periods. And fighting intensified in the morning hours. Army units are in heavy fights in several parts of the Rumanian capital with Securitate groups, which barricaded themselves in residential buildings and open fire unexpectedly from there. Leaders of the National Salvation Front called the attention of the population to the fact that the Securitate members are highly trained in street fights and for night activities, and it is difficult to recognize the Securitate men as they wear civilian clothes, and some even wear the arm bands of the uprisers and infiltrate the crowds. **********The buildings of Rumanian radio and television are firmly held by the uprisers, with help from the army units. A fresh attack was launched against television early on Sunday morning, and fights then spread to the streets of the diplomatic district, where heavy cannons and hand weapons were heard for two hours. The televison building was guarded also with help from the population, who formed roadblocks with lorries and trucks in the streets leading to the building. Fights are also reported from the vicinity of the northern railway station. The terrorist units are also a problem in the city center buildings still under construction. Members of the Securitate units kept firing all through the night near the Foreign Ministry in Victoria Square from the floors of an unfinished 12-story building. **********By Saturday morning, the situation in Bucharest is that Securitate units are continuing to put up heavy resistance and are launching counterattacks in several places, but the army has the situation in hand. An appeal was made to young people to help the army's activity by forming patriotic guards. According to information, the four major Securitate units in the Rumanian capital have not received reinforcements. **********Rumanian radio, which broadcast programs all night and informed the population about the developments, has called the workers of the units and companies to do everything to insure the supply of the population amid the difficult circumstances. News on drinking water is contradictory. According to Bucharest radio, water has not been poisoned, but other sources contradict this, and the population thus has no reliable information. **********Battles were also reported outside Bucharest, from Szeben, Timisoara and Brasov. The situation is calm in many other major cities of Rumania. For example, life is almost back to normal in Nagyvarad. There are no fights, and the shops are open and operating. **********It was reported that a helicopter division of the Securitate blew up the ammunition stores left behind in Elopatak, in Kovaszna country. Two helicopters with weapons and ammunition took off for the capital, but the army shot down one in the vicinity of Bodok. In Szeben, helicopters attacked the railway station, and the still-remaining Securitate units hold the city under terror. **********Bucharest radio wished Merry Christmas to the entire population of Rumania. On Sunday morning, ''the third day of freedom,'' Bucharest radio called for restoring normal order as soon as possible in all places where fighting had ended, by organizing local National Salvation Front committees. Production should begin, and food, heating and drinking water should be insured to the population first of all. **********Although fights are still in progress, new democratic Rumanian newspapers are being published one after the other. Hungarian language newspapers are again coming to life in the regions inhabited by the Hungarian ethnic groups. Attila Jakabffy, member of the National Salvation Front of Marosvasarhely, was happy to report on Bucharest television that the Ceausescu dictatorship, which was the source of so many conflicts between the Hungarian and the Rumanian people, has ended. They can now freely speak Hungarian. Mr. Jakabffy thus spoke in Hungarian on Rumanian television, and said order has been restored in the regions inhabited by Hungarians. The people have won. He added: We can insure the entire population of the country that we, the Hungarian minority, want to live and work together with the entire nation in the place we were born, and we shall do everything in the interest of work, peace and the future of our children and ourselves.  M.T.I. From Budapest **********Col. Gyorgy Keleti, spokesman of the Hungarian Ministry of Defense, reported on Sunday in Budapest that Minister of Defense Ferenc Karpati held a telephone discussion on Sunday morning with Gen. Nicolai Militaru. **********The new Rumanian Minister of Defense said they highly appreciate the assistance readiness shown by the Hungarian people, the Hungarian Government and the Hungarian People's Army, the effort with which Hungary wishes to assist the solution of the Rumanian situation. **********In answer to questions by Minister Karpati, the Rumanian Minister said one or two days will probably have to pass before the Hungarian transport aircraft are able to safely arrive in Rumania. Other possibilities should be sought to forward aid deliveries in the situation that has come about. According to the Rumanian side, it would be safer to forward aid by railway and waterway. The Hungarian side is continuously awaiting notification from the Rumanian side on when, in what direction, and under what circumstances the aid can be dispatched. **********According to Mr. Karpati, the direct communication contact that has come about between the two armies guarantees that forwarding of aid deliveries can be solved within a short time.

Ceausescu followers are fighting desperately, sometime shooting at peaceful passers-by. **********Ion Iliescu, president of the National Salvation Front Council, together with the general staff and military leaders, is directing operations from a protected place. It is probable that the Securitate is searching for this center but this cannot be successful because the army, the militia and the interior organs which have gone over to the other side represent a greater and greater force. Hour by hour, the chance is growing that the army, which is in control of the Bucharest situation, will finally liquidate the scattered units. **********In the other towns of Rumania, the picture varies. In certain places fighting is still going on, but more serious clashes have not been reported so far. **********Reports from Timisoara say that the armed fanatical groups are on their last legs. Roads leading out of town are closed and tightly checked so that members of the fleeing Securitate can be captured.  The Moscow Radio **********(Interview with a Bucharest correspondent, Sergei Zhelezenyak, by an unidentified studio announcer.) -Announcer: Can you hear us, Sergei Nikolayevich? Sergei Nikolayevich? **********Zhelezenyak: I can hear you very poorly. **********Announcer: Well, we can hear you well. So tell us what the situation is? **********Zhelezenyak: As you can hear, firing is under way literally on the streets adjacent to our building and our correspondents' post. Well, as you know, with the onset of darkness yesterday it was expected that forces loyal to Ceausescu would try under the cover of darkness to take hold of power again. In order the prevent the terrorists regrouping,there have been checks throughout the night on all main roads in the city. They were carried out by students. One of them was armed with a submachine gun while the rest merely held sticks. They thoroughly searched all pedestrians and vehicles in particular. I think that this general supervision of the city did, to a certain extent, play a positive role. **********Nevertheless, between approximately 2100 and 2200 Bucharest time terrorists carried out a raid on the Gara de Nord Railway Station. **********During the night there was fighting also in other areas too, at times even with the employment of fairly large-caliber artillery. Many buildings were damaged, especially in the central part of the city. The fact that these buildings are architectural monuments and the pride of the Rumanian capital makes it even more painful. The guns were firing upon the roofs where terrorists were firmly entrenched and from where they were firing at pedestrians. Naturally, fires have been breaking out.  Report of Tainted Water **********At 0430 there was a report that water could not be used for washing or drinking, since the water had been poisoned. People were ringing each other up and passing on this information. At 0500 fierce fighting flared up once again in many areas. At 0600 Free Bucharest Radio announced that the water had been checked and the report of the water being poisoned had not been corroborated. **********The Committee of National Liberation is full in control of the situation in the city, although in some places and as you can hear, in my immediate vicinity - there is firing and there are perhaps what I might call combat actions.  Tass From Bucharest **********Morning bell chimes heralded Christmas Eve in Bucharest on Sunday, but they could not abate tension in the troubled Rumanian capital. **********Our car, like all other cars on the highway, was stopped at every crossing. A car belonging to former State Security Minister has just passed here spraying everyone with machine-gun fire, a patrol man who stopped us on the Mageru boulevard in downtown Bucharest explained. **********Near the Revolution's headquarters - the radio and TV building -we saw another atrocity by Ceausescu die-hards. Explosions and gun-fire rocked the square. All windows in the building have been shattered and large holes were gaping in the walls. There was a pool of blood on the sidewalk, ringed by burning candles. **********Today, we visited Bucharest's emergency hospital. Volunteer donors were lining near the gate. Crowds of crying relatives stood nearby, surrounded by young people offering their help. **********''The pain of the revolution is here,'' a doctor on duty told us. **********It is here that the first victims of the popular revolt against the Ceausescu regime were brought in on Dec. 21. **********Since then, the hospital staff have been working round the clock. **********We visited the hospital morgue with more than 90 bodies of freedom fighters and terrorists. **********Bloodshed in bucharest continues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/01/business/the-executive-computer-the-fallout-from-the-font-wars.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1070, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Fallout From the Font Wars", "print_headline": "THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; The Fallout From the Font Wars", "body_text": " **********The Font Wars, as the competition among industry leaders is known, went ballistic last week at the Seybold Computer Publishing Conference here, and the outcome will fundamentally change the way software looks on computer screens and the way documents look when they are printed or sent to other computers. **********Bill Gates, chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, and John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc., announced that their companies - opponents in court for the last year - had reached an agreement on sharing outline font technology and printer software. In the former, characters are stored as mathematical formulas that describe such characteristics as style, size, shape and weight; outline fonts allow computer users to store one set of specifications in each type face and manipulate the size and other characteristics in almost infinite permutations. **********Even though the technology may seem arcane to most computer users, or perhaps limited in significance to the specialized area of desktop publishing, the Microsoft-Apple agreement is ''probably the most important development in the computer industry this year,'' said Jonathan W. Seybold, publisher of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing. His conference brings together the leading figures in the multimillion-dollar industry of desktop and electronic publishing. **********''This is not just arcane stuff for the cognoscenti,'' Mr. Seybold said. ''We are on the brink of a new generation of computing with a rich graphics environment for all users. The font technology is the foundation, and it is of crucial importance to everybody who uses the next generation of word processing, spreadsheets, graphics or any other application, as well as to more upscale publishing.'' **********Microsoft, the largest maker of software for personal computers, announced that it had acquired rights to Apple's scalable font technology. That will significantly improve the way text appears in applications running under the OS/2 operating system, and perhaps under the Windows environment on DOS. Text display, manipulation and printing on the PC has been inferior to that of the Macintosh, and this agreement has the potential of making DOS and OS/2 computers more attractive to people who use graphics. **********In return, Apple will get the rights to Microsoft's recently acquired printer software, which controls the way information from a computer is translated to the printed page. By linking itself to the much larger base of computers using Microsoft operating systems and applications software, Apple will benefit through easier integration in offices where Macs and PC's coexist. In theory, Macs and PC's will be able to share text documents and printers much more easily than they do now. **********Apple and Microsoft assert that they have created an ''open'' standard for font formats and font-sharing technology, one that will permit type designers and software developers to create a flurry of products. Further, they say, businesses will be able to buy font packages that can be used on any computer or printer, which is important as more offices use a combination of machines. **********The Apple/Microsoft announcement was a stunning blow to Adobe Inc., whose Postscript software and proprietary type fonts are currently the de facto standard for high-end publishing systems, including Apple's. Apple and Adobe, along with the Aldus Corporation, of Seattle, created and reaped the benefits of the desktop publishing industry. **********However, Adobe kept proprietary certain aspects of its Postscript and outline font technology, which is common practice in the industry. The problem, analysts said, was that Adobe did not recognize that a time comes when the developer must loosen its grip on proprietary technology so that it does not hold other customers hostage to a single supplier. **********Apple and Microsoft executives said they chose to use one another's technology because it was technically superior to Adobe's. This is impossible to verify, since specifications for the proposed technology have not been released, let alone products. Privately, computer industry executives said it was Adobe's intractable stance on licensing that drove the larger companies to seek an alternative. If Adobe had compromised a year ago, the sources said, the power struggle could have been avoided and Adobe could have been the unified standard. **********The day after the Apple-Microsoft coup was announced, Adobe's chairman, John Warnock, appeared at a seminar and in an emotional speech said that Adobe would open the specifications for its outline fonts. The company had been planning to do so early next year, he said, but the large club wielded by Apple and Microsoft forced him to accelerate his plan. **********The move may come too late. Backed by a flurry of support from type font makers and software developers, Apple and Microsoft said they were proceeding with their plans. **********Reaction at the Seybold show was mixed. Some executives said they had resented paying so much in royalties to Adobe; they were elated that Adobe's ''lock'' on outline fonts had been broken. But many people said their emotional reaction was to back Adobe, a company that has a proven, superior product but whose leadership was unable, or unwilling, to reach an agreement with the powerful leaders at Apple and Microsoft. **********Steven Jobs, the chairman of Next Inc. who was ousted by Mr. Sculley from the chairmanship at Apple, where he had chosen Adobe's Postscript as the standard for the Macintosh, suggested that politics and personalities, rather than technology, were at the root of the conflict. His company's computers will continue to support Adobe's print, display and font technology, he said. James S. Gable, Apple's marketing manager for imaging technology, predicted that other companies, perhaps Adobe itself, would create translators that convert existing Adobe fonts to the Apple-Microsoft format automatically, and vice versa. **********But a big question is where the International Business Machines Corporation will cast its vote: with Adobe, which it currently supports, or with Microsoft, which controls the operating system and graphical interface software used by I.B.M.'s desktop computers. The choice will affect the full range of I.B.M. computers, and thus I.B.M.'s decision is certain to influence every company that makes I.B.M.-compatible equipment and software."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/21/world/rome-journal-why-vatican-s-voice-sometimes-bites-its-tongue.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1989-09-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1070, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rome Journal; Why Vatican's Voice Sometimes Bites Its Tongue", "print_headline": "Rome Journal; Why Vatican's Voice Sometimes Bites Its Tongue", "body_text": " **********When Pope Pius XI inaugurated Vatican Radio with a brief message one winter's morning in 1931, the only cause for worry was whether the crackly sound and unstable signal emanating from the new station would somehow diminish the occasion. **********The purpose of Vatican Radio, though, was never in discussion. Set up by the Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, its job was simply to carry the words of the reigning Pope, first in Italian and then in other languages, to the Roman Catholic faithful scattered far afield. **********Today, Vatican Radio has far exceeded that mission, not only broadcasting news and other programs in 34 languages, but also sending taped programs around the world, helping organize papal trips and even providing private language instruction to the present Pope. **********Yet, thrust into the more complex worlds of politics and theology by its success as a radio station, it now finds itself increasingly caught between its desire to provide reliable and objective information and its need to reflect official Vatican policy. 'An Unavoidable Conflict' **********''There's an unavoidable conflict between the needs and imperatives of diplomacy and of information,'' the Rev. Pasquale Borgomeo, Vatican Radio's director general, said. ''If you put your policy at the service of diplomacy, you lose credibility. And in the field of information, if you lose credibility, you're wasting your time and money.'' **********This quandary has become all the more acute under Pope John Paul II since, more than his recent predecessors, the Polish-born Pope has not only assumed positions on a vast range of delicate political issues, but has also sought to smother movements of dissent within the universal Catholic church. **********''We're a state radio rather than an official radio,'' Father Borgomeo said. ''But in any state, an external service is considered a political body, so we are considered more official than we tend to be. The more official we are, the less room for movement we have.'' **********The situation is further complicated by the fact that Vatican Radio is answerable to the Secretary of State, Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, who is also in charge of the Vatican's relations with other governments. Protests by governments about broadcasts are therefore channeled directly to the Secretary of State. 'A Paralyzing Silence' **********On one recent occasion, when Prague complained about ''attacks on Czechoslovakia'' by Vatican Radio at a time of delicate negotiations over the naming of new bishops there, the Secretary of State publicly reminded the station that it should remain ''in syntony'' with the policies of the Holy See. **********On other occasions, even in response to requests from Vatican Radio, the Secretary of State's office has refused to provide political guidelines on delicate issues of the day, forcing the station to adopt, in the words of a senior executive, ''self-control and a paralyzing silence.'' **********For the Rev. Ignazio Arregui, the station's news director, the ideal solution would be to attach Vatican Radio to an office other than that of the Secretary of State so that its broadcasts would be considered less official. ''At present, everyone knows where to apply pressure,'' he said. **********Father Borgomeo, however, disagrees, albeit admitting his difficulty in convincing the Vatican of the need to preserve the station's credibility. ''You can't have something as important as Vatican Radio dependent on some peripheral office,'' he said. Station Run by Jesuits **********On church matters, in contrast, Vatican Radio's position is well defined thanks to what one executive called ''a list of taboos.'' This includes the voice and views of left-leaning advocates of so-called liberation theology and of European theologians who recently signed documents critical of the Pope's conservative leadership. **********''There are names that can't be mentioned because there are people in the Vatican who are scared of opening windows and doors to a more creative debate in the context of public opinion within the church,'' the executive said. ''Just because we interview someone, it doesn't mean we agree with them.'' **********The resulting tension between the Holy See and Vatican Radio is all the greater because, since its inauguration 58 years ago, the station has been run by Jesuits, a religious order that has long been known for both its intellectual independence and its political and theological liberalism. **********In the early 1980's, when relations between Pope John Paul and the Jesuit order were at a low point, it was even rumored that Opus Dei, the conservative Catholic lay movement, might take over the operation of Vatican Radio. **********''I think that we provide daily proof of the Jesuits' loyalty and faithfulness to the Holy Father,'' Father Borgomeo said in an interview. 'Piracy' in Nicaragua **********Certainly, over the years, the 35 Jesuits - and 370 lay employees - at Vatican Radio have demonstrated their usefulness. On an annual budget of just $20 million, they not only broadcast to Communist countries where religious freedom has long been suppressed as well as to Catholic strongholds in the West, but also provide vital technical help during the Pope's frequent trips abroad. **********When the Pope visited Nicaragua in March 1983, for example, Vatican Radio technicians were even threatened at gunpoint by Sandinista agents who seized control of the sound system at a public mass in order to amplify pro-Sandinista chants and drown out the Pope's criticism of the so-called People's Church. ''It was a case of electronic piracy,'' Father Borgomeo recalled. **********Yet, as Vatican Radio struggles to compete for an audience on crowded international airwaves, the source of its problems can often be found in the entrenched bureaucracy of the Holy See just 400 yards away. ''We have to think in seconds,'' Father Borgomeo said. ''The Vatican thinks in centuries.'' **********While Vatican Radio is uncertain of the size of its audience, it claims one important advantage over the likes of the Voice of America and the BBC. **********''If another station decides its national interest requires a new program, it has to build an audience,'' the 56-year-old Jesuit said.

Initially, however, this kind of political uncertainty usually causes traders and investors to seek safety in the dollar. **********''There is uncertainty about the Soviet response and the Warsaw Pact response to the pace of change,'' said Paul Kimball, a managing director at Morgan Stanley & Company.

Smaller Gain Against Yen **********In late trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.8675 marks, up from 1.8520 on Thursday, but down from its 1.8690 high for the day. But the dollar gained less against the yen; it was at 143.45 yen, up from 143.05 on Thursday. **********Gold prices eased. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a 4 P.M. bid of $386.25 a troy ounce, down from $386.30 late Thursday.

But some traders said this had more to do with the underlying weakness of the currency than the situation in East Germany. In addition, the dollar gained against the pound, closing in New York at $1.5773, compared with $1.5823 Thursday. **********The dollar's climb was not that sharp when compared with some other days this year, when the dollar has been fairly volatile. And traders were divided over whether this rally would continue and possibly force another round of dollar selling by central banks to keep the currency in line. At 143.45 yen, the dollar is already above the 140 ceiling believed set for it by the United States and its economic allies. And at 1.8675 marks, the dollar is again beginning to move toward the 1.90 ceiling. **********The United States and its allies in the Group of Seven have fought to keep the dollar in line. They have issued communiques saying the dollar is too high, changed interest rates, and sold billions in the foreign exchange market to push the dollar lower. And since the stock market plunge of Oct. 13, the dollar has been back in line, at least against the mark. **********Hubert Pedroli, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York, said he thought the dollar was now moving higher. But he also said that the September trade deficit number, scheduled for release Thursday, could have a big impact on the outlook, especially if it indicates that the deficit is growing again. The August trade deficit was $10.8 billion, up from $8.2 billion in July. Looking for Signals **********Mr. Pedroli suggested that the uncertainty in the market could continue until next month's United States-Soviet Union summit meeting between Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He said the changes in Eastern Europe ''go beyond the understanding of the average foreign exchange trader,'' and they will be looking for any strong signals of what to expect. **********Liliana Nealon, vice president for foreign exchange at Union Bank of Switzerland, said that the slowing American economy, lower corporate profits and further declines in the stock market could again push the dollar lower. **********One reason for yesterday's rise is that many traders had aggressively sold dollars for West German marks after the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190 points on Oct. 13. But after markets became calmer, they found themselves overloaded with marks, especially in light of the uncertainity in East Germany. **********The mark also fell against the Japanese yen, partly because of rumors early in the day that the Japanese would raise interest rates next week. Because West Germany has moved much more aggressively than Japan to raise interest rates this year, the yen has remained much stronger against the dollar in recent weeks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/business/economic-scene-slowing-down-wall-street.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Passell", "pub_date": "1989-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 757, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; Slowing Down Wall Street", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Slowing Down Wall Street", "body_text": " **********DOES Wall Street do its job too well? **********Drilled in the catechism of efficiency during their impressionable years, economists find it difficult to imagine a market in which trading could be too easy. But not every expert takes the religion of efficiency so literally. Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist, and Victoria Summers, a Boston securities lawyer, offer an intriguing case for reducing the liquidity of securities markets. **********Computerized trading and the deregulation of brokerage commissions, they argue, have probably increased price volatility and reduced investors' interest in corporations' long-term performance. The clock can't be turned back on technology or regulation. But Uncle Sam could tax every securities turnover, discouraging speculation and giving insitutional investors a greater incentive to hold securities for the long haul. **********Brokers, whose incomes depend on volume, are unlikely to see the merit in the Summers case. Their interests, however, may not prove decisive: the Summers proposal for a half-percent tax on every securities transaction could raise $12 billion annually for revenue-starved Washington. **********The idea of an anti-speculation tax isn't new. Warren Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway and, arguably, the most successful securities investor in America, favors a confiscatory 100 percent tax on short-term capital gains. Even John Maynard Keynes was worried enough about ''the predominance of speculation over enterprise'' to call for a stock transfer tax. **********What is new in the Summers paper, presented last week at an Annenberg-Northwestern University conference in Washington, is a tightly reasoned attack on the assumed linkage between efficiency and low transaction costs. **********Securities markets have three main jobs: raising capital, pricing securities according to their prospects and giving investors flexibility to adjust the risk/return dimensions of their portfolios. Today's markets manage the last of the three exceptionally well. There's no evidence, though, that the markets are very efficient at jobs one and two. **********Spending on services from member firms on the New York Stock Exchange totaled $53 billion in 1987 - 12 cents for every dollar of gross capital formation. In the process of trading trillions in securities, prices do change. But it is far from clear that the sixtyfold increase in turnover since 1960 has improved the market's ability to track fundamental value. Indeed, the Summers have amassed mounds of evidence to the contrary. **********Studies all suggesting that stock prices have a substantial - and possibly growing - random element aren't conclusive. As Princeton's Sanford Grossman points out, economists' inability to explain why prices change may say as much about the state of econometrics as the rationality of the market. But it does shift the burden of proof. **********Securities investing is almost a zero-sum game: The gains by winning stockpickers are offset by the losses of the losers. If the billions spent to churn portfolios each year don't greatly improve the efficiency of capital allocation in the process, it is hard to see how society benefits. **********A tax of one-half a percent of the value, the Summers say, would reduce volume. However, if the tax were levied against all American institutions and residents, it wouldn't be likely to drive trading overseas. Nor would it would stop investors from buying securities that seem undervalued. **********Such arguments won't fly on Wall Street. According to Louis Margolis, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, none of the major financial houses make a profit on their brokerage businesses. But that doesn't mean the houses would absorb a turnover tax without a squawk: Any reduction in turnover would leave them with overstaffed research departments and account executives unable to meet their mortgage payments. **********In any event, the real constituency for the turnover tax is Capitol Hill, not Wall Street. Since the October 1987 crash, legislators have been searching for a fix to stock volatility that doesn't open them to charges of overregulation. A tax that only affects go-go investors and their brokers would certainly fit the description. **********Probably more important, Washington is hungry for a revenue source that can be rationalized as something other than a tax. Hardly anyone expects a budget deal this year that includes taxes. But by next year, all the easy ways to comply with the deficit-reduction law will be exhausted. A market-stabilizing fee on stock transactions already has the support of House Speaker Jim Wright.

When the meetings ended, I was left with the impression that no further writedowns would be forthcoming for Latin America's debtor countries unless they followed the lead of Mexico. To do this, countries like Brazil and Argentina would have to sell off their public utilities, some potentially profitable industrial corporations and some service industries like airlines. **********In the past, one met mostly bankers at these big international meetings. Now there are a lot of lawyers. **********For Latin America the foreclosure process has begun, but for the time being it is called privatization or debt-for-equity swaps. Countries hoping to borrow more money from creditor-nation governments, the I.M.F. and the World Bank, are being told to help themselves by relinquishing ownership of their basic economic infrastructure. **********In advocating this brave new world of privatizing hitherto public monopolies, these local investors and their partners, the international banking and investment community, cite a number of truisms. **********Private-sector managers will run enterprises more efficiently, the proponents of privatization say. **********This argument has merit, as far as it goes. But it should be remembered that the troubled savings and loan institutions in Texas were all privately run businesses. **********But more important, in the United States and Europe there exists a balance between private profitability and the public's need for popularly priced power, transport and other services. This balance is insured by public regulatory agencies and is backed by antitrust legislation. **********But few Latin American or other third world economies have ever had to develop these regulatory traditions because their governments have owned the major public utilities and other monopolies. The fact that private ownership of these enterprises will be a new experience for these countries means that it may not have the same salutary consequences as in the United States. **********Proponents of privatization say that a sell-off of utilities will reduce government budget deficits. They argue that privatization will turn government-owned businesses, which are often fiscal drains on a country, into private tax-paying entities. As a result, lower federal deficits may help slow the endemic inflations that plague most debtor economies. **********But for the population at large, shifting the economic burden away from government (and hence the taxpayers) may turn out to be largely illusory. For what the government saves in subsidies may be paid by users of these utilities in the form of higher power, phone and transport rates charged by the new proprietors. **********Fortunately, there are alternatives to the above scenarios. The most obvious one is to keep these monopolies public but restructure them as truly independent corporations by bringing in the best management possible. The alternative to badly run public enterprise is not necessarily privatization, but better administration with effective checks and balances against incompetence and malfeasance. **********A second option is to put public regulatory and antitrust legislation in place before it is too late. The objective is to hold privatizers to their promises by making them absorb the penalty for their own possible inefficiency, by enjoying lower profits rather than extorting higher rates from consumers. After all, why should third world populations deserve less than the United States in this respect? **********Whatever option is chosen, the possible outcomes are relatively clear. If the new purchasers of public utilities are foreign, it will constitute a retrogression from neocolonialism back to direct colonialism. If domestic investors buy a nation's economic infrastructure, they will achieve a higher degree of power than has been attained by investors in the United States and Europe. The upshot of this may be an unprecedented economic polarization in countries where wealthy citizens already have a strong influence on government. **********But the most likely outcome is an alliance between wealthy local families and foreign banks and other international investors. That would give the takeover process a cosmopolitan patina. **********One way or another, the debt-into-equity conversion represents a foreclosure on the mismanaged economies of the third world. But behind the rhetoric of today's privatization, one must always ask, Qui bono? Who will benefit from the prospective economic changes? In my opinion, it will be the rich and the creditor banks who benefit from these schemes. For the people in general, and for public-employee labor unions, privatization means that life may well be more expensive in the future."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/18/business/new-bank-to-emphasize-aid-to-small-borrowers.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1989-09-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Bank to Emphasize Aid to Small Borrowers", "print_headline": "New Bank to Emphasize Aid to Small Borrowers", "body_text": " **********When Lyndon B.

Spent $500,000 **********To bring private capital and disciplined business attitudes to Community Capital, Mr. Comstock has spent $500,000 and more than three years studying the new bank's market niche and uncovering promises of financial support from other banks, labor unions, religious orders and citizens.

The law, which Federal officials have begun interpreting more stringently, encourages banks to meet credit needs of local communities, but does not set strict lending guidelines. **********Since Morgan is a wholesale bank and does not make small loans or operate a neighborhood branch system, Ms. Simmons said, the investment with Community Capital ''is a way for us to support community lending for which we would not otherwise have the capacity.'' **********Mr. Comstock said, ''Our objective is not to absolve other banks of their community responsibilities, but cooperation makes sense in cases where they have the capital and we have the special lending expertise.''

This neighborhood had been discovered nearly a decade ago by trail-blazing advertising agencies, designers, architects and small publishers in search of cheap rents and large spaces. **********Now the newcomers are giving the avenue from 14th to 23d Street a chic character. **********They range from the Gap, the ubiquitous sportswear company, which opened a branch this month at 118 Fifth Avenue at 17th Street, to Giorgio Armani, the Italian designer of fashionable men's and women's clothing, who opened his first Emporio Armani boutique in the United States yesterday at 110 Fifth Avenue at 16th Street. **********Next month Cignal, a clothing boutique that is part of a Baltimore-based chain, expects to open its second New York shop, at 79 Fifth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets. The first one opened last year in the World Financial Center. **********Matsuda of Tokyo recently signed a lease for space between 20th and 21st Streets. And other fashion retailers, among them Ann Taylor, are said to be searching for sites on the street. **********This new wave of clothiers is bringing to the area the sort of name-brand power that could turn lower Fifth Avenue into a destination shopping district in the way that Barney's has drawn shoppers to Seventh Avenue in Chelsea. **********''These new fashion boutiques are not the very first high-end retailers on the street,'' said Benjamin Fox, a broker with New Spectrum, a real estate brokerage concern. He noted the presence of Dot Zero at 22d Street, known for highly styled office and home furnishings, and Paul Smith, a British haberdasher, which opened at 16th Street in 1987. **********''But when the Williwear boutique opened and word of the Armani deal hit the streets, it was like a dam breaking,'' Mr. Fox said. ''Now there are more retailers looking than there are good locations for them to take.'' **********One reason retailers are flocking to the area, brokers say, is that the customer base is much broader than it was a few years ago. **********''The potential customer is not just in the office buildings on Fifth Avenue,'' Mr. Fox said. ''When you talk about the customer base, you're also talking about the changes on Broadway and Park Avenue South and the influx of new residents to places like Zeckendorf Towers on Union Square. And because so many well-known clubs and restaurants are in the area, people know the neighborhood.'' **********The relatively cheap rents and favorable demographics have not been the avenue's only drawing cards. The 19th-century commercial buildings in the area - known as the Flatiron District after the triangular-shaped landmark Flatiron Building at Fifth Avenue and 23d Street - offer generous spaces, high ceilings and the sort of architectural detail not found in buildings on streets like Columbus Avenue. **********The new Emperio Armani, for example, is in a 9,600-square-foot space that has 17-foot ceilings and arched, wood-framed windows and doors. **********Not surprisingly, the rush for space on lower Fifth Avenue has increased rents. Brokers say the cost of space in the best sites, from 15th to 20th streets, has more than doubled in the last 18 months from about $20 to $25 a foot to a range of $45 to $60 a foot. **********Even with that level of inflation, the price of admission to lower Fifth Avenue is far less than for other retail hot spots like Columbus Avenue. Retail rents there start at about $125 a square foot and rise to whatever the traffic will bear. **********Jeff Mason, the national leasing manager for Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, the corporate parent of the Cignal boutique chain, said the company's Fifth Avenue site offered not only the best price but also the most potential. **********''There were only a couple of areas where we wanted to be,'' Mr. Mason said. ''We could have gone to a more expensive neighborhood, like somewhere on 57th Street, but we are not in Manhattan as a promotional tool. We want to make a profit there.'' **********One factor that helped the company hold down costs, Mr. Mason said, was the configuration of its space on two levels. The design for the new store calls for a staircase to link the 2,000 square feet of space at street level to 3,800 square feet of selling space below grade. That much space, if all at street level, would have cost much more. **********Gene Meer, senior vice president of Huberth & Peters Inc., who was the broker in the Armani deal, warned that fast-rising rents could threaten the avenue's potential. **********''I would say that rents are at the right level now,'' he said. ''But if prices rise too fast, there is a chance that history will repeat itself and the market will give out the way it did for a time on Columbus Avenue and in SoHo last year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/28/world/kremlin-s-mideast-sprint-diplomats-see-gains-outweighing-setbacks-wide-ranging.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1989-02-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 846, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kremlin's Mideast Sprint; Diplomats See Gains Outweighing Setbacks On Wide-Ranging Tour by Shevardnadze", "print_headline": "Kremlin's Mideast Sprint; Diplomats See Gains Outweighing Setbacks On Wide-Ranging Tour by Shevardnadze", "body_text": " **********In a 10-day Soviet diplomatic swing through the Middle East and the Persian Gulf, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze displayed a broad diplomatic reach that extended to both Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, to both Iraq and Iran. **********From the wider perspective of the lumbering phenomenon that diplomats call the peace process, an Egyptian analyst said, Mr. Shevardnadze may have produced no more than ''atmospherics.'' **********But Arab and Western diplomats said he had staked out a Soviet position in that nebulous process by fostering Arab unity in areas where the influence of Washington is offset by its allegiance to Israel and its reluctance to offer the P.L.O. more than a tentative hearing. Mr. Shevardnadze's contacts extended beyond those that Washington is able or willing to undertake. **********As Mr. Shevardnadze wound up his trip in Iran today, the diplomats said successes had outweighed setbacks in a tour that sought to redeem Moscow among Muslims from the stigma of its military presence in Afghanistan, which ended this month. **********The failure related primarily to the inability of Soviet diplomacy to bring about a reconciliation between Syria, Moscow's principal Arab ally, and the P.L.O. Officials of the P.L.O. said Soviet diplomats had sought unsuccessfully to persuade President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to meet in Damascus with Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, to seal a reconciliation. Successes Are Listed **********Diplomats said Mr. Shevardnadze's successes - wrought by a combination of timing, planning and the windfalls in an unpredictable region - were these: *********** Mr. Shevardnadze established the Soviet Union as a dynamic player in a region where diplomacy has been dominated by the United States since President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt expelled Soviet military advisers in 1972. *********** He showed Moscow to be active when Washington seemed uninspired by new thinking in the early days of a new Administration, and thus appeared to take the high ground in calling for superpower cooperation to end the region's conflicts. *********** He seized the moment of the West's latest crisis with Teheran over the British author Salman Rushdie to open new doors for Moscow in Iran, where East and West have long competed for strategic influence. **********Mr. Shevardnadze displayed a wide reach, meeting in Cairo with both the Israeli Foreign Minister, Moshe Arens, and Mr. Arafat, and paying separate visits to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. **********During Mr. Shevardnadze's tour, a Western diplomat said, ''he told a lot of people what they wanted to hear and what they knew they would hear'' -for example, that the Soviet Union supported the Arab call for an international Middle East peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council. **********Israel opposes the idea, saying it favors direct negotiations with its Arab adversaries, excluding the P.L.O. **********The Soviet message won support in Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq - the four Arab countries Mr. Shevardnadze visited before flying on to Iran. **********His effort to effect a reconciliation between President Assad and the P.L.O. collapsed, P.L.O. officials say, when Mr. Assad declined to extend an official invitation to Mr. Arafat to visit Damascus. The two men have been bitterly estranged since 1983. **********Without publicizing the setback, Mr. Shevardnadze flew on to Amman and Cairo, where he delivered what Soviet diplomats depicted as the keynote speech of his tour, urging the United States to join in cooperative regional diplomacy and promoting the idea of an international peace conference. **********At the same time, he set out the Soviet terms for re-establishing diplomatic ties with Israel, broken during the 1967 Middle East war. These were the establishment of a dialogue with the P.L.O. and acceptance of the idea of an international Middle East conference - both anathema to Israel's conservative Likud leaders. #2 Mixed-Up Jigsaw Puzzles That left the Middle East in the familiar position, resembling two mixed-up jigsaw puzzles with neither interlocking: The Soviets, now, are talking to the Israelis, sort of, and the Americans are talking to the P.L.O., sort of, but neither Arabs nor Israel nor either superpower agrees on the picture they are trying to build, beyond avowals that it be peaceful. **********Mr. Shevardnadze garnered his greatest windfall in Teheran after a visit to Baghdad, where he expressed Soviet desires for peace in the Persian Gulf. In a meeting with Ayatollah Khomeini, the Teheran radio reported, the Soviet official was told that Islamic Iran, long hostile to what Teheran has depicted as godless Communism, sought stronger ties with Moscow. **********The avowal was ascribed by Western diplomats to Teheran's newest crisis with the West over the Ayatollah's call for the assassiniation of Mr. Rushdie, whose novel ''The Satanic Verses'' many Muslims hold to be heretical."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/world/tigre-separatists-in-ethiopia-say-they-have-taken-a-town.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tigre Separatists in Ethiopia Say They Have Taken a Town", "print_headline": "Tigre Separatists in Ethiopia Say They Have Taken a Town", "body_text": " **********Ethiopian rebels say they have captured a small town 85 miles north of the capital of Addis Ababa and halted a Government counterattack. **********In a broadcast monitored in Nairobi late Friday, the Tigre People's Liberation Front said the town of Meranya fell to its fighters on Thursday. **********The claim could not be independently verified.

Reactors using uranium produce plutonium, a bomb fuel, as a byproduct. **********Plutonium is also used to start new atomic reactors, and Dr. Srinivasan, the nuclear official, has said that critics who say that India is diverting the material to a nuclear arms program overlook this point. In an interview last year, he said that 50 kilograms of plutonium were used in 1985 to start up a new ''fast breeder'' test reactor that uses raw material available in India. **********Although most of India's nuclear plants are not open to international inspection, New Delhi has denied having a secret weapons program. Its capability of building a nuclear weapons system was shown, however, when it exploded what it called a peaceful nuclear device in 1974. **********Norway said a West German company, Rohstoff Einfuhr, bought 15.18 tons of heavy water from Norway in 1983, flew it to Basel in Switzerland by West African Airlines. Then, with the addition of six tons of Soviet heavy water, it was flown to Dubai and India. The consignment landed in Bombay, the Norwegians said, about Dec. 7, 1983. **********The Chief Public Prosecutor for Oslo, Anstein Gjengedal, who is leading the investigation of the shipment, said in a telephone interview that he did not know whether the destination was an Indian Government department. **********''All I have is an address in Bombay, not a name, and we have found this address on a freight document written in West Germany and we still do not know if this is the end user,'' he said. **********Mr. Gjengedal said the address on the freight consignment document listed the Directorate of Purchase and Stores at Palton Road in Bombay as the consignee. He quoted a West German national who reportedly accompanied the flight to India as saying that the consignment was ''handed over to this address.'' **********A visit to the address given by the Norwegians showed that the department had moved. A security official at the Directorate's office said the office was moved ''three or four years ago.''

The Poles grumbled a bit but took Mr. Bush's pronouncements and obvious good will as vouchers of more important support to come -from Mr. Bush's summit partners, the World Bank and other international agencies. They are also hoping for more investment from foreign businesses. **********In Hungary, speaking at the Karl Marx University of Economic Science, where Marx's ''Das Kapital'' is no longer required reading, Mr. Bush pledged to open American markets to Hungarian goods and send the first Peace Corps volunteers to a Communist country. The Peace Corps there would teach English, which Mr. Bush called one of the most popular American exports, very useful for making international business deals. **********Mr. Bush's symbolism was carefully chosen to encourage expectations that the real benefits to the Communist countries would come from a closer relationship with Western business and technology, and from the economic and political reform of their own systems. But he carefully avoided creating the impression that he was trying to lure them back to capitalism. **********Both the Polish and Hungarian leaders, as well as their critics in the universities and trade unions, seem to realize, as Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, told David Rockefeller and Peter G. Peterson at a dinner in Warsaw earlier this year, ''Communism is kaput.'' But what is to take its place remains a mystery that the politicians and economists are desperately trying to solve, whether it fits Communist ideology or not. A top Hungarian official told Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Peterson: ''I've spent half a lifetime inventing ideology. It is time to confront reality.'' **********Mr. Peterson observed: ''Sometimes an unusual metaphor helps out in the almost metaphysical discussions we listened to. Prime Minister Rykowski, an authentic intellectual, was going on quite eloquently about the profound virtues of market-oriented economies and democratization, while in a very capitalistic dark blue suit, white shirt and dark tie.'' But the Americans noticed that the Polish leader's ''largely hidden socks were bright red.'' **********The Communist Party leaders of Poland and Hungary are determined to hang onto the term ''socialism'' for their system, but are willing to effect a grand compromise with their opponents by calling it ''democratic neo-socialism.'' Neo-socialism in the Communist world is now taking its place beside the past decade's capitalist neologisms: ''neo-conservatism'' and ''neo-liberalism.'' **********None of the three terms has a crystal-clear meaning. Neo-conservatism represented a disaffection on the part of some former socialist intellectuals, and some conservative politicians, with the failures of the welfare state. Neo-liberalism represented a departure of some liberal politicians, worried about inflation and sluggish growth, from overreliance on government to solve social problems or spur economic growth. **********But what the three ''neos'' have in common is an enhanced respect for the virtues of the free market and business enterprise. And this is the ace in Mr. Bush's hand as he seeks to build bridges with Eastern Europe and, most important, with the Soviet Union. **********His overtures to the leaders, intellectuals and laboring people of Poland and Hungary were couched in terms that would not alarm the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, that he was trying to draw the Communist (''neo-socialist'') states away from Mr. Gorbachev and back to the capitalist West. Mr. Gorbachev has reportedly told the Communist leaders in Eastern Europe, ''You can do what you like, as long as you don't slap my face.'' **********They are trying, with Mr. Bush's help, to avoid doing so. The economic model they are searching for is what they consider the true system of the Western democracies: a ''mixed economy,'' with both capitalist and socialist elements. **********And they are counting on Mr. Gorbachev to help them get through, partly by keeping his pledge not to intervene militarily in their countries, partly by cuts in military forces that will ease the economic burdens on both East and West. **********The most serious problem facing the Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union, endangering their democratic reforms, is their poor economic performance. This stems from their enormous budget deficits, repressed inflation and the inefficiency of their enterprises. These cannot be cured without bringing down military outlays, introducing a free price system, achieving a convertible currency and reducing the economic role of party hacks and bureaucrats."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/12/business/company-news-prime-files-motion-against-mai-basic.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prime Files Motion Against MAI Basic", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Prime Files Motion Against MAI Basic", "body_text": " **********Prime Computer Inc., which is facing a hostile $1.3 billion bid from MAI Basic Four Inc., filed a court motion contending that MAI Basic violated Federal Reserve Board margin requirements in arranging financing on its $20-a-share tender offer. **********Prime, a maker of minicomputers in Natick, Mass., said in its motion filed in Federal court in Massachusetts on Tuesday that MAI Basic's financing included borrowed funds totaling more than 50 percent of the value of Prime's outstanding stock, which it said violated the Fed's margin requirements.

Now, says Dean LeBaron, it is time for them to start buying farmland. **********The idea of buying farmland when American farmers still bitterly remember the crash in farm values in this decade, and the bankruptcies that resulted, is typical of Mr. LeBaron, a money manager who has often marched to a different drummer in the 20 years he has run Batterymarch Financial Management. **********Sometimes that drummer has produced outstanding results for Batterymarch, as it did last year, when the company made a lot of money investing in equities in Brazil, an area Mr. LeBaron still sees as cheap. In other years, when the Wall Street consensus has been closer to accurate, Batterymarch accounts have trailed dramatically in the performance sweepstakes. On average, the company has done better than the market, reporting a compounded annual gain of 14.1 percent since 1970, compared with 10.5 percent for Standard & Poor's 500. **********Batterymarch will announce today that it has acquired Agrivest, a Connecticut-based manager of farmland. That company, spun off from the Connecticut Mutual Insurance Company, still mostly manages the insurer's portfolio of farmland. ''It's been very difficult to get pension managers interested'' in farmland, said James McCandless, an executive vice president of Agrivest. **********''Here is this vast real estate component which is almost entirely unrepresented in American pension portfolios,'' Mr. LeBaron said. ''Similarly, there is a desire on the part of overseas investors to put money in the United States, and invest in the dollar sector for the long term, but there are concerns about the day-to-day volatility of the U.S. stock market.'' **********Mr. LeBaron said he thinks farmland represents a much better investment than office buildings, whose prices ''have been bid up to pretty high levels by pension funds and Japanese buyers.'' **********He said he thinks farm prices nationally bottomed about 18 months ago. ''Although we had a fairly well advertised drought last year, farm appraisals and farm rents seemed curiously unaffected,'' Mr. LeBaron said. **********If pension funds were to become major buyers of farmland, it would reflect a revolution in the farm economy, where the family farmer has long expected to own his own land, and the idea of a farm landlord, as Mr. LeBaron noted, brings the image of a man with ''a big mustache'' demanding payments from an impoverished sharecropper. **********Mr. LeBaron believes the crash in farm prices changed attitudes and ''made outside ownership of land a very satisfactory alternative for many farm communities.'' **********At the moment, Mr. McCandless said, an institutional investor buying farmland can expect to make 5 percent to 8 percent a year in rent, with the hope of additional profits from appreciation in the land value. While variations were great among regions, he said that national averages indicated that farmland prices rose 2.5 percent in 1987 and 5.8 percent last year, after falling for five years. **********Another selling pitch for the pension funds will be that historically farm prices have done well when stock and bond markets did poorly, Mr. LeBaron said. ''We think this will help funds obtain diversification.''  France Fund Opening Up **********Another closed-end fund, the France Fund, is opening up. **********That move, announced yesterday, provided welcome news for shareholders in the fund, who will be able to redeem shares at net asset value rather than sell them at the substantial discounts to net asset value that had prevailed. France Fund shares rose $1, to $10.625, in New York Stock Exchange trading. Net asset value, calculated weekly, was $11.63 last Friday. **********For the holders, there may also have been a big sigh of relief that the company that controlled 40 percent of the fund, the V.B.I. Corporation, had agreed to the plan to open the fund. The fund said V.B.I. planned to redeem its shares. **********V.B.I. is controlled by Martin Vik, a Norwegian investor who lives in Monaco. Mr. Vik previously took control of the Scandinavian Fund, which is being converted into an operating company, the Scandinavia Company, rather than being open-ended. Shares of that company dropped in price after V.B.I. took control. **********Closed-end funds are mutual funds that trade on stock exchanges, at prices usually lower than the net asset value of the shares. Before its rise yesterday, France Fund was trading at a 17 percent discount. Open-end funds are also mutual funds, but they stand ready to sell new shares, or buy back old ones, at prices based on net asset value. **********With V.B.I. about to make a profit on its investment in France Fund, for which it paid about $10.63 a share, there was speculation that a group that includes some of the same investors would increase its 20 percent stake in the Italy Fund, which rose 37.5 cents, to $8.25.

The Pentagon opposed the stricter curbs. **********A White House official said after the meeting, ''The tendency is to tighten up on assurances from the Japanese,'' indicating that the Commerce Department's stance had prevailed. Announcement Seen Thursday **********Mr. Bush's formal decision might be announced on Thursday, the White House officials said. **********The Commerce Department has been seeking stronger restrictions on transferring technology, saying it feared the long-term effect of competition from abroad. **********The Pentagon officials feel that the Japanese plan for the fighter strengthens security and political ties between Japan and the United States, and they have said that concerns over trade should not determine military policies. **********Congress has been watching the intra-Cabinet dispute closely. Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Repubican on the Senate's trade subcommittee, today introduced legislation that would give the Commerce Department a formal role in all agreements to transfer military technology. 'Just Fair Treatment' **********Before today's meeting, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher was asked what he wanted. He told a small gathering of reporters, ''Just fair treatment.'' **********The Pentagon has suffered in the debate from not having a chief. The Senate last week rejected Mr. Bush's candidate, John G. Tower, and the new nominee, Representative Dick Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, has not yet been confirmed. Mr. Cheney has said he supports the Pentagon's position. **********Japan has said it needs the technology to meet its goal of becoming a competitor in civil aviation by the turn of the century. **********Military aircraft technology is not easily transferred to civilian uses, but many experts believe that what is learned from avionics integration, team assembly and other processes could become the nucleus for a civilian industry. Countries with the strongest civil aviation presence today are generally those with the strongest military base, the experts point out. Other Instances Cited **********But the Commerce officials have said they fear a repeat of the situation that occurred with computer memory chips, videocassette recorders, television and radio, as well as in other industrial sectors. In those products, Japan enjoys a trade surplus of at least $50 billion with the United States. **********The Pentagon, which negotiated the F-16 co-production agreement last year after Japan had initially indicated that it wanted to build an advanced fighter on its own, has resisted altering the agreement. **********While the Treasury and Office of the United States Trade Representative backed the Commerce Department, the State Department allied itself with the Pentagon. **********A White House official said Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, was working on a compromise to retain the Pentagon-negotiated agreement but to ''satisfy Commerce concerns.'' $1.2 Billion Accord The $1.2 billion development agreement calls for the General Dynamics Corporation, which makes the F-16, primarily in Texas, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan to cooperate in developing the FSX tactical fighter, essentially a new airplane based on the F-16 design. **********The Commerce Department has been concerned about information about General Dynamics' aerodynamics and systems integration technology leaking out and the shares of work that would be apportioned to the American and Japanese companies in a future co-production agreement. **********In addition, it has complained about releasing the software source codes, which provide access to the computer in which information is filed about the plane. **********Despite the concessions to the Commerce Department, Congress can still block the transaction, but it would need a two-thirds majority of both houses to head off a likely veto. **********If the President's decision is announced on Thursday, as White House officials were saying today, the Administration is expected to brief influential lawmakers to ease Congressional concerns over the deal. Role in Future Agreements **********The Commerce Department has also sought a primary role in approving such military co-production accords in the future and in overseeing technology transfers in the current deal. The sharp confrontation over the FSX has reflected years of pent-up frustration by the economic agencies, which see the Pentagon-negotiated co-production and offset agreements, which provide American-based military hardware to foreign nations, as undermining this country's industrial base. **********Because of the FSX debate, most analysts have agreed, all such future accords will come under much closer scrutiny. **********On Capitol Hill, where the debate has been monitored closely, legislation that would mandate a special role for the Commerce Department in sharing advanced military technology was introduced today in both Houses. **********''We must assure that those in our Government with expertise in maintaining a forceful and aggressive industrial position for the U.S. be consulted,'' said Senator Danforth, the Missouri Republican who is the bill's chief sponsor. **********Under the legislation, the Commerce Secretary would be consulted and would make suggestions to the President where necessary in future Defense Department co-production accords. The Secretary could also advise that existing agreements be renegotiated. **********Asked whether he would support legislation that enhanced the powers of his department, Mr. Mosbacher told reporters, ''We're taking a neutral position on that.'' No Comment From Embassy **********The Japanese Embassy here had no immediate comment. The Japanese Government has taken the position that it will not renegotiate the basic agreement reached with the Pentagon last year. **********But Japanese officials have left open the possibility, which has been raised by the Commerce Department's officials, that ''refinements'' of the accord could be appended to agreements between General Dynamics and Mitsubishi. **********The Japanese officials say that what they want above all is definitive word that the project will proceed. Many of the Japanese, as well as the American, officials cautioned that if the United States backed out, its international credibility would experience a major blow. **********Japan hopes to have its new fighter in the air by 1997."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/13/business/the-media-business-advertising-family-media-rates.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Family Media Rates", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Family Media Rates", "body_text": " **********Family Media Inc. announced a series of magazine advertising rate increases last week.

McDonald's, Wendy's and Domino's Pizza are also conducting test marketings with various credit card companies, and Burger King is studying the idea. **********''The trend is inevitable,'' said Michael Goldstein, a financial analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, a New York investment research firm. ''It's toward more broadly based acceptance of credit cards. Fast food is one of the biggest unpenetrated segments available to the credit card business. Today, there's virtually no penetration whatsoever.'' **********During the last two decades, the fast-food industry has played an increasing role in American eating habits, generating roughly $65 billion a year in sales. But virtually none of those sales have been transacted with plastic because the time it takes to complete the sale - and verify the customer's credit - slows the delivery of food. **********The credit card companies, for their part, have shown little enthusiasm for seeking fast-food business. The relatively small size of transactions was not enough to cover the high cost of processing them. **********But recent advances in computers and in data transmission technology, as well as shifts in American eating and spending patterns, have combined to make the use of credit cards in fast-food restaurants look like a profitable proposition to both the fast-food industry and the credit card industry, which have been seeking ways to expand. **********Previously, it could take more than a minute to complete the steps in a credit card purchase: using a telephone for credit verification, getting a customer's signature, address and telephone number, and wrestling with the customer over who gets the carbons. **********The centerpiece of all the test marketing is a device that comes in several forms that radically shortens that time. **********In the Arby's test markets, Visa has installed a device that receives fresh data daily, through a Public Broadcasting System television transmission, about stolen and overdrawn cards. A division of PBS sells a portion of its broadcasting spectrum for data transmission. When the cashier slides the credit card through the verifying device, authorization or rejection of the card is almost instantaneous. The device also logs the specifics of the transaction and, for those who request it, issues a receipt. There is nothing for the customer to sign, and the process takes 2 to 10 seconds, faster than a cash transaction. 'It Will Build' **********''People are worried that if they use the credit card, they'll hold up the line,'' said Ira Hermann, Arby's chief operating officer. ''They don't realize they can do as fast with plastic as with cash. Once the customers are comfortable using it, it will build.'' **********Credit card companies generally charge merchants between 1 and 4.5 percent of each sale, depending on the volume of sales and the efficiency of the processing technology involved. Companies involved in the current test markets said that a standard fee had not yet been determined, but that a charge on the lower side of that range - 2 percent or less - was likely because of the high volume of fast-food sales and the great efficiency of the equipment being used. **********Customer acceptance of credit cards at Arby's has been good but not spectacular, the company said. In the Phoenix restaurants, the percentage of sales paid with credit cards leveled off at 2 to 3 percent. But the average purchase is larger when a customer uses a card - around $5.50, compared with $3 when cash is used. **********Daniel Brigham, a spokesman for Visa U.S.A. Inc., said those statistics are encouraging enough for Visa to continue exploring alliances with fast-food chains. It is also testing small-payment markets in movie tickets, tolls and concession stands. **********''For every point of market share we can swing our way,'' he said, ''we will move up to $1 billion through our system. Fast food and small payments are potentially a $100 billion market, with fast food being around 55 percent of that.'' A 'Major Opportunity' **********Phil Carter, vice president of merchant development for Mastercard, said his company also viewed fast food as a ''major opportunity,'' and was planning to open test markets with a fast-food chain in the next six months. **********American Express, which is operating a test market of its credit card at a Domino's Pizza outlet on Maiden Lane in lower Manhattan, faces a marketing as well as a logistical challenge as it explores the use of its cards in fast-food outlets. **********''They are carefully trying to reposition the notion of prestige,'' said John Love, publisher of Credit Card Management, a trade journal. ''The trick is to maintain their cachet of prestige and upscale, while broadening their base.'' **********Lawrence Armour, an American Express spokesman, said: ''The guy who uses the card for travel on Wednesday has another life on the weekend, which might involve coaching the kids at the Little League game. And after the game the kids want to use McDonald's. It's their Lutece.'' **********Since 1970, the fast-food industry's sales have swelled tenfold, to a projected $65 billion this year, according to the National Restaurant Association. But the number of establishments has also grown, resulting in flat or declining sales for most companies. **********Yet other fast-food statistics show great promise for credit card companies. In 1955, for instance, only 25 percent of every dollar spent on food went to a restaurant. By 1986, that had grown to 41.1 percent, according to the restaurant association. **********A 1986 Gallup survey commissioned by the association showed that 25.6 percent of those in the study ate at a fast-food restaurant ''more than once a week.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/10/business/business-people-kemper-financial-picks-a-chairman-for-invest.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1989-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 416, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Kemper Financial Picks A Chairman for Invest", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Kemper Financial Picks A Chairman for Invest", "body_text": " **********The Kemper Financial Companies said yesterday that James R.

At least one police officer was wounded. **********The slaying of Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, who had become a billionaire as a leader of the Medellin cocaine smuggling cartel and was under indictment in the United States on several smuggling charges, is the most striking success in the Colombian Government's war on drug traffickers. The drug war began in August after the assassination of the country's leading presidential candidate. Bombings and Shootings **********Until now, the Government had captured hundreds of mansions, farms, ranches and fleets of cars, trucks and planes but was unable to track down any leading drug traffickers. Fear and despair engulfed the country as Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, 42 years old, and Pablo Escobar Gaviria, 39, another billionaire leader of the Medellin cartel, were said to have directed a retaliatory campaign of bombing and shooting aimed at forcing President Virgilio Barco Vargas to abandon the anti-drug war. **********Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels are said to be responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the streets of the United States. President Bush is to discuss anti-drug efforts with Mr. Barco and the Presidents of two main cocaine growing countries, Bolivia and Peru, in Cartagena in February. **********Several senior police officials announced the death of Mr. Rodriguez Gacha over Bogota radio stations, and United States officials who spoke with the police confirmed the killing. United States officials would not comment further. Trap Laid 10 Days Ago **********Although it is unclear how the authorities managed to maintain the secrecy of the operation today, senior police officials said the shootout was a result of a trap that had been laid for Mr. Rodriguez Gacha beginning about 10 days ago. **********It began with the kind of announcement that has become frustratingly routine in Colombia as the judicial system has disintegrated in the face of threats and bribes. Mr. Rodriguez Gacha's son, Freddy, who had been jailed early in the Government's offensive, was abruptly freed. **********A judge declared that there was insufficient evidence to continue holding him on a charge of weapons possession. This time, however, the person being released was being used as bait, the police said. The police stayed out of sight but on the heels of Mr. Rodriguez Gacha's son and eventually zeroed in on the drug baron in a rural area 350 miles northwest of Bogota between the towns of Tolu and Covenas. A force of about 300 soldiers and police officers closed in on Mr. Rodriguez Gacha and the others this afternoon. **********''The operation to locate Rodriguez Gacha was an intelligence operation of great care,'' said Gen. Carlos Arturo Casadiego, an assistant director of the national police. **********Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, and Mr. Escobar are suspected of ordering the bombing last month of a plane of the national airline, Avianca, that exploded in the air, killing all 107 people on board, and a car bomb attack on the federal intelligence agency in Bogota that killed more than 60 people and wounded 1,000 others. More than 120 others have died in more than 200 other bombings and shootings. **********As the casualties mounted, Colombians increasingly called on Mr. Barco to negotiate a truce with Mr. Rodriguez Gacha and the other drug barons. Mr. Barco refused to end his pursuit of the traffickers and has become increasingly isolated. Referendum Attempt Defeated **********Only this week Mr. Barco narrowly defeated an attempt by Congress, which is dominated by his own Liberal Party, to conduct a national referendum on the drug war. Some political leaders have begun calling for Mr. Barco's resignation. Moreover, some political leaders and foreign diplomats have been concerned that the narcotics violence could force the postponement of presidential elections scheduled for next May. **********The Government had offered a reward of $625,000 for the capture of either Mr. Rodriguez Gacha or Mr. Escobar, and in recent weeks its drug war essentially turned into a hunt for the two traffickers. **********Attempts to capture Mr. Rodriguez Gacha and Mr. Escobar had been repeatedly frustrated. Several times, squadrons of helicopters swooped in on hiding places moments after the drug barons had fled, leaving behind brewing coffee, cigarettes still burning and tables laden with warm food. **********In one case, a pair of helicopters owned by Mr. Rodriguez Gacha suddenly popped through a jungle clearing and skimmed away at treetop level as the police were landing. Another time, a fleet of four-wheel-drive bush vehicles scattered like flushed quail. **********The security forces had been stymied, United States and Colombian officials said, because paid informants in the police and army had been tipping off Mr. Rodriguez Gacha and Mr. Escobar as the Government mounted raids. Informants in Control Towers **********''All levels of the military and the police are riddled with informants,'' a United States official said. Furthermore, he said, ''the vast majority, if not all, aircraft control towers in the country have informants in them.'' **********''When a military or police aircraft takes off,'' the official said, ''these guys get a phone call.'' **********Despite the violence with which he was associated, Mr. Rodriguez Gacha, whose education ended at grade school and who worked as a pig farmer before becoming a smuggler, and Mr. Escobar had become something of folk heroes as they managed to elude the authorities. But attitudes toward them turned bitter after the bombing of the airliner and the intelligence headquarters. **********The two men financed small armies that operated out of the broad Magdalena River valley north of Bogota, protecting their drug operations and the outwardly legitimate ranches and farms that they ran against leftist guerrillas, who sometimes tried to extract taxes from the traffickers. They also hired squads of assassins. **********Together, the two men were believed to have been responsible for hundreds of killings over the last decade, including the assassinations of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla; Guillermo Cano, the editor of the Bogota daily newspaper El Espectador, and most recently the leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan. **********Mr. Barco's Government said the two men were secretly providing money to start a new political party. Candidates backed by Mr. Rodriguez Gacha had recently been elected mayor in five towns in the Magdalena valley. 'A Real Threat' **********''These men are a real threat to Colombian democracy,'' a senior Government official said the other day in Bogota. **********Mr. Rodriguez Gacha and Mr. Escobar employed thousands of Colombians in the cocaine business and lavished millions on community improvement projects. Mr. Rodriguez Gacha provided electric lights, running water, bus service and a bullfighting ring in his hometown of Pacho, about 40 miles northwest of Bogota. **********Mr. Rodriguez Gacha also displayed a taste for the macabre. He installed a gallows with a dangling hangman's noose on the lawn of one of his ranch houses and etched his initials on bullets he loaded in a silver automatic pistol. **********In Washington tonight, William J. Bennett, director of the Government's federal drug policy, said the United States was not directly involved in the operation against Mr. Rodriguez Gacha.

Defeat Conceded in Broadcast **********In a dramatic broadcast on national television Tuesday night, the president of the PRI said returns from the election in the state of Baja California Norte indicated that Ernesto Ruffo Appel of the right-wing National Action Party, or PAN, had won a decisive victory. That concession was echoed shortly afterward by the PRI's candidate for governor, Senator Margarita Ortega Villa. **********''We must recognize that the tendency of the results in the governor's race favors the candidate of the National Action Party,'' said Senator Luis Donaldo Colosio, president of the national executive committee of the PRI. **********''The Institutional Revolutionary Party is a party that has a serious commitment to the democratic modernization of Mexico. It is a modern party disposed to recognize its defeats and not yield in defense of its victories.'' Vote Fraud Charged **********Mr. Colosio also said the PRI had won a majority in the state of Michoacan, where 18 seats in the state legislature are at stake. But the leftist-nationalist Democratic Revolutionary Party, founded this year by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, asserts that it won all but three seats there and accuses the PRI of planning vote fraud ''as it has always done in the past when defeat looms.'' **********The PRI's recognition of its defeat in Baja California is likely to fortify demands by Mr. Cardenas's party that its claims to victory in Michoacan, where Mr. Salinas and the PRI were routed in the presidential election last year, be recognized. Army and police units have been deployed on highways and at town squares and electoral commission offices throughout that state since last week in anticipation of just such a post-election political confrontation. **********The unexpected PRI announcement came after three days of conflicting electoral results and growing political tension in Baja California, which borders California and includes the fast-growing cities of Tijuana and Mexicali. **********On Monday, citing incomplete and unofficial returns, both the PAN and the PRI claimed to be ahead in the Baja California vote count, each by a margin of about 50,000 votes. A Threat to Block Border **********Warning that a vote fraud was under way, PAN leaders had vowed even before the vote to ''block the border from Tijuana to Ojinaga,'' across from Presidio, Tex., if Mr. Ruffo's victory was not officially recognized. They also said they would follow Mr. Salinas during state visits to Colombia, Venezuela, France and Spain from July 8 to 15 to prevent him from presenting himself as ''the shining knight of democracy.'' **********The confusion in Baja California led most Mexican politicians and political analysts to conclude that some important PRI leaders in the state were unwilling to recognize Mr. Ruffo's victory and that Mr. Salinas would have to intervene personally to guarantee it. **********''The final judgment will be made not in an overheated Mexicali but in the commodious offices of Mexico City,'' Jose Agustin Ortiz Pinchetti wrote in the Mexico City daily La Jornada on Tuesday. **********On Tuesday night Miss Ortega, a 38-year-old sociologist who was Mr. Salinas's own choice, said a visit to Tijuana during the day had given her ''a broader vision'' of the way the results were going. New information, she said, had led her to conclude that ''the tendency of the vote is not favorable to me.'' **********As Miss Ortega's defeat became apparent, a former state president of the PRI, Jesus Ruiz Barranza, complained of what he described as ''the people from the capital who have come here to intrigue and to divide us.'' The party's national leadership, he said, ''has proved that shunting aside the true revolutionaries of the PRI doesn't work and that handing the PRI over to political managers doesn't work.'' **********A senior Government official said this afternoon: ''Probably there is going to be a reaction of the very old guard, the pre-dinosaurs. They are going to say, 'If I had been there, this would not have happened, because I am very good at fixing elections.' '' **********In a speech to supporters in the resort town of Ensenada, where he was elected Mayor in 1986, Mr. Ruffo described the PRI action as ''a landmark'' that ''will help Mexicans to have faith in ourselves, our laws and our work.'' But Mr. Ruffo, a 37-year-old accountant and fishing company executive born in San Diego and raised in Ensenada, also said his party would continue to fight for the mayoral seats and the majority in the state legislature that he said the PRI was still illegitimately withholding. **********In theory, the governor of a Mexican state has extensive powers and administrative autonomy. But as a result of the system of one-party rule that has prevailed here since 1929, governors have almost always been subservient to the President, who sometimes invoked party discipline to remove them at will."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/30/world/2-cocaine-figures-in-colombia-seek-a-deal-on-amnesty.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1989-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1072, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 COCAINE FIGURES IN COLOMBIA SEEK A DEAL ON AMNESTY", "print_headline": "2 COCAINE FIGURES IN COLOMBIA SEEK A DEAL ON AMNESTY", "body_text": " **********With a Government crackdown continuing, leaders of two of Colombia's largest cocaine rings have offered to get out of the drug trade in return for an amnesty and truce in Colombia's war on drugs. **********The offers became public today as bombs shook Colombia's two largest cities, Bogota and Medellin, increasing tension that has remained high since traffickers touched off the war by assassinating the nation's leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, 11 days ago. There were no reports of injuries in the bombings today, which occurred early in the morning. **********''No more drug trafficking, no more war, no more assassinations, no more bombs, no more arson,'' Fabio Ochoa Restrepo, the patriarch of a Medellin cocaine clan, proposed in a letter to President Virgilio Barco Vargas. ''Let's sit down and talk.'' Government's Response Last week, a second leading cocaine figure, Jose Rodriguez Gacha, called a Colombian reporter from his hiding place to make a peace offer. A reporter who listened to a tape of the telephone call said Mr. Gacha offered to give the Government all his farms and airplanes in return for his ''integration'' into society. Army troops occupy about 10 of Mr. Gacha's ranches and houses. **********It is impossible to judge the sincerity of the offers, which are reminiscent of others made in the past, or to determine whether such views were widespread among the cocaine traffickers. **********In response to the overtures from the traffickers, Communications Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds said today: ''The Government has not considered negotiating with people who have committed drug-trafficking crimes. The drastic nature of the measures taken does not justify this kind of dialogue.'' 'Let There Be Dialogue' **********Mr. Ochoa, the father of three men wanted in the United States on drug charges, warned in his letter, made public today, that Colombia's cocaine traffickers ''prefer a grave in Colombia over a jail cell in the U.S.'' **********''Doctor Barco, let there be dialogue, let there be peace, let there be amnesty,'' the elder Mr. Ochoa wrote in the letter, dated last Saturday. ''Let us not be proud. Let us not be stubborn.'' Mr. Ochoa lives on a horse farm near Medellin.

She also denied reports that she would resign.  [ Page A10. ]  In Medellin, a few hours after this morning's bombings, the city's Mayor backed Mr. Ochoa's call for peace talks. ''It is not only the position of Fabio Ochoa, it is the position of many people who believe that you have to talk to obtain peace,'' said the Mayor, Juan Gomez Martinez. Six judges resigned in Medellin today under death threats. **********A drug-financed terror group that works for the Extraditables, as the Colombian traffickers sought by the United States are known, is believed to be behind the bombings that have shaken Medellin daily since Thursday. **********But President Barco has refused to back away from his declaration of ''war,'' made against drug dealers last week. ''We cannot rest until we destroy the organizations dedicated to narcotics trafficking,'' Mr. Barco said in a message recorded on Monday for American television. In a direct appeal to American cocaine users, Mr. Barco said in English, ''Those of you who depend on cocaine have created the largest, most vicious criminal enterprise the world has known.'' History of Offers **********Colombia's cocaine dealers have a history of trying to negotiate peace with the Government. In mid-1984, after the assassination of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, a police crackdown forced several traffickers to flee to Panama. At that time, an envoy of Colombia's President, Belisario Betancur, held secret talks with leaders of the Medellin cartel. **********The fugitives offered to stop dealing drugs and to bring home enough money to offset Colombia's foreign debt, about $15 billion at the time. But when the talks became public, they caused a furor and were abandoned. **********''How much blood could have been avoided after the Panama talks,'' read a statement from a major Medellin trafficker, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, which was printed in the newspaper La Prensa on Saturday. ''We want peace. We have demanded it shouting, but we cannot beg for it.'' **********In contrast to the two other cocaine figures, Mr. Escobar did not offer to give up dealing drugs. ''No more the path of legal action,'' his statement concluded. ''Now it is with blood.'' **********President Barco also appears to believe that it will be a fight to the finish. **********''The survival of Colombia, which is one of the oldest and most stable democracies of Latin America, is now at risk,'' he said in the videotape broadcast, which was recorded for American television. **********Government raids are continuing. But Col. Eduardo Arvelo Castaneda, the Defense Ministry spokesman, said today that the police had released 60 percent of the 11,000 people arrested in the last 10 days in sweeps against suspected traffickers. Details of an Arrest **********Today the army gave details of the arrest last Friday of Abraham Majuat Hernandez at a ranch near Medellin. **********In one of the biggest seizures of the year, the raid netted a small airplane and 4.5 tons of cocaine - roughly the equivalent of 1 percent of Colombia's annual production. According to the Bogota newspaper El Espectador, Mr. Majuat offered soldiers $25,000 and information on other traffickers if they would let him go. **********Two other raids, in the port of Barranquilla, netted 8.2 tons of marijuana. **********Mr. Majuat was identified by the army as a major financial figure in the Medellin cartel. He and two others arrested in the last 10 days, Eduardo Martinez Romero and Bernardo Londono Quintero, are believed to be candidates for extradition to the United States. **********Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, director of Colombia's national security agency, asserted today that Mr. Majuat was also ''very involved'' in the killing of Mr. Galan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/22/business/business-technology-fast-curing-cement-may-help-road-builders.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "1989-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 786, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fast-Curing Cement May Help Road Builders", "print_headline": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY; Fast-Curing Cement May Help Road Builders", "body_text": " **********For more than a century, engineers have used the same basic material to construct many of the nation's roads, bridges and buildings: portland cement. When mixed with water, gravel and sand, it produces concrete, a substance as hard as stone after it dries. **********But over the years, standard portland cement has frustrated engineers because it can take up to several weeks to cure, or gain full strength, and then steadily deteriorates under wear and bad weather. **********Now two companies have begun offering new cement that cures much faster. Within four hours or so, it can support loads of 3,000 to 4,000 pounds per square inch. It takes ordinary portland cement three or four days to support such a load. **********The faster curing times could be a boon in road construction, where concrete could be poured in the middle of the night on a freeway repair job and be ready for abuse from rush-hour traffic the next morning. **********One of the companies making the new cement is Lone Star Industries Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., a major supplier of building materials. It has developed a cement that cures in about four hours and contains, it says, all of the properties that any construction engineer would require. **********Ideal Basic Industries of Denver also offers a cement with comparable strength and curing times. **********Dr. Della Roy, a professor of material science at Pennsylvania State University, said: ''The new cement is very promising because of its fast-strength gain. I saw a heavy truck drive over cement poured four hours earlier.'' **********Lone Star also contends that its new cement is more durable because it is less permeable to salt and other deicing chemicals that are spread on roads and bridges to melt snow. These chemicals cause conventional concrete to buckle and they corrode steel reinforcing bars used in concrete structures. **********Construction industry analysts also said the new cement - which they liken to an all-purpose laundry detergent that has fabric softener, bleach and stain removers in one package -would have wide applications where water and chemical erosion is a problem, as in tunnels, highways and sewer systems. **********Lone Star has named its new product Pyrament. It costs about twice as much as conventional portland cement, but analysts said it could drastically reduce labor costs because the concrete would require less maintenance and care. **********Some experts on concrete said, however, that it was too early to determine whether Lone Star's product would fully meet expectations. And industry analysts said they did not expect the new cement to account for more than 10 percent of the portland cement market, which had $5.8 billion in revenues last year. They said the reason for the low market share is that aside from the additional cost, much construction does not need the quick-curing properties. **********''The product is so new that many outside researchers have not had a chance to study it thoroughly, but based on a demonstration I have no reason to doubt the company's claims,'' said Steve Kosmatka, a concrete engineer with the Portland Cement Association, an industry trade group based in Skokie, Ill. **********Fred Cohrs, Ideal Basic's executive vice president, said the company sells a fast-setting cement that cures in two to four hours with a strength of 3,000 to 4,000 pounds per square inch. **********Mr. Cohrs said Ideal Basic did not intend to offer a product that contains all of the properties of Pyrament because the market potential for such a cement is ''less than 5 percent of current sales.'' **********Lone Star said it has spent more than $7 million over 10 years to develop the new cement. The company, while not being specific, said Pyrament's ingredients include a mixture of portland cement and pozzuolana -natural and artificial substances added to cement to lend particular properties. A common ingredient is fly ash, which helps to increase the strength and durability of concrete. **********A major problem in pouring concrete is cold weather. Low temperatures, especially below 35 degrees Fahrenheit, slow the formation of concrete's crystalline structure, which gives it strength. **********Lone Star said that Pyrament cures in temperatures as low as 28 degrees because it requires 35 percent less water than portland cement. **********Analysts said they expected portland cement to continue to be used for most construction work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/10/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas McGill", "pub_date": "1989-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Harvey Hoffenberg, has been named an executive vice president and executive creative director of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising. *********** Blaise Mercadante has joined BBDO, Los Angeles, as senior vice president. *********** Vanessa Reed-Stagliano has been named advertising promotion director of TV Guide magazine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/20/business/the-media-business-advertising-wells-is-losing-lauren-and-procter-gamble.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-09-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Wells Is Losing Lauren And Procter & Gamble", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Wells Is Losing Lauren And Procter & Gamble", "body_text": " **********The Procter & Gamble Company and the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation yesterday dealt Wells, Rich, Greene a major setback, confirming industry rumors that they would shift their accounts from the agency. **********P.&G. reassigned its Sure deodorant account to Grey Advertising, while Polo Ralph Lauren gave its business to Carlson & Partners, an agency started this week by Sandy Carlson, the creative director who managed the Polo account at Wells, Rich. **********The Sure account has a budget of $18 million, according to Leading National Advertisers, while Polo Ralph Lauren is worth $8 million to $10 million. **********Ms. Carlson's new agency will handle Lauren as its sole client.

But he was equally opposed to American military action. **********''We are not in accord with military intervention by any country,'' Mr. Endara said last spring, soon after General Noriega nullified the results of the presidential election. ''It will cause more problems than it solves.'' Mr. Endara, a widower known for his amiable manner and ample girth, is believed by many to have defeated the pro-Noriega candidate, Carlos Duque, by a margin of 3 to 1. **********Three days after the May 7 election, Mr. Endara and his two vice-presidential running mates were beaten by paramilitary thugs as they led an opposition motorcade through Panama City. Mr. Endara was hospitalized for a week with head injuries. **********Over the summer, with public opposition to General Noriega at a low ebb, Mr. Endara sought to step up the economic pressure by urging Panamanians to delay paying taxes and utility bills, and to boycott the state-controlled lottery and casinos. **********Discouraged by the response, Mr. Endara began a two-week hunger strike on Sept. 20, announcing that it was in protest of the National Assembly's appointment of Franciso A. Rodriguez as president. Lying on a hospital bed in the window of a downtown office building, Mr. Endara is believed to have shed at least 30 of his 265 pounds - and stirred many jokes in the process. **********Two weeks later, on Oct. 5, hours after the second abortive military coup against General Noriega in two years, armed men ransacked opposition-party headquarters and Mr. Endara fled into hiding, where he remained until yesterday's strike.  Ricardo Arias Calderon **********For months, Ricardo Arias Calderon, 56, a philosophy professor who became leader of Panama's Christian Democratic Party, was considered Mr. Endara's strongest rival for the opposition nomination for the presidency. But Mr. Arias Calderon, whose sometimes austere personality has been overshadowed by Mr. Endara's warmth, settled for a spot as candidate for first vice president. **********But as Panama's political crisis worsened, it was almost invariably Mr. Arias Calderon who stepped forward to articulate the views of the opposition. **********He seemed especially presidential in March 1988, when the Government allowed him to return from a brief period of exile and he gave a moving speech to supporters at the airport. ''We have but one objective,'' he said. ''To get rid of Noriega and build reconciliation and democracy in Panama.'' **********Like his running mates, Mr. Arias Calderon is no stranger to physical violence at the hands of the Panamanian military. In June 1987, as General Noriega found himself faced with a rising wave of street demonstrations and general strikes, Mr. Arias Calderon and his wife were clubbed by the riot police during a demonstration. **********Last May 10, he was wounded when paramilitary men attacked the same opposition motorcade in which Mr. Endara was hurt. And in early October, shortly before the unsuccessful military coup, Mr. Arias Calderon and eight companions were detained for 20 hours and questioned about their role in the opposition campaign to convince Panamanians to deprive the Government of tax revenues. **********Despite his appreciation for American support against General Noriega, Mr. Arias Calderon made it clear over the years that he had few illusions about the relationship of the United States and the General. ''The chief interest of the Americans here is the security of the Panama Canal,'' he said in June 1986. ''In all these years, they have known exactly what Noriega was doing. But now they are against him because they feel he is a source of instability rather than stability.''  Guillermo Ford **********Although Guillermo Ford was the junior vice-presidential candidate in May's presidential elections, for a time he eclipsed his two running mates as the country's most recognizable anti-Noriega leader. **********For many Panamanians, the 53-year-old Mr. Ford's slashing stump style and brusque manner seemed to project a machismo that contrasted favorably with the cautious approach of other opposition figures, whose defiance of the Noriega regime seemed limited to waving white handkerchiefs, honking corn horns and banging pots. **********Yet he made it clear that he had no plans to help lead the opposition into a suicidal charge. ''We're not going to ask our people to confront these monsters,'' Mr. Ford said on May 13, three days after he and his associates were beaten during an opposition motorcade. ''We're not going to take them to the butcher shop.'' **********For Americans, Mr. Ford's prominence was assured by his command of idiomatic English, his nickname of Billy, and especially by stirring pictures of him taken on May 10. He was shown clad in a shirt soaked with his slain bodyguard's blood, being pummeled by a club-swinging vigilate thug. **********At the time of his nomination by the Nationalist Liberal Republican Party, known by its Spanish acronym of Molirena, Mr. Ford, a businessman, was a self-described political novice. But he was so successful at forging a following that many suspected that the motorcade attack might well have been an murder attempt aimed principally at him. Mr. Ford was in the United States at the time of the failed october coup. A day later, he discussed it with President Bush. **********''I looked Bush straight in the eye and he told me he'd do whatever it takes to get Noriega out, that nothing has been ruled out,'' Mr. Ford said. ''He said he would not allow a dictator like Noriega to make a fool of the United States and the rest of the world.'' At the time, Mr. Ford said, Mr. Bush did not offer any hint of what he might have in mind."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/22/business/market-place-program-trading-drives-up-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1989-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 955, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Program Trading Drives Up Stocks", "print_headline": "Market Place; Program Trading Drives Up Stocks", "body_text": " **********THE VOLATILITY brought on by program traders - or more accurately by those using the futures market to change their exposure to stocks rapidly - is back. The sharp gains in stock prices last week bore all the earmarks of a futures-driven market, albeit of the sort that provokes no public outcry, since those who denounce program trading are more disturbed by falling prices than rising ones. **********That surge of buying of index futures came amid one of the collective mood swings that can so often affect Wall Street, this one regarding the Federal Reserve, which just a few weeks ago was thought to have little choice but to tighten credit further. Now many believe that the Fed is on the verge of loosening credit and pushing down interest rates. **********The change of view regarding the Fed is based in large part on the stunning strength of the dollar in the face of opposition from most of the major central banks. For a couple of years, the central banks have shown brilliant market timing in their currency interventions, generally buying dollars before they were going to go up, and selling them near short-term peaks. But now, the dollar selling is having little effect. **********With the dollar continuing to rise, the pressure is on the Federal Reserve to push down short-term interest rates relative to those abroad. Such an easing would help to avert recession fears, and the expectation of the action helped to cut long-term Treasury bond yields to 8.7 percent, the lowest level in more than a year. **********Raising foreign interest rates would be expected to have the same effect on the dollar, but the Japanese and West German Governments have domestic political reasons for being reluctant to take decisive steps. The German central bank, in fact, failed to join in the dollar-selling last week, further encouraging the dollar bulls. **********Not long ago, the prevailing view was that the Fed could not ease for fear of setting off severe inflation. But with the dollar strong, that worry has been pushed aside, at least temporarily. **********The drop in interest rates was perhaps foretold by the action of the Dow Jones utility average, which has shown gains in each of the past nine weeks. The solid strength, even in early May when the overall stock market was under pressure, indicated that worries over higher interest rates were not disturbing buyers of the interest-sensitive issues. **********Since stock index futures and options became an important part of the financial markets in the mid-1980's, many portfolio managers and some individual investors have used them as a quick way to change their exposure to the stock market. When the bulk of that activity is on one side of the market, as it was last week, the demand for futures is transformed by program traders into a demand for the stocks themselves - the traders sell relatively overvalued futures and buy shares. **********A result is a concentration of orders, since the program traders generally concentrate on stocks in the S.&P. 500 or the even narrower Major Market Index, which includes just 20 stocks and is intended to track the movement of the Dow Jones industrial average. There was significant buying of the Major Market Index stocks on Friday, in connection with the expiration of its May contracts. **********That is probably one reason that the sharp move since May 9, during which the Dow Jones industrial average has risen 5.5 percent, was largely dominated by blue chips. Averages with a heavier weighting of secondary stocks generally have risen a more restrained 2 or 3 percent. Before this rally, secondary stocks over all had been doing a bit better than blue chips this year, as they did in 1988. **********Money managers who use futures to make big changes of portfolio weighting, as many did last week in response to opinion changes by such respected investment advisers as Steven Einhorn, of Goldman, Sachs, and Charles Clough, of Merrill Lynch, generally scale down their futures positions thereafter as they buy actual stocks. That could help the secondaries to come back, and put some pressure on larger shares. **********A technical indicator also helped to provoke some of last week's buying, as the advance-decline line of New York Stock Exchange issues moved to a post-crash high for the first time since the spring of 1988. That line moves up or down each day based on the difference between the number of Big Board stocks that rise versus the number that fall. **********The advance-decline line has enjoyed a wide following in large part because in both 1983, when the market topped out before the 1983-84 correction, and in early 1987 before the October crash, the advance-decline line stopped rising months before prices fell sharply. So when the line peaked in March 1988, and then failed to confirm subsequent new post-crash highs in the Dow Jones industrial average, some prominent technicians saw that as a sign the market was again becoming overextended. But last Monday, the N.Y.S.E. advance-decline line finally managed to rise above the level it had hit in early 1988, and it moved up sharply last week.

He is sick, isolated, perhaps dying, and no one is clear whether he or his old comrades on the Politburo even recognize the crisis in their land. **********The story of East Germany's abrupt fall from a Communist success story to crisis is largely the increasingly familiar story of a Communist state thrown into disarray by the waning of Soviet control. But it is also the story of a Communist state blessed with industrious people and a generous neighbor, but cursed by an unnatural division that has left the Government singularly dependent on an ideology gone sour, and under potent and permanent challenge from a bigger, richer and freer Germany. **********Many East Germans and Western diplomats say the pride and stubbornness of Mr. Honecker and many of his comrades on the Politburo can be traced to their roots as struggling Communists who suffered and fought for their ideology, first in the misery of an impoverished Germany between the wars, and then under the Nazis. **********Mr. Honecker, a roofer from the harsh industrial backwater of the Saarland, spent 10 years in Nazi political prisons. Thirty-two at the end of the war, he was among the Communists pressed by the Soviet Union to take charge of a state devastated by war and not only denied anything resembling the Marshall Plan aid pumped into West Germany but also burdened with awesome reparation payments to Moscow. Rebellion Crushed in 1953 **********The first years of the ''first state of peasants and workers on German soil'' was a permanent crisis. Hundreds of thousands of citizens fled through Berlin to the West. Soviet scrounging stripped all surviving industry of any equipment, and Stalin maintained an iron grip on a state he had created in pursuit of his own power politics. No Western country would recognize the Communist Germany, and Berlin remained a source of permanent tension. **********A veteran Stalinist who had spent the war years in Moscow, Walter Ulbricht, ruthlessly crushed a rebellion in 1953, and in 1961, faced with a flight that threatened to drain his state of manpower, ordered Mr. Honecker to put up the infamous Berlin wall. **********But by the 1970's, with Stalin gone and the Kremlin seeking detente with the West, Mr. Ulbricht was an obstacle. Leonid I. Brezhnev was receptive to the Ostpolitik overtures of West Germany and eager for a solution to the Berlin riddle that would clear the way for the Helsinki negotiations on European security that he had fathered. **********So in 1971, the Soviets brought in Mr. Honecker. By then, anyone who replaced Mr. Ulbricht would have been welcomed, and despite his obvious sponsorship by Moscow, Mr. Honecker's ascension raised new hopes. Beginning of Athletic Successes **********Many East Berliners recall the 1970's as the best period of their past. **********East German athletes were beginning to achieve their now-legendary successes in international sport. The allies resolved the status of Berlin, clearing the way for the two Germanys to sign the Basic Treaty of 1972 that finally brought East Germany recognition in the West as a sovereign and fully respectable state. **********''In 1974, we were the only nation to beat the West German soccer team that went on to win the World's Cup,'' an East Berliner said. ''The 1-0 victory brought real national pride. It seemed to confirm that we had arrived, that East Germans could consider ourselves equals.'' **********Economic changes introduced by Mr. Honecker anticipated many of the changes Mr. Gorbachev would try 10 years later, and society was given more leeway. State Visit to West Germany **********''Blue jeans and long hair began to be tolerated, and he began putting things in the store,'' a Berliner who was a teen-ager at the time said. ''We started to talk more freely. Oh, he was still strict. But the message was that if you worked hard, there was something in it for you.'' **********Relations with West Germany produced tangible aid. And when Moscow stormed out of negotiations on medium-range missiles in 1983 and threw East-West relations on ice, Mr. Honecker gained respect in both Germanys for stubbornly continuing to champion disarmament and detente. **********With the revival of detente, Mr. Honecker finally achieved a long ambition and paid a formal state visit to West Germany, visiting the grave of his parents in Saarland and finally watching his flag with its Communist symbol wave alongside the West German flag. **********After the visit, Mr. Honecker moved to satisfy his people's greatest longing, travel abroad. More than a million were allowed visits to the West in the next year, though usually with a loved one left behind to insure that the tourist returned, and legal immigrations soared past 100,000 a year. Resentment and Local Elections **********By that time, Mr. Gorbachev was already setting the tectonic plates of East Europe grinding. Change was in the air, and to many East Germans, Mr. Honecker was ''giving yesterday's answers to today's questions.'' **********Galvanized by the rapid change in neighboring Poland and in Hungary, a country they used to visit by the hundreds of thousands, many East Germans saw Mr. Honecker and his leadership as an immovable obstacle. **********The resentment broke into the open in May, when elections of local officials, which many Germans hoped would be held in the spirit of the democratization in the Sovet Union, proved to be as tightly controlled by the party as they had always been. **********''We believe that people are leaving East Germany because they have lost all hope of change, because the Communists are closed to Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika,' said Reinhard Schult, one of the founders of the biggest new movement for changes, the New Forum. ''Many people can no longer tolerate the kindergarten atmosphere, or being constantly led by the nose on all fronts.'' 'A Very Human Rebellion' **********So when the gates opened a crack through Hungary, East Germans began to flee. Slowly at first, by last week the flight was a frenzied rush by thousands for a rapidly closing door. **********Many East Berliners argued that it was not material need or political persecution that were driving people to flee, but a basic desire to escape the oppressive paternalism of the Honecker Government. **********''Fundamentally it's a very human rebellion taking place,'' a Western diplomat said. ''They're saying we're grown up now. Talk to us.'' **********Among those who chose to remain, the exodus demonstrated how urgently change is needed. One young member of the Communist Party noted that New Forum and many other new groups seeking reform were not demandng the overthrow of a Communist system, but only its urgent democratization. The same sentiment, he said, was widesprea among the younger Communists. **********''It's not like Poland here,'' he said. ''Socialism has lots of genuine roots in Germany. This is where it was invented, and even in West Germany the Social Democratic Party has traditionally been strong. Ultimately that's what we want, something along the lines of traditional European social democracy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/28/business/opec-seeks-output-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPEC Seeks Output Deal", "print_headline": "OPEC Seeks Output Deal", "body_text": " **********Oil ministers of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued today to seek a production quota they can all abide by. **********After a two-hour closed-door meeting here, ministers from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Kuwait and Algeria emerged to say they were still working on a deal but they provided no details. **********In five days of talks, the ministers have yet to signal any willingness to make concessions that might lead to a production agreement. **********''We will keep meeting until we have an agreement,'' Hisham M.

Reaction to Dollar's Rise **********Credit market reaction to the dollar's rise first appeared during trading in Europe, when prices surged. Activity moderated as trading shifted to New York, but despite the slower pace, Treasury prices remained close to their highs of the day in United States trading. **********Some analysts said that with the run-up in the dollar, the chances had increased that the Federal Reserve would be forced to ease monetary policy soon. **********An overt move by the Fed to cut interest rates would help push the dollar lower because it would narrow the gap between yields on Treasury securities and those offered by competing fixed-income securities in other countries, most notably West Germany and Japan. **********''The latest rise in the dollar could be the final justification where the Fed finds a reason to ease policy,'' said Victor Chang, president of V.C. Management Company Inc.  However, the Fed sent a signal to market participants yesterday that it had no intention of lowering the trading range on the overnight Federal funds rate, the interest rate it most directly controls. **********Around midday yesterday the Fed entered the market to drain reserves from the banking system when the funds rate was trading at 9 11/16 percent, a level below the 9 3/4 percent to 9 7/8 percent range that is widely perceived as the Fed's target range for the closely watched rate. The draining activity caused the funds rate to stabilize at the 9 11/16 level, where it remained for the remainder of the session. **********''That move told us they are not about to ease, and that policy is unchanged,'' said David Green, head of the government securities trading desk at Chemical Bank. ''But at this point the market doesn't care. It is just looking at the dollar.'' **********The biggest gains were recorded by long-term bonds, which rose by more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. **********In late trading, the Treasury's 8 7/8 percent bonds due in 2019 were offered at a price of 102 30/32, up 1 6/32, to yield 8.59 percent. That is down from 8.70 percent in late trading Friday and is the lowest yield on the closely watched bellwether issue since mid-March, 1988. **********Meanwhile, short to intermediate note issues also recorded big gains. **********By late in the day, the 9 1/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 21/ 32, up 26/32, to yield 8.57 percent. And the 9 5/8 percent four-year notes were offered at 102 30/32, up 3/8 of a point, to yield 8.70 percent. **********Yields on Treasury issues to be offered at auction later in the week plummeted. **********Late yesterday the two-year Treasury notes to be sold on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.80 percent. Late Friday the notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 8.92 percent. **********And the five-year notes to be sold Thursday were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.64 percent, down from a late when-issued rate of 8.84 percent on Friday. **********The gains in short-term interest rates last week were reflected in yesterday's weekly auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills. **********Dealers pushed secondary bill issues higher last week on the belief that the Fed was not about to ease credit conditions. **********At yesterday's auction, three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 8.32 percent, up from the average rate of 8.21 percent at last week's auction. **********Six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 8.33 percent, up from an average rate of 8.19 percent a week ago. **********A number of analysts said that the current rally, which has been fueled by signs the economy is experiencing a soft landing as it slows down, as well as some recent evidence that inflation is leveling off, could continue. **********But some analysts said that the recent decline in long-term rates, which have fallen by more than a full percentage point since the end of March, could rekindle the economy later in the year. **********''This is the early stage of an explosive bond market rally,'' declared Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.

Self-regulation, the industry says, is working. Skepticism Abounds **********But the skeptics are many. On Feb. 21, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a Federal agency, issued a blistering attack on the Chicago Board of Trade, contending that the exchange, the world's largest futures market, was unable to police its members. **********Two days later, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, raised questions about whether the board or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the second-largest futures exchange, could calculate the time of their trades on contracts. The contracts are agreements to deliver a set amount of a commodity, like soybeans, at a fixed price on a certain date. **********And last week, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, asked the futures commission to consider 11 changes. They include higher fines for trading abuses and increasing the number of commission officials on the floors of the exchanges. **********The barrage has led the normally optimistic exchange officials to concede that self-regulation is being threatened as never before. **********''Today, we face what could be our greatest challenge,'' said Thomas R. Donovan, the Board of Trade's president, in a recent speech. ''At issue is our very right to self-regulation, the right to write the rules for your exchange and enforce those rules.'' **********The Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange have moved to reassure outsiders. The board has recently announced changes in its trade-timing procedures, the Merc has assembled a committee to recommend trading changes and both exchanges have increased fines for trading violations. Reforms Still Urged **********But the efforts to appear more vigilant have failed to silence the calls for reform. ''The question we will have to ask is, 'How much more regulation will be needed to protect the public?' '' said Representative Glenn L. English, an Oklahoma Democrat who serves on the House Agriculture Committee, which oversees commodity trading. **********Many people are now saying that self-regulation is tantamount to allowing a fox to guard a chicken coop. The outsiders say it is unrealistic to expect traders to discipline their brethren. And they say it is especially naive to ask traders to write rules that would reduce cheating if those rules would cut the traders' pay. **********''It's not that people in Chicago are thieves,'' said Jack Barbanel, the head of futures trading at Gruntal & Company in New York. ''It's that you have whole generations of people who have made a living in a certain way at the exchange for years, and they're not about to change.'' Fending Off Intervention **********Chicago's futures exchanges have proved extraordinarily deft at fending off attempts to interfere in their affairs. In early 1980, after a ''cornering'' of the silver market sent prices soaring, the exchanges successfully lobbied Congress to block a proposal that would have empowered the Federal Reserve Board to set requirements on the margin - the portion of the cost of a futures contract that may be borrowed. In the mid-1980's, the exchanges thwarted a proposal that would have required them to time-stamp trades at one-minute intervals. **********More recently, after the October 1987 stock market crash, it was only through intense lobbying on Capitol Hill that the exchanges defeated a proposal that would have given the Securities and Exchange Commission oversight for stock-index futures, which are contracts based on a basket of stocks. **********But the issue now facing the exchanges is far more serious. For the first time, reports have circulated that a large number of traders may have attempted to cheat customers. Though unsubstantiated, the reports have shaken the confidence of investors. Thus, the prevailing view among industry professionals is that self-regulation will be changed regardless of the F.B.I.'s findings. **********''There is agreement at both major exchanges that something has to be done to restore faith in the market,'' said John Rainbolt, a leading commodity lawyer in Washington. Attempting Self-Regulation **********Even critics concede that self-regulation has been partly successful. Since 1979, the number of people at the Merc working in enforcement has increased to 60, from 20. The enforcement ranks at the Board of Trade have swelled to 85, from 49 in 1983. Disciplinary actions have more than tripled at both exchanges since 1984 - to 207 at the Merc and to 879 at the Board of Trade. **********This occurred while the annual trading volume in the Chicago futures markets grew to 245.9 million contracts last year, about triple what it was in 1979. **********Both exchanges have also spent millions of dollars on computerized trade-reconstruction systems. **********Many people are concerned that both exchanges are dominated by insiders - traders, brokers or exchange officials - who, they contend, have treated the exchanges as a private club. For example, the New York Stock Exchange has a 27-member board, 12 of whom come from outside the securities industry. But the Merc has 25 insiders on its 31-member board, and 21 insiders sit on the Board of Trade's panel of 24 people. Assessing Rule Changes **********So it should be no surprise that the exchanges' rule makers have first considered the effect of any changes on its members. One example is a rule that allows traders to trade for themselves on the same day they are executing customer orders. The outsiders have complained that the rule invites abuse by allowing brokers to trade for their personal accounts before doing so for customers, which could raise the price of contracts. **********''In Chicago, you don't have the same outside factors trying to provide objectivity,'' said Jerry Markham, another Washington-based commodity lawyer. ''Everything is dominated by the floor and is in the floor's interest.'' **********Nor are the outsiders involved in enforcement at Chicago's exchanges. Both rely on an adversarial system. The exchanges' enforcement officials bring charges against violators, and the cases are decided by exchange committees. But none of the panels include people who are not exchange members. And many people question whether the committees can be hard-nosed. Widespread Cheating Seen **********Many people outside the exchanges also say cheating is too common at the Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange. These people, who speak only on the condition that they not be identified, say the cheating runs the gamut, with one of the most common abuses involving the ''open-outcry'' system for buying and selling commodity futures contracts. **********Under open outcry, a trader is supposed to call out orders to the full trading pit. But the traders say a close relationship often forms between brokers, who execute orders for others, and locals, who trade for themselves. The relationships become so cozy, the traders say, that brokers and locals often stop dealing with the entire pit. **********Sometimes, the abuses can be flagrant, like the conditions that prevailed last summer in the Board of Trade's soybean futures pit. With a sudden rainfall depressing soybean prices, the traders were desperate to sell soybean futures contracts. But a peculiar thing happened: while the electronic quotation board above the traders' heads recorded heavy volume, few of the trades seemed to be taking place in the pit. 'Just Broke Down' **********The traders later explained that brokers had decided to sell their own futures contracts to customers rather than shout out the customers' buy orders to the pit. The brokers thus made it nearly impossible for traders in the pit to sell their contracts. **********''Guys were getting killed, losing thousands of dollars by the minute, and they had no way of bailing out,'' one soybean trader recalled. ''The entire open-outcry system just broke down.'' **********Ultimately, self-interest may spur the exchanges to give the outsiders more control. Mr. Rainbolt, the Washington lawyer, noted, ''If you've got $400,000 tied up in a membership, and you see that price slipping because of falling public confidence, you've got a real incentive to do something about it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/26/business/chief-rejoins-qintex.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 146, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chief Rejoins Qintex", "print_headline": "Chief Rejoins Qintex", "body_text": " **********Qintex Entertainment Inc. said today that David Evans, who resigned last week as president and chief executive, had reconsidered and would resume both positions until the end of the year or until a successor was named.

Bombs exploded and rockets screamed and the sound of machine-gun fire accompanied much of the 60-minute news conference. **********It was not clear who was firing at whom and for what reason. The Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Rene Emilio Ponce, who sat next to the President, said the air force was pounding a rebel concentration on the ashen skirts of the San Salvador volcano. **********Some residents of the area said a rebel patrol passed through the area where the press conference took place just moments before the air strike. It was also suggested that the bombing and the rocketing may have been an attempt by dissatisfied extremists within the armed forces to disrupt the President's announcement. **********Another press conference was held this afternoon by Auxiliary Archbishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez, who said the Roman Catholic Church still hoped it could get the stalled peace process back on track. **********''Roads are still open,'' the Archbishop was quoted by the Associated Press as saying, referring to the talks he said he is holding this week in an effort to arrange a cease-fire and negotiations to end the conflict. Second Press Conference **********Mr. Cristiani's press conference was only his second since the rebels launched their offensive with attacks on the President's official residence and private home. **********Mr. Cristiani appeared relaxed and confident, though his eyes were rimmed by red and deeply sunken in his face. When Mr. Ponce was asked a question, the President stood up, knocking over his chair. He went over to a military aide and borrowed a cigarette - even though he had reportedly given up smoking a month ago. **********Mr. Cristiani's news conference came as signs mounted that the rebels were preparing to launch a series of new attacks. One rebel said today that new recruits had more than made up for their casualties and that the insurgents would strike again within the next few days. Others said the attack could come as soon as Friday morning. **********But Mr. Cristiani and Colonel Ponce said the rebels had been dealt a decisive defeat, and discounted the possibility that they retained enough strength to strike a crippling blow against the Government and the armed forces. But they noted that a small group of armed men could create and launch many attacks and did not dismiss the likelihood that fighting would break out again. **********The rebel offensive stretched the army and succeeded in bringing the country to a halt. With their attack on the exclusive Escalon neighborhood on Tuesday, the guerrillas for the first time took the war into the living rooms of the rich, who have long lived in isolation, emotionally protected from the brutal conflict behind security guards and 12-foot walls. **********The rebels also have succeeded in showing that the Cristiani Administration will not be able to fulfill its ambitious economic rejuvenation program without negotiating an end to the civil war with the rebels. Cease-Fire Is Offered **********But the offensive, which exhausted both armies, so far appears to have strengthened extremists who are opposed to any political solution. Apparently in an attempt to insure that their offers are rejected, the insurgents and the Government have included provisions they know the other side will reject in outlining conditions for resuming the negotiations. The rebels earlier this month broke off the talks, although both sides have promised not to unilaterally withdraw. **********But late Wednesday, after the quietest day in the capital since the start of the offensive, rebels proposed a cease-fire to be verified by the United Nations. **********''We express our disposition to define an immediate cease-fire,'' the rebels said in a statement read on Radio Venceremos, their underground radio network. **********But in their proposal, the guerrillas said they did not want to resume negotiations with the Government. They said that talks should be with the armed forces, which traditionally have ruled the country in alliance with the oligarchy and have a de facto veto over Government decisions. 'It's Not Serious' **********Mr. Cristiani today rejected the insurgent proposal. ''It's not serious,'' he said. He accused rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of using the previous negotiations to plan their offensive and build up their military strength. **********''The peace process was used very cynically by the F.M.L.N.,'' the President said. ''We don't want to play into their hands and let them use this peace process.'' **********Mr. Cristiani said he would only resume the negotiations if the rebels proved they were sincere in seeking a political solution to the war, which has killed 70,000 people and displaced more than one in 10 Salvadorans. **********Asked what would bring the Government back to the negotiating table, Mr. Cristiani said, ''The willingness of the F.M.L.N. to cease hostilities and give us enough assurances that they wouldn't continue to use the peace process as a tactical maneuver.'' Curfew Remains in Effect **********The President said that since the offensive proved that the insurgents did not have the power to topple the Government or defeat the army, they should lay down their arms. Any further attacks amount to nothing more than terrorism, he said. **********Mr. Cristiani said the only item on the agenda in future talks should be ''a cessation of hostilities,'' but the rebels have long said that was tantamount to insisting on their surrender. They demand that the Government agree to military, economic and social change before they put down their arms. **********In the press conference, Mr. Cristiani angrily rejected assertions that his Administration had been eviscerated and that extremists were now making the important decisions. ''Obviously, this is not true,'' he said. ''The Government is doing what should be done, not what a small group thinks should be done.'' **********Mr. Cristiani dashed widespread hopes that he would soon end the state of siege and the dusk-to-dawn curfew that were imposed in the second day of the offensive. **********He said the state of siege, which gives the security forces vast powers to arrest and hold people for almost any reason, would be re-examined when it is up for extension after 30 days.  Venezuelan to Meet Rebels **********CARACAS, Venezuela, Nov. 23 (AP) - President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela said today that he planned to meet with Salvadoran guerrilla leaders as a possible mediator in peace talks. **********Mr. Perez conferred with officials of President Cristiani's Government earlier in the week and told reporters today that a meeting with rebel leaders in Caracas could take place within hours. **********He described the 11-day guerrilla offensive in which more than 1,000 people were killed a ''horrible bloodbath,'' but he said an evenhanded approach was needed to achieve recognition in El Salvador. **********''It can't be possible that Latin America will take a step back with the latest developments in El Salvador, when we are about to see the whole region covered with democratic regimes,'' he said. **********''I will say the same things to the representatives of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front that I said to the ministers of the Cristiani Government: We need to look for sincere solutions.'' **********The Venezuelan President said a cease-fire should be a prerequisite for peace talks and cautioned against increased American military involvement. **********He said he was awaiting word of the guerrillas' arrival. As he left the briefing room, Mr. Perez was asked when the meeting might take place, and replied, ''Possibly tonight.'' **********Members of the palace guard surrounded the presidential beach retreat of La Guzmania, in the port city of La Guaira north of Caracas, where the conference presumably would be held. **********Unconfirmed reports said one of the rebels attending would be Shafik Handal, said to be their top military strategist.

The report did not give the number of casualties. **********Similar attacks were launched against Government positions at Conde, Santa Maria and El Jacatal, also in San Miguel Department. **********San Miguel has been the scene of fighting between the guerrillas and Government forces since the rebels launched their nationwide offensive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/21/world/muslim-cleric-urges-defiance-of-israeli-curbs-on-worship.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 493, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Muslim Cleric Urges Defiance Of Israeli Curbs on Worship", "print_headline": "Muslim Cleric Urges Defiance Of Israeli Curbs on Worship", "body_text": " **********A Muslim cleric urged Palestinians today to defy Israeli restrictions on worship at the holiest Islamic site in Jerusalem, and United Nations relief officials demanded that Israel stop using gunfire to quell Palestinian protests. **********In the Gaza Strip, at least 16 Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with troops. **********Sheik Mohammed al-Jamal, a preacher at Al Aksa Mosque, called on Moslems in the occupied territories to attend Friday prayers at the mosque to challenge the Israeli restrictions. **********The police order was issued after Palestinians stoned policemen in the mosque compound after prayers on April 7, the first Friday of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. **********On April 14, the police turned away most West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians trying to reach the mosque compound, known as Haram al-Sharif, the third holiest site of Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. **********''If the Israeli authorities prevent Moslems from entering the mosque, they are to pray in the Old City of Jerusalem,'' Sheik Jamal said.

Next year, three-month bills will average 6.7 percent, the Bush Administration said, up from the 5.5 percent rate that had been projected. **********On inflation, the Administration expects consumer prices to rise by 4.9 percent this year, versus the 3.6 percent forecast earlier.

''I've been here 30 years, and this is the fourth real estate downturn that we've had,'' said Mr. Simmons, chairman of the Valley National Corporation, the owner of Arizona's largest bank. **********''It's been pretty predictable what happens,'' Mr. Simmons added in a telephone interview. ''It's a very cyclical thing, and real estate values always come back.'' **********Owners of Valley National shares hope Mr. Simmons is right, for the company has a bulging portfolio of real estate loans that appear shaky. **********The situation has created an unusually wide divergence of opinion on Wall Street. Thomas K. Brown, the banking analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, calls Valley National ''our top pick for 1989.'' Charles W. Peabody, the banking analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, thinks its share price is likely to plummet. **********Arizona has been one of the fastest-growing states, and it is still growing more than the country as a whole. But as growth has slowed, a lot of offices and houses have sat waiting for people who never arrived. Moreover, although construction has slowed, some office projects are still rising despite a dearth of renters. **********With the slowdown has come a sharp rise in Valley National's nonperforming assets, to $450 million at the end of the year, compared with $295 million a year earlier and $205 million at the end of 1986. Mr. Peabody computed that, as a percentage of shareholders' equity, those nonperforming assets have risen from 33 percent two years ago to 75 percent. Nonperforming assets consist mainly of loans on which interest is no longer being collected - usually because borrowers have fallen behind on payments - and real estate acquired through foreclosure. **********Such a rise in nonperforming assets would often be accompanied by increases in the amount set aside to cover possible loan losses, but that has not been the case at Valley National. While the loan-loss provision rose to $240 million in 1987, it fell back to $87 million last year, $11 million less than in 1986. That relatively low amount is a key reason why Valley National was able to report 1988 profits of $67.3 million, or $3.41 a share. **********The heart of Mr. Peabody's bearish case is that the loan-loss provision, over which bank executives have a large amount of discretion, is far too low. ''I call it the ostrich approach to banking,'' he said. ''There's plenty of sand out there to bury your head in.'' **********Mr. Brown, the Smith Barney analyst, dismissed such talk. ''The key is the future direction of the nonperforming loans,'' he said. ''I would expect them to go down this year.'' In that regard, he is even more optimistic than the company's chairman. ''I doubt they will go down much in 1989,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''But they won't go up either.'' **********Mr. Simmons, a former chief executive of United Bank of Arizona, now a Citicorp subsidiary, noted that he and other top officials had joined Valley National within the last year and said that they had no reason to defend loans made by their predecessors. ''We're doing what we think is correct,'' he said. ''I'm not going to delude our shareholders by transfering $50 million into a loan-loss reserve when there is no reason to do so.'' **********There seems to be little question that Valley National needs a turnaround in real estate values. Discussing the value of foreclosed real estate, carried on Valley National's books at $93 million, Mr. Simmons said: ''If we had to take our other real estate and put it on the market tomorrow, I don't think we'd get that price. Under any kind of normal circumstances, however, we do have it on the books at the right price.'' **********To Mr. Simmons, the only real question about Arizona real estate values is whether they will turn up this year or in 1990. ''When it does happen,'' he said, ''real estate will come back and be worth what it was, and it will be liquid again.'' **********Mr. Peabody said it may take as long as five years to rent all the commercial real estate in the Phoenix area that has been built or is under construction. In the meantime, rents have fallen far enough, due to various concessions, that other local bankers have told him that developers often do not have enough cash flow to service many loans. John Lucking, Valley National's chief economist, said he believes that values and rents have not fallen nearly that far. **********If no write-offs are coming, Valley National's stock does look cheap. At the current price of $28.875, it is selling for less than the stated book value of $31.29 a share. The worst case Mr. Brown can imagine would be a write-off of $3 or $4 a share. But Mr. Peabody warns, ''If market conditions continue to deteriorate, you've got $15 to $20 of loss in that organization.'' **********There is one thing on which the two analysts agree. Both think that events will prove who is right within the next 12 months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/business/business-digest-287789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********THE ECONOMY  Employers are aggressively bargaining with doctors and hospitals on health-care costs, and steering workers to the ones with the best price.

Industry experts said most of the prepaid health plans should remain profitable at least through 1990, when the cycle may turn down again. **********The H.M.O. industry lost $900 million in 1987 and again in 1988, said Joel J. Menges, director of analytical services at American International Healthcare Inc., a unit of the American International Group, a multinational insurer. It has recouped its losses by aggressively raising the monthly premiums charged to employers and individuals. **********''Two-thirds of all H.M.O.'s in the country had losses last year,'' said Peter J. Grua, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore. Now most publicly owned H.M.O.'s are profitable, he said. ''Even some of the smaller companies are back on the track.'' Stock prices of many large H.M.O.'s have more than doubled this year, he said. **********The turnaround came as insurers were forced to stanch losses they took while covering soaring medical costs. The insurers raised their rates as much as 50 percent for traditional fee-for-service health plans in 1989, while H.M.O.'s increased theirs by 12 percent to 20 percent. **********For 1990, Mr. Grua said, insurers are seeking increases of 25 percent or more, which means H.M.O.'s can stay ahead of inflation, remain competitive and still show a profit if they raise rates by 12 percent to 15 percent. Kaiser Foundation Health Plans, an industry giant with 6.2 million members, has announced rate increases averaging 19.2 percent for 1990. Increases averaged 11.2 percent in 1989 and under 5 percent in the three preceding years. Kaiser did not report losses. H.M.O.'s charge a fixed monthly prepaid fee for each patient. Thus, hospitals and doctors have an incentive to keep costs down by offering checkups and other preventive measures to keep patients healthy and by minimizing expensive services. **********''H.M.O.'s have truly been able to control their costs better than an insurance company,'' said Larry Greenberg, manager of the Fidelity Select Medical Delivery Fund in Boston. A few tightly managed H.M.O.'s like Pacificare Healthcare Systems Inc., based in Cypress, Calif., pass along only a set share of the per-patient premiums to hospitals and doctors, adding to the pressure to keep costs down. FHP International, based in Fountain Valley, Calif., owns a hospital and employs its own doctors. Humana Inc., the hospital chain based in Louisville, Ky., owns H.M.O.'s with more than one million members. Todd Richter, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the H.M.O.'s were providing 17 percent of Humana's patients. **********Analysts predict that insurers may start cutting prices again in 1991. ''When pricing turns negative, the H.M.O.'s will still be able to make profits in the downturn,'' Mr Greenberg said. But Seth H. Shaw, at Prudential-Bache Securities, is less sanguine. ''Next year political problems will emerge,'' he said. As pressure grows to hold the line on prices, he added, ''H.M.O.'s that raise rates by 20 percent will not be part of the solution.'' **********The prepaid health plans had 32.6 million members enrolled at the beginning of the year, up 3.3 million from Jan. 1, 1988, according to the Group Health Association of America, an H.M.O. trade group in Washington. James F. Doherty, the group's president, predicted an additional 3.3 million members will be added in 1989. **********But some H.M.O.'s have lost members as companies required employees to help pay for rising premiums. ''We realized we couldn't hold the line on the premiums,'' said Alan Peres, benefit planning manager at American Information Technologies, the Chicago-based regional telephone company. **********In the 1990 sign-up period now under way, employees at Ameritech's Illinois Bell unit are being asked to pay $42.83 to $62.23 a month for family coverage in Chicago and more in downstate Illinois, said Bill Watson, Illinois Bell's director of benefits.

''She can rant and rave, but, if it's down to a choice between the British and the Germans, most of these Continental countries will go with the Germans.'' **********Today in West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher insisted that his talks in Washington at which his demand for superpower disarmament talks on short-range missiles was rebuffed had been amicable and that the Americans had recognized West Germany's ''special right'' to speak its mind.  [ Page A10. ] **********The emergence of a loose NATO coalition in support of Bonn has not happened overnight but gradually, reflecting the accrual of influence by the most powerful nation in Western Europe, diplomats and strategic analysts said. At the alliance headquarters in Brussels, officials speak of ''the Deutsche mark zone,'' an expression that denotes the translation of economic might into political suasion. **********This might, combined with West Germany's geopolitical importance, has converted Italy, a handful of smaller Western European nations and, to an important degree, France and Spain into tactical allies. More Assertive Generation **********''The Germans are finally waking up to the fact that they are a rather powerful medium-size country in Europe,'' said Ronald Asmus, an analyst of German affairs at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif. ''We're now dealing with a more self-assertive generation of Germans, who feel they've paid their dues and are willing to throw their weight around in the alliance.'' **********Today, Mr. Genscher today pointedly referred to ''the very wide support among our Continental European partners for the German position.'' **********Although it shifts subtly on different issues, the West German coalition within NATO typically includes Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Greece and Luxembourg. Yet a decisive turn in Bonn's favor occurred after President Francois Mitterrand of France was re-elected to a second seven-year term last May. **********In his first term, Mr. Mitterrand observed a stern vigilance toward the Soviet Union, pleading in the West German parliament in 1983 for the deployment of American medium-range missiles. But in his second term the French President has accommodated French strategic doctrine to the spreading antinuclear sentiment in West Germany, which has weakened and, lately, panicked Mr. Kohl. A 'Futile' Tactic **********Well before Washington or London came to the same conclusion, Mr. Mitterrand argued that it was futile to press the beleaguered Mr. Kohl to endorse the replacement of the aging Lance short-range nuclear missiles before next year's parliamentary elections in the Federal Republic. And though France is hostile to the new West German demand for superpower negotiations on short-range missiles and nuclear artillery, a senior adviser to Mr. Mitterrand said it was unwise for NATO to stake out a public position against such talks. **********''One has to understand the Germans' reaction,'' the Mitterrand adviser said. ''If France's defense were assured by short-range American missiles on French soil, the reaction of the French would be the same as the Germans' today.'' **********Rather than veto the Germans' demand for short-range negotiations -as the Bush Administration did Monday - the French official suggested that NATO should seize the initiative and propose to the Soviet Union that it reduce its short-range arsenal, now overwhelmingly superior, to roughly the same level as the alliance's 88 Lance launchers, most of which are stationed in West Germany. To satisfy West German opinion, NATO might lower the ceiling to 66 launchers or so, he added. **********The conversion of France to the role of an explainer, if not always a defender, of German positions within the alliance means that Mr. Kohl and his influential Foreign Minister have one of the Continent's two nuclear powers halfway in their camp. Britain, the other nuclear power in Western Europe, has few unwavering allies on the Continent, with the curious exception of Portugal. A Threat to NATO Talks **********By pushing for ''speedy'' negotiations on short-range nuclear systems, the Kohl Government has implicitly threatened to disrupt the NATO summit gathering in Brussels on May 28-29. Yet despite their Continental alliances the Germans do not have the power to override the American veto. **********''The Americans can't modernize Lance without the Germans, and the Germans can't negotiate without the Americans,'' said Josef Joffe, foreign editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung in Munich. ''One likely outcome is that each side will torpedo the other.'' **********In the meantime, the West Germans have turned upside down the so-called dual-track strategy that NATO followed between 1979 and 1983, an approach that involved negotiating with the Soviet Union on medium-range missiles while moving forward to deploy them in Western Europe when the negotiations failed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/16/business/northrop-names-new-head-for-b-2-bomber-program.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1989-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 489, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Northrop Names New Head For B-2 Bomber Program", "print_headline": "Northrop Names New Head For B-2 Bomber Program", "body_text": " **********The Northrop Corporation today named Oliver C.

If Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is not caught, if the situation on the streets of Panama is not quickly restored to order and if the opposition to the military strike from leaders in Latin American is not quickly reversed, what the Administration calls ''Operation Just Cause'' could turn into a political liability for Mr. Bush. **********''The book is still out,'' said Charles William Maynes, editor of the magazine Foreign Policy. ''We just don't know yet whether this operation is going to get converted into a war between some of the Panamanian people and American troops. Panama is not Grenada. It has a history of nationalist resentment of the United States.'' **********That assessment was shared by Sol M. Linowitz, who helped to negotiate the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977. He said several questions remain unanswered: Will General Noriega be able to turn the American attack on him into an attack on Panamanian nationalism, mobilizing public opposition to the American strike and to the new Panamanian Government? Even if General Noriega is captured, will his supporters mount sabatoge operations against Americans in Panama and against the canal, demanding American military responses? **********Every American president since Theodore Roosevelt in 1903 has tried to secure democracy in Panama, with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman heightening those efforts during World War II to protect the Panama Canal and to ''have Panama be like us,'' said Professor Frank Gerome, an expert on Panamanian history at James Madison University. **********''The problem is that political parties and democracy have just never been institutionalized down there,'' he said. ''The roots are too shallow, so things never seem to turn out as we hope.'' **********These doubts notwithstanding, most Republicans and Democrats in Congress lined up behind the President's action, although the Democrats were far less effusive. Democrats seemed to be trying to strike a delicate balance: Having criticized the President for not being more decisive in responding to events in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union, and for mishandling the coup attempt in Panama on Oct. 3, now that he has acted in a seemingly decisive manner they find it very difficult to condemn the military action, particularly when American soldiers are still risking their lives. **********At the same time, though, many Democrats appeared anxious to avoid heaping too much praise on the Administration. They seemed to feel that the Panama operation was, to some extent, an attempt by the President to display political fortitude and military muscle against a target that was in no way central to American foreign policy interests. Also, they recognized that the initiative could quickly turn sour. From Caution to Hostility **********For instance, the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said: ''Under the circumstances, the decision is justified. When there is the engagement of U.S. forces in the field, it behooves all of us to give that support.'' **********But Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, was more reserved. ''The instinct of all Americans is to support the President in this kind of situation,'' he said. ''More information from the Administration is needed before we can know whether this particular operation was the best course of action.'' **********Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginian Democrat, declared his backing for the operation, but said: ''If General Noriega and his forces are not neutralized in the near future, the safety of more American citizens in Panama and the security of the Panama Canal could be jeopardized. The ultimate success of our operation in the long run will depend largely on whether other countries in the region recognize the new government.'' **********The least enthusiastic response from a Senate Democrat came from Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said: ''As the fighting continues I wish success to our soldiers with the minimum loss of life. Personally, though, I would have preferred that the President had only taken such an action in concert with the neighboring Latin American nations.'' **********The Chairman of the House Narcotics Committee, Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, was outright hostile to the attack. He said: ''As much as I would like to get rid of the bum in Panama, I don't see the legal authority of the use of the military. I am of course distressed that prior to our action, an American was killed, an American arrested, an American brutally beaten, and an American military wife was threatened with rape. President Bush said, 'That was enough.' If that is so, far more than that happens on the streets of New York every day and night, and I say, that too is enough.'' **********Summing up the views of most Republicans, the Senate minority leader, Robert J. Dole, Republican of Kansas, told a news conference: ''I want to indicate my support for President Bush's action - strong support. He knew it was a difficult choice; he knew people would be injured or killed, but he felt that the national interest required an appropriate response to continued escalation and provocation by the dictator down there, Noriega.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/16/world/khomeini-s-judgment-iranian-leader-s-instruction-kill-writer-may-reflect.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 821, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Khomeini's Judgment; Iranian Leader's Instruction to Kill Writer May Reflect a Calculation Rooted in Politics", "print_headline": "Khomeini's Judgment; Iranian Leader's Instruction to Kill Writer May Reflect a Calculation Rooted in Politics", "body_text": " **********Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call for the execution of a writer he has accused of blasphemy appears to be largely a political maneuver by the Iranian leader to reassert his role as spokesman and protector of Islamic causes. **********The Ayatollah, who is 88 years old, has a record of weighing his actions carefully. He may have seen in the protests over Salman Rushdie's novel, ''The Satanic Verses,'' an opportunity to bolster Iran's prestige among Muslims worldwide. **********Ever since Iran accepted a cease-fire in the war with Iraq last summer and appeared to retreat from fundamentalist Islamic policies of the last few years, its status as revolutionary model has been diminished in much of the Islamic world. **********An Iranian official who asked not to be identified said the Ayatollah might have seen an opportunity for one-upsmanship in the silence of other prominent Muslim leaders. **********''The protests have been going on for weeks,'' the Iranian official said. ''He has had plenty of time to think about it and many demands to act from inside and outside Iran.'' Instigation Carries Risk **********But the Ayatollah's call for the execution of Mr. Rushdie, who was born a Kashmiri Muslim and lives in London, also carries risks for Iran. **********It has already set back attempts to moderate its militant revolutionary image. And it may give an opening to those elements of the Iranian leadership that oppose the more pragmatic policies of the mainstream leaders in international and domestic politics. **********This correspondent, who just ended a 12-day trip through Iran, found that many militant leaders among the ruling clergy disapprove of the resumption of diplomatic ties with Western countries like France and Britain, not to mention the United States. These leaders have questioned Iran's relative liberalization in allowing a greater degree of individual freedom at home, in drifting toward financial and economic cooperation with the outside world and in recently granting amnesty to many political prisoners. **********In a view of several Iranian officials who asked not to be identified, Ayatollah Khomeini has made a practice of redressing the balance every time it tilts too much in one direction. Lately, events had been tilting toward pragmatists like the Speaker of Parliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, and President Ali Khamenei. Some also put in this category the cleric chosen as the nation's future supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri. **********The pragmatists have been promoting the policies of liberalization to the detriment of more conservative leaders such as the Interior Minister and the Prime Minister. It was not not too surprising, therefore, that Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi jumped on the episode to declare a public day of mourning today in Iran, stirring up emotions. Demonstration in London **********Although, Iranian officials interviewed tonight insisted that the demonstration by 3,000 Iranians in front of the British Embassy in Teheran today could not deteriorate into a takeover similar to the capture of the United States Embassy a decade ago, these events are bound, at the least, to freeze the improvement in Iran's relations with Western countries. **********In addition, if Mr. Rushdie is harmed, the trend among Western countries toward restoring normal relations with Iran will almost certainly stop. **********Tonight in France, for instance, the newspaper Le Monde sharply denounced the Ayatollah's call for the killing of Mr. Rushdie, saying that ''too many of the old Imam's opponents have already paid for his religious decrees with their lives.'' Imam is the title accorded to Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran as leader of the faithful. **********France has been at the forefront of Western countries - along with West Germany, Italy and Spain - whose ranking diplomats visited Iran, advocating a reconciliation with Teheran after the end of the Persian Gulf war. Setting the Agenda **********But as a French diplomat pointed out in Teheran a few days ago, the Ayatollah has ''other cats to whip'' these days, and worrying about Western public opinion is not at the top of his list of priorities. **********Two other considerations may be behind the Ayatollah's move, however. **********One is a real concern that Islamic leaders should unite in opposition to what he has always felt is a latent desire to undermine Islam in both the West and the East. The other is the fear that the controversy over the book is pitting Muslim against Muslim. **********By focusing the anger on Britain and the United States for allowing such a book to be published, some experts say, the Ayatollah has deflected what threatened to become a fight between brethren in Pakistan, in Iran or elsewhere."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/22/business/unisys-reports-loss-of-78.7-million.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1989-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 641, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Unisys Reports Loss of $78.7 Million", "print_headline": "Unisys Reports Loss of $78.7 Million", "body_text": " **********The Unisys Corporation said yesterday that it had lost $78.7 million in the first quarter, attributing the downturn to expenses incurred in introducing a line of mainframe computers. **********Analysts, who expected the loss, said they were nonetheless concerned because the company's military business had done worse than planned and because sales of Unix operating systems, which Unisys is counting on for future growth, had been disappointing. **********Because Wall Street expected the loss, the market did not react significantly.

Revenue also fell to $2.2 billion in the quarter this year from $2.37 billion in 1988 quarter. **********The downturn at the computer maker, based in Blue Bell, Pa., comes at a time of uneven performance in the computer industry. Analysts have noted that while some major companies are reporting poor results, others have remained strong. The differences reflect the industry's restructuring that is linked to a shift to less expensive computers. These computers are increasingly viewed as an alternative to minicomputers and mainframes, the analysts said. **********Unisys is trying to make its transition from proprietary mainframe computer designs to more modern work station products that run the Unix operating system. **********Analysts say they are confident that Unisys will post strong results in this year's second half, when the impact of its new mainframe computers will be felt most dramatically.

Martin, a computer industry analyst at Prudential-Bache Research. ''They're trying to work inventories down.

Consumer Reports has four million paid subscribers and its product recommendations often wield great influence. Engineering Analysis Begun **********A spokesman for the traffic safety agency confirmed the magazine's report that the Government decided earlier this year to open an engineering analysis of the Bronco II to determine whether it is safe. **********The spokesman said the investigation was begun because of petitions from the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocate group, and Consumers Union, and because of accident data that came to light during the Suzuki investigation. **********An engineering analysis is the second highest level of Federal safety investigation, just below a safety defect investigation.

Wheels Lift Off Ground **********The magazine said the Bronco II lifted two wheels off the ground several times while being driven through an obstacle course in a test drive at 42 miles an hour. It said that condition was ''a possible prelude to a rollover,'' although it noted that its test drivers were able to bring the wheels back down and finish the course. **********''We don't think any vehicle should lift both wheels so far off the ground in our tests on smooth, drive pavement,'' the magazine says in the article. **********The magazine said that on a longer obstacle course at speeds of up to 53 miles an hour, the Bronco II's ''inside front wheel lifted off the ground,'' adding: ''Deeper into the swerve, the wheel rose higher. As the Bronco II's hood rose before their eyes, our drivers lost their view of the course ahead.'' **********The other three vehicles tested performed better in the test, it said. **********Ford said it had conducted comparable accident-avoidance maneuvers and ''Bronco II did not lift even one wheel off the ground.''

ETA Systems, which recently stopped making supercomputers, dunks some of its central processors in liquid nitrogen. **********But even those measures may soon be inadequate. The fastest chips today consume about 30 watts of electricity apiece and give off almost as much heat as an incandescent light bulb of the same power. By the mid-1990's, experts predict, microprocessors will burn as much as 100 watts apiece. If left uncooled, the temperatures of such chips would quickly exceed the melting point of silicon, 1,420 degrees centigrade. To put the matter another way, such chips are expected to produce almost as much heat flow per square centimeter as the engine casing of a Saturn 5 rocket engine. **********The problem is that chips now contain many more circuits than they did several years ago, and each circuit generates a small amount of heat. ''Five years ago, 10 years ago, integration levels came to only 500 circuits per chip,'' said Rao Tummala, a senior research scientist at the International Business Machines Corporation. ''All you had to do was blow air over it to remove the heat. Now, chips have 10,000 circuits, 20,000 and more, with each circuit consuming three- or four-thousandths of a watt of electricity. Multiply all that together and you have an enormous amount of heat.'' **********In anticipation of increasingly serious heat problems, engineers at the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation in Austin, Tex., have designed a tiny radiator system for chips that they say offers 10 times the cooling power of other current methods, including immersion and various existing radiator-like devices. M.C.C., as it calls itself, is owned by a consortium of computer and electronics companies, which has first rights to license any technology developed there. **********Cray has developed a competing technology for its newest computers that pumps Fluorinert through tiny pipes that run beneath each chip. The system is believed to remove roughly the same amount of heat as the M.C.C. package. **********Fabian Pease, professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, who pioneered the basic approach in the early 1980's, said of the M.C.C. researchers: ''They look like they've got a very practical system.'' **********M.C.C.'s package, which has not yet been incorporated into a computer system. is not the first water-cooling system for chips. The International Business Machines Corporation, for example, makes a device that conducts heat from a chip through a tiny piston into a water-cooled plate. But the existing devices are relatively bulky and do not remove enough heat for the next generation of supercomputers. **********Developed under the leadership of Dennis J. Herrell, a former I.B.M. researcher, the new M.C.C. system works on the same principles as an automobile radiator. As in a car, cool water is pumped past the hottest parts of the equipment. **********But in supercomputers, limitations on space create special difficulties. On the one hand, Dr. Herrell said, every increase in ambient temperature of 10 degrees centigrade shortens the life of the chip by about half. On the other hand, chips must be packed as closely together as possible if the entire machine is to achieve its maximum speed. **********Today's fastest computers, for example, complete more than 200 million operations a second, or one operation ''cycle'' every five nanoseconds. A nanosecond is one-billionth of a second. Electricity travels through a circuit board at about half the speed of light, which translates to a speed of only one foot per two nanoseconds. As a result, even tiny increases in the breathing space between chips add sharply to the travel time of the signals and slow the machine's operation. As supercomputers approach cycle times of one nanosecond, all of their processing circuitry will have to be contained within a volume just several inches long on each side. **********Thus, wrapping the cooling pipes of M.C.C.'s package around every chip would be too bulky. Instead, the radiator looks like a flat plate that lies on top of a circuit board filled with chips. On the bottom layer of the plate, which is typically made from silicon, are hundreds of tiny microchannels, grooves about one-tenth of a millimeter wide, that carry water across each chip and absorb its heat. **********''The approach seems straightforward,'' Dr. Herrell said. ''The difficulty is in making sure that the cool water reaches each chip evenly. We've got to make sure that the water reaches all chips at the same time.'' If the water were to absorb heat from one chip before flowing to another, the last circuits to be reached would get very little cooling. **********To avoid that, the researchers came up with an arrangement inspired partly by man's circulatory system. In man, the largest arteries carry blood evenly to the body's major regions, and then a huge network of progressively smaller blood vessels distributes the blood to individual locations. **********In their cooling package, the researchers built the main veins and arteries in two layers of silicon that contain wide conduits lying directly over the microchannels. **********These conduits are simply slots cut through a silicon plate and stretch from one side of the circuit board to the other. They run perpendicular to the microchannels below. One set of these conduits is connected to an incoming stream of cool water, and the other to a channel that carries the heated liquid away. **********When the cooling package is installed as a unit over a circuit board, water is first pumped into the wide conduits on top. Following the path of least resistance, the water flows to the end of each conduit and effectively covers the board. When the conduits are filled, the water is then forced down into the much thinner microchannels below. **********As the fluid is pressed through each tiny channel, it crosses one part of a chip and absorbs its heat. A large exit conduit lies on top of the other side of each microchannel, which receives the heated water and carries it away. The result, Dr. Herrell said, is that the entire cooling element is only two-tenths of an inch thick, but removes about 10 times as much heat as the cooling packages designed by both I.B.M. and Mitsubishi of Japan, which hold the current records in the field. **********Mitsubishi encases computer chips in a hydrogen-filled ceramic package that radiates waste heat into a copper plate on top of it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/09/world/bush-aide-and-senator-clash-over-failed-coup-in-panama.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1989-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Aide and Senator Clash Over Failed Coup in Panama", "print_headline": "Bush Aide and Senator Clash Over Failed Coup in Panama", "body_text": " **********In an extraordinary public disagreement over intelligence policy, President Bush's national security adviser and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee clashed sharply today over whether President Bush has been handcuffed by Senate restrictions on covert action in Panama. **********Administration officials said Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, was voicing to the committee chairman, David L.

[ Page A7. ]  A presidential executive order bars the Central Intelligence Agency from political assassinations. Administration officials disclosed for the first time that they have interpreted the Senate's view on assassinations as barring intelligence officers from providing guidance or help to any coup that might include the death of its target. **********Mr. Scowcroft, appearing on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' did not directly discuss the Intelligence Committee's secret deliberations. But he said the executive order on assassinations, which dates to the Ford Administration, had been forced on the executive branch by lawmakers. He added, ''The Congress, by its actions and demeanor, certainly leaned us against the kinds of things they're now saying we should have done.'' **********Mr. Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat, insisted in a separate appearance on the program that the Administration has been granted all the money and authority it has sought for activities ''relating to Panama.'' **********Mr. Scowcroft replied that ''we did not get everything we have wanted'' and Administration officials said he had in mind the committee's decision earlier this year to cut the financing for a covert program aimed at influencing the Panamanian elections. **********Mr. Scowcroft said after the program that he had not meant to impugn the integrity of Mr. Boren, who said he had been referring only to operations aimed at influencing the Panamanian military. **********The issue arose as three of Mr. Bush's senior national security advisers appeared on network television programs this morning to answer blistering criticism from Capitol Hill on the coup attempt. **********In separate appearances, Secretary of State James A.

Mr. Cheney confirmed that this was true, but said the coup collapsed before any action could be taken. Noriega Ouster Still Expected **********In interviews today and Saturday, Administration officials continued to insist that General Noriega would eventually be ousted. John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview Saturday on the Cable News Network that he thought the odds were 8 to 5 that Mr. Noriega would be gone within six months. **********''The President has said he wants him out, and I can't believe that between the will of the people of Panama and the will of the people of the United States, we can't achieve that,'' Mr. Sununu said on the ''Evans and Novak'' program. ''If you want odds, I'd say 8 to 5 that he probably will be out.'' **********Referring to the Panama Defense Forces, he added, ''And I would not be surprised if the P.D.F. understands that when the President says our quarrel is not with the P.D.F. but with General Noriega that there will be continued unrest in that and an opportunity will come along in an effective way to get General Noriega out.''

That's not the business that I'm in. But what I would say is that we should keep the pressure on and we intend to do that.'' **********The United States has called for the overthrow of General Noriega so that he can be brought to the United States to face trial on Federal drug charges. **********Administration officials continued to disclose new details of the coup attempt to deflect criticism of bungling. **********Responding to the report today in The Washington Post, Mr. Cheney said in an appearance on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' that as the coup was faltering, he had given General Thurman authority to collect General Noriega from the rebels, if this could be done without using force. **********Separately, officials said the Administration decided to invite the rebels to ask for United States intervention. The rebels were also to be told to declare their support for democracy. **********The officials said General Thurman was asked to draw up contingency plans to encircle the compound where General Noriega was thought to be held so that he could be taken into American custody. **********Administration officials said the message was never passed on because the coup ended. **********The Administration began to respond to these statements Friday, when Mr. Cheney appeared at a closed meeting of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees and reminded the lawmakers of the Congressional objections to previously proposed covert operations in Panama. **********A senator said that William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine was so angered by this remark that he inserted in the hearing record copies of the presidential intelligence orders on Panama that had been approved by the committee. **********The committee does not have the authority to quash a covert action, but its objections have usually been sufficient to dissuade administrations from proceeding.

The radio reports indicate that 100,000 people demonstrated in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province; 40,000 marched for democracy last week in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, while the Guangdong provincial radio reported that 30,000 students marched in the port city of Canton. **********News reports from Inner Mongolia said that ''more than 15,000 students from all institutes of higher learning'' held street demonstrations on Thursday to support the student hunger strike in Beijing. **********The radio reports indicate that there have been demonstrations of more than 10,000 people in at least eight other provinces: Gansu, Guangxi, Hunan, Jilin, Liaoning, Qinghai, Shaanxi and Zhejiang. Rally in Economic Showplace **********Reuters reported that more than 100,000 protesters marched today through the thriving new city of Shenzhen, on the Hong Kong border, chanting for democracy and demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Li Peng. The marchers, organized by the Shenzhen University students' union, represented about one-fifth of the population of the city, a showplace set up by the Chinese Government to attract foreign investment and trade. **********The radio broadcasts were transcribed by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, an arm of the United States Government that routinely monitors foreign broadcasts. They reported that marchers in the provinces have been shouting messages like ''Support the patriotic students,'' ''Long live democracy,'' ''Get rid of old-man politics,'' ''Mama, we are not wrong,'' ''Eradicate privilege,'' ''Down with official racketeering,'' and ''Unless the official profiteers are toppled, the state will collapse.'' **********In many provinces, there have been sit-ins and hunger strikes by students and young intellectuals demanding dialogues with officials of local government agencies and local Communist parties. In Zhengzhou in Henan Province, the radio reported that students ''swarmed into the courtyard'' of the provincial government building and presented petitions complaining about ''official profiteering'' and other ''anomalies.'' Reports Have Approving Tone **********Radio and television news reports in Beijing often focus on the actions and statements of national political leaders. The provincial radio broadcasts have given much more detail about local protests, and the tone is, in some cases, remarkably tolerant of the protesters. **********For example, on Thursday, the Hunan radio reported, ''Tens of thousands of students, teachers, workers, journalists and citizens staged processions in various cities of our province to express their support for the patriotic action of Beijing's university students.'' **********The mental and physical anguish of the hunger strikers in Beijing ''has aroused the serious concern of people in our province,'' the Hunan radio said. **********At Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province, the radio reported that more than 10,000 students took to the streets on Friday to support the uprising in Beijing. Some went to the gate of the provincial government headquarters to demand a dialogue with local leaders. Chants Against Corruption **********In Hunan Province, the radio reported that ''some of the 200 students on hunger strike fainted'' in the 90-degree heat on Friday. In Jilin Province, students from more than 20 colleges and universities marched through the capital, Changchun, shouting slogans like ''Down with bureaucracy!'' and ''Eradicate corruption!'' **********In Xining in Qinghai Province, the local governor, besieged by students, workers, scientists and technicians, declared, ''We support the students' activities and will faithfully relay your demands to the central authorities.'' Several hundred local journalists sent an open letter to the Governor demanding that he investigate the ''business operations and profiteering of the sons and daughters of top leaders.'' **********In Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, thousands of students blocked a Yangtze River bridge and marched last week under banners affirming their support for the Beijing students. They also shouted slogans demanding greater freedom of the press, the local radio said. **********Likewise, in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province, radio news reports said students from more than a dozen colleges marched in the streets and presented local officials with petitions supporting the democracy demonstrations in Beijing. **********Other radio broadcasts reported demonstrations in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian and in the coastal provinces of Shandong and Fujian."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/02/business/bush-seeks-an-edge-on-gains-tax.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1989-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1028, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Seeks An Edge on Gains Tax", "print_headline": "Bush Seeks An Edge on Gains Tax", "body_text": " **********Seeking to regain a tactical advantage in his fight for a cut in the capital gains tax, President Bush is seriously considering proposals to make permanent the $16 billion in automatic spending cuts that took effect on Oct. 16, Republican Congressional leaders said today. **********The capital gains tax and the spending cuts have become linked in the Congressional maneuvering over how to fashion a deficit-reduction plan that would undo the spending cuts and at the same time permit final action on a number of other measures attached to the House version of that plan. **********Those measures include modifications to the catastrophic health insurance program and a temporary cut in the capital gains tax. Reductions in Medicare **********The spending cuts - $8 billion from the Pentagon budget and $8 billion from a variety of domestic programs - have already reduced reimbursements for Medicare beneficiaries by 2 percent and would eventually force sharp reductions in education grants. **********Over time, they would also mean cuts in military personnel on active duty and could require layoffs of other Federal employees, including drug-enforcement agents, law-enforcement personnel and air traffic controllers. **********The cuts were required under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced-budget law because Congress failed to meet the law's deadline for devising its own deficit-reduction plan. **********The Republican leaders who met with Mr. Bush on Tuesday to discuss tax and budget strategy said the President had made no decision on whether to let the automatic budget cuts stand. But they said his top advisers - Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and John H. Sununu, the chief of staff - were strongly in favor of such a course. Mr. Darman has publicly urged this for some time. Advantages for White House **********Allowing the spending cuts to become permanent could help the White House meet next year's targets for cutting the deficit and also assist it in tactical maneuvering this year to get a vote on cutting the capital gains tax. **********Congressional Democrats have proposed a deal in which the deficit-reduction plan would include changes in the health insurance program and the extension of a variety of tax breaks popular in both parties. **********Republicans contend that if Mr. Bush were to veto such a Congressional deficit-reduction plan or simply to tell Congress there was no need for one, Democrats would have to deal with the health insurance program and the tax breaks in a separate tax bill. Under those circumstances, some Republicans think they would gain the leverage they now lack to force a Senate vote on cutting the capital gains tax. **********Administration officials and Congressional Republicans said the option had become more attractive to President Bush in recent days because of new calculations suggesting that the effect of permanent cuts on the Pentagon budget would not be as severe as previously thought. **********Administration and Congressional officials said Mr. Sununu had been presented with the numbers and believed they demonstrated that the Pentagon ''could survive'' the automatic spending cuts for a year. **********''Sequester has some attractive benefits to it,'' the White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters today, using the technical term for the automatic spending cuts. ''We are looking at what it would do. We are planning it into the economies of all the departments, including the Pentagon, and we think we can handle it.'' **********Senate Democratic leaders said that they take the Adminstration's threat of a permanent sequester seriously, but that it would not be enough to change any minds on a capital gains tax cut. ''We simply are not going to be blackjacked into voting for it on the basis of a sequester,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committtee. **********''It is clear that the White House is coming more and more to wanting a sequester,'' said Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee and chief sponsor of a plan to cut the capital gains tax rate permanently. 'Whole New Ball Game' **********Mr. Packwood, who conceded that Republicans are currently at a tactical disadvantage, said that if Mr. Bush were to agree to make the spending cuts permanent, ''it's a whole new ball game.'' **********Mr. Packwood said the Administration had determined that even with the automatic budget cuts in effect, the amount the Pentagon will spend in the current fiscal year will be only $3 billion less than it would spend if the cuts were rescinded. Initially, he said, the estimates had indicated a gap of $12 billion to $15 billion. **********Congressional budget specialists confirmed those estimates, adding however, that because much of the Pentagon's spending is planned on a multi-year basis, automatic cuts this year could pose serious budget difficulties for the Pentagon in fiscal 1991. **********Mr. Sasser disputed the Administration's calculations on the Pentagon budget for the current fiscal year and said the effects of making the automatic spending cuts permanent would be more damaging to the Pentagon than the Administration is now suggesting. Report From Gingrich **********Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip and one of those who attended the Tuesday meeting with the President, said Mr. Bush was not prepared to accept a deficit-reduction plan that ''did not meet his goals.'' **********But Mr. Gingrich said he thought the President would sign a deficit plan if he had an agreement from Senate Democrats that there would be a vote on the substance of a capital gains tax cut proposal. **********Although Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Packwood clearly favor the idea of making the automatic spending cuts permanent, that view is not shared by two leading Senate Republicans -the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, and the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Pete Domenici of New Mexico."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/16/business/key-rates-443789.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 190, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY RATES", "print_headline": "KEY RATES", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/business/investing-will-biotechnology-finally-deliver.html": {"writer_name": "Echo Garrett", "pub_date": "1989-09-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 997, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Will Biotechnology Finally Deliver?", "print_headline": "INVESTING; Will Biotechnology Finally Deliver?", "body_text": " **********INVESTING in biotechnology stocks is a little like picking up mercury with your fingers: just when you think you have it, it slips away. **********''A lot of investors still aren't looking at biotechnology companies,'' said Michael Sorell, M.D., a drug analyst at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. ''In many cases, these are companies with no dividends, no earnings and not enough capitalization.'' **********Still, in the last few months several analysts have added a few biotechnology stocks to their buy lists. After all, many of the stocks are trading at more reasonable prices these days. With investors disappointed by the industry's general inability to make money, few biotech stocks have returned to the frothy levels reached in 1986 and early 1987 - before the stock market crash. In fact, Montgomery Securities said that at the end of last year, the 50 biotechnology stocks it tracks were trading at an average of 50 percent below their peak prices. **********Biotechnology companies that make therapeutic drugs are among analysts' favorites. While stocks of biotech concerns in the diagnostics and agricultural fields have been sluggish this year, those of biotherapeutics have generally fared as well as or better than the Standand & Poor's 500, said Denise M. Gilbert, an analyst at Montgomery. **********And that trend should continue. Dr. Sorell, for one, urges investors to reconsider these companies because the Food and Drug Administration has approved some of their products, enabling them to pay down debt and strengthen their balance sheets. Many of the lawsuits over patents, he added, have been resolved, reducing the competitive risks. In addition, analysts point out, several companies are about to announce the results of late-stage clinical trials on products with blockbuster potential. In fact, over the next two years, the Food & Drug Administration is expected to approve 20 new biotherapeutic drugs, according to Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. As of January, he said, the agency had approved only eight. **********Dr. Sorell recommends stocks in three companies with biotherapeutic drugs: the Amgen Corporation, Biogen Inc. and the Chiron Corporation. **********Although Chiron has several therapy drugs and vaccines in the pipeline, its diagnostic test for hepatitis C makes its stock attractive to analysts. The company should release results from last-stage clinical trials this September and introduce the product in 1990 into a worldwide market pegged by analysts at about $250 million. Chiron should earn $1.33 a share in fiscal 1991, up from a loss of $1.32 a share in fiscal 1988, said Ms. Gilbert, who recommends buying the stock at any price up to $33 a share. On Friday, Chiron closed at 24 3/4. **********Biogen has already introduced a major product, interferon, a cancer treatment therapy with a potential market of $200 million a year. Under an agreement with the Schering-Plough Corporation, which is licensed to market the product, Biogen receives a 10 percent royalty on sales. This year, interferon should generate at least $70 million in revenues for Biogen. And by 1991, the product should help lift the company into the black, with earnings of 13 cents a share, up from a loss of $1.17 a share in 1988, said Jeff R. Swarz, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who believes shares will climb to 20 over the next 12 months. On Friday, Biogen's shares closed at 13 1/2. **********Amgen should has begin reaping the benefits of its first product in the early 1990's. This summer, the company released erythropoietin, a treatment for anemia that could generate a lucrative $225 million annually in the United States alone, said Ms. Gilbert, who recommends the stock. Prudential-Bache estimates that the company will earn $1.50 a share in fiscal 1991, ending in March, up from a loss of 49 cents a share in fiscal 1989. **********However, two pending lawsuits against Amgen make it a risky stock. Genetics Institute Inc., another biotechnology company, has sued Amgen for patent infringement, and Johnson & Johnson is taking the company to court for breach of contract. ''They could lose all rights to their only drug,'' said Robert Kupor of Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********While Mr. Kupor recommends the stock only if the company settles the patent suit, Ms. Gilbert, for one, believes Amgen has ''a strong and defensible position'' in both cases. And Prudential-Bache believes the stock has already fully accounted for the company's legal problems. With the patent trial now under way and the contract suit coming to trial this fall, Amgen shares in the last several weeks have dropped 10 points. On Friday, they closed on 39 5/8. But Prudential-Bache believes they could climb to 55 or 60 over the next 18 months. **********Mr. Kupor likes shares of Centocor Inc. because they are far less risky. ''It's totally washed out and due for a rebound,'' he said. ''They went out of fashion over a year ago because they had slower than expected clinical development and decided to plow profits back into R.&D.'' On Friday, the stock closed at 18 3/4, down from the mid-40's in 1987. **********Although the company is expected to release results this fall from late-phase clinical trials on a monoclonal antibody for septic shock, which is linked with surgery and affects about 200,000 Americans a year, it has been overshadowed by the Xoma Corporation. Xoma has received more attention because it has lined up Pfizer Inc. to market its septic-shock therapy, Mr. Kupor said. But he believes Centocor's product will be preferred to Xoma's because it uses human antibodies rather than those from mice, which patients are more likely to have a reaction against. **********Still, Prudential-Bache's Mr. Weisbrod says the difficulties of developing a product from human cells have put Centocor's product nine months behind Xoma's."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/world/most-hungarians-enjoy-freedom-from-politics.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1989-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 929, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Hungarians Enjoy Freedom From Politics", "print_headline": "Most Hungarians Enjoy Freedom From Politics", "body_text": " **********The vast majority of Hungarians are using their new political freedom to stay out of politics. **********The ruling party, which changed its name last month from Communist to Socialist, has since then lost at least 690,000 of its 720,000 members. They used the freedom of choice offered when the party invited them to exchange Communist membership cards for Socialist documents by declining to do so. **********Even so, said Istvan Degen, who heads the office of Rezso Nyers, the party president, ''we are the biggest party in Hungary.'' **********That is true. The other contenders for the top claim smaller memberships. The resuscitated Smallholders Party, a major one before World War II, says it has 22,000 members. The Democratic Forum announced at its congress last month that its roster stood at 20,154. Elections Due by Spring **********The Forum, a party that emphasizes Hungary's nationalist heritage, is the first and most firmly anchored of the opposition groups that have mushroomed since the Communists' political monopoly began to wear thin two years ago. Even officials of the former Communist Party expect the Forum to emerge as the largest party in Hungary's first free parliamentary elections since 1947, due to be held by next spring. **********Attila Agh, a political scientist of the ruling party's Historical Institute, said he had counted 47 parties now in existence. In the last month alone, he said, 14 had sprung up. But even a generous count, accepting the larger groups' unverifiable membership claims, suggests that not many more than 100,000 persons in a nation of 10.6 million well-educated people belong to any political grouping, including the ruling party. **********The Communist Youth Movement, which reorganized earlier this year to free itself from party control, has suffered a shrinkage comparable to that of its parent party. **********Leaders of the opposition groups have been covering their evident disappointment over the size of their membership by emphasizing that the increase in the rolls is steady. Like officials of the former Communist Party, they assert that a referendum on Nov. 26 and subsequent elections for president and Parliament will prove that their electoral appeal is far bigger than their rolls would indicate. Wearied by Communism **********Opposition figures, as well as some of the freshly converted ex- Communists, say also that 44 years of all phases of life being made political by the Communists have wearied people. They contend that only when traditional European ways have been restored by a freely elected Parliament will Hungarians re-enter the political arena. **********But some Hungarians as well as foreign diplomats believe that most Hungarians are not only weary of Communist politics but distrustful of politics and politicians altogether. They believe that what concerns most Hungarians is the decline in a standard of living that a decade ago was as high as any in a Communist country. **********This week, the public was stirred by two Government announcements. One raised the import duty on cars. Hungary produces none of its own. The other cut the amount of convertible currency that Hungarians are allowed to finance their now unlimited right to travel abroad. **********The standard of living that still permits a sizable economic elite such frills as cars and travel has so declined for the majority that by official statistics about a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. **********The cost of living rises steadily as double-digit inflation shrinks the value of the prevailing low wages. The promised economic reform means in its first stages that Government subsidies to hold down the prices of basic necessities will be abolished to make prices reflect real cost, and unproductive enterprises will be shut down, causing unemployment. Heavy Foreign Debt **********A foreign debt of $18.5 billion - the highest per capita in Europe - weighs heavily on all economic decision-making, because the payments will eat deeply into export earnings for many years to come. **********''The Government and the opposition seem to say the same thing,'' said Miklos Vasarhelyi, an aide and codefendant of Imre Nagy, the Prime Minister executed for leading the 1956 revolt against Soviet and Communist domination, in a conversation earlier this year. '' 'You have to work more and better, and if you do, we guarantee you that in the next five years your life will be worse and worse every year. ' This is not a very appealing program.'' **********The real gains in political liberalization, the restoration of many human rights and historic truths long denied are seized by Hungarians as their due. Because they are largely the result of waning Communist Party authority, Hungarians look up to no political leader whom they might follow in gratitude. **********In many conversations, Hungarians from varied social levels said that what the new political freedoms have brought are largely gestures, which are welcome, but no changes in their material lives. **********They list symbolic acts like the ceremonial reburial of Mr. Nagy, the change in name of the party, removal of the Communist ''people's'' from the official name of the ''Hungarian People's Republic,'' disappearance of Communist stars from public buildings and a scheduled referendum to restore the historic national emblem. **********Hungarians are fond of drama and symbolic gestures, an intellectual of the ruling party said, but the next government, of whatever party, will have to find a way to offer substance to this skeptical nation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/12/world/2-chinese-businessmen-get-death-sentences-for-theft.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Chinese Businessmen Get Death Sentences for Theft", "print_headline": "2 Chinese Businessmen Get Death Sentences for Theft", "body_text": " **********Two businessmen were sentenced to death today for theft and embezzlement, as part of the Government's crackdown on economic crimes. **********Tonight's television news programs showed the sentencing before a large public meeting held in a gymnasium.

Warnings From Congress **********In December several members of Congress warned Mr. Bush not to start his term with a divisive proposal to add offensive weapons to what they described as ''the already teeming Saudi arsenal.'' They said such sales were not justified and could interfere with the quest for a negotiated settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. **********But Bush Administration officials said the Saudis would just go elsewhere to buy similar arms if the United States turned down the latest requests. They noted that Saudi Arabia recently signed an agreement to buy dozens of aircraft and other military equipment from Britain over the next 10 years. **********The list, giving a preview of possible arms sales, must be submitted to Congress each year under a law adopted in 1976 as an amendment to the Arms Export Control Act. The White House must send Congress formal notification of each proposed sale, and the sale goes through unless Congress passes a law to block it. In practice, the White House often revises an arms sales proposal to allay Congressional concerns. Some Prospective Buyers **********The State Department list gives these details of prospective sales: *********** Egypt is likely to buy 150 Hawk antiaircraft missiles, 50 armored personnel carriers, 24 AH-1W helicopter gunships and two radar systems used to locate artillery and rocket launchers. In addition, Egypt may buy 6,000 rounds of tank ammunition and special equipment to upgrade its tanks. *********** Kuwait is expected to buy 1,500 TOW antitank missiles, 7 multiple-launch rocket systems and 200 of the latest battle tank, the M1A1. *********** Israel is expected to buy 200 Stinger antiaircraft missiles, three AN/TPQ-37 radars and four reconnaissance helicopters. The Administration is also prepared to sell Israel electronic equipment to upgrade about 50 F-15 fighters. *********** The United Arab Emirates are planning to buy 40 F/A-18 Hornets as well as 12 Apache helicopter gunships and 12 155-millimeter howitzers. *********** Bahrain is likely to buy 40 Maverick-G air-to-surface missiles, used to blow up tanks and bunkers.

Most of the positions taken by the Reagan Administration have been reconfirmed by Mr. Bush, officials said. **********The Administration has been weighing new measures on land-based missiles, like abandoning a Reagan Administration proposal to ban mobile missiles. Ban on Mobile Missiles **********But key participants at the National Security Council meeting today were said to oppose abandoning the ban on mobile missiles before further consultations with Congress and additional examination of verification questions. **********The new suggestion by the Joint Chiefs on air-launched cruise missiles addresses one of the thorny issues in the negotiations. **********Moscow has insisted that each strategic bomber be counted as having the maximum number of cruise missiles that it can carry. The Reagan Administration, in contrast, contended that only loose limits should be set on air-launched cruise missiles, asserting that relatively slow cruise missiles are less threatening than faster ballistic missiles. **********Under the Reagan Administration approach, different types of bombers would be counted as carrying a specific number of cruise missiles even though they might actually carry more of the weapons. No Formal Decisions **********But Administration officials said that under the Joint Chiefs' proposal, each bomber would be counted as carrying the number of cruise missiles that it is equipped with. Such an approach would appear to move the United States toward the Soviet position, though some significant differences over these weapons would remain. **********A senior Administration said no formal decisions were made at the National Security Council meeting. The official said some strategic arms issues now before the Administration might not be made before the talks resume on Monday. **********No major changes are expected at this time in the Bush Administration's stand on space-based anti-missile systems and sea-launched cruise missiles, two major points of dispute between Washington and Moscow in the arms negotiations. **********The National Security Council meeting today followed a lengthy review of strategic arms issues during which Bush Administration has considered a host of proposals. Ideas under discussion by Administration specialists have range from modest changes to the American negotiating stance to a farreaching suggestion to ban all land-based missiles with multiple warheads over 15 years. Strategic Arms Treaty **********A senior Administration official said today that the United States had no timetable for finishing a strategic arms treaty, which was largely completed during the Reagan Administration. In contrast, President Bush has said that he hopes a new agreement on cutting conventional arms can be completed within a year. **********Officials noted that key decisions in the deliberations on conventional arms, which produced a surprise proposal at the NATO summit meeting last month, had been confined to a few senior Administration officials. The same pattern may apply on strategic arms, they said. **********Whether to propose new measures on land-based missiles, the Soviet Union's strong suit in strategic forces, has been a focus of Administration deliberations. Ideas under consideration have included deeper limits on Soviet SS-18 missiles and lifting the ban on single-warhead mobile missiles while prohibiting multiple-warhead versions. **********Pentagon officials have been reluctant to lift the ban on mobile missiles until it is clear if Congress will support the program to put MX missiles on rail cars and to develop a new single-warhead mobile Midgetman missiles. Before he took office, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, was sharply critical of the ban, arguing that it blocked the United States from fielding less vulerable weapons. **********On another issue, officials said the Joint Chiefs had differed with civilian Pentagon officials over whether to limit missiles that are not deployed. The chiefs have reportedly opposed limits on undeployed missiles, arguing that the United States has many such weapons used as spares and for training, among other purposes. Civilian Pentagon officials favor strict limit on such weapons to guard against possible Soviet cheating."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/13/business/wpp-said-to-be-near-ogilvy-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WPP Said To Be Near Ogilvy Deal", "print_headline": "WPP Said To Be Near Ogilvy Deal", "body_text": " **********The WPP Group appears close to an agreement to buy the Ogilvy Group in a deal that would create the second-largest advertising and marketing company in the world. **********WPP, a London-based company whose holdings include the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, and Ogilvy, the parent of Ogilvy & Mather, confirmed that they were formally discussing WPP's offer. **********A spokesman for WPP, who asked not to be identified, said a deal was likely. ''It's not at the point where they're saying, 'Let's let the lawyers draw up the papers,' but it's probably close to that,'' the spokesman said. Some Talk of a Buyout A public announcement about the negotiations could come at Ogilvy's annual meeting Tuesday in Manhattan. But people with knowledge of the talks would not rule out the possibility of a leveraged buyout by Ogilvy managers or the emergence of another suitor. **********In a short statement released in New York, Ogilvy said only that it had ''entered into discussions with WPP Group P.L.C. concerning the possible acquisition by WPP of Ogilvy for cash in a negotiated transaction.'' **********A representative of Ogilvy refused to comment on whether a deal was imminent but cautioned that hurdles remained. ''This could well break down,'' the representative said. **********But disclosure that the two sides are talking ''means it's a done deal,'' said one industry executive who had discussed the takeover fight with both WPP and Ogilvy officials. ''It's only a matter of price,'' the executive said. Ogilvy said in its statement that WPP's ''willingness'' to increase its offer to more than $50 a share had cleared the way for formal talks. Discussion of Price **********The WPP spokesman said the two sides would probably agree to a price of ''between $50 and $55 per share.'' **********And Richard Dale, an advertising analyst with James Capel, a London brokerage, speculated that a deal would eventually be struck at $52 or $53 a share. **********This would make the price for Ogilvy about $830 million, by far the most ever paid for an advertising company. Two years ago, WPP paid $566 million for Thompson's parent, the JWT Group, in the first hostile takeover of an advertising company. **********A merger of Ogilvy and WPP would create a company with gross revenues of $2 billion on billings of $13.5 billion, slightly behind Saatchi & Saatchi, which is based in London. Management Issues **********Advertising executives familiar with the talks said the two sides were also negotiating on management issues. **********One apparent concern has been the title and role of David Ogilvy, the 78-year-old founder of the company that bears his name. Although retired and living in a chateau southwest of Paris that dates, in part, to the 12th century, he remains on the company's board. The support of Mr. Ogilvy, whose rules on ad writing and agency management are the bedrock of the agency, is considered crucial to the success of an Ogilvy-WPP merger. **********But representatives of Ogilvy and WPP said Mr. Ogilvy's role in the talks should not be overemphasized. **********Campaign, Britain's advertising trade magazine, reported on Thursday that Martin Sorrell, the 44-year-old chairman of WPP, had been assiduously wooing Mr. Ogilvy. The magazine said Mr. Sorrell had even offered to change the name of his holding company from WPP to Ogilvy, and to make Mr. Ogilvy the chairman. **********People inside WPP, and some outside the company who are familiar with Mr. Sorrell's plans, said he was unlikely to place the Ogilvy banner over his holding company because that would hurt morale and business at J. Walter Thompson. **********Mr. Sorrell has asserted in the past that advertising and marketing companies are best managed by financial holding companies whose names are distinct from those of subsidiaries. 'No Hint' Last Week **********Some people close to Ogilvy expressed surprise that a deal with WPP might be imminent. As recently as last week, one former executive said, Ogilvy officials were searching for ways to remain independent. ''There was no hint then'' that Ogilvy was willing to negotiate a merger, the executive said. **********Many of Ogilvy's large clients, including Duracell, Cotton Inc. and Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, have expressed reservations about, or opposition to, a merger. These clients have cited long, fruitful business relationships with Ogilvy & Mather. **********Joseph J. Doherty, the vice president for marketing communications of the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, a longtime Ogilvy client that opposes a merger with WPP, said, ''I don't think any advertiser thinks these mergers are any good.'' **********But Mr. Doherty said the realities of business meant that most clients would remain with the agency. **********''I have commercials in production,'' he said. ''I'm working on a media plan for the fall. Do you want to throw that out and mess up your business? No.'' **********Last weekend, WPP, whose other holdings include Hill & Knowlton, the world's largest public relations agency, and three dozen other companies in fields like market research, sales promotion and product design, told Ogilvy it was willing to pay $50 a share, or slightly more than $800 million. In addition to Ogilvy & Mather, Ogilvy Group owns the Scali, McCabe, Sloves and Fallon McElligott ad agencies and the world's largest direct-marketing company. It also has sizable market research and public relations divisions. **********WPP had originally offered $45 a share, or $730 million, in a letter on April 28 from Mr. Sorrell to Ogilvy's chairman, Kenneth Roman. Heavy Stock Trading **********Ogilvy's release of the letter, which Mr. Sorrell had insisted was private, led to heavy trading in Ogilvy's stock. The price of its shares rose more than 50 percent in less than a week. **********In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Ogilvy's shares rose $1.375 on news of the negotiations, closing at $53.25. Ogilvy was the sixth-most-active over-the-counter issue, with 1.4 million shares changing hands. **********WPP's stock, meanwhile, fell 5 pence a share on the London Stock Exchange, closing at 602 pence, or about $10, after two weeks of steady decline. Some people in the financial community have expressed skepticism that Mr. Sorrell could finance the acquisition without diluting WPP's earnings per share. **********One of WPP's largest shareholders, Mike Luckwell, chairman of Parallel Media, a British communications company, dismissed those doubts, saying, ''Any suggestion of skepticism about the ability of WPP to fund such an operation is rubbish.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/11/business/chase-medical-trading.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chase Medical Trading", "print_headline": "Chase Medical Trading", "body_text": " **********Trading in Chase Medical Group resumed yesterday, with more than 50,000 shares changing hands over the counter at prices of $4 to $6.50 each.

The speech, which took more than two hours to deliver, brimmed with the spirit of centralization instead of liberalization, and it contained little of the enthusiasm for rapid economic change that for most of the last few years has inspired the Government's vision of China's future. **********China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, who has presided over that period of change, did not attend today's session. There was no official explanation for his absence. 'Never Return to Old Mode' **********In his speech, Mr. Li, a 60-year-old Soviet-trained engineer, also called for a continuation of some market-oriented changes, including development of stock markets. But his stress was on restoring Government control over the economy and the need to extend the current economic retrenchment for at least two more years before restructuring could be effectively resumed. **********''We shall never return to the old economic mode characterized by overcentralized, excessive and rigid control,'' Mr. Li said. ''Nor shall we adopt private ownership, negating the socialist system.'' **********In tone, the speech was very different from the report of a year ago. At that time, Mr. Li called for China to ''put reform at the center of all our undertakings,'' while today he appeared to believe that the back burner would be more appropriate. In Preparation Since January **********The Government Work Report, as the speech is formally known, presumably reflects the views not only of Mr. Li but of a majority of the nation's top leaders as well. Chinese familiar with the speech say it has been in preparation since at least January, and many drafts have circulated among top leaders so that they can make suggestions and revisions. **********The speech appeared to reflect not a reawakening of ideological fondness for Maoist Communism, but deep alarm at the economic chaos and social unrest that have emerged in the last year or so as the Government lost control over parts of the booming economy. **********As Mr. Li spoke before 3,000 delegates to the National People's Congress, China's legislature, most of the nation's top leaders, except for Mr. Deng, sat behind him on the rostrum. The party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, was there and so was the former party leader, Hu Yaobang, who was ousted in January 1987 after student demonstrations in major cities. **********The speech was not entirely a surprise, as China's leaders have acknowledged since late last summer that the central Government needed to slow down growth and regain a grasp over the economy before the march to the market could be resumed. Even many Western economists agree that such a retrenchment was necessary to prepare the country for further changes, and that central planning was necessary to foster a banking and legal system and improve China's physical infrastructure. **********But Mr. Li took this theme somewhat further. For example, last fall China's leaders suggested that a delay of up to two years might be necessary in the nation's adoption of market-oriented policies, while today's speech suggested that the delay might last more than two years and that it would involve not just a postponement of economic changes but a partial rollback of some that already have been adopted. **********The delegates in the cavernous Great Hall of the People were mostly silent during the speech. But they applauded loudly when Mr. Li implicity warned Western countries not to support the independence movement in Tibet. **********''Any foreign force's support for such separatist activities, under whatever pretext, constitutes an outrageous interference in China's internal affairs and will absolutely not be tolerated,'' Mr. Li said, then repeating the statement to further applause. A Focus on Economics **********The speech focused on economics, however, and especially on what Mr. Li seemed to regard as two major related problems: the loss of power from the central Government to the provinces in recent years, and the risks that China will face if it embraces the chaos and inequality of market economics. **********Mr. Li stressed the need for the central Government to maintain control of the economy and prevent corruption and profiteering as well as unproductive investments. He said the Government would continue to force companies to cut their links with local officials and to improve their accounting systems, ''so as to put an end to the present state of chaos.'' **********He also called for measures to redress the growing ''unfair distribution of income,'' and he said that the state would tighten its control over prices as a way of restricting inflation. **********Most of the work report was expressed in vague language, exhorting people to behave better rather than outlining how this would be achieved. Given the increased willingness of local officials and individuals to ignore instructions from the central Government, Mr. Li's relatively stringent socialist vision may well be quietly but effectively defied by the hundreds of thousands of tiny shops and factories that are privately or collectively run and that are responsible for much of the chaos that Mr. Li warned against."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/business/prospects-pushing-up-pay.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1989-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 723, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prospects; Pushing Up Pay", "print_headline": "Prospects; Pushing Up Pay", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department's report early this month on January employment was seen by some economists as one more sign that wage increases are about to accelerate, adding to inflationary pressures. Hourly wages, for example, rose at an annual rate of more than 7.6 percent. Also noteworthy was the addition of 408,000 to the nation's payrolls in January, an unexpectedly sharp increase that was only partly explained by unseasonably mild weather. Four experts discuss where wages are headed.  Daniel Mitchell  Director, Institute of Industrial Relations and professor in the Graduate School of Management at U.C.L.A. **********We will stay on this cliff for the next six months, perhaps for the rest of the year. We are not at the flash point yet, but you see symptoms. The flash point for wage inflation is around 5 percent unemployment, which last occurred in the 1960's. There are similarities between today's labor market and that of the 60's, but we don't have the huge wave of young people entering the economy that we had in the 1970's, nor external inflation influences like OPEC's oil price increases. **********There were signs of pressure in 1988, such as increasing rank-and-file union resistance to concessions. You saw it at Chrysler, General Electric and in the rubber and trucking industries. I would look at the steel industry for signs of accelerating wage inflation; steel unions were battered by concessions in the past. An end to concessions would be an inflationary sign, even if there are no significant wage increases. Also watch the telephone company contracts this summer.  Charles Lieberman  Managing director, financial markets research, Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corporation. **********I am expecting wage inflation of 6 to 7 percent by the end of the year. One characteristic of this expansion that is unlike prior ones is that tightness is coming not just from an excess of demand over normal growth in supply, but there are also adverse demographics. There's a baby bust following the baby boom and the flow of women into the work -force is slowing. **********Natural labor force growth now provides about 135,000 potential workers a month. The pool of unemployed that can be hired without unusual wage inducements is probably down to 650,000 to 750,000. The unemployment rate should drop in the coming months, perhaps sharply. At current growth rates, we should exhaust the supply of excess labor by mid-year.  Sheldon Friedman  Research director, the United Automobile Workers. **********Wages have been increasing more rapidly, but a lot of it is health insurance costs and payroll taxes. The Fed is tightening up on monetary policy based on what I think is a faulty analysis treating inflation in certain sectors as general inflation. Being below 5.5 percent unemployment today just isn't the same thing as it was 15 years ago. There are far more involuntary part-time workers and workers so discouraged they have given up looking, which means a lot more slack. There were 2.3 million involuntary part-time workers in 1973 when the official rate was below 5 percent. Today there are 5.3 million such workers. There were 689,000 discouraged workers in 1973 and 951,000 today. There's much more danger of a recession from the Fed raising interest rates than wage-led inflation.  Audrey Freedman  Economist, The Conference Board. **********Even though the unemployment rate was falling, general wage increases were smaller each year of the recovery until 1987. Then they flattened. In the second half of '88, they headed up. I see gradual pressure developing, but not a wage explosion. I expect wages to be climbing at a 6 percent rate by year-end. **********One moderating factor is that employers don't imitate increases in other industries or areas of the country where things are tight. There's no longer an acceptance that union settlements should lead everything. Competitive pressure won't allow it. With less regulation and more foreign competition, it's riskier to have high labor costs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/10/business/bonwit-s-owner-files-for-bankruptcy.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1989-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonwit's Owner Files for Bankruptcy", "print_headline": "Bonwit's Owner Files for Bankruptcy", "body_text": " **********The Bonwit Teller and B.

W. Mays, filed for Chapter 11 protection, operations were substantially scaled back to reduce costs, and many employees were let go. Korvettes closed. **********No totals on liabilities or assets were available last night as the lawyers for Hooker presented the bankruptcy documents to the court. Hooker is represented in its bankruptcy by the New York law firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz & Mendelsohn. Shipments Cut **********Bonwit Teller, which will reach its 100th anniversary in 1995, has not had an easy time of it in the last two decades. Under various owners - first Genesco Inc., then the Allied Stores Corporation and the Campeau Corporation - its expansion was slowed, while similar chains like Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor opened stores across the country. For a time in the 1970's, Bonwit even lost its flagship store in New York, but under the Allied ownership it reopened around the corner in a building adjacent to Trump Plaza. After Campeau acquired Allied in 1986, Campeau sold Bonwit to Hooker in April 1987 for $101 million. **********Founded more than 100 years ago, B. Altman was for years a small profit maker as part of the Altman Foundation, named for the company founder, Benjamin Altman, to finance humanitarian projects in New York City. **********Altman's staid, mannerly approach appealed to New Yorkers and tourists who favored an old-fashioned department store. In the early 1980's, the foundation sold the Altman stores to a real estate investor group that reduced the size of the store and built an office complex on the Madison Avenue side of the flagship building. Hooker bought Altman's retail operations a year ago from an investor group that bought the operations from Allied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/04/business/south-korean-debt-falls.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Korean Debt Falls", "print_headline": "South Korean Debt Falls", "body_text": " **********South Korea's foreign debt declined by $4.4 billion during 1988, the Bank of Korea reported today.

Higher Expenses Cited **********David McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance, attributed the slide in United States profits to higher product and marketing expenses. He also said domestic results were hurt because most of the year had fewer sales of the Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar sports coupes. Ford introduced new Thunderbird and Cougar models at the end of 1988. **********Because of the dip in United States automotive profits, Ford said its hourly employees would get smaller profit-sharing checks than they received last year. Mr. McCammon said the average size of the checks, which is to be announced Friday, would be between the $3,700 average paid for 1987 and the $2,100 for 1986. **********The Ford announcement today said fourth-quarter net income was $1.16 billion, or $2.42 a share, compared with $932 million, or $1.87 a share, in the 1987 quarter.

A Gain in Market Share **********Ford increased its share of the nation's car market to 21.7 percent last year, a gain of 1.7 percentage points. G.M.'s market share dropped 2.7 percentage points, to 44.6 percent, and the Chrysler Corporation lost a point, to 16.5 percent. **********Mr. McCammon was cautious about whether Ford could match its 1988 results in the coming year. He said 1989 ''won't be as good, but we've been wrong before.'' **********Some analysts were more optimistic. ''We think Ford's strength in the market will prevail in 1989, so that even though the new-car market will decline next year, we could actually see Ford increase its sales a tad,'' said Christopher Cedergren, an analyst with J.

The operations were also hampered by higher losses from bad car loans. **********Ford sold 6,517,000 vehicles to its dealers worldwide, compared with 6,115,000 vehicles sold a year ago.

Mircea Cosofret, who said the church had $140,000 for Rumania. ''We both speak Latin languages, we both have Latin roots. The French have always been at our side.'' **********In 1856, after the Crimean War, France pushed for Rumania's autonomy from the Turks, and after World War I, thanks largely to French support, Transylvania was given to Rumania. Between the two world wars, France agreed to protect Rumania. French Studied in School **********These ties have pushed Rumania close to France - 65 percent of Rumanian schoolchildren study French -and have made France a magnet for Rumanian emigres. ''The emigres have created pressures for France to aid Rumania, and the century-old ties between these two countries have increased those pressures,'' said Jean-Baptiste Duroselle, a professor of international relations at the University of Paris. **********In recent years, joining in humanitarian efforts has almost become a fad, whether it be for Armenian earthquake victims or for Jerry Lewis's fight against muscular distrophy. **********In an interview, Eugene Ionesco, the Rumanian-born dramatist who lives in Paris, said, ''Rumania needs material of all sorts: books, food, medicine. France is helping, but Rumania is in such a debilitated state, that it's necessary to give more and more and more.'' **********France has stepped up the size and visibility of its aid campaign after two leading opposition politicians, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, attacked the Socialist Government for acting too little and too late. Interview in Le Figaro **********''Here, nothing happened while the blood was flowing in Rumania,'' Mr. Chirac said in an interview with Le Figaro, the Paris daily. **********The Socialists accused Mr. Giscard and Mr. Chirac of trying to make political hay out of the Rumanian tragedy. The Socialist Party called their criticisms ''indecent,'' and called the two men hypocritical because they visited and hosted Mr. Ceausescu when they were in power. **********The French Foreign Ministry responded to them with a testy two-page communique, stating that the Government acted promptly and ''regrets the criticisms of some French politicians who, in these difficult hours, are so badly informed and have such bad intentions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/25/business/korea-s-snake-imports.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Korea's Snake Imports", "print_headline": "Korea's Snake Imports", "body_text": " **********A demand for health potions has encouraged frog and snake imports to South Korea, a Government report said last week.

The rules announced today involve not just censorship of some reports or restrictions on news gathering, but a virtual ban on press coverage itself. **********It is not clear to what extent the authorities intend to enforce the new rules. BBC Reporter Warned **********Earlier regulations, announced on May 20 after martial law was imposed in parts of Beijing, forbade foreign journalists from conducting almost any kind of interview. But these rules were not enforced, although a few journalists have been warned in the last 10 days by the Foreign Ministry or State Security Bureau. A correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation was ordered today to stop violating the restrictions or ''accept all the consequences.'' **********In addition, the police slapped and detained a Japanese photographer this evening when he photographed a crowd in front of the Public Security Bureau, witnesses said. The Japanese Embassy said it was unaware of the incident, and other Japanese journalists said they did not know his name or affiliation because he is not based in China. **********Hundreds of students jostled with the police outside the Public Security Bureau headquarters tonight to protest the beating of the journalist, and also of two other students who they said were also beaten. **********Responding to the new press restrictions, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing issued a strong protest this evening and called the rules ''a deplorable case of press censorship and harassment.'' **********''This calls into question China's policy of openness to the outside world,'' the statement added. **********Ding Weijun, the Beijing city government spokesman who announced the new restrictions, presented them as ''explanations'' of the previous rules. While both sets of rules are nominally from the city government, they almost certainly would have to win approval of senior officials in the central Government. The Government's Rules **********The new restrictions include these: *********** ''During the period when martial law is enforced in some districts of Beijing, press coverage . . . is subject to prior application to, and approval of, the office of foreign affairs of the Beijing Municipal People's Government.'' *********** Bans on ''press coverage, photographing and video taping of activities prohibited by the  [ martial law ]  decrees at Tiananmen Square . . . or at other public places; or press coverage in a disguised form, such as making appointments with Chinese citizens to meet at the offices or residences of foreign journalists . . . or at hotels or elsewhere, for interviews on activities prohibited by the decrees.'' The decrees prohibit demonstrations, so any press coverage of demonstrations would violate the rules. *********** ''Without approval . . ., foreign journalists . . . shall conduct no press coverage, photographing and videotaping of the troops enforcing martial law.'' **********It is unclear if the rules presage a new crackdown. Other signs, as usual in Beijing these days, were contradictory. Students Tell of Kidnapping **********The most peculiar incident was the assertion by students occupying Tiananmen Square that four people tried to kidnap two student leaders from their tent at 3 A.M. today. **********According to the students' account, Chai Ling, the general commander of the Tiananmen Square students, and her husband, Feng Cengde, the deputy general commander, were awaken by four people who tried to gag them with towels and carry them away. **********Mr. Feng escaped and shouted for help, and other students seized and interrogated the four people. Three of them were also students, and one was a member of a Beijing citizen organization that has supported the demonstrators, but most students were convinced that the four were Government agents. **********The students noted that it has been a carefully guarded secret where the student leaders will sleep on any night, and they frequently move around, so the kidnapping attempt had to have been supported by some careful investigation work. In addition, at about the same time, the students loudspeaker system and telephone were sabotaged so that they could not summon help, they said. **********The Government has strongly condemned the student occupation of Tiananmen Square, and particularly the raising of a 27-foot reproduction of the Statue of Liberty, but so far the authorities have not intervened. **********The Government's next moves may depend on the meetings now under way each day in the Communist Party headquarters to try to resolve the political crisis that has paralyzed China for two weeks. The only indication today was an acknowledgment by the Foreign Ministry spokesman that there have been no changes in the positions of the leaders of the Communist Party, army or Government. **********But the spokesman, Li Jinhua, professed not to understand a question about whether the formal positions might be unchanged but somebody might now be ''acting'' general secretary of the party. While rumors are flying in every direction, the consensus is that no one has yet been dismissed, but that the party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, has been relieved of his powers and will be dismissed from his post at the next Communist Party Central Committee meeting."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/13/business/poland-s-foreign-fix.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1989-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2023, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Poland's Foreign Fix", "print_headline": "Poland's Foreign Fix", "body_text": " **********In December 1987, William D. Hanna arrived here with Yogi Bear and Magilla Gorilla. Accompanied by employees dressed as the cartoon characters, Mr. Hanna came to Warsaw to inaugurate a joint venture that his company, Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc., the American cartoon giant, set up with American and Polish partners. The idea was to make cartoons in Poland for sale in the West. **********Now, less than two years later, the shoestring venture has developed into an integral part of Hanna-Barbera's business, thanks to modest doses of capital, generous inputs of local cartooning talent and the merchandising know-how of the Americans. **********Mr. Hanna is not the only American to have made the trip. Marriott International Hotels is about to open a hotel here with a Polish partner. Pan American World Airways has started up a tourism and publishing venture in Cracow, in southern Poland. And the Central Soya Company, the American grain-trading arm of Italy's huge Ferruzzi group, has joined with Polish partners to market grains and feeds. **********The American investment effort is still just a trickle, measured in the millions of dollars rather than billions, with many Americans and other foreigners remaining skittish about the unsettled political conditions here. Those concerns were heightened last week as labor unrest over sharp increases in food prices was reported in a number of Polish cities. At the same time, the Communists faced new opposition in Parliament to forming a government in the wake of the sweeping victories of the Solidarity trade union in the June national elections. **********Nonetheless, the joint ventures are the first fruit of a high-stakes bid by the Polish Government to revive the country's desperately ill economy. **********Saddled with a $39 billion foreign debt, the world's fourth largest, Poland is caught in a vicious cycle of declining investment that crimps industrial production, which in turn shrinks the export revenues essential to service the debt. **********To break the cycle, Poland's Communist leaders have been casting about for foreign investment, particularly from the wealthy West. To attract the hard currency needed to restore the country's collapsing industrial infrastructure, the leaders have followed in the path of China and the Soviet Union in dismantling traditional Communist barriers to capital investment. Lately, senior Government officials have taken to touring the West in search of business partners. **********Western leaders, including President Bush, are backing the effort. They are concerned that an economic collapse in Poland, the Soviet Union's largest and most populous East bloc ally, could threaten the entire fragile structure of change advocated in the region by Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Indeed, on visits to Poland and Hungary last month, President Bush offered comprehensive packages of assistance, including measures to sweeten private investment. **********So far, the appeals and come-ons have not set off a stampede of Western business executives. The Government's Foreign Investment Agency, which registers joint ventures involving foreign partners, lists just 30 such projects with Americans, only a handful of which have advanced beyond the talking stage. Still, the United States ranks No. 2, led only by West Germany with nearly 100 registered ventures. **********How much foreign capital is committed here is unclear, but it also appears to be modest in scale. About $6.5 million has been posted by American companies as upfront registration fees. Other figures are not available, but Marriott reportedly raised up to $65 million in Western bank loans for its project. **********The American presence would expand dramatically if Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the Polish-born heiress to much of the Johnson & Johnson health products fortune, follows through on her plan to buy and run the big Lenin shipyard in Gdansk. In June, Mrs. Johnson signed a letter of intent to buy the yard by Jan. 1, and is said to be willing to invest as much as $100 million. The Government ordered the yard liquidated last year after steady losses. **********If there has been little rush to invest, it is perhaps because the remaining obstacles to doing business are still daunting, notwithstanding the successes of companies like Hanna-Barbera. In many ways, the difficulties mirror those faced by Western companies operating in the Soviet Union and China. **********Poland's telephone and telex system, as well as services like banking and transport, are in a state of advanced decrepitude. And then there are the layers and layers of bureaucracy and anti-business feeling nurtured by 45 years of Communist rule. **********Moreover, dreadful bookkeeping practices of the Communist economy make it nearly impossible to set a value on a potential partner's assets. West German executives who visited Poland recently said some of the moribund factories they inspected had a net value near zero, an estimate their Polish partners would not accept. ''When the Communists abolished profit,'' a European diplomat noted, ''they also did away with capitalist ideas like depreciation.'' **********Some investors, too, appear to be frightened by the country's reputation for labor turmoil. In Poland, the cyclical social upheavals of the last 30 years, like the one that saw the flourishing of Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade union, have all been associated with labor strife sparked by political and economic discontent. In fact, while the American economic presence in Poland was never great, the imposition of martial law in December 1981 to crush Solidarity dried up much of the foreign activity that was here. **********Still, executives at some of the largest foreign manufacturers in Poland - Italy's Fiat, which manufactures automobiles, and Dallas-based Dresser Industries, which builds bulldozers here - said that production was never crippled by walkouts, not even in Solidarity's turbulent 1980-81 heyday. **********Zbigniew Niemczycki, the ebullient and driven director of European affairs at Curtis International Europe Inc., is one of those who appears unfazed by the challenges of doing business here. Mr. Niemczycki, a Polish-born American, is the man who was the principal catalyst of the Hanna-Barbera deal, in which Curtis, a subsidiary of the Indianapolis-based Curtis Publishing Company, holds a 10 percent stake. In all, Curtis did about $25 million in business last year in Poland, including selling and servicing home entertainment equipment and buying and selling wood products, metals and chemicals. **********In an interview at the Curtis headquarters along Warsaw's broad Marchlewski Avenue, Mr. Niemczycki said that Curtis has plans for at least four new joint ventures involving everything from fish processing and pharmaceutical products to building prefabricated homes. **********Mr. Niemczycki argues that an American company looking to increase capacity or shorten its supply lines to European markets should consider Poland. ''There is a high technical culture here, compared to, say, Mexico, and existing facilities because of overinvestment in the 1970's,'' he said. ''Some of these factories will need technology, but not big investments.'' **********Hanna-Barbera Poland is a case in point. Wojciech Trzcinski, president and chairman of the joint venture, explained that with seed money of about $100,000, the venture was able to generate about $1 million of revenues in its first year. The work force has grown to 180 since May 1988, when the venture started up with a staff of 24. **********Besides making and selling cartoons, Hanna-Barbera Poland rides herd on the parent company's licensing arrangements in Eastern Europe (traditionally a den of film piracy), runs a training school for animators and is tentatively exploring opportunities for using Poland as a springboard into adjacent areas of the huge Soviet market, such as the Ukraine. **********Other executives here agree that in Poland, a little yields a lot. That was Dresser's experience, said Bogdan Z. Kryca, manager of licensing programs at the Komatsu-Dresser Company, a joint venture based in Libertyville, Ill., between Dresser and Komatsu, a Japanese maker of heavy construction equipment. **********The venture took over a licensing arrangement in the early 1980's from International Harvester, when the big commercial vehicle manufacturer now known as Navistar International ran into financial trouble. The arrangement was to manufacture bulldozers and loaders at the huge Stalowa Wola steel and machinery works in southeast Poland. **********Though not itself a joint venture, the arrangement provides for the Poles to build the machinery under the quality control of Dresser engineers. Dresser then purchases several hundred pieces of the equipment a year for resale in North America, Australia and Africa. **********Mr. Kryca, an amiable Polish-born lawyer who was educated in the United States and spent much of his life there, said Dresser was attracted to Poland because of its low wages and production costs and a large reservoir of engineering talent. **********''Stalowa Wola has big factories, a lot of skilled labor, raw materials,'' he said. ''Let's face it, we did not pay for the factory, we had no brick and mortar outlays.'' **********Now Dresser is playing midwife to a new joint venture to help build up Stalowa Wola's service and repair parts network for its clients in East European countries. **********The experience of companies like Curtis and Dresser appears to confirm the observation that companies still tend to go into Poland because it is an easy place to cut their losses, if things come tumbling down, rather than for its attractiveness as a long-term investment. **********It is that perception that the regime in Warsaw professes to want to change by loosening restrictions on foreign companies. **********Hanna-Barbera, for example, set up shop under earlier joint venture legislation that limited the foreign share to less than 50 percent. Today, foreign partners can hold a controlling share, and there appears to be little trouble with repatriation of earnings. The cartoon-maker is required to sell 15 percent of its hard-currency earnings to the state treasury at the official exchange rate, but the Government skims off only 5 percent in taxes. **********There is another source of friction, however. While the Solidarity-based opposition in Poland welcomes foreign investment, it is leary of capital it believes tightens the Communist grip on the economy. **********Thus, the Solidarity daily, Gazeta Wyborcza, recently took to task an independent foundation set up last year under the wing of the Rockefeller Foundation to stimulate private agriculture. **********The plan was to use commercial bank loans from the West to import grains and feed that private peasants could use to fatten their hogs, which in turn would be sold in the West for hard currency. The fledgling foundation hopes to create a healthy business cycle with profits that would attract other investments and joint ventures and benefit the large group of private farmers. **********But the article accused the foundation of reinforcing the lock-grip of the state meatpacking monopoly, Pek-Pol, which acts as an intermediary in distributing grains and feeds and repatriating hard-currency earnings. **********Gregory A. Vaut, the executive director of the foundation, said that private enterprises, like grain distributors and food processors, still do not exist to compete with Pek-Pol - and never will without an infusion of foreign investment. **********Mr. Vaut said the joint ventures he has in mind might result in the opening of a privately held agricultural bank. Among other things, the bank would make loans to private Polish farmers to finance the importing of grain and the processing and exporting of hams. **********''Lack of credit is the major problem, for farmers, processors, equipment makers,'' he said. ''But there are lots of opportunities. And you don't have to build a $20 million plant to get in and get started.''

The move, which puts a more realistic value on its currency, is apparently a step along a difficult path toward making it possible for anyone to exchange rubles for other world currencies. **********More broadly, the step is a sign of the Soviet leadership's willingness to act boldly to shake up the country's lethargic economy and integrate it into the world economy. **********The biggest news is not what has happened, but what is likely to happen next. Sweeping changes in currency regulations are expected over the next few months that should reduce the control of Moscow planners over foreign transactions.  [ Page D2. ]  Effective Nov. 1, the rate of exchange will plummet in certain dealings, not all of which were defined by Gosbank, the state bank, in an announcement carried by Tass, the official press agency. The ruble, now officially worth about $1.60, will then be worth just 16 cents. Officials of Gosbank, the Finance Ministry and the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the announcement. **********The new ''special rate'' would apply to foreigners in the Soviet Union, who have long been outraged by the unrealistic official rates, particularly when compared with rates 20 times as high that are offered by black marketeers. **********According to a report in the Government newspaper Izvestia, the new rate would apply only to the tiny fraction of transactions that do not involve imports and exports. The official rate would continue to be used, presumably for all transactions aside from direct >buying and selling of currencies. The Soviet Union has long set, and ar-tificially inflated, the exchange rate for the ruble, causing a vast difference between the value of rubles traded officially, and those exchanged on the black market. Those hurt most by the special rate are Soviet citizens traveling abroad, who need to exchange rubles for foreign currency. **********With the relaxation of travel restrictions, the number of Soviet citizens traveling to Western countries as tourists, on business and in exchange programs has increased strikingly. And their demand for foreign currency has strained the Soviet Union's hard-currency resources. **********Soviet travelers are now limited to exchanging 200 rubles a year for each person, which at the old exchange rate would have fetched about $320. At the new rate, they would receive only $32 for the same number of rubles. **********The limit on the amount Soviet citizens can exchange, coupled with the increase in travel, has contributed to a rise in the black market price. It is technically illegal to import or export rubles without a license, but people apparently risk this frequently. **********In recent weeks, the black market rate in Moscow was reported to be about 10 rubles to the dollar, and as high as 20 to the dollar in Leningrad and the Baltic republics. **********At the New York offices of Deak Pereira, the foreign currency exchange concern, the rate this week was 7.7 rubles to the dollar.

''The purpose of the decrease in the value of the ruble is to put currency payments in order, attract more foreign currency to the U.S.S.R., help normalize the consumer market and cut short currency speculation,'' Mr. Orlov wrote. **********In addition, imported goods in the Soviet Union fetch extraordinarily high prices on the unofficial market, with computers and pearls commanding the highest prices - making the effective exchange rate up to 60 rubles to the dollar, Izvestia said today. **********The article also criticized ''the absurdity'' of the official rate, and the refusal of officials to rectify the situation sooner. **********''This act is aimed primarily at the black market, so dollars will flow to official exchange points and not to profiteers,'' said Mikhail L. Berger, an economics specialist at Izvestia, who wrote today's article. ''When you have a choice of the bank offering 60 rubles for $100, or some guy on the street giving you 1,500 rubles, that's no alternative. It's clear most people would prefer the second.'' **********Soviet economists and Western diplomats who monitor the Soviet economy said today that they were surprised by the timing of the move and by the drastic slashing of the exchange rate even in a limited context. Aid for Tourists Seen **********''It's impossible to tell what kind of effect this is going to have on foreign companies doing business here,'' said one Western diplomat who has tracked the Soviet economy. ''This is a high-impact, low-detail announcement. By our reading, we think it means that tourists will now get the favored rate.'' **********Several Western and Soviet economic specialists said they thought the black market rate would rise in response to the announcement, but not proportionately. **********The practical impact on foreigners working or traveling in the Soviet Union is likely to be limited. ''There's not that much out there that you could spend so many rubles on,'' Mr. Berger said. **********The prices of most tourist services, including hotels and air travel, are set and payable in dollars. Foreigners can purchase hard-to-find goods at special state stores that accept only hard currency. Link to Gold Suggested **********As part of an effort to revitalize the economy, the Soviet Union has been looking for ways to give the ruble a more realistic value, without forcing runaway inflation. Some Western and Soviet financial specialists have suggested linking the ruble to the country's enormous gold reserves, as a means of securing its value. **********With a dearth of consumer goods to purchase here, there are said to be more than 300 billion rubles stashed away in savings banks, and possibly many more billions hidden in homes. **********To satisfy consumer demand, and stave off discontent, the Soviet Government this year increased the amount of imported goods it has purchased for hard currency. **********Although some economists have advocated foreign shopping sprees as a means of placating aggravated shoppers, the Government has been reluctant to overspend on such items for fear of expanding the already severe budget deficit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/the-media-business-television-nbc-walks-into-a-cable-minefield.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1989-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1049, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; NBC Walks Into a Cable Minefield", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television; NBC Walks Into a Cable Minefield", "body_text": " **********NBC, the most successful of the broadcast networks, will take the first step toward its stated goal of becoming a major player in the cable industry a week from today with the premiere of CNBC, a 24-hour, consumer-oriented business channel. **********But even as it markets the channel to cable operators, NBC is learning that the rules of the cable game are entirely different from those in the broadcast game. **********One NBC official, encountering the labyrinth of interlocking cable interests, said last week, ''Working in cable is like dealing with the Mob.'' **********NBC's concern, in short, is that cable system operators with interests in other channels will lock out CNBC. A Good Beginning **********On the surface, CNBC will begin in unusually good shape for a new cable channel. The initial subscriber base of 13 million is the second highest in cable history, topped only by the debut last year of Ted Turner's TNT channel (devoted mainly to old movies). TNT came on line linked to 17 million homes. **********NBC likes to say CNBC is the biggest premiere of a channel not owned by major cable operators, pointing out that TNT had built-in access to millions of subscribers based on Mr. Turner's alliances with dominant cable operators like Telecommunications Inc., Time Inc., Warner Communications and Continental Cablevision, all of which have equity interests in Turner Broadcasting. **********CNBC should also benefit from the considerable resources of the broadcast network. CNBC has a gleaming new office in Fort Lee, N.J. It will have access to all the information collected by NBC News worldwide. 'The Money Wheel' **********The channel will feature a program called ''The Money Wheel'' from 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. weekdays, with market updates and advice for consumers. Dick Cavett and John McLaughlin, the political commentator, will be the hosts of evening talk shows. The evening schedule will also include a two-hour information program formatted like ''The Today Show,'' NBC said. **********''On the surface their schedule looks solid,'' said Larry Gerbrandt, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., firm that follows the cable industry. ''They're putting a huge amount of resources behind it.'' **********CNBC's start-up cost is an estimated $65 million. Commitments from cable operators will expand the subscriber base to at least 23 million over three years, closer to the 30 million to 32 million that CNBC projects it will need to turn a profit. CNBC will initially receive 7 cents a month per subscriber from each cable system, and will also sell advertising. **********But even with such a strong start, CNBC is not guaranteed success. The main concern, as expressed by NBC officials last week, is the crisscross of alliances between the system operators and channel operators that now make up the cable industry. **********''It has become very crowded and very complicated,'' Mr. Gerbrandt said. ''I would describe it as a minefield. It's hard to take a step in the business now without setting off an explosive reaction.'' **********In CNBC's case, one major explosion has emerged from the mouth of Ted Turner, who quickly declared himself an enemy of NBC's new channel. Mr. Turner dismissed CNBC's business programming as a ruse intended to hide NBC's real purpose: establishing a beachhead in cable from which to take on Mr. Turner's successful Cable News Network. **********Mr. Turner thinks NBC wants an all-news cable outlet to help defray the costs of its money-losing news division. One reason for his conviction: NBC tried to buy CNN from him three years ago. **********CNBC's president, Michael L. Eskridge, called Mr. Turner's charges ''paranoia,'' and cited the contracts NBC has signed with cable operators promising that the channel will not be for general news. **********Arthur Sando, a spokesman for Turner Broadcasting, responded: ''What happens when those contracts run out? NBC is in place by then. What are the operators going to say if they start introducing a news format? Ted is convinced that that's their intention.'' **********Mr. Sando pointed to the first program announced for CNBC, Mr. McLaughlin's talk show. ''What does McLaughlin have to do with business news?'' he asked. **********The dispute took a more tangible turn two weeks ago when Mr. Turner sought approval from his board to acquire an interest in the Financial News Network, the channel that sees itself as the natural competitive target for CNBC. **********The industry interpreted Mr. Turner's move as an attempt to protect himself by insuring the viability of CNBC's prime competitor. NBC saw the potential for some unhealthy pressure on cable systems to stick with FNN instead of CNBC. **********Mr. Turner's board did not support the deal, though it might be revived. **********The Turner board includes a lineup of tangled interests typical of the cable industry. One member, Telecommunications, the largest cable system operator in the country, owns the Tempo network, whose transponder space NBC leases. **********Two other key members are Time Inc. and Warner, two major system owners that just announced plans to merge. One NBC official, noting some enmity between Time and NBC's parent, General Electric, said a pending CNBC deal with Warner's cable system fell through shortly after the merger announcement. **********NBC is still worried that fear among the system operators of damage to Mr. Turner's investment could hold back the growth of CNBC. **********The key to success, NBC and industry analysts agree, is a channel that so many viewers want to watch that systems cannot lock it out.

A Very Favorable Price **********Paramount is expected to present what it believes is evidence that an exchange of stock by the two companies gave Time stock to Warner at a very favorable rate, people involved with the case said. **********Time and Warner had originally planned to merge in a deal that was subject to appoval by shareholders of both companies. After Paramount offered to buy Time for $175 a share in cash, or $10.7 billion, Time rejected the offer and announced a plan to acquire Warner for $70 a share, or $10.7 billion. **********Time's offer to buy Warner was not subject to approval by stockholders, and a number of them have been highly critical of Time's board for refusing to negotiate with Paramount. If Time Was for Sale **********The main legal issue to be decided in Delaware Chancery Court is whether Time's board, in its original merger deal with Warner, put the company up for sale.If the court finds that it did, Time's board could be found to have abused its responsibility to shareholders by not considering other offers. **********Paramount is expected to argue that Time's management has been more interested in protecting itself than in protecting shareholders and doing what is financially viable for the company. **********If the court upholds the Time-Warner deal, Paramount is expected to have little chance of keeping Time and Warner from merging. **********The trading on Wall Street seems to reflect a belief that Time will win the right to complete its deal with Warner: Time's stock is trading well below the value of Paramount's offer. **********Time's stock closed at $152.625 yesterday, up $1.125, with 871,000 shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Warner's stock closed at $62, up 25 cents. It was the seventh-most-active issue on the Big Board, with just over one million shares traded. Paramount closed at $56.75, down 25 cents, with 722,000 shares traded. **********The market responded with little enthusiasm to Paramount's announcement. As one arbitrager said: ''It could add $18 to the offer if it takes a year, but it will not take that long, so it is not a major issue. It is better than nothing, but it is not a big differential.'' **********The interest that Paramount has offered to pay would accrue starting 60 days from the date that Time agrees to accept its offer or is ordered to refrain from interfering with Paramount's efforts to obtain F.C.C. and local regulatory approvals for its proposed acquisition. Charge of Hypocrisy **********In its F.C.C. filing, Paramount said Time was being hypocritical in asserting that Paramount would need at least a year to obtain approvals to transfer cable franchises. **********Paramount said Time had admitted that its proposed merger with Warner could be closed without all necessary approvals for cable transfers. Paramount also asserted that Time had encouraged local authorities to file lawsuits against Paramount, offering to pay for the legal action and indemnify the municipalities against countersuits. **********Time had no official response to Paramount's accusations, but a person close to Time said, ''All Time has done has been to point out the law to the municipalities involved.'' **********In adding interest payments to its offer, Paramount responded to the contention that cable transfers would make the offer less valuable since Time shareholders would not be paid as quickly as it might appear. What the Bankers Said **********Paramount also answered Time's filing on Thursday that asserted Paramount's bankers had privately indicated that the closing would take a year or more. **********A source close to Time said the interest amendment represented a belated admission by Paramount that regulatory approvals would take a substantial period of time. **********As to Time being ''two-faced,'' the source added that that it already had approvals for most franchises it would obtain from Warner and expected to have them all by the time its tender offer for Warner closed. **********In the Delaware court, Chancellor William T. Allen is expected to rule on the case by the end of the week. No matter which way he rules, most lawyers involved in the case expect an appeal to be filed. **********In that case, the Delaware Supreme Court would hear oral arguments within 30 days, lawyers said, and probably rule within 72 hours of its hearing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/05/business/company-news-cadence-to-buy-gateway-design.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cadence to Buy Gateway Design", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Cadence to Buy Gateway Design", "body_text": " **********Cadence Design Systems Inc. agreed to buy the Gateway Design Automation Corporation of Lowell, Mass., for stock valued at more than $72 million.

Shcherbitsky will witness the first relatively competitive elections in the Soviet Union in his 71-year lifetime, but Mr. Shcherbitsky himself is running the old-fashioned way - without opposition. **********Mr. Shcherbitsky, the Ukrainian Communist Party leader and the last Brezhnev-era member of the ruling Soviet Politburo, has lately come under open attack as a relic of the discredited past. By most accounts, he should now be running scared. **********Residents of the Ukrainian capital say the party boss's popularity has been in steady decline since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded near here in 1986, undermining public confidence in the leadership. **********Mr. Shcherbitsky, who was promoted to the Politburo by Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1971, is regarded as a lukewarm, lip-service supporter of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and political program, and Mr. Gorbachev treated his host with cool condescension on a five-day tour of Mr. Shcherbitsky's domain last week. Yet Mr. Shcherbitsky's critics in the Ukraine say the Soviet leader tolerates him primarily because he has managed to keep the lid on nationalist unrest in his home republic. Third of Races Uncontested **********But happily for Mr. Shcherbitsky, he does not need Mr. Gorbachev's coattails to help his candidacy for the new national Congress of Deputies to be elected March 26. Although the new election system has given many Soviet voters their first taste of real competition, accounts from the Ukraine and several other regions of the country indicate that officials have used the vague powers built into the new law to keep outsiders off the ballot. **********An average of five candidates were nominated in each of the 1,500 election precincts throughout the country, but the district voter caucuses that ended last week whittled the contenders down to two in most cases - and judging by preliminary data, about a third of the races will be completely uncontested. **********Once chosen, the national congress will select from among its members a chairman and a standing legislature, or Supreme Soviet, which will be the country's highest governing body, meeting twice yearly for sessions lasting three or four months each. Running Near Hometown **********In theory, the legislature is to assume real authority over political and economic affairs, including both domestic and foreign policy, matters now run by the Communist Party apparatus. How much power the party will cede to the legislature in reality remains to be seen. The full congress will meet once a year to oversee the legislature's work. **********Mr. Shcherbitsky is running in a district near Dnepropetrovsk, his native city. Communist Party officials said that about half the members of the Ukrainian party Politburo are running without opposition, as well as the head of the Ukrainian legislature, the head of the Young Communist League, the Minister of Internal Affairs and about half of the county Communist leaders. **********''I would think they would be ashamed,'' said Ivan F. Drach, a secretary of the Ukrainian Writers' Union and himself a candidate for the new congress. Mr. Drach has publicly called on Mr. Shcherbitsky to retire, ''the sooner the better.'' Reason for Competition **********The establishment seems to have serious reason to fear competition. In many cases where party-backed candidates face a challenge, they are in trouble. **********In Lithuania, for example, party officials admit that their candidates may well lose a majority of the republic's seats to the unofficial opposition, a popular front called Sajudis, that demands greater independence from Moscow. **********In the Ukraine, the political alternatives are not so well organized, but they are growing fast, spurred by a Ukrainian cultural revival, a depression in the coal mines and state farms, and outrage over pollution. **********Almost every day for the last week unofficial political organizations have staged demonstrations protesting the lack of choice in the election. While Mr. Gorbachev was in town, the authorities tolerated the gatherings, but then began breaking up the meetings and arresting leaders. Avoiding Risk of Democracy **********Soviet newspapers have recounted several cases in which local party officials have sought to avoid the risk of democracy by putting pressure on electors, planting slander in the press about alternative candidates and in one case - in the Russian city of Yaroslavl - allegedly stuffing the ballot box. **********In southern Moldavia, in a district populated predominantly by the Gagauz minority, a Turkic people, the sole candidate who made it to the ballot was a Russian, the second-ranking Communist official of the republic, who has never lived or worked in the region. Gagauz leaders have declared their intention to boycott the election in protest. **********In the Ukrainian town of Zhitomir, according to Soviet newspaper accounts, local party officials employed such tactics as changing the locks on the meeting hall door, staging their own unannounced nominating meeting and trying to steal the records of an election caucus, all to prevent the nomination of a freelance journalist who had written embarrassing exposes of the local authorities. She was nominated all the same. **********In Saratov, in southern Russia, the authorities broke up an election rally by environmentalists seeking to oppose the nomination of a factory director. One organizer was dismissed from his job, and another kicked off the local Communist Party committee, according to the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya. Route to Ballot Complex **********''It must be admitted,'' said a Pravda editorial Feb. 15, ''that not all party and Soviet bodies have proved ready for the new realities of election work.'' **********The route to the ballot is, to many Soviet citizens, bafflingly complex and suspiciously susceptible to official manipulation. **********To begin with, one third of the seats in the new ruling body are reserved for official organizations, including 100 places for Communist Party members. **********The remaining deputies are to be elected by the public according to geographic districts, but in order to get on the ballot a candidate must have been nominated by a meeting of at least 500 voters, approved by a caucus of district electors and registered by an official commission. **********On these commissions, according to a Pravda tally, three out of four members belong to either the Communist Party or its youth arm, the Young Communists League. **********In Kiev, candidates in three of the seven districts are running unopposed, including Konstantin I. Masik, the city party leader, and Valentin A. Zgursky, the Mayor and a member of the Ukrainian Party Central Committee. 'Strictly by the Book' **********Mr. Masik used the new election rules to pack a voter meeting. The law allows each candidate to bring to these meetings a bloc of committed delegates proportionate to the number of workplaces that nominated him. **********Mr. Masik was nominated by 30 workplaces, mostly in factory meetings where workers declared their preference by a show of hands under the gaze of their bosses. He came to the voter meeting with 180 of the 284 committed electors. They eliminated five other hopefuls from the ballot. **********It was all ''strictly by the book,'' said Ivan A. Shub, a Communist Party organizer in a Kiev factory, who is the chairman of the election commission that oversees Mr. Masik's district. **********When asked if Mr. Masik's candidacy was a good example of the new pluralism, Mr. Shub shrugged and said, ''We are still studying democracy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/british-battle-over-harrods-tiny-vs-phoney-pharaoh.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1989-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1066, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Battle Over Harrods: 'Tiny' vs. 'Phoney Pharaoh'", "print_headline": "British Battle Over Harrods: 'Tiny' vs. 'Phoney Pharaoh'", "body_text": " **********A long-running battle for control of Harrods department store, one of the most unusual corporate disputes ever, took some bizarre turns today. **********For years, Roland W. (Tiny) Rowland, a maverick British businessman, has tried to wrest the celebrated retailer from the Fayed brothers of Egypt. **********In the latest twist, Mr. Rowland's Sunday newspaper, The Observer, published a special edition today that included lengthy extracts from what the paper said was a previously unpublished report of a Government investigation into the Fayeds' $1.05 billion 1985 purchase of House of Fraser P.L.C., which owns Harrods. **********The 16-page edition carried the headline ''Exposed: The Phoney Pharaoh,'' above a large picture of Mohammed al-Fayed. **********After just a few thousand copies were sold, the Government moved with unusual speed to get a court order to prevent its publication and distribution. The order also forbids any discussion of the report by broadcasters. Fraud Investigation **********The Government obtained the injunction on the ground that the disclosure of the Department of Trade and Industry's report could prejudice an investigation of the takeover that is being conducted by the Government's Serious Fraud Office. **********In fact, it was after Lord Young, the Trade Secretary, received the report in July that he asked the fraud office to look into the case. **********Mr. Rowland had previously appealed to the House of Lords, which serves as Britain's highest court of appeal, to force Lord Young to publish the department's report. That appeal is still pending. **********The long extracts from the Government report, as published in The Observer today, appear to support Mr. Rowland's longstanding assertion that the Fayeds misrepresented their backgrounds and their financing at the time of the takeover bid. **********In addition, The Observer, quoting the Government report, said the Fayeds' advisers, Kleinwort Benson and a firm of London solicitors, ''accepted at face value what they were told by the Fayeds.'' It added, ''In our opinion, they did not take sufficient steps to check the accuracy of what they were told.'' The Fayeds' Holdings **********The Fayed brothers also own the Ritz Hotel in Paris, some Mediterranean ferries, oil interests and real estate in the United States, Britain and France. **********The extracts do not indicate where, if not from the Fayeds, the financing originated for the House of Fraser takeover. **********Mr. Rowland's company, Lonrho P.L.C., has said it suspects that the brothers were financed indirectly by the Sultan of Brunei, a claim denied by both the Fayeds and the Sultan, who is thought to be the world's richest man. **********Donald Trelford, editor of The Observer, insisted that Mr. Rowland had nothing to do with the somewhat remarkable decision to publish the special edition. **********A large portion of the British public is deeply interested in the background and details of the four-year-old takeover, he said, and could not wait until Sunday to find out. ''It was entirely my own idea,'' Mr. Trelford said. Heavy Rhetorical Fire **********The late afternoon and evening were taken up with a barrage of heavy rhetorical fire, both political and corporate. Bryan Gould, the opposition Labor Party's trade spokesman, said the Government's quick work to stop publication of The Observer was most suspect. **********''This astonishing episode can only confirm that there is something in the Fayed saga which the Government is desperate to hide,'' Mr. Gould said. **********House of Fraser officials attacked Mr. Rowland's use of The Observer to pursue a corporate campaign that has become a personal obsession. ''Rowland is like a playground bully who cries foul because he has lost his marbles,'' said Michael Cole, media director of House of Fraser. **********Mr. Cole called for a police investigation into how Lonrho got a copy of the report. **********For Mr. Rowland, who is 71 years old, the pursuit of House of Fraser dates to the late 1970's. He has chased his quarry with a flamboyance and zeal more reminiscent of some freebooting businessman of the 19th century than a 1980's corporate executive. Between 1977 and 1979, Mr. Rowland acquired 29.9 percent of House of Fraser. Blocked From Buying Shares **********But in 1984 he sold his stake to the Fayeds. At the time, Mr. Rowland was blocked from acquiring more House of Fraser shares because of a 1981 ruling by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that his taking over the big retailer would be against the public interest. Still, it has never been fully explained why Mr. Rowland sold his stake to the Fayeds. **********In March 1985, the Fayed brothers, Mohammed, Ali and Salah, initiated their $1.05 billion bid for House of Fraser, just three days before the monopoly office reversed its 1981 ruling, freeing Lonrho to reopen its offer. **********But by then the Fayeds were proceeding with their friendly bid and Lonrho no longer had a blocking stake in the company. **********Mr. Rowland is unusual among executives of big British corporations in that he is an outspoken critic of the Conservative Government of Margaret Thatcher. **********And he is apparently convinced that he is the victim of a conspiracy by the British establishment to prevent him from gaining control of Harrods. **********For the last four years, he has relentlessly investigated the Fayeds' background and financing, and published anything he could find that would be considered damaging. By some estimates, Mr. Rowland's campaign against the brothers has cost him more than $50 million. Will Keep It '1,000 Years' **********Yet if Mr. Rowland is determined, so is Mohammed al-Fayed. ''There is no way I'll sell Harrods,'' he once told The Sunday Times of London. ''It will be in my family for 1,000 years.'' **********Some of the anti-Fayed material uncovered by Mr. Rowland has appeared in The Observer in the past, but mostly he has published it on his own, including a glossy 183-page book, ''A Hero From Zero.'' The title was a reference to Mohammed al-Fayed and to Mr. Rowland's contention that he came from humble origins rather than being from a wealthy Egyptian family, as the Fayeds contended in their representations to their merchant bank, Kleinwort Benson, and to the British Government."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/world/paraguay-general-leads-a-rebellion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 970, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PARAGUAY GENERAL LEADS A REBELLION", "print_headline": "PARAGUAY GENERAL LEADS A REBELLION", "body_text": " **********Army units rebelled against the Government Thursday night, and early today a spokesman for the political opposition said President Alfredo Stroessner, the Western Hemisphere's longest-ruling leader, had been put under arrest. **********General Stroessner, 76 years old, ''is a prisoner and Gen.

The report was considered positive, traders said, because it could lead to a reduction of military spending and an eventual cut in the Federal budget deficit. Far Below Week's Highs **********Traders said some buyers came into the market after the morning's decline, to as low as 1.9550 marks and 139.80 yen, provided them an opportunity to get dollars at far below this week's highs, when the dollar exceeded 2 marks. **********In late trading, the dollar was at 1.9824 marks, just above the 1.9805 on Thursday. Aginst the yen, the dollar was down slightly, ending at 141.17, just below Thursday's 141.20. **********The Bundesbank, which had not joined in the recent rounds of central bank dollar selling, returned to the market yesterday. The glaring absence of the West German bank in recent weeks had started rumors of a breakdown of cooperation among the United States and its economic allies in the Group of Seven, which traders said contributed to the dollar's rally. Reports on Japan Rate **********There is still concern in the market that there might be some effort soon by the United States and its economic allies to take more foreceful steps to push the dollar lower, including interest rates increases in Japan and West Germany and maybe even an interest rate cut of some sort in the United States. There were reports yesterday that the Bank of Japan would raise its discount rate by three-quarters of a percentage point next Wednesday. **********But the ability of the dollar to rebound yesterday with these rumors in the air indicates to some traders that even if some of the rumored actions occur the dollar rally would not be quashed. ''We know they're going to raise interest rates,'' said Simon Fisher, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company. ''And if the market can then take the intervention, then the dollar will go higher.'' **********He said a key test would be whether the dollar could keep from falling below the 1.9575 and 1.9360 levels against the mark. These are important support levels on charts that traders watch closely, and if the dollar falls through them it could drop much lower. ''If we stay above these levels, we'll test the highs of this week again,'' he added. Dollar Still Above Ceilings Even with the decline on Thursday, the dollar is still above the ceilings that the United States and its allies are believed to have set. The ceilings were believed to be 1.90 marks and 140 yen. **********In early trading yesterday, the dollar fell briefly through the 1.9575 level but then rebounded. It fell again, with the central bank intervention, dropping to 1.9600 marks. But it held that level and then began to rise. **********Mr. Fisher said that once traders saw that the dollar was not going to fall further, they decided they had to cover their positions quickly, and this helped push the dollar higher. Many of the same traders who were buying at this point had sold earlier thinking the dollar would fall lower. No Comment by White House **********The dollar moved above Thursday's closing levels on the report, by The Washington Times, that Mr. Bush would propose a reduction of as much as 10 percent in the number of American troops in Europe. The proposal will reportedly be made during a meeting next week in Brussels on the 40th anniversary of NATO. Mr. Bush, who left for Europe yesterday, will spend two days in Italy before arriving in Brussels on Sunday. **********The dollar moved close to 142 yen and over 1.99 marks but then retreated some when the White House refused to comment on the troop reduction report. **********The swings in the dollar's value yesterday were exaggerated by the thin trading on a day that preceded the Memorial Day weekend in the United States and a Monday holiday in Britain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/13/business/company-news-russians-get-visa-cards.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russians Get Visa Cards", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Russians Get Visa Cards", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union's largest bank began issuing Visa cards to replace the passbook savings account, Visa International reported today. **********The Sperbank Visa card is to replace the traditional savings account passbook, serving as a debit card enabling the holder to get to funds on deposit. **********''This is a giant step forward,'' said Charles T.

It also appointed Charles Scott, 40, a longtime colleague of Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's and the chief financial officer of IMS, as Saatchi's group finance officer. **********Although Saatchi has been reeling from financial setbacks, advertising analysts and executives were unsure whether the appointments meant that Charles and Maurice Saatchi were truly surrendering control of the company they founded in 1970. **********One top Saatchi executive who has been critical of the current management called the appointments ''rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.'' 'Going to Run the Business' **********But Mr. Louis-Dreyfus said he had assurances from the Saatchi brothers that he would have complete authority over the company's operations. **********''If I didn't think I would be C.E.O. and the brothers would not be running it on a day-to-day basis, I would not have joined,'' he said. **********And Maurice Saatchi commented in a rare on-the-record interview: ''Clearly, Charles and I will be heavily involved with Robert in the strategy and policy of the company. But he's going to run the business.'' **********Several analysts expressed surprise that Saatchi chose as its leader an executive without experience in advertising. **********''These are unusual selections in the sense they're not Triple-A in terms of media profile or recognition,'' said Chris Akers, an advertising analyst with Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers in London. **********Yet others, citing the growth of IMS from a $213 million company when Mr. Louis-Dreyfus joined it in 1982 to one that was sold last year to Dun & Bradstreet for $1.77 billion, called the French executive the perfect man to serve as steward of Saatchi, because of his demonstrated financial acumen and ability to think strategically. 'A Great Move' **********''Anyone else but him in this role, I might have had some reservations,'' said James D. Dougherty, an analyst with County NatWest Securities. ''I have no doubt he will be C.E.O. in fact as well as in name. I think it's a great move by Saatchi.'' After the sale of IMS, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus retired from the company.  In the interview, Maurice Saatchi said: ''We are just delighted. I've spoken today to all our large shareholders and to most of the analysts, and they appear to be delighted, too. **********Mr. Saatchi, who is 43, will remain as chairman and executive director of the London-based advertising holding company after giving up the chief executive's title on Jan. 1. His brother Charles, 46, will remain as an executive director. **********The appointments come at a critical juncture in the 19-year history of Saatchi. After acquiring some of the advertising industry's most illustrious agencies, growing as much as 70 percent a year and building its worldwide income to $14.7 billion in 1988, Saatchi this year began a slide that forced it to announce in March that its profits would fall below last year's level, for the first time in its history. **********Saatchi's difficulties stemmed largely from a scattershot approach to acquisitions around the world without any consistent strategic underpinning. In particular, the company's expansion into consulting, an area in which it lacked expertise, hurt it. **********Emma Hill, an advertising analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company, in New York, estimated that Saatchi's pretax profits for the 1989 fiscal year would be $:70 million (about $108 million), almost 50 percent lower than last year's profits of $:138 million. **********In recent months, the news has only worsened for the company, whose holdings include the world's third-largest ad agency, Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide, and the fourth-largest, Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide. **********In June, the company disclosed its plan to sell its troubled consulting division, whose slow growth and high expenses have contributed to Saatchi's financial problems. Analysts who originally expected the division to fetch as much as $:350 million now say Saatchi will probably not get much more than $:250 million for it. **********The financial problems have caused unrest among Saatchi's executives and investors. Several weeks ago, Carl Spielvogel, the chairman of Backer Spielvogel Bates, asked Charles Saatchi whether he would consider selling the company to him. Mr. Spielvogel, who had financial backing from Prudential-Bache Securities, was rebuffed, insiders say. **********Earlier this week Saatchi's largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management in Memphis, which owns slightly more than 10 percent of Saatchi, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had been gotten in touch with by unnamed third parties about participating in a financial overhaul of Saatchi. **********Southeastern also said it would consider proposals from other investors that could include changes in management or control of the company. While doubting the viability of a hostile bid for the company, many analysts nevertheless considered Southeastern's filing an invitation to potential acquirers. **********Maurice Saatchi attributed Saatchi's problems to slow advertising growth in the United States and Britain, and to ''too much optimism about revenue and not enough action early enough about costs.'' **********''The company needs to take cost-cutting measures, a lot of which it has already done, and to have the financial discipline it's been famous for,'' Maurice Saatchi said.  Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, too, acknowledged that his first priority would be to restore the company to financial health. **********''They had excellent financial control until two years ago,'' he said in a telephone interview from London. ''Then, suddenly, for reasons I don't know, it went wild. We're going to put the controls back.'' **********Responding to a prevalent criticism about Saatchi - that it never had a coherent marketing strategy -Mr. Louis-Dreyfus said the company's strategy would be ''to own 20 percent of the advertising market throughout the world.'' Saatchi currently places about 20 percent of all the advertising in Britain, Australia and Scandinavia. **********Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, who is a French citizen now living in Switzerland, took pains to stress the importance to the company of Terry K. Bannister and Roy Warman, the co-chief executives of Saatchi's communications division, which oversees its ad agencies. Saatchi insiders say that Mr. Warman and Mr. Bannister had fought the appointment over them of a new chief executive, and thought they might leave the company if one were named. **********But Mr. Bannister, who said he met Mr. Louis-Dreyfus for the first time only a week ago, added that he strongly approved of his appointment. ''If Robert brings to the company the kind of financial strength we need, it will make it easier for us to develop the communications businesses and it will take that weight off our shoulders,'' he said. **********Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, a Harvard Business School graduate who joined IMS as chief operating officer in 1982 and became president and chief executive in 1984, brings formidable financial credentials to Saatchi. **********IMS, which was founded in 1956, serves large drug companies by following the movement of their products from the manufacturing plant to doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. When Mr. Louis-Dreyfus joined it, the company was suffering from a series of diversification moves into barely related businesses. He shed several of these divisions and restored IMS to health - a challenge he compared to the one he faces at Saatchi. **********According to Mr. Dougherty, the County NatWest analyst, between 1981 and 1987, IMS's revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 14.5 percent, while shareholder equity increased by 21.6 percent annually. He added that the company's market capitalization grew at a compound rate of 35.3 percent a year. **********''That puts Louis-Dreyfus in some very heady company, in terms of C.E.O.'s who make money for their shareholders,'' Mr. Dougherty said. ''The only others I know in that league are Anthony O'Reilly of Heinz and Phil Geier of Interpublic.'' **********Despite Mr. Louis-Dreyfus's success at IMS, many analysts and executives remain skeptical that he will be able to apply his expertise quickly to an advertising company. **********''You've got to learn the business,'' said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc. ''And while you're learning, the business is changing.'' **********Citing a history of top executives whose ability to run Saatchi has been constrained by its internal politics, other analysts wondered whether the Saatchi brothers would allow Mr. Louis-Dreyfus free rein. **********In addition, Mr. Akers of Citicorp Scrimgeour said, ''The biggest problem has been to get hold of the holding company. He estimated that Saatchi spent $:25 million a year on its holding company operations. By contrast, industry experts say, the Interpublic Group of Companies, the world's third-largest advertising conglomerate after Saatchi and the WPP Group, spends about half that amount operating its holding company. **********Saatchi executives were adamant that the appointment of Mr. Louis-Dreyfus was not a response to the recent takeover speculation. Mr. Saatchi said he began wooing Mr. Louis-Dreyfus three years ago, after trying unsuccessfully to acquire IMS. **********''I found him a very attractive man for two reasons,'' Mr. Saatchi said. ''He seemed to be financially brilliant and more acute and quick about finances than any financial person I'd ever met. Second, he seemed to have a charismatic and appealing manner. You can find number crunchers easily and wackily charismatic ad men, but to find that combination is really hard.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/09/business/company-news-prospect-ends-bid-for-recognition.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prospect Ends Bid For Recognition", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Prospect Ends Bid For Recognition", "body_text": " **********The Prospect Group said it had terminated its $11-a-share offer for 7.1 million common shares of Recognition Equipment Inc., the troubled postal-equipment maker.

Baker 3d appears to be developing a three-track approach to Middle East peacemaking, with one track dedicated to the Israelis, one to the Palestine Liberation Organization and one to the Soviet Union. **********His aim, according to senior State Department officials and Israeli and Western diplomats in Washington, is to foster a peace process that would begin with Israel negotiating with Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and then later branch out to try to include other Arab states and the P.L.O. in some form of direct negotiations. **********A senior State Department official accompanying Mr. Baker on his trip to Vienna, where East-West conventional arms talks are to begin this week, spoke today of the Bush Administration's early thinking on the Middle East. As a tangible Bush Administration policy on the region appears to be crystallizing, the Soviet Union will add a dimension to it on Tuesday, when Mr. Baker will sit for talks with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Mr. Shevardnadze has already declared his intention to bring up the Soviet role in the Middle East in their discussions. #2 Guiding Factors Mr. Baker, aides say, is guided in his thinking about the Middle East by two facts. One, he is convinced that an international Middle East peace conference, at this time, is a nonstarter. Israel will not attend, and since Israel holds all the territorial cards, there can be no peace process without it. Two, he thinks that the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories has forced both Israel and the P.L.O. to reconsider all of their old positions. **********The Secretary of State wants to begin by encouraging Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who are loyal to the P.L.O. but not formally part of the P.L.O. leadership. **********Mr. Baker is known to believe that only after Israel and local Palestinians work out some arrangement for Palestinian autonomy and mutual confidence-building measures, can the parties even begin to think about some broader dialogue involving Israel and the P.L.O. in direct talks. **********Two weeks ago, Elyakim Rubinstein, the Israeli Government's Cabinet Secretary, made a quiet visit to Washington where he met three times with senior officials from the State Department and the National Security Council who informed him of the Bush Administration's thinking, Israeli officials said. **********Mr. Rubinstein, a confidante of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, was told that Washington would like to see Mr. Shamir present a serious, tempting offer of real autonomy for the West Bankers and Gazans when he meets with President Bush in Washington the first week in April, Israeli officials said. Elements of an Offer **********Between now and April, the State Department and the N.S.C. are expected to discuss with the Israelis, through various channels, what they would consider to be the key elements of such a serious offer, as well as some ideas for a final settlement, Israeli officials said. Those discussions will begin in a week when Israel's Foreign Minister Moshe Arens meets with Mr. Baker in Washington. **********Israeli officials said that State Department officials have told Israel that it would be shielded from the mounting European, Arab and Soviet clamor for an international peace conference if Mr. Shamir produces a substantive autonomy proposal that would appeal to West Bankers and Gazans - but United States officials say that is a big if. **********With such a serious Israeli proposal in hand, the Administration would use it as the basis for the dialogue with the P.L.O., Administration officials said. **********''Our dialogue with the P.L.O. has no value in isolation,'' said the senior State Department official traveling with Mr. Baker, ''it has to be folded into this overall concept. Arafat has to translate his words into deeds by proving that he is ready to allow small concrete steps to go forward now, even though he won't be getting everything he wants.'' **********The main reason the dialogue has been so slow up to now - only one formal meeting since mid-December - is because the Administration's concept has taken time to evolve, the official said. 'Missing the Whole Point' **********The way the State Department has been responding to Palestinian attacks on northern Israel can also best be understood in light of its overall approach. **********The senior State Department official said Washington understands that Mr. Arafat, even though he is chairman of the P.L.O. - a coalition of eight guerrilla organizations - does not have control over all elements under the P.L.O. umbrella, particularly the pro-Syrian factions which have been responsible for most of the recent raids against Israel. **********That is why, up until now, the State Department has reacted with a deliberately ambiguous approach of denouncing the raids, describing them as inconsistent with the P.L.O. disavowal of terrorism, but not allowing them to become a pretext for a breakoff of the dialogue. **********At the same time, however, the State Department has told the P.L.O., publicly and privately, that it considered any act of violence by Palestinians against Israeli soldiers or civilians inside or outside of Israel as contrary to the spirit of the dialogue. **********The P.L.O. immediately claimed that attacks against Israeli soldiers were not terrorism. **********''They are missing the whole point,'' said the senior State Department official. What the Administration was saying, he said, was that it does not care how the P.L.O. defines terrorism. It wants to get away from the whole issue of definition and to focus instead on what concrete steps the P.L.O. can undertake to convince the majority of Israelis that it is ready for peace. The most concrete step, said the senior official, is to stop killing Israelis and to condemnn those who do. **********''If Arafat can't halt the violence, or at least condemn it, then people will ask what are we talking to him for,'' the senior official said. To be sure, he added, Israel should also curb its attacks on the P.L.O., but it is Mr. Arafat who has to convince Israelis to trade land for peace - not the other way around - so he will have to be more forthcoming. Attempt to Signal Arafat **********There apparently was another reason, though, that the State Department adopted the sweeping position that the P.L.O. desist from all violence against Israel. It is only because the Israeli Army intercepted all the Palestinian guerrillas in south Lebanon before they were able to cross into Israel that their raids did not turn into some ugly incident involving Israeli civilians, the senior official said. **********If by chance one of these raiding parties gets through and attacks Israeli civilians, the official indicated, the Bush Administration will find itself under pressure to end the P.L.O. dialogue immediately. Therefore, it has been trying to signal Mr. Arafat, publicly and through the United States Ambassador in Tunis, Robert Pelletreau, to either use his influence to stop the infiltrations or disavow them before it is too late. **********The third element in the evolving Bush Administration Middle East policy relates to the Soviet Union. According to American officials, Mr. Baker is expected to tell Mr. Shevardnadze that if Moscow is serious about being a partner in a Middle East peace initiative it will have to abandon, for now at least, the idea of an international conference, and join Washington in its step-by-step approach. **********The Secretary of State is expected to challenge the Soviets to prove their good intentions by using their leverage to convince Mr. Arafat to let West Bankers and Gazans to take the lead in negotiations, while reassuring him that he will not be left out when it comes time to discuss a final settlement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/business/company-news-sutton-holding-bids-for-desoto.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sutton Holding Bids for DeSoto", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sutton Holding Bids for DeSoto", "body_text": " **********DeSoto Inc., a paint company based in Des Plaines, Ill., received a takeover offer of $50 a share in cash from the Sutton Holding Corporation, a New York concern owned by investors and led by William Spier and Michael Zurawin.

Earlier this week, after weeklong negotiations, Campeau, the Canadian developer that owns nine American department store chains, including Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus in New York and Burdine's in Miami, received a $250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments. Olympia & York is another large Canadian developer. **********Campeau, which amassed its retailing empire by borrowing heavily to purchase the Allied Stores Corporation in 1986 and Federated Department Stores early last year, has already put Bloomingdale's 17 stores up for sale to help with its cash needs. New Bridge Loan Sought **********Any new cash, including that from mortgage debt, would also help pay down an $800 million bridge loan from Citibank and other banks that helped the company buy Federated Department Stores early last year. Olympia & York is trying to arrange a new bridge loan to help replace the old one, which is due soon. **********Executives close to Campeau said yesterday that they expected the four-man restructuring committee, set up under the terms of the $250 million loan, to seek mortgage financing for most of the Federated and Allied stores situated on property owned by Campeau. About half of the 250 stores are on such property. **********Carole Sanger, spokeswoman for Campeau in the United States, said in Cincinnati that a mortgage financing program ''has been the plan all along'' to help repay the company's other debts, ''but the restructuring committee will have to determine what it wants to do with it.'' Will Report to New Board **********But financial sources said the mortgage financing and the already announced plan to sell the Bloomingdale's stores would be high-priority recommendations of the committee. The group, headed by Lionel G. Dodd, chief operating officer for Olympia & York Enterprises, will report to the new Campeau board, also set up as part of the loan agreement. That board consists of three representatives from Campeau, three from Olympia & York and four from minority shareholders. **********Shortly after Robert Campeau, chairman of the Campeau Corporation, acquired Allied in December 1986, he obtained new mortgages for a large number of the Allied stores. This helped him to keep Allied's debts in line until his May 1988 takeover of Federated Department Stores. But the resulting high interest rates for ''junk bonds'' and other capital needs created a credit squeeze last week that ended only with the $250 million loan. **********Any sale of other Federated or Allied store divisions, expected by analysts and other retailers, is now said by several financial sources to be of lesser priority than the mortgage financing plan and the sale of Bloomingdale's. **********The restructuring committee, meanwhile, is said to have started the process of selecting a new chief executive and a new chief financial officer for Campeau U.S., the company's American arm. The loan agreement called for the appointment of a new top team. **********A clearer picture has begun to emerge on what happened earlier this week when Mr. Campeau vacated his post as chairman of the American subsidiary, also part of the loan deal, and said he would concentrate on real estate, not on retailing. A source close to the Campeau negotiations said: ''The stores were doing better than anyone said, but the Campeau Corporation was placed in a seeming position of tighter liquidity than it had been because Citibank, Sumitomo and the others in the bank group didn't want to fund the company anymore if Bob Campeau still ran it.

It also delves into more serious matters like the history of race relations and the lasting effects of the Civil War. **********The book, which sells for $50, may be the first regional encyclopedia, but probably not the last.

''There are now thousands of specialized encyclopedias, and the list is growing rapidly,'' said Kenneth Kister, a top reviewer of encyclopedias and the author of several encyclopedia buying guides. **********While the major publishers have for years published specialized encyclopedias on science, health and music, they are carving out new specialties. Judging from the number of leading publishers in the market, encyclopedias for very young children may be among the hottest specialty areas. World Book and Britannica already sell encyclopedias for small children. **********And this summer Funk & Wagnalls and Children's Television Workshop Inc., the producer of ''Sesame Street,'' plan to introduce On My Way with Sesame Street, a 15-volume set of encyclopedias for preschoolers to be sold in supermarkets. **********Independent authors are publishing single-subject encyclopedias on topics with still narrower appeal. Consider titles like ''The Encyclopedia of U.F.O.'s'', ''The World Encyclopedia of Police Forces and Penal Systems,'' ''The Money Encyclopedia'' and ''Encyclopedia of Suicide.'' **********Still, some specialty encyclopedias indicate that consumers continue to crave general knowledge. ''Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,'' a one-volume encyclopedia that provides small bits of information on history, art, geography and philosophy, made The New York Times's best-seller list last year, one of the few encyclopedias ever to do so. **********''With the proliferation of specialized knowledge, we felt there was a need for a central core of general knowledge between two book covers,'' said E. D. Hirsch Jr., the encyclopedia's co-author. **********Still, if it is knowledge on maiden aunts, snake handlers and the effects of air conditioning on the Sunbelt that you seek, you would have better luck consulting Mr. Ferris's compendium of Dixie facts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/27/business/bush-signs-bill-ending-gas-controls.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Schneider", "pub_date": "1989-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 744, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Signs Bill Ending Gas Controls", "print_headline": "Bush Signs Bill Ending Gas Controls", "body_text": " **********President Bush today signed a law removing the last price controls on natural gas and then pledged to develop a comprehensive strategy for enhancing the nation's energy security. **********In signing the legislation, Mr. Bush completed a process begun 11 years ago with passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act, which removed price controls for newly discovered gas. **********''We've learned from the past,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We are united in the conviction that the best way to deal with our energy problems and serve the American people is to let the market economy work.'' Little Impact Expected **********Executives in the $73-billion-a-year natural gas industry said that roughly 40 percent of natural gas supplies are still subject to price controls. In most instances at present, however, the controlled price is higher than the market price. As a result, executives said, the new law affects only 5 percent of domestic natural gas production, not nearly enough to change the industry's depressed condition. **********Prices are now a fifth of what they were in the early 1980's, and exploration has slowed considerably, according to the American Gas Association, an industry trade group in Washington. The number of new gas wells in 1989 may not exceed 800; in 1982 more than 4,000 wells were drilled. **********''This legislation does not make much difference,'' said U. E. Patrick, the president of Patrick Petroleum Company of Jackson, Mich. ''We can't afford to explore at the price we are getting, and unless we have additional incentives, like changes in tax laws, we could run into shortages.'' **********Mr. Bush said today that the nation's reserves of natural gas, variously estimated to be 600 trillion to 831 trillion cubic feet, were enough to last well into the 21st century. Trade groups say that natural gas accounts for 24 percent of domestic energy production, and the President said he hoped the use of the clean-burning fuel would grow. Domestic Oil Output Is Down **********Far more worrisome, the President said, is the state of domestic petroleum production. The nation is producing 7.55 million barrels a day, the lowest since the mid-1960's, according to the Energy Department. Oil imports have increased to 7.99 million barrels daily, the highest since 1979. **********''This is no time for complacency,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Our energy security problem continues. We cannot and will not wait for the next energy crisis to force us to respond.'' **********Mr. Bush, who was once in the oil business in Texas, said he had directed Energy Secretary James D. Watkins to develop a ''comprehensive national energy strategy'' that would revive much of the thinking and many of the programs of the 1970's. The programs, like energy conservation and research on alternative fuels, fell into disfavor during the Reagan Administration. **********In a news conference after the signing ceremony, Mr. Watkins said he regarded the development of a national energy strategy as a high priority. Mr. Watkins said the strategy would be in place by late 1990. **********About 40 studies that address various aspects of energy policy have already been conducted by the 12-year-old Energy Department, Mr. Watkins said. Further studies will rely on experts from Government laboratories, along with information from trade associations, environmental groups and conservation organizations, he said. Hearings Are Scheduled **********The first public hearing on the strategy will be held in Washington on Aug. 1. Hearings have also been scheduled in Tulsa, Okla,; Boise, Idaho; Seattle, and Louisville, Ky., during the next six weeks. **********Research and conservation programs were a central part of the Energy Department when it was established by the Carter Administration in 1977, but the efforts found little favor in the Reagan Administration. One of the first acts Mr. Reagan's energy aides took in the early 1980's was to dismiss Dr. Maxine Savitz, the Energy Department's chief conservation researcher. **********Under Mr. Reagan, the department's principal goals on energy security were to clear the way for market forces to operate and to fill the six salt mines in Louisiana and Texas where the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is kept. The Government has spent $16.1 billion on oil for the reserve since 1980. The reserve currently holds 573 million barrels of oil, the Energy Department says."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/business/personal-finance-turning-a-charitable-gift-into-a-pension.html": {"writer_name": "Donald Korn", "pub_date": "1989-06-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1152, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turning a Charitable Gift Into a Pension", "print_headline": "PERSONAL FINANCE; Turning a Charitable Gift Into a Pension", "body_text": " **********A variety of tax law changes affecting retirement plans in recent years have combined to put the spotlight on what had been a relatively obscure investment vehicle, the charitable remainder unitrust. **********Taxpayers foreclosed from making deductible contributions to an Individual Retirement Account may find that a deduction is available with a unitrust. And owners of small businesses, frustrated by a morass of new restrictions and rules, are increasingly using the unitrust as a substitute for a corporate pension plan. **********Anyone who is willing to part with assets worth at least $20,000, either all at once or over a period of years, ''will find a unitrust beneficial,'' said Paul M. Brooks, president of Renaissance Inc., a financial planning firm in Carmel, Ind. With a unitrust, he said, ''you will have a lot more flexibility and fewer regulatory restrictions, compared with an I.R.A., a Keogh or a corporate plan.'' **********A unitrust involves the transfer of cash or other property to a trust that is set up to make distributions to ''income beneficiaries,'' usually the donor and spouse, during their lifetimes. The payments can begin immediately or they can be deferred, until retirement if desired. **********At the end of the payout period (i.e., when all the income beneficiaries are dead), the trust ''remainder'' goes to a designated charity. **********Because you are making a charitable gift when you establish the trust, you receive an immediate tax deduction. The size of the deduction depends on the age of the beneficiaries, the amount of the payout and the value of the donated assets. For example, a 55-year-old man would get a little less than a $4,500 deduction for donating $15,000 to a unitrust designed to pay him 7 percent a year on retirement. If the payout were to be 10 percent, the deduction would drop to less than $3,000. **********There are other benefits. You can contribute virtually any sum, versus the $2,000 annual limit for an I.R.A. You may get tax-exempt income from a unitrust, which you can't get from other retirement plans. And the unitrusts are good for the soul as well as the wallet. ''Many people want to give something back,'' Mr. Brooks said. Nonetheless, the trusts are not for everyone. The gift to the trust is irrevocable - you can't get your money back, although you are permitted to change charitable beneficiaries. That means that, unlike an I.R.A., the principal is no longer yours, nor can you bequeath it to your heirs. **********''A common practice is to use some of the tax savings or the income to buy life insurance, to make up the shortfall to children or grandchildren,'' said Zoe M. Hicks, an Atlanta attorney specializing in estate planning. With proper planning, your children may actually wind up with more money. **********Moreover, the trusts are complicated devices, especially if payments are deferred. When there is no deferral, the payout is a fixed percentage of the trust's assets, as calculated each year, with a 5 percent minimum. But if you want to defer payments, you must elect to use what is called a net-income unitrust. In this situation, the payout is a percentage of the trust's net income, rather than a percentage of assets. The deferral comes about by producing either no income or the kind of income that is not recognized for trust accounting purposes. The trust could hold undeveloped real estate, stocks that pay no dividends or, in many states, zero-coupon municipal bonds, for example. **********When you finally want to receive cash flow, you can direct the trust to sell the real estate, stocks or zero-coupon bonds and invest instead in Treasuries or top-quality corporate bonds, to get a high current yield. A net-income unitrust designed to delay payments until retirement should contain a ''makeup'' provision, giving you a higher payout in retirement to make up for the missed payments. **********Whatever their drawbacks, the unitrusts are an increasingly popular tool. Since Congress established the rules for unitrusts in 1969, the very wealthy have been the main donors, using the trusts as a way to shrink their taxable estates and their estate taxes. Now, thanks to computerized tax planning and trust administration, unitrusts are within the reach of many more people. **********Indeed, the unitrusts are making sense to more and more small-business owners unhappy with the burdens and costs of maintaining corporate pensions. Under Federal law, a company pension covering the owner must also cover other employees. Recent changes now guarantee pension benefits much faster to employees. In addition, the changes reduced the amount that business owners can contribute for themselves while increasing reporting requirements. By dropping a company plan and choosing instead to use a unitrust, the owner builds a private nest egg and is no longer responsible for the employees. **********Meanwhile, some business owners and highly paid executives have reached the point where their pension plans are fully funded so they risk incurring a 15 percent excise tax on ''excess distributions.'' Starting a unitrust may help avoid that tax. The juiciest tax breaks go to those individuals who contribute assets like land or stocks that are worth much more now than when they were acquired. Such individuals avoid the capital-gains tax. And they get a charitable deduction based on the current value of the donated property. (However, the contribution of mortgaged property, such as real estate, poses special tax problems and should be avoided.) The trust can sell the appreciated assets, which may have low yields, and buy high-yielding assets, giving the owner much more cash flow while avoiding capital-gains taxes. **********To set up a unitrust, you need to work with an attorney who is knowledgeable about estate planning. Your bank, accountant or financial planner can recommend one. Mr. Brooks put the set-up cost at about $300 for smaller trusts, plus $100 or so a year for tax preparation and investment management. The costs are much steeper for more sophisticated trusts, Mrs. Hicks said. **********Many charitable organizations are eager to help you set up a unitrust, as long as they are named as the ultimate beneficiaries. Some have an attorney on call, with their fees often minimal. **********It is possible for the donor to be the trustee directing investments or a co-trustee with another person. One caveat: Do not pick a trustee who has a conflict of interest, i.e., a broker or planner who stands to receive a commission if the trust buys a mutual fund, for example. If you are going to use a financial professional as a trustee, choose one who is paid on a fee or retainer basis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/business/japan-growth-forecast.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Growth Forecast", "print_headline": "Japan Growth Forecast", "body_text": " **********Japan's gross national product is expected to grow 5 percent in the fiscal year that begins April 1, according to a research report released today.

Manuel Antonio Noriega continued, businesses and government offices opened here today and other normal activities resumed for the first time since an American invasion deposed the military leader a week ago. **********Panamanian and foreign officials said negotiations over a request by General Noriega for eventual asylum in Cuba were being handled here and ''in several other capitals.'' The general took refuge in the Vatican's embassy here on Christmas Eve. **********Panamanian officials said President Guillermo Endara and his Cabinet were keeping their distance from the matter because, as one put it, ''we have more important things to do, like getting this country back on its feet and running again.'' But it was clear that the possibility of General Noriega leaving for Cuba or surrendering himself to the local authorities was not particularly welcome to the new Government. 'The Practical Thing' **********''If he goes to Cuba, he's still going to be a headache,'' a senior aide to Mr. Endara said today. ''You can't forget that he still has a ton of money with which he could create a lot of problems for us.'' **********''We would much rather that the United States find some way to take him there,'' the official said. He added, ''That may not be the nationalist thing to do, but it's the practical thing.'' **********Across the capital, in fact, petitions began circulating today to demand that the Vatican refuse to grant General Noriega refuge and that he be handed over to the Panamanian or American authorities. **********With the fighting all but over in the capital, many American troops are shifting to police duties, often as part of joint patrols with Panamanian security units. United States military officials said they expected those activities to continue until the new security organization called the Panama Public Force is fully organized and functioning. Hugs and Kisses **********''This is a new experience for us, and we're learning as we go along,'' said an 82d Airborne Division officer near the Marriott Hotel this morning. ''We've been trained for fighting, not for civil patrols.'' **********In Washington, the Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said that it was too soon to say when the American forces would be withdrawn. ''It is too soon to start putting a date and a number together,'' Mr. Williams said. He said there are now about 24,000 American troops in Panama, about half of whom were flown down for the invasion last week. **********On the streets, Panamanians approached American patrols to hug soldiers, shake their hands or kiss them. Throughout the working-class Calidonia area, which General Noriega claimed was a stronghold of support, graffiti has appeared proclaiming ''Gringos amigos, Noriega malo'' - bad. **********For the bulk of the population in the capital, the tumult caused by the presence of the American troops was finally beginning to die down today. Responding to Government calls for employees of ''basic services'' to return to work, thousands of utility, hospital and sanitation workers showed up on the job this morning. Lines for Gasoline **********At gasoline stations, lines stretched for blocks as word spread that fuel was once again available. The capital's gaily painted jitney buses were also running for the first time since the fighting began last week; a transport union leader said it was their ''patriotic duty'' to resume service. **********''I never thought that I would be so happy to see traffic jams or to have to stand in line in front of grocery stores,'' said Jose Luis Macias, a university student. ''Just the fact that those things are happening is reassuring after what we have been through during the last week.'' **********Television stations also resumed broadcasts, urging private businesses and stores to open their doors. Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said newspapers would begin publishing as soon as physical conditions permitted, but as employees returned to some major newspapers shut down by General Noriega in 1988 they found equipment stolen or destroyed by the Panamanian army units that had been guarding the premises. 'Extraordinary Opulence' **********Popular sentiment against General Noriega has been kept at a high pitch by television broadcasts showing what announcers call ''the extraordinary opulence'' of his various homes and offices. **********''Manuel Antonio Noriega is a criminal who has filled many human beings with sobbing, mourning and pain, who has robbed, killed and tortured,'' said one of the petitions in circulation urging the Vatican not to provide asylum for the general. **********''To let him go free in another country or to grant him refuge or diplomatic protection would be to ignore the principles of justice and liberty for which Panamanian citizens have been fighting in recent years,'' it said. **********Domenico Buglione, the Italian-born owner of a downtown jewelry store, said: ''The Pope simply cannot take him in, cannot accept him. Noriega should be put on trial, either here or in the United States.'' **********American officials said Michael G. Kozak, a State Department legal expert who last year took part in talks to have General Noriega relinquish power peacefully, is in the Panamanian capital, but they declined to give details about his activities. Hunt for Noriega Associates **********Around the capital, the hunt for associates of General Noriega continued. At roadblocks, American troops with photographs of members of General Noriega's high command stopped cars and checked passengers for any resemblance to those in the pictures. **********Some civilian officials in the Noriega Government are now in American custody, including Mario Rognoni, a former Cabinet minister and personal spokesman for General Noriega, and Toti Suarez, said to be a go-between for corrupt activities and enforcer for the military. United States military officials would not say what charges the men faced, if any, but their homes were being closely examined. **********''There's enough stuff in here to keep a forensic laboratory busy for a month,'' said an American lieutenant outside the home of Mr. Suarez, whom Panamanian opposition leaders have accused of torturing opponents of the previous Government. ''You can't believe some of the things we have found here.'' **********Government officials said they suspected that some of the hundreds of military and civilian collaborators of General Noriega, as well as missing members of his family, had taken refuge with him in the Vatican mission, the Cuban Embassy or the nearby residence of the Cuban Ambassador. American forces have surrounded the Cuban buildings as well as the Vatican Embassy. **********Among those whose whereabouts still remain unknown are Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, the hated head of the political investigative police, and Mike Harari, an Israeli who was General Noriega's chief of security and adviser. Still 'Limited Resistance' **********Luis Del Fin Perez, a political officer at the Cuban Embassy here, said ''a small number of Panamanians, no more than 20'' had been granted asylum. ''We do not acknowledge the right of the United States to pursue anybody, but none of the people here are who they are pursuing,'' he said. **********A spokesman for the American military, Col. Jerry Murguia, said ''limited resistance to the United States forces continues'' in parts of the capital area. **********In Colon, the country's second-largest city, Government officials said 55 civilians had been killed in the fighting and about the same number wounded. There were still no comprehensive casualty reports from other provincial areas, though both Panamanian and American officials said organized armed resistance had diminished almost to nothing. **********The Pentagon updated casualty figures today, saying 23 United States military personnel were killed and 330 wounded in Panama; in addition, 2 American civilians were killed. The Pentagon added that 297 members of the Panamanian military had been killed and 129 wounded. **********The precise number of Panamanian civilian dead is not known, but it has been estimated in the hundreds. Thousands in Detention **********The United States has captured and detained about 4,640 Panamanians, including members of the Panamanian Defense Forces. The Pentagon said that the number of refugees has ranged from 5,000 to 13,000 as Panamanians move in and out of refugee camps. It also said that about 33,000 weapons had been captured or turned in to American forces in Panama. **********At what just a week ago were barracks and stations of the Panamanian Defense Forces, former soldiers and policemen lined up to register for the new security organization. Many expressed bitterness at the conduct of their former commander, one of whose favorite mottos was ''Here, no one surrenders or cringes.'' **********''Noriega betrayed us and abandoned us,'' said Adrian Victoria, a 20-year-old former bricklayer's apprentice who said he had joined the Panamanian army three months ago because it offered a salary of $250 a month. ''He wasn't at the head of the troops. He should have stayed with us and led us.'' **********The owner of a major department store that had been looted in the first days of the invasion said he thought that the destruction was worth the changes that had been wrought. ''But tell the Americans it had better be over in another month or else it will turn around completely,'' said the businessman, whose wife has been cooking meals for American soldiers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/05/world/sri-lankan-refugees-in-india-return-home.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 201, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sri Lankan Refugees In India Return Home", "print_headline": "Sri Lankan Refugees In India Return Home", "body_text": " **********About 39,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees have returned to their homes from southern India in the last year and a half, Indian Government officials and relief workers in Sri Lanka said today. **********The last two groups, about 600 people, arrived in Sri Lanka over two days last week.

The Japanese are seeking technology leadership rather than cost advantage and will emerge as a dominant force in certain segments of the market much faster than is generally expected. American aerospace companies must avoid the ''it will never happen here'' attitude that contributed to the downfall of the steel, consumer electronics, automobile, shipbuilding and semiconductor industries. With aerospace providing an annual trade surplus to the United States of more than $17.8 billion, the stakes are high. **********Aerospace is an explicit and essential element in Japan's move toward an economy based on sustainable export competitiveness. Today, Japan is overly dependent on yesterday's industries - like automobiles - and dangerously exposed to low-cost competition from rapidly industrializing countries like South Korea. By developing new industries, like aerospace, Japan hopes to realize a higher level of sustainable growth - including exports - and to develop new technologies like composites, ceramics and communications. **********The Japanese Defense Agency chose to co-develop the FSX as its next generation jet-fighter airplane with the General Dynamics Corporation at more than twice the cost of procuring American-made off-the-self F-16's. They did this even though the FSX will not have anything close to twice the performance of the F-16. This illustrates Japan's broader commitment to develop an industry and not simply an airplane. And the willingness of Japan to select General Dynamics over McDonnell Douglas as a partner, despite the latter's longstanding military aircraft relationship with the Japanese, suggests that it places a high priority on learning from a new partner. **********Those who discount these ambitions should note the demonstrated ability of the Japanese to move quickly from almost no position in specific aerospace segments to selected positions of parity or even leadership in segments of the industry. While Japan must overcome both significant technology hurdles - and well-entrenched competitors - to date its record in this industry has been impressive. Already, Japan is producing world-class satellites, rockets, radar-jamming equipment, fuselage parts and a guided missile with greater reliability than France's Exocet. **********In short, Japanese aerospace companies have created innovative solutions to major military and civilian design problems, and demonstrated consistently shorter development times and more flexible product-designs than their American competitors. In addition, their domestic market is big enough for them to achieve the necessary economies of scale, since Japan's military spending is now the third-highest in the world. **********If we compare different countries and make adjustments for the longer development times, longer product and program-life cycles and the increased nationalistic concerns that affect the aerospace industry, we are still left with a very compelling growth scenario for Japan's aerospace companies. Add to these projections the possibility of Japan increasing its own military spending - along with exports of military and aerospace products - and Japan's growth would be staggering. Our forecast is that Japan's aerospace industry will reach the $25 billion- to $30 billion-a-year level by the year 2000, compared with its $7 billion level today. This projection does not assume an increase in Japan's military spending. **********Japan's market structure is highly concentrated, with the top three companies producing aerospace products accounting for more than 70 percent of the market. This concentration is a result of a deliberate policy to achieve world-class capability quickly, with each company dominating specific niches. This formula was extremely successful in other industries and offers a sustainable approach in aerospace. **********In 1971, for example, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry arranged for six Japanese semiconductor and computer companies to form three paired groups with the goal of helping the companies achieve a world-scale critical mass in electronics. As a result of this strategy, Japan has devastated its competitors. **********AEROSPACE, electronic private branch exchanges, and personal computers all represent new target industries in which Japan has established more focused and competitive presences than the United States. Japan's stategy of industrial concentration encourages specialization among competing Japanese companies, which enables them to carve out and dominate specific niches. This strategy will result in accelerated industry development and enhanced export growth. **********Clearly, the Japanese are to be reckoned with; their expanding role in aerospace manufacturing can pose either a threat. But in light of this development and the fragmented nature of the American aerospace industry, it is vital that American companies move quickly to create a response to the Japanese that is driven by real business and technological opportunities. **********If an American company chooses the joint-venture approach, it must act now to secure the right Japanese partners, since such ventures typically involve a long-term building process. While the nature of Japan's market competitors - and the role of the government - makes selecting industry winners easier, it also creates the risk of pre-emptive alliances by other companies from America and elsewhere. **********A successful strategic alliance requires nurturing, along with a sensitivity to Japanese interests in developing domestic technology and manufacturing capabilities. For example, General Dynamics's recent success in winning the FSX was largely the result of concessions that will allow Japanese control over both development and many aspects of production. The Japanese will use similar leverage over the fragmented American industry to extract concessions from its competitiors. **********The key to competing with Japan in aerospace means acting now to establish multiple linkages between American and Japanese companies as the basis for building broad-based, long-term relationships. The alternative is the erosion of competitive position in the increasingly global aerospace marketplace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/25/business/stocks-rise-slightly-as-dow-advances-5.86.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1989-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 507, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stocks Rise Slightly as Dow Advances 5.86", "print_headline": "Stocks Rise Slightly as Dow Advances 5.86", "body_text": " **********Stock prices rose slightly yesterday as turnover contracted moderately. **********Traders said that equities continued the pattern of recent days in following the lead of the dollar and the bond market, but those markets sent mixed signals.

The last reduction came on June 5, when banks lowered the rate from 11 1/2 percent. That was the first cut in more than a year. **********The prime rate is used as a benchmark to determine lending rates on a wide range of fixed- and adjustable-rate loans. It is watched closely because a cut in the prime signals lower borrowing costs for consumers and small and midsized businesses. The rates on home equity loans, as well as credit card interest rates, are often pegged to the prime.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.42 points, to 2,660.66.  [ Pages D6 and D13. ]  The latest round of rate-cutting was started on July 7 by Southwest Bank of St. Louis, but was first picked up by a money-center bank on July 10 when Chase Manhattan cut its rate. A few smaller banks followed Chase's lead, but the other big money-center banks held off, apparently awaiting signs that the Federal Reserve, which began easing credit in early June, would do so further. On Friday, Bank of America followed Chase's lead and cut its rate. Under Pressure **********Citibank was the first to announce yesterday that it was lowering its rate. It was followed by Bankers Trust, Chemical, Continental of Illinois, First National of Boston, Manufacturers Hanover, Mellon, Morgan Guaranty and Security Pacific. **********The big banks had been under pressure recently to lower their rates because the Federal Reserve has been easing credit, and mortgage rates are at their lowest level in two years. Some economists have speculated that most leading banks hesitated to follow Chase's cut partly because they wanted to determine whether the Fed would continue to act. Last week, in its latest step, the Fed signaled a further drop by allowing the Federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate among banks and a rate the Fed closely controls, to drop another notch. **********''Right now, what you're seeing is a recognition that the Fed funds rate has moved to 9 percent, or perhaps slightly lower,'' said Lincoln F. Anderson, an economist with Bear, Stearns. The prime usually floats one and a half percentage points above the Federal funds rate. 'Inflation Is Going Lower' **********''There is a gradual recognition that the Feds are loosening credit and inflation is going lower,'' he added. ''The question now is whether the Fed is lowering the Federal funds rate fast enough. If they're not, of course, then we'll end up in a recession. But we're not expecting a recession.'' **********The Federal funds rate traded at 8 7/8 percent late yesterday, down from Friday's level. The Federal Reserve controls the rate by contracting or expanding banking reserves. The rate traded below 9 percent for the first time in seven months last week, and this was widely regarded as a sign that the Government was easing its grip on credit to help the economy, which has been weakening in several areas, to achieve a ''soft landing'' and avoid a recession. **********A Salomon Brothers economist, Richard B. Berner, said banks were ready to let interest rates drop because corporate lending is down. ''Loan demand is certainly not strong,'' he said, ''and one of the reasons for that is that on the corporate side companies still have a lot of cash and don't want to borrow.'' 'An Internal Thing' **********Commenting on the early move by Chase to lower the prime rate, Brent B. Erensel, senior banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said: ''There's some publicity that goes to being first, but there's also an internal cost of funds analysis, so Chase's cost of funds might have gone down quicker than the others for some reason, so they felt they could cut their rate. It's an internal thing in terms of cost of funds, and it's a marketing thing in terms of being first.'' **********The top banks lowering their rates yesterday declined to comment on the timing.

Switzerland does not outlaw most forms of money laundering. Justice Minister Resigns **********For the proud Swiss, perhaps even more embarrassing than this foreign criticism is that Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp, the first woman to serve as a Swiss Government minister, has become embroiled in the scandal and resigned. **********Mrs. Kopp, who was also serving as the country's Vice President, admits having advised her husband, Hans, to quit his post as a currency trading company's vice chairman after she learned that the concern was a target in a then-secret money-laundering investigation. Some Swiss investigators say she could be indicted for violating official secrecy, which would make her the first Swiss minister ever to be indicted. **********Her resignation was followed by the suspension on March 6 of the Government's chief prosecutor for being lax in the fight against drugs. In addition, a senior anti-drug investigator was transferred because the company where his father and half-brother work was owned by a suspected drug smuggler. **********''The events that have come to light have jeopardized nothing less than the reputation and integrity of the Government, indeed respect for democratic institutions as a whole,'' said a newspaper, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung. Bankers Lose Their Calm **********The scandal - as well as recent scandals involving insider trading and fortunes deposited by deposed dictators - has generated a fierce debate over whether Switzerland has become a haven for dirty money and whether it needs tougher laws to police the money sloshing around the nation. **********Some officials have called for a law that would punish bankers if they are negligent in failing to discover that depositors are laundering money. The usually phlegmatic bankers are screaming that they are being made scapegoats and being asked to serve as police detectives. **********''Some people in certain banks seem to feel that they don't have a big moral or personal responsibility to be superconcerned where this or that money comes from,'' an American official said. ''Sometimes you have to tap these businessmen on the shoulder and say, 'Not only do you have a moral responsiblity to help us out, but you have a legal responsibility, too.' '' **********The scandal started to snowball last November when prosecutors in Ticino, a canton in southern Switzerland, arrested two Lebanese brothers, Barkev and Jean Magharian, who are suspected of running a money-laundering operation. Investigators say they began focusing on the brothers after seizing more than 200 pounds of heroin and morphine in February 1987 in what was Switzerland's largest drug haul. Indicted in the U.S. Dick Marty, the Ticino prosecutor, said the Magharians channeled about $1.3 billion through Swiss banks and currency trading companies from 1985 to 1988. He said that he could not be certain how much of the money came from the drug trade, but that he knew $36 million came from a cocaine dealer in Los Angeles. The two brothers are being held in investigative custody, and Swiss officials have not formally charged them with a crime. **********On March 8, the Magharian brothers were indicted in California for conspiracy to launder drug money, and two days later they were indicted in New York for selling cocaine. The United States has asked Swiss officials to hold the brothers pending formal extradition proceedings. **********''The increase in money laundering is only the consequence of increased international drug traffic and ties to organized crime,'' said Paolo Bernasconi, a law professor and former prosecutor. ''Unfortunately our nation's authorities have understood that only belatedly.'' **********Embarrassed by this scandal, the Swiss insist that they are no more of a magnet for dirty money than other countries with strong bank secrecy laws, including Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. **********''Dirty money is everywhere,'' said Robert Jeker, president of Credit Suisse, a major Swiss bank that prosecutors say handled some of the Magharians' money. ''It's all over the world, and of course there will be some here as there is some in other countries.'' **********Mr. Jeker suggests that the best way to stop laundering would be to require people carrying large sums of money to declare the amounts when entering or leaving Switzerland. Drug couriers would thus find it difficult to deposit illicit money because they would first need to obtain a Government stamp at the border. Bankers Resist Plan **********But some bankers are attacking Mr. Jeker, asserting that Switzerland has become a banking center because of the ease with which people can transfer money into and out of the country. **********''I like to have the maximum of freedom in capital transfers,'' Mr. Jeker said. ''But we have to accept that we have a lot of dirty money traveling around the world.'' **********One twist to the affair is that while Mrs. Kopp was Justice Minister, she pushed for a strong money-laundering law that would punish for up to five years people who sought to conceal the criminal origin of money. Although there is little dispute about how that should apply to drug traffickers, a debate rages about how it would affect bankers. **********''Many people are talking about criminalizing negligence,'' said Andreas Hubschmid, first secretary of the Swiss Bankers Association. ''A basic principle of law is you don't send someone to jail for being negligent.'' **********But Markus Lusser, the president of Switzerland's central bank, takes another view, suggesting that some Swiss bankers are too eager to close both eyes to accept money of dubious origin. **********In a recent statement calling for tougher money-laundering laws, Mr. Lusser said: ''Which bank would admit acting intentionally?

But some in the military are less hopeful, predicting losses of territory to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas once Vietnamese troops withdraw this year. **********Some Western diplomats suggest that in the interest of pushing a political settlement in Cambodia that favors the pro-Vietnamese administration of Prime Minister Hun Sen, it may be in Vietnam's interests to overstate the dangers of the Khmer Rouge, under whose rule from 1975 to 1979 more than a million Cambodians perished. **********But it is not Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials who are a bit downbeat, but the military. And the military's analysis, in its essence, differs little from the views of many Western diplomats and military attaches in Bangkok. **********Vietnam has declared that it intends to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September. No Vietnamese official, publicly or privately, says the Khmer Rouge can seize the capital, Phnom Penh, or quickly put Mr. Hun Sen's Government at risk. But there is a grudging respect for the Khmer Rouge fighters of Pol Pot, who the Vietnamese acknowledge have been lying low for the last year, as diplomacy has accelerated and the Vietnamese withdrawals have continued. Khmer Rouge Gains Denied **********Vietnamese officials stress that Khmer Rouge attempts to seize land inside Cambodia and move civilians in behind its troops have been rebuffed. ''Inside Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge don't control a single village,'' said Nguyen Co Thach, the Vietnamese Foreign Minister. **********But when Vietnamese forces withdraw completely, said Maj. Gen. Tran Cong Man, editor in chief of Quan Doi Nhan Dan, the Army People's Daily, the Khmer Rouge ''can occupy a bigger part of Cambodia than now, but in the remotest parts, in the mountainous area and along the border.'' **********The troops of Mr. Hun Sen ''made a lot of effort in 1988,'' General Man said. ''I believe they can manage almost all the territory they now manage. If the Pol Potists try their best, they can only occupy some percentage only, and not the big cities.'' **********The city most at risk, the general acknowledged, is Battambang, in northwest Cambodia near Thailand. But he said he believed that Mr. Hun Sen's army could hold it. ''Anyway,'' he said, shrugging, ''they will have to try their best.'' **********Foreign Minister Thach said Mr. Hun Sen's strength could be judged in the increasing productivity of Cambodian farmers. ''Rice is produced by peasants,'' he said. ''And if production is good, it means they have political security, military security and confidence on the ground, and in the future.'' **********Even with Vietnamese troops supporting the Cambodian Army, General Man said, ''every day there are about 10 cases of activity or destruction inside Cambodia'' by the Khmer Rouge. **********''They are scattered incidents, and they avoid places where Vietnamese soldiers are,'' the general added. ''But while they cannot occupy any integral part of the country, they appear everywhere.'' Khmer Rouge Put at 25,000 **********According to Vietnamese military officials, the Khmer Rouge has roughly 25,000 hardened fighters, with 15,000 of them inside Cambodia, supported by 15,000 people engaged in logistical support and transport of ammunition. These figures correspond well to Western estimates, which suggest the Khmer Rouge forces range from 30,000 to 50,000, with a core of 20,000 to 25,000 fighters. **********The Hun Sen army is believed to have 45,000 to 60,000 soldiers, with provincial and village militias of 100,000 people, with varying degrees of training and equipment. The Vietnamese say they have especially high hopes for the provincial militia, who live at home with their families and ideally will fight the Khmer Rouge to protect them. **********The Vietnamese also stress that the Khmer Rouge will face a much more difficult environment if China agrees to cut off its military aid and Thailand shuts down the border camps that have provided sanctuary to the guerrillas. ''If the fish have no water, as Mao Zedong declared,'' Mr. Thach said, ''how can the fish survive?'' **********The Vietnamese acknowledge that the Khmer Rouge have clan and kinship ties that provide them some support, but deny that they have a class or nationalist base in the countryside, as some Western analysts believe. Non-Communist Forces Discounted **********The Vietnamese have little regard for the non-Communist forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, a former Prime Minister, which form an uneasy alliance with the Khmer Rouge. ''The data they give to the United States when they ask for weapons is very big,'' General Man said. ''But the reality as we know it is not a considerable one. That is why the so-called Sihanoukist army and the Son Sann army are afraid of Pol Pot, and why they barely participate in the fighting.'' **********Mr. Thach has said that once the Vietnamese withdraw, Cambodia would at worst be like Burma, with the Khmer Rouge playing the role of the ethnic insurgencies that hold territory on Burma's periphery. **********''If the situation is like Burma,'' General Man said, ''then the situation would be rather good, for it means the Government would last.'' **********Asked about the general's comment, the ebullient Mr. Thach looked slightly surprised.

Despite all this, we don't think they will raise their Lombard rate from the present level of 6 percent at this time.'' **********But speculation over the Bundesbank's intentions dominated trading in Europe, where the British pound weakened against the mark in expectation of a rise in West German interest rates.

But at a national conference here, begun today, the Electric Power Research Institute also showed off less advanced models based on the body of a General Motors van, which customers can order today for delivery next year. **********''Go out and kick the tires -they're real,'' said Richard E. Balzhiser, president of the power research institute, which is sponsoring the two-day conference. Long a Dream **********Replacing gasoline with electricity in vehicles has been talked about and tinkered with since the early days of the automobile, and particularly since the 1973 oil embargo. But the cars have never had the range or durability to be very useful. Today, however, improved technology and the prospects of tougher environmental enforcement are beginning to make electric vehicles look more practical. **********Moreover, even advocates concede that electric vehicles will be a modest niche market for the foreseeable future, mainly used as delivery trucks, service vans and the like that travel short distances each day. Optimists predict that the potential market is more 100,000 electric vehicles a year, compared with a total American market of 15 million cars and light trucks. **********Still, the first factory production of an electric vehicle in North America in recent years, with the General Motors van body, is scheduled to begin in May. The power research group, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to sell 500 next year. **********''We are looking for a foot in the door that will convince the population,'' Mr. Balzhiser said. **********According to C. Dennis Bausch, a vice president of Vehma International Inc., a developer of the General Motors-based van, North American production of the G.M. Vandura, the Ford Econoline and the Chrysler Ram models comes to 440,000 a year. Half are for commercial use and, he estimated, electric vans could substitute for perhaps half of those -120,000 a year.. Clean-Air Campaigns **********The main force behind the push for electric vehicles is that clean air is suddenly a national priority. Nearly 60 percent of the population of the United States lives in areas that do not meet Federal clear air standards. One area that violates the standards, Los Angeles, has mandated that 40 percent of passenger vehicles and 70 percent of freight vehicles run on clean fuels by the year 2000. And Glenn Barr, a Los Angeles Deputy Councilman, said the vehicles shown here demonstrated that the technology exists to make those vehicles electric. **********In fact, the higher-technology Chrylser-body van, still a prototype, shows that substantial progress has been made. Its nickel-iron batteries are 30 percent lighter than standard lead-acid batteries storing the same amount of power, an important consideration since a heavier battery means more energy to move the vehicle, and therefore less range. And the fuel economy of the new van is half a kilowatt-hour per mile, a substantial improvement over earlier models. **********The model about to enter production is known as the G-Van, after General Motors' designation of the body style. It was developed by the power research institute; Vehma, a subsidiary of the Magna International Company, a Toronto-based auto parts maker; Chloride EV Systems, which made the batteries, and General Motors, with support from the Southern California Edison Company. **********Although it uses lead-acid batteries, it also represents technical progress. In test rides today, it accelerated acceptably, but designers are still working on the whine of the motor. It's Not Cheap **********Like all electrics, this van uses no energy when it is not moving, in contrast to internal combustion engines, which continue to burn fuel while idling. Thus, the advantage of electric vehicles is magnified as traffic worsens, engineers say. But it had better have an advantage, because it sells for $32,000, roughly double the cost of a four-cylinder gasoline model. **********Yet with opinion polls showing a popular willingness to spend more to protect the environment, the appeal of the electric vehicle is obvious. The vehicles produce no pollution at the point of use, and the power plants that supply them are substantially cleaner sources of energy than gasoline engines. The research institute, comparing the G.M.-based electric van with its gasoline cousin, found a 97 percent reduction in pollution. **********The attraction is obvious for the utilities, too. A single electric car would use about one and a half times as much electricity as a typical household, said Lawrence Hamlin, manager of research at Southern California Edison. The utility has enough slack capacity to run 600,000 vehicles, which would add $90 million a year to profits, Mr. Hamlin said. **********The new Chrysler-based van is meant to be charged by a 220-volt circuit - the kind used in households to run electric ovens or central air-conditioning - at 40 amperes. That amount of electricity is the rough equivalent of running every electric-using device in a typical house. Some industry officials foresee more advanced technologies, like power lines buried in the pavement from which cars pick up electricity.. **********First, however, the business is struggling to get off the ground. The van will be sold through General Motors dealerships. Marketing plans for the Chrysler-based van are less certain. **********In the face of that uncertainty, however, there is appetite. Martin F. Gitten, a spokesman for Con Edison, said his company had already tested some cars converted to electricity, and ''everywhere you took them, it was like the Pied Piper of Hamlin, it drew a crowd.'' **********''There is a public fascination,'' he said. ''All we need now is the technology.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/30/business/hammer-is-re-elected.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hammer Is Re-elected", "print_headline": "Hammer Is Re-elected", "body_text": " **********Dr. Armand Hammer, the 91-year-old chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, was re-elected Friday to another term as a director by the company's shareholders.

While most of those signals seem to indicate that the economy is slowing down, the case is not clear cut. For example, the Labor Department reported Friday that unemployment rose three-tenths of a percentage point in April to 5.2 percent. But it also said that hourly earnings rose 7 cents last month. And a new wage agreement at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, which some analysts said could be inflationary, further muddied the water. **********Many stock traders are hoping that a slow-growth, noninflationary economy will keep a lid on interest rates, and provide a good climate for stocks.

It received the option in exchange for bankrolling the firm. **********Information Consulting got its start when Mr. Brebach, former head of Andersen's huge consulting arm, left that firm in a bitter dispute. With a five-year loan from Saatchi, for an undisclosed amount, Mr. Brebach formed Information Consulting nearly 12 months ago to provide professional expertise in the booming information technology area. **********In particular, Information Consulting expected to develop capabilities in systems integration work, in which a consultant often teams up with a computer manufacturer to take a project from start to finish. **********In exchange for the seed money, Saatchi also paid close to $10 million for an option, expiring in May 1990, to buy Information Consulting for about 12 times future net income. **********Mr. Brebach is confident that by May 1990, his firm will be reporting $100 million in annual revenues.

Traditionally, McKinsey has hired about 300 professionals a year, almost exclusively from the ranks of the better business schools and corporations.

First, it spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising intended to portray itself as a technologically sophisticated alternative to A.T.&T., then it enlisted a growing army of part-time salespeople to promote its long-distance service at busy street corners, county fairs, shopping malls and just about any place where people have gathered. **********The street-corner salespeople may sound decidedly low-tech, but with their way paved by advertising that gave U S Sprint name recognition, they have just collared their one millionth customer, accounting for one-eighth of Sprint's customer base. **********''It's one of our major programs for acquiring residential business,'' said William Plikaitis, a marketing executive with U S Sprint. ''It has caught the attention of upper management in a very positive way.'' **********The sales force, now numbering nearly 30,000, is not employed directly by U S Sprint. Since the creation in 1986 of U S Sprint, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., a separate company, Network 2000, has existed solely to enlist customers for it. Network 2000 receives 4 percent of the long-distance billing from the customers it signs up. **********Network 2000 is a so-called multi-level marketer, which like Amway or Mary Kay Cosmetics, relies on an extensive sales force made up mostly of part-timers. Such companies are fueled by pyramid-like structures in which veteran salespeople recruit new ones and receive commissions from their sales. **********To foster a certain image and increase recognition of their company names, the top carriers in the $50 billion long-distance market spend heavily on advertising. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which has 70 percent of the market, spent nearly $500 million on advertising in 1988, according to documents the company filed with the Federal Communications Commission. In 1987, U S Sprint, with a 7 percent share, spent $65 million, and the MCI Communications Corporation, with 12 percent, spent $52 million, said Advertising Age, the trade journal. **********Most of these costly image campaigns involve glossy full-page ads in major publications and expensive commercials on prime-time television, even at the halftime of the Super Bowl. But U S Sprint has decided that image ads alone are not enough. **********''The problem with image advertising is that it doesn't motivate a lot of people to make a phone call to sign up for another long-distance carrier,'' said Joel D. Gross, a telecommunications analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''If some guy collars you on the street for 5 minutes, it happens.'' **********But other marketing experts say Sprint's image campaign was critical to the success of its street-level efforts by giving the Network 2000 sales force a stamp of legitimacy. ''You would be just a wild man on the street if you weren't representing something that had substance,'' said Sidney J. Levy, chairman of the marketing department at the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University in Chicago. **********''We had spent a considerable amount of money through advertising to build a high-tech advanced image of U S Sprint,'' said Bill Musgrave, vice president of corporate relations for the company. U S Sprint scrutinized Network 2000's sales training methods and materials before agreeing to the street-corner sales, and it still closely monitors the company. ''The direct sales effort has not hindered the image of the company,'' Mr. Musgrave said. Network 2000's far-flung sales force has considerably broadened Sprint's customer base by appealing to the $20 billion market for residential long-distance users, where increasingly MCI and U S Sprint are going after A.T.&T. customers. **********Aside from an occasional appearance at a college campus or near a military base, A.T.&T. has avoided a direct sales approach. MCI has tapped into Amway's extensive door-to-door sales force, but an MCI spokesman says the connection ''is not a large channel'' for developing new business."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/29/business/real-estate-recycling-a-new-issue-for-builders.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1989-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 886, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate; Recycling: A New Issue For Builders", "print_headline": "Real Estate; Recycling: A New Issue For Builders", "body_text": " **********MOST people think of waste recycling as an environmental issue, but it is also becoming a real estate issue affecting builders, developers and operators of office and commercial properties. **********Responding to the new pressure on the real estate industry, carting and waste disposal companies are expanding and adapting their operations. Among these is Red Hook Recycling, which is about to start operations in a new plant on a five-acre site on Columbia Street at the Brooklyn end of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. It will be wholly devoted to processing demoliton and construction waste for builders. **********Another new type of recycling plant is being developed by waste management and carting companies like Lehigh Carting Inc. Its operation is beneath the Kosciusko Bridge in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. The company is adding a 52,000-square-foot recycling plant there to handle wastes from office buildings and other commercial properties. **********This new plant and others combine manual and mechanical operations to retrieve re-usable materials like paper, metal and glass from trash. **********''Recycling is unavoidable,'' said Joseph Veccio, who owns and operates Lehigh Carting. ''The lack of appropriate dumping spaces is not only a public problem but affects all industries. There are fewer and fewer options for companies in the waste disposal business; so when our costs go up, the costs to any business that needs our service goes up.'' **********The pressure on companies like Lehigh to incorporate some sort of recycling component in their businesses increased significantly last year when New York City's Department of Sanitation raised dumping fees at city-owned landfills from $18.50 a cubic yard to $40 a cubic yard. **********Lehigh, which Mr. Veccio operates with his brother, Michael, handles about 400 tons of waste each day. Most of it comes from private carting companies that serve restaurants, office buildings and other small commercial establishments in the city. For a fee, Lehigh accepts the waste and disposes of it. **********The operation now consists mainly of trash compacting and bundling for transport to landfills in the city and out of the state. The company's new plant, on the Lehigh compound at the corner of Scott and Townsend Streets, will be built and run by a subsidiary, BQE Services. It is being financed partly with $4.5 million in low-interest loans arranged through the city's Financial Services Corporation. **********The new plant will be two connected structures. One will serve primarily as a waste holding area. The other will hold the recycling operation. This will consist mainly of a conveyor belt system that moves the waste from the holding area to a mezzanine level, where manual sorting will be done, and then on to the plant's compacting and baling machinery. **********Because Mr. Veccio cannot suspend his company's operation during construction, work on the recycling plant will not be completed until late this year or early next year. Once in operation, however, he expects the recycling system to reduce his volume of waste by 25 to 30 percent. **********Most recycling plants now in the planning stage will be variations of the one being built by Lehigh, designed to handle everyday refuse. But at the the other end of the spectrum is Red Hook Recycling. **********Michael Cosola, the company's president, said it took five years to plan and build his plant to handle construction and demolition debris. **********''The material that comes here will be dry,'' he said. 'We won't be handling garbage or ordinary trash like paper or bottles.'' **********For that reason he expects to recover 80 percent of the materials from the waste brought in. The final salable products will be mainly scrap metal, wood chips and stone and concrete particles, which can be sold as landfill or road pavement base. **********Most of the sorting at Red Hook will be done by machines, not by hand. **********The plant's main structure is a hangar-like building 200 feet long and 45 feet high that serves as an enclosure for the recycling equipment. The operation comprises a series of machines, grates and screens designed to break down and sort the material, connected by a system of conveyor belts. The major pieces of equipment are a huge shredder and an air sorting machine that works like a vaccuum cleaner to retrieve lightweight materials like cloth, sponges and plastic. A tower at one end of the main building contains the operations room, from which an engineer controls the system. The room is equipped with television monitors, giving the engineer pictures of the parts of the operation not visible from the tower's plate glass window. **********Because the equipment at Red Hook has been painted bright blue or yellow, the operation has the look of a giant Tinkertoy. **********In addition to the recycling plant, the site also holds a storage and transportation area, a weigh station for incoming trucks and a small building for offices, employees' locker rooms and a lunchroom. **********The new plant is scheduled to be in full operation by the end of April."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/04/business/us-notes-and-bonds-decline-on-job-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 708, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Notes and Bonds Decline on Job Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Notes and Bonds Decline on Job Data", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury notes and bonds dropped and Treasury bill rates climbed yesterday, partly because of a larger-than-expected rise in nonfarm employment last month and partly because of a Congressional stalement over legislation that would raise the national debt ceiling. **********Although many participants in the fixed-income market viewed the employment data as a statistical aberration, they believed the figures would preclude any easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the near future. **********Before the market opened, the Government announced that the number of nonfarm jobs increased by 233,000 in October, up from the rise of 201,000 reported the month before. Many economists expected a rise of no more than 150,000 jobs. **********''Aside from the suspect employment numbers, the Treasury securities market was also unsettled by the ongoing stalemate over raising the national debt ceiling,'' said Leif H. Olsen, who heads an economic consulting and money-management firm bearing his name in New Canaan, Conn. ''Unless the debt-ceiling wrangle is resolved over the weekend, there may not be any auctions of T-bills, much less the mid-quarter refunding sales scheduled for next week.'' **********Expecting that Congress would raise the debt ceiling from its current level of $2.87 trillion before Monday, the Treasury had planned to auction $16 billion of bills at its weekly sale on Monday, up from $15.6 billion last week. The scheduled refunding auctions include one for $10.25 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday; one for $10 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday, and one for $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.  Lack of Guidelines Seen **********Even if the debt ceiling is raised by Monday, Mr. Olsen said, dealers and other potential bidders will be without the benefit of pre-selling guidelines. Normally, Treasury securities dealers discuss coming sales with their expected customers and acquire a sense of the market value of the securities after they are auctioned. **********Nor did the bond market have the benefit of observing Japanese trading patterns, because virtually all financial institutions were closed in Japan yesterday in observance of Culture Day, a national holiday. **********As for the October employment data released yesterday morning, Mr. Olsen noted that the 233,000 increase included a rise of 95,000 jobs in local government. He said: ''Many of us believe the local government jobs consist mainly of teachers and others involved in eduation who returned to their jobs in September, but were not tallied until October. If so, we can expect the October numbers to be substantially revised downward next month.'' **********Largely as a result of these uncertainties, the benchmark Treasury long bonds, the 8 1/8 percent issue maturing in 2019, were being offered late in the session at 102 7/32, down 22/32. The yield rose to 7.93 percent, from 7.86 percent the day before; the yield was 7.84 percent a week earlier. In Chicago, the spot December Treasury bond futures contract closed at 99.8, down 19/32 on the day. **********Among other representative Treasury issues traded in the secondary market, the new 7 5/8 percent notes of 1991 fell 12/32, to 99 11/32, for a yield of 7.99 percent; the 8 percent notes of 1996 dropped 17/32, to 100 7/32, with a yield of 7.96 percent, and the long notes, the 8's of 1999, declined 16/32, or a half-point, to 100 8/32, and now yield 7.96 percent.  Bill Rates Climb **********Uncertainty over the Treasury bill auctions on Monday contributed to a rise in rates. The discount rate on 90-day bills rose 10 basis points, to 7.83 percent; six-month bills climbed 17 basis points, to 7.69 percent, and the one-year bills closed up 17 basis points, at 7.48 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********With the Federal Reserve refraining from money-market operations, the Federal funds rate traded unchanged for most of the day at 8.75 percent, before easing to 8 11/16 percent at the close.

No terms were disclosed, but competitors estimated the value of the deal at about $50 million. **********When billionaire corporate raiders like Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., run into tough sledding while trying to take over a company, they often turn to the stockholders to vote them into office. The idea is supposed to appeal to stockholders, particularly the big financial institutions, because they can show huge returns on their investments. Because large stockholders often mean strong opposition, takeover targets work especially hard to keep them happy. Bills Can Be High **********Both sides turn to the proxy solicitors to persuade the stockholders to support their ticket, one to re-elect the current officers and the other to vote in the dissidents. The bill for each side typically runs to substantially more than $1 million, sometimes in just a few weeks. Moreover, according to Wall Street analysts, the profits in the business are enormously high. **********Almost a year and a half ago, the Carter Organization of New York, a brash proxy fighter whose corporate raider roster includes Irwin L. Jacobs of Minneapolis, T. Boone Pickens of Amarillo, Tex., and Coniston Partners L.P. of New York, sold the company for $114 million to Valin Pollen International, the British public relations and advertising agency. **********The deal was structured such that Carter collected $51 million and would collect the rest over three years, depending on the company's performance. **********At the time, Richard B. Nye, 57 years old, Georgeson's chairman and chief executive, said that Valin Pollen had also approached him before the Carter deal but that he was ''not particularly interested'' in selling. Blue-Chip Clients **********Georgeson, a private company with 150 employees and offices in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Dallas and Los Angeles, works for such blue-chip concerns as Texaco Inc., the Gillette Company and the Centel Corporation, the telecommunications giant. Its revenues are thought to be less than Carter's, although its 500 clients make it one of the more prestigious in the business, particularly in defending against stockholder dissidents. **********In addition to Carter and Georgeson, other major proxy solicitors are D. F. King & Company and Morrow & Company. Morrow's clients include the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the Bank of New York and Texaco. King's clients include the Boeing Company and American Airlines Inc. **********Asked whether Georgeson would set up in Britain, John C. Wilcox, its executive vice president, said that no similar firms were in Britain today but that ''the environment there is becoming more like the United States'' and ''our skills are exportable.'' He mentioned, for example, services like ''stock watch'' and ''shareholder identification,'' which monitor buying and selling patterns for clients to spot hostile activity. **********Under an agreement in principle, Mr. Nye will become the deputy chairman. Norman Chalmers, a senior partner of Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting firm, is the chairman of Corporate Communications. The company, in turn, owns City and Commercial Communications P.L.C., a British investor relations company, and Donley Communications, a New York-based financial relations company.

Fuchs, offered an insight: ''Funny is money,'' he said. **********On the eve of the introduction of HBO's Comedy Channel, questions about its future abound. The most profound is: If you tell a joke in an empty forest, does it still get laughs? **********For HBO, the initial currency of success for the Comedy Channel will be laughs, not viewers - and certainly not profits. HBO is seeking national attention for its new channel after having spent millions of dollars on a concept that everyone - including its competition - describes as highly creative and very risky. It is counting on the channel to open to favorable critical notices, because it knows the house is not going to be especially crowded. **********''At the start, the press is going to be our most important constituency,'' Mr. Fuchs said.  The Comedy Channel will begin its cable programming at 6 P.M., Eastern time, Wednesday - but not on too many cable channels. Though the company has commitments from cable operators that will make it available to about 10 million viewers at some point in the next year, only about four million cable subscribers will be able to see it this week. (In New York, the channel will be shown on Brooklyn-Queens Cable, but it will not be available in Manhattan for about a year.) Even that limited exposure will be enough for HBO to fire the first shot in what has been the most bitter -and fascinating - corporate conflict in the cable business. Viacom Inc.'s MTV Networks are scheduled to introduce their own version - HA!, the TV Comedy Network - on April 1. So the comedy channel battle is still very much about the money that funny is expected to provide. **********Larry Gerbrandt, vice president for Paul Kagan Associates, the leading analyst of the cable industry, has assessed the stakes by estimating that a successful cable comedy channel (one channel, that is, not two) will eventually be an investment worth half a billion dollars. **********Unlike HBO, which is a pay channel, the Comedy Channel will be offered as part of basic service and will make money from advertising and subscription fees. **********Given that goal, HBO has opened up its bankroll. Mr. Fuchs would not disclose how much HBO was spending. **********But another cable executive, who asked not to be identified, said HBO had already spent more than $25 million on the channel and Mr. Gerbrandt predicted that either channel would have to spend up to $75 million before it would see any profits. **********Mr. Fuchs said HBO had gained an advantage by getting its channel up and running first. But that advantage will dissipate ''if we lay an egg,'' he said. No one at HBO expects that. **********HBO's Comedy Channel has been set up as a place with a specific attitude, staffed with a crew of hosts who perform comedy acts. The bulk of the channel's programming will consist of clips from comedy movies. **********But the hosts offer the opportunity to create breakthrough stars. Best early bet: Rachel Sweet, a funny-looking, funny-sounding, altogether funny former rock singer who describes her post-punk life in her short comedy segments. **********Tom Freston, chairman of MTV Networks, said he thought the Comedy Channel ran the risk of ''being so hip they hip themselves right out of the mainstream.'' HA! will depend on more familiar comedy formats - situation comedies, movies - surrounded by what Mr. Freston called ''hip packaging.'' **********HA! has bought such fare as repeats of the ''Lucy Show,'' Groucho Marx's ''You Bet Your Life, and ''Candid Camera.'' Mr. Freston has also made deals with the comedy film directors Ron Howard and Rob Reiner and signed Fred Silverman, the exceedingly mainstream ex-network programmer, as a consultant. **********Mr. Fuchs still questions how committed Viacom and MTV Networks are to a comedy channel format. ''Theirs is a deal channel,'' he said. ''We have a comedy channel,'' Mr. Gerbrandt said: ''The best situation for HBO would be if HA never launches. The worst scenario is two crippled channels.'' **********But both sides know the fight will be decided not by format but by distribution. The channel that wins the favor of large cable operators is most likely to win the half-billion dollars at the end of the punchline. So far, neither channel has secured any signficant commitments, even though both are now inviting operators to take a piece of their channels in exchange for access to subscribers. Both are offering up to 50 percent equity stakes. **********Mr. Freston said negotiations with cable operators were ''going well.'' **********Mr. Fuchs said ''the deal situation is intensifying.'' He said the cable operators might be waiting to hear the critical assessment of the Comedy Channel. ''They need someone to tell them what's hot,'' he said. **********Mr. Gerbrandt said: ''Cable operators are being Solomonic. They're putting both channels on a scale to see which has more weight - and which is going to sink out of sight.'' **********Time Warnerd (HBO)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/24/business/article-470989-no-title.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Article 470989 -- No Title", "print_headline": "Article 470989 -- No Title", "body_text": " **********The Federal Government had a budget deficit of $35.78 billion in March, the largest monthly shortfall in nearly three years, the Treasury Department said Friday. **********Including last month's deficit, the shortfall in the first half of the 1989 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, was $128.43 billion, wider than the $119.61 billion in the first half of the previous year, when the March gap was $29.28 billion. **********Budget analysts expect the Government to show a substantial surplus for April because of the deluge of income tax payments that usually arrives by the April 15 filing deadline. **********Last month's shortfall, which followed a February deficit of $27.87 billion, was the Government's widest monthly gap since it had a $39.4 billion deficit in May 1986. **********The Bush Administration has predicted that the budget gap will widen this year to $163.3 billion from $155.10 billion in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30.

Barrett earlier this year became chairman and chief executive of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. He recently talked about his company's future and the dramatic changes in the industry following the acquisition of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company by the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, and General Tire by Continental A.G. of West Germany **********Q: How important is it for Goodyear to be the world's largest tire company? Is size important for its own sake? **********A. It does several things for you. It's a pride factor with our people. The esprit de corps is quite important. I think that our history will show we established ourselves in the different continents of the world quicker than the people we compete against. **********We think of our global presence as one of our strengths. We've been able to weather downturns in certain geographic areas because other areas have been up. We call it geographic diversification. There are times when it's tough to make a buck in the North American market, but you can be successful outside North America, and vice versa. The thing to work on is getting all those cylinders pumping in the right direction at the right time. But we don't seem able to do that. **********Q. After all the consolidations, are there still more to come? **********A. Yes. You have Goodyear, Bridgestone and Michelin with about half of the market. And then there are all these other players, and many with 2 to 5 percent of the market. Some of those will be quite successful because they will be willing to take hold of a specialized niche. For example, Cooper Tire has the private brand market, the low-margin market for the discount stores, and they are doing quite well. But there are a number of Japanese companies that will undergo a shakeout. The shakeout in the United States is basically over except someone will probably pick up Uniroyal Goodrich. **********Q. Goodyear is strong in North and South America, Europe and parts of Asia. But not in Japan and Korea. What's your strategy there? **********A. We have to have a manufacturing base in that part of the world. We have a distribution base in Japan, but we have only 3 or 4 percent of the replacement market in Japan. Our intention is to manufacture in Korea. **********Q. Why not manufacture in Japan? **********A. I think that's much more difficult. You'd be going into a market that's already saturated with capacity. And the payout and the patience would have to be very long term. We can go into Korea, where the competitors are not as skillful. We can do it much quicker and get a payout in Korea quicker than Japan. **********Q. What has happened to your labor costs over the last few years? **********A. We have it down to under 10 percent of the total costs of producing a tire. Fifteen years ago, it would have been twice that or two and a half times that. Compared with our competitors, we're good. **********Q. What kind of tire do you think American car makers are going to have in the next five years? What kind of miles-per-gallon fleet average do you expect in that period?< **********A. They're very concerned because tires play a role in fuel economy. Speaking for Goodyear, we think the miles-per-gallon fleet average will continue to increase. We're at 27 miles per gallon now. It will probably be 37 in five years. Also, they want to give every line of cars a different feel. You've got the luxury sedans, the sporty type cars. So the tire lines are getting complicated because the car makers want a different feel. **********Q. Several years ago, thanks to Sir James Goldsmith, your company restructured. What difference has that made on your operations? **********A. We converted equity to debt. In this country we're on a roll in taking the equity out of our companies and converting it to debt and then taking that cash and repeating that cycle. Our debt is higher and our interest payments are higher. **********Q. But has it made any difference in the quality of tires or investment in operations? **********A. No. We've been able to invest and continue to invest and do the things we've needed to do to be competitive. **********Q. Tire dealers now charge for taking old tires for disposal. If a customer takes the old tires home, disposal companies often refuse them. Tires have become a major problem in solid waste. What is Goodyear doing about it? **********A. It's a problem we work on diligently. There are methods to dispose of tires very effectively. You can put a tire through a very heavy-duty grinder. You can take the ground up rubber and mix it with coal and burn it.

P. Stevens & Company, one of its biggest competitors, and then split it up. The deal will end a 106-year-old relationship between Pepperell and the Lanier family of Georgia and Alabama. **********William Farley, 46-year-old chairman of Farley Inc., said in a news conference in Atlanta that the deal would create the largest textile and apparel company in the world, with 62,000 workers and annual sales of $4 billion. He said that Joseph L. Lanier Jr., 56, and Donald J. Keller, also 56, would resign as chairman and president, respectively, when the deal closed. **********Mr. Farley added in a telephone interview later that he would become chairman, chief executive and chief operating officer but would keep the present name of the company. He said that he also expected to keep the rest of Pepperell's senior executives. **********In a prophetic remark he made at the time of the Stevens venture last April, Mr. Lanier was asked how long the Stevens name might be around. He replied, ''I'm not even sure how long the West Point-Pepperell name will be around.'' Reaction to Takeover **********Asked how Mr. Lanier reacted to the takeover, Mr. Farley remarked, ''He's absolutely not happy but I wish him well.'' **********The Farley chief recalled that during the battle ''Lanier had said that on a scale of 1 to 10, my chances of getting the company were 11.'' **********Pepperell opened its doors in 1866 as the Alabama and Georgia Manufacturing Company. But by 1882 it became the West Point Manufacturing Company with E.F. Lanier as president, making sails for clipper ships and cotton covers for the Conestoga wagons that crossed the prairies. Joseph Lanier Jr. is the fourth generation of the Laniers to run the company. **********In their joint announcement, Pepperell and Farley, said they had reached a definitive agreement for Farley to increase its present $52-a-share tender offer to stockholders to $58, with the total value of the deal - including plans to refinance Pepperell's debt - approaching $3 billion. **********Farley already owns 2.87 million shares, or 9.8 percent of Pepperell's 29.3 million shares, meaning it would be paying $1.53 billion for the rest. With the total valued at $3 billion, this would mean that Pepperell's debt also amounted to about $1.5 billion. **********Without identifying any bidders, Pepperell said that a special four-member committee of independent directors evaluated ''several proposals'' in response to an invitation to bid for the company. Farley Sees Only Two Bidders **********But Mr. Farley, said in a telephone interview that ''I think the only bidders were Merrill Lynch and ourselves.'' Mr. Farley said he understood that the Merrill bid was ''a combination of Merrill Lynch and the management of Pepperell.'' **********As pieced together from officials close to the auction process, Pepperell was being advised by both Merrill Lynch Capital Partners and Goldman, Sachs & Company. Goldman, Sachs was selected to sell the company in a blind auction through sealed bids where none of the bidders knew who else would participate. Merrill Lynch concluded that as a ''defensive adviser,'' the way to get the best possible bidding contest going would be for it to join in the bidding itself and ''stimulate the bidding.'' **********Merrill Lynch is understood to have told the Pepperell directors and the directors are said to have agreed to a plan whereby Merrill Lynch would make a bid ''considerably in excess of $52,'' the only known Farley bid before its final $58 bid.'' The plan further provided that Merrill Lynch would put up more than $1 billion of cash, with the rest to come from banks, and with the further understanding that while Merrill Lynch was ''prepared to buy'' Pepperell for its offering price, it would step aside if it were outbid. **********Officials close to the auction process said that this was the first sign of how aggressive Merrill Lynch was willing to become and expected the big investment house to play a similar role in future takeover battles, committing its capital to draw out other bidders. **********Officials close to the bidding said that an initial round took place on the evening of Feb. 15, with Farley and Merrill Lynch the two main players. Each was told separately that their bids were ''close'' and instructed to put in their ''highest and best'' bid by Tuesday. Negotiations leading to yesterday's agreement began on Wednesday. **********Mr. Farley said that fees for his lawyers, bankers and advisers would run more than $100 million. He said he had commitments from Wells Fargo Bank, the Bankers Trust Company and the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group for all the financing. Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch will split $14 million, while Mr. Lanier will collect about a $4 million ''golden parachute.'' **********Mr. Farley said he would keep Pepperell's Arrow shirt line but sell about $100 million in assets, including some imported Arrow and Saturday's sportswear lines."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/29/world/us-resolution-on-armenians-angers-turks.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1989-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 705, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Resolution on Armenians Angers Turks", "print_headline": "U.S. Resolution on Armenians Angers Turks", "body_text": " **********The Turkish editorial cartoon may not have been a model of subtlety, but it made its point clearly. **********There in the illustration stood a cowboy in a 10-gallon hat, a smoking rifle in his hands and a booted left foot planted firmly on the corpse of an American Indian. While he lingered defiantly over his victim, the cowboy sang a ballad about ''Armenian genocide.'' **********Moral: The United States is hardly in a position to give lectures about the horrors of mass killings. **********The cartoon reflects a widespread anger here over a resolution making its way through the United States Senate to proclaim a national day of remembrance for the widespread killings of Armenians at the hands of Ottoman Turks during World War I. What especially outrages many Turks is the resolution's characterization of the killings as genocide. They complain that it unfairly reinforces a common - and, they insist, mistaken - view that Turks rank among the great butchers of the 20th century. **********For decades, Armenians have asserted that 1.5 million of their countrymen were slain or allowed to die of starvation in a Turkish genocidal campaign begun in the spring of 1915. Turkish historians and officials maintain that the number of deaths was closer to 300,000 and that there was no deliberate extermination program but rather random violence on all sides at a time of great turbulence, as a world war raged and the Ottoman Empire was collapsing. If anything, they say, an even larger number of Turkish Muslims were killed by Armenians. **********To make clear their displeasure, Government officials threaten reprisals if the Senate passes the resolution, which has already cleared the Judiciary Committee. As a warning, they have begun to restrict American military movements, and say they are prepared to scrap a security agreement, up for renewal next year, that gives the United States the use of military bases and surveillance outposts here. **********''Turkey-bashing is a popular sport,'' said Tugay Ozceri, the No. 2 official in the Foreign Ministry. ''If that resolution clears Congress, United States-Turkey relations will be dramatically marred.'' The American Embassy in Ankara agrees, and it has sent an unusual letter to Americans living in Turkey expressing the Bush Administration's opposition to the Senate bill and urging that attention be paid to Turkish sensibilities. But that has not mollified Turkish officials, who accuse the Administration of slowness to act. **********This is not the first such Congressional resolution, but it has gone further than most, in part because it has 53 sponsors and because its chief supporter is the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole. The bill would designate next April 24 as a ''national day of remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 1915-23.'' Deportations in 1915 **********In the spring of 1915, the Ottoman Empire began to deport hundreds of thousands of Turkish Armenians, who were openly sympathetic to the Allied powers opposing the Turks and other nations. April 24 was the date of a major roundup in 1915. Countless thousands perished from beatings or shootings or from deprivation on the journey to a desert in what is now Syria. **********Besides believing that the word ''genocide'' is loaded, Turks object to the dates in the resolution. They extend well beyond the end of World War I in 1918, to the final dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of the modern Turkish republic in 1923. **********''It goes to the foundation of the present Turkish state,'' a Western diplomat said. ''It tells them that their state was founded on a mass crime.'' **********Among the more outspoken critics of Washington is a member of Parliament from the opposition Social Democratic Populist Party, who, following the cartoonist's lead, proposes that a monument be built in Ankara to the American Indian. **********''The so-called Armenian genocide has not been established as a historical fact,'' the lawmaker, Istemihan Talay, said.

In the week that ended Wednesday, total assets of taxable money market funds rose $2.8 billion, to a record $282.8 billion, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Since the end of 1988, those assets are up $19 billion. **********One alternative to such funds, which is getting increasing attention from investors, is a relatively new mutual fund, with an unusual structure that combines aspects of money market funds, closed-end mutual funds and open-end funds. **********The managers of the fund, the Putnam Prime Rate Trust, celebrate every time the prime rate rises. ''It's gone up six times since we started the fund last April,'' said Pamela Weingarten, the chief executive of Pilgrim Group Inc. **********Pilgrim said yesterday that the fund's assets had topped $250 million, not a huge amount by industry standards but unusual for a fund started in 1988 and not backed by one of the industry's giants. **********The fund is invested entirely in corporate loans purchased from banks, 68 percent of them stemming from leveraged buyouts. Those loans are indexed either to the banks' prime lending rate, which was raised last week to 11 1/2 percent from 11 percent, or to the London interbank offered rate, which fluctuates daily and is now above 10 percent. In either case, when rates rise, so does the yield on the fund. The latest quoted 30-day yield is 10.3 percent, but that will rise as a result of the recent prime rate increase. **********One result of the fund's unusual structure is a lack of constant liquidity for the investor, who has the opportunity to cash out only once a quarter. The fund discourages short-term investing in two other ways. There is a 3 percent sales charge, and an investor who withdraws money in less than a year forfeits 90 days' interest. Thus anyone who invested money for less than six months would probably have a loss. **********Although it is nominally a closed-end fund, Prime Rate Trust is being continually offered and during February took in $2.7 million a day in new investments, Ms. Weingarten said. **********Most closed-end funds trade on stock exchanges or the over-the-counter market, enabling holders to sell their shares whenever they wish at the going market price. By contrast, the Prime Rate Trust fund is not traded, which means that an owner of shares can only sell them back to the fund during the quarterly tender offers. The last such offer ended Wednesday, with $500,000 in redemptions. **********Since all income is paid out by the fund, the net asset value is kept at a constant $10 a share, where it will remain unless and until a borrower defaults on a loan. So far that has not happened. **********In effect, the Prime Rate Trust is a long-term investment in short-term assets, and it is more risky than a money market fund. But the average money market fund is now yielding just a bit above 9 percent, well below the Pilgrim fund's return. **********The existence of such a fund is a reflection of how banking has changed in recent years. Banks once made their own loans and kept the bulk of them. But the big money center banks have increasingly begun to sell off large participations in their loans as soon as they are made, choosing to profit from the up-front fees in arranging a loan and to free their capital for other deals. **********Although the Prime Rate Trust fund competes with banks for investors' money, Ms. Weingarten said banks had not been reluctant to sell loans to her fund. **********The principal risk for investors in the fund is that in the next recession, whenever that might be, there will be a wave of defaults on leveraged buyout loans. Ms. Weingarten emphasizes that the loans are secured by collateral and are senior to much of the other debt of the companies. But some banking analysts have grown nervous over the rising amount of buyout loans, and in effect this fund is just another bank owning such loans."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/business/what-s-new-weather-monitoring-computers-that-help-skippers-navigate-ferret-fish.html": {"writer_name": "Jack Wynn", "pub_date": "1989-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 483, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Computers That Help Skippers Navigate and Ferret Out Fish", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN WEATHER MONITORING; Computers That Help Skippers Navigate and Ferret Out Fish", "body_text": " **********On-board weather-monitoring computers are enabling captains of ocean fishing vessels not only to sail the safest routes, but to increase the size of their catches. **********Introduced over the last two years, the computers cost from $10,000 to $300,000, depending on their sophistication. For instance, Systems West Inc. sells a portable unit for $35,000 that includes an antenna, satellite receiver, processor and a high-resolution color video monitor. The Science Applications International Corporation, a military contractor in LaJolla, Calif., is marketing much larger weather consoles, priced at $100,000 and up, mainly to the Government. **********The computers receive from the Government's weather satellite real-time data on prevailing conditions within up to two million square miles of any location plugged into the system. Most models display images of ocean currents and cloud patterns. Using this data and a vessel's starting point and destination, many computers can chart a ship's course, bypassing undertows and approaching fronts to save both fuel and time. Fishing vessels are able to complete three trips in the time it previously took for two, according to the National Marine Fishery Service, a Government agency. **********The computers also display images of the ocean surface, shaded in an array of colors - up to 256 on the Systems West model - to indicate temperature variations. Fishing captains use the temperature readings to find fish. While yellow-finned tuna prefer sea temperatures of around 80 degrees, flounder seek cooler waters of around 55 degrees. **********These precise readings allow fishers to spend less time hunting for fish and more time catching them. ''Preliminary data indicate that fishers with access to satellite imaging can save 25 to 40 percent search time,'' said Michael Laurs, an oceanographer at the Southwest center of the National Marine Fishery Service. **********The computers certainly are more accurate than the weather charts from NASA and the National Weather Service that fishing vessels used to rely on. Sent over teletype and facsimile machines, the data - derived largely from readings taken at sea by the Navy and Coast Guard - are often outdated by the time they reach fishing vessels. **********''It became an unhappy joke to find out later that the calculations were made two days earlier,'' said Peter Scoli, an 82-year-old fisher from Annapolis, Md., who estimates that the size of his catch has increased by about 15 percent since he purchased a weather computer. **********Still, some worry that computer-aided fishing could deplete fishing stocks. While increased competition weighed heavily in the 53-percent decline since 1979 in Atlantic cod off the New England coast, improved fishing technology was also a factor, according to David Crestin, chief of the fisheries management division at the Fishery Service in Massachusetts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/05/business/trains-to-be-cut-in-canada.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1989-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trains To Be Cut In Canada", "print_headline": "Trains To Be Cut In Canada", "body_text": " **********The Canadian Government said today that it would cut passenger train service by more than 50 percent nationwide, touching off bitter protests in a country that was stitched together by railroads in the 19th century and where trains and the people who ride them are the stuff of national folklore. **********The cuts, from 405 trains a week to 191 in the heavily subsidized rail network, had been expected for months because of Government budget cuts. Canada has been grappling with a national deficit of $25 billion a year, which is nearly 50 percent higher per capita than the United States deficit. **********Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative Government, which described the cuts as irreversible and refused to hold parliamentary hearings, hopes to cut a total of $850 million from its railroad subsidies by 1993. (All figures are in United States dollars.) By eliminating services that included the most famous Canadian train of all, the transcontinental run over the Canadian Pacific tracks through the Rocky Mountains, Mr. Mulroney touched a deep nerve. Trains have been a large part of what has held this sparsely populated country together, and their role has been imprinted on the national psyche. 'Canadian Railroad Trilogy' **********More than 20 years after he first performed it, Gordon Lightfoot, the popular balladeer, continues to stir pandemonium at concerts when he breaks into the opening line of his ''Canadian Railroad Trilogy'': ''There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run,/ When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun.'' **********In Ottawa, where the cuts were announced, Mr. Mulroney tried to still the uproar by saying he had no choice if the Government was to rein in expenditures. He told Parliament that on some railroads in the Canadian west, it was costing the Government more than $400 in subsidies every time a passenger got on a train. ''Public spending has been out of control for 25 years in Canada - no controls over it exercised whatsoever with the exception of the last five years - and this must be brought under control,'' the 50-year-old Prime Minister told reporters. **********Part of the Government's problem is that the cuts, to be phased in starting on Jan. 15, will hurt most deeply in the small towns and rural areas that have been strong supporters of the Conservatives and that regard themselves as the guardians of Canadian tradition. With 38 routes cut to 20, total passenger train mileage would drop from an expected 12 million miles this year to 6 million in 1993. **********The Government-owned Via Rail Canada Inc. would end up offering little more than skeleton service in wide areas of the Maritime Provinces, along Canada's Atlantic coast, and in the western provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Northern Ontario would be hard hit, too, as would parts of Quebec. **********At a news conference, Canada's Transport Minister, Benoit Bouchard, made it clear that the mission of Via Rail, created in 1977 to take over the failing passenger services of two railroad companies, Canadian Pacific and the Government-owned Canadian National Railways, would be to seek a return to eventual profitability. Via Rail would concentrate 128 of its 191 trains a week on the central rail corridor between Windsor, Ontario, and Quebec City, a 725-mile stretch through areas where nearly 15 million of Canada's 25 million people live. The corridor accounts for two-thirds of nationwide traffic. Cuts of 2,700 Jobs **********More than 2,700 of Via Rail's 7,300 employees would lose their jobs as a result of the cuts, but a confidential Via Rail report, copies of which were leaked to Canadian newspapers, said that nearly 60,000 Canadian jobs depended on passenger rail services, nearly 30,000 of them in tourism, and that many of these might be in jeopardy, too. **********For the Government, the immediate costs, in severance and other payments, would run to about $120 million, but Mr. Bouchard said that Ottawa expected its subsidies to Via Rail to fall from $545 million to about $297 million by 1993. **********In Parliament, the 45-minute daily question period turned into tirades against the rail cuts. The opposition leader, John N. Turner of the Liberal Party, assailed Mr. Mulroney for having ''destroyed'' an essential part of Canadian history and a service depended upon by many Canadians, especially the old and the young. Comparisons With Amtrak **********Along with other opposition spokesmen, Mr. Turner said the Government, instead of cutting rail services, should be investing in them heavily, as governments in Western Europe and Japan have done. ''Canada needs a modern, efficient passenger rail service,'' Mr. Turner said. **********Amid the furor, both sides offered comparisons with Amtrak, the Government-owned passenger railway system in the United States, which made severe cuts in passenger routes after it was established in the early 1970's. At that time, American critics held up the extensive passenger services in Canada, as well as those in Western Europe and Japan, as an example for the United States. **********Some opposition critics in Ottawa today maintained that Amtrak, now a commercial success, was a model for Canada. But Mr. Mulroney dismissed the idea, saying that his Government's cuts were less severe than those made by Amtrak in 1971, which he said amounted to 75 percent of all United States passenger routes. Transcontinental Service **********Much of the immediate criticism centered on the Government's decision to eliminate the transcontinental train known as the Canadian, which has run for decades on the 3,000-mile run from Montreal to Vancouver. The train, with glass-roofed observation cars, has drawn thousands of American tourists with its spectacular Rocky Mountain views. **********The Canadian Pacific track on which it has run marked a historic watershed when it was completed with the joining of the eastern and western portions in the Rocky Mountains on Nov. 7, 1885, since it opened up large areas of the west to settlement and ultimately made possible the inclusion of the western provinces in the Canadian confederation established in 1867. **********The Government said today that transcontinental service would continue three times weekly on the more northerly transcontinental route now held by Government-owned Canadian National. But it also said that all of Via Rail's routes would be open for takeover by private investors. **********A Toronto-based travel company, Blyth & Company, immediately announced that it would start a luxury transcontinental service on the Canadian Pacific route beginning in June 1990, with amenities that would include private marble bathrooms, gourmet meals, feather pillows and private video screens. Sam Blyth, the company president, said that one-way tickets for the 70-hour run would go on sale Oct. 14 at a price of $2,122."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/06/business/indictment-is-seen-in-pentagon-case.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Shenon", "pub_date": "1989-01-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 941, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INDICTMENT IS SEEN IN PENTAGON CASE", "print_headline": "INDICTMENT IS SEEN IN PENTAGON CASE", "body_text": " **********A Federal grand jury in Virginia is expected to announce on Friday the first indictment in a broad investigation of accusations of bribery and fraud involving Pentagon officials, the Justice Department said today. **********Lawyers for several key suspects in the case, including Stuart Berlin, a Navy procurement specialist, and William Parkin, a former Navy official who is now a military procurement consultant, said an indictment of their clients appeared imminent. **********At least two major military contractors under scrutiny in the case are also expected to face criminal charges Friday, possibly including conspiracy and bribery, the lawyers said. **********The charges would be the first to result from a two-year Federal investigation centering on accusations that military contractors obtained an edge in competing for Defense Department contracts by illegally obtaining proprietary Government information.

Mr. Berlin has denied wrongdoing. Investigators said in the affidavit that Mr. Berlin apparently received $1,000 every few months from Mr. Parkin and Mr. Lackner. **********Mr. Lackner's chief lawyer could not be reached for comment today. Hazeltine Vows Cooperation **********Hazeltine said in a prepared statement that the company ''continues to cooperate fully with authorities and has no further comment at this time.'' **********Mr. Parkin, who worked for the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project office in the late 1970's, has also worked recently as a consultant to Teledyne, which was the subject of Federal search warrants last summer in the Pentagon investigation. **********The company, a division of Teledyne Inc., makes a radar test device mentioned in a separate search warrant that sought documents in Mr. Lackner's home. **********''We've been cooperating with the Government in this investigation,'' said Mr. Baker, the Teledyne spokesman. Asked whether the company has been advised that it will face criminal charges, he said, ''The last I heard, the Government said there has been no official decision.'' Delays on Indictments **********Justice Department officials said Mr. Hudson and his staff had been embarrassed by repeated delays in bringing indictments in the Pentagon investigation. After the inquiry became public knowledge last June, the department issued public statements predicting criminal charges by late fall. **********Officials at department headquarters in Washington said they were puzzled by the decision in Mr. Hudson's office to alert reporters to the expected indictment a day in advance. **********''Usually the policy around here is a cautious one,'' one department official said.

Corners grew rarer and less profitable in the 1920's, and were supposed to have disappeared entirely until a series of transactions made it appear that a corner is now in the works. **********The case has set Wall Street buzzing about how it could have happened,whether any rules were broken, and how the Securities and Exchange Commission and the American Stock Exchange will straighten out the situation. The S.E.C. has not leveled any charges, but has suspended trading in Chase Medical Group Inc., the company whose shares seem to have been cornered, until Thursday. Investigations are under way. **********The existence of an apparent corner took many by surprise. Although the company involved is small, the case could further sully Wall Street's image at a time when other forms of market manipulation are in the spotlight. And it has sent regulators scurrying to study rules they had not invoked in decades. **********Cornering a stock is a maneuver capped by a one-two punch. This is how it works: **********One group acquires not just all the available shares of a company, but more than all of them - an arrangement made possible because some investors sell the shares short. Those investors, betting the share price will fall, borrow shares and sell them into the market. **********Then comes the one-two punch. Having accumulated the shares, the group controlling the securities demands that the shares it has lent to short sellers be returned. With other shares unavailable, the shorts cannot honor that demand. **********This allows the group controlling the securities to buy shares to satisfy the obligation, using the short sellers' money. That is known as a ''buy-in.'' Since the group is the only one with any stock that can be sold, it can set any price it wishes. The stock is thus cornered and the shorts are squeezed. **********In the war between bulls and bears, longs and shorts, a stock corner is the ultimate victory for the longs - or at least it seems that way to those who dream of corners. **********But historically, that victory has often been Pyrrhic. Those who corner the stock own a company for which they often have severely overpaid, because in accumulating their position, they have sharply bid up the shares. Often they can sell only at a much lower price. **********In two celebrated corners of the 1920's, involving the Stutz Motor Car Company of America, an auto maker, and Piggly Wiggly Stores, a grocery chain, the men who engineered the corners went bankrupt. **********Since then, regulations and legislation have been implemented to discourage corners, and such transactions have become a rare phenomenon. That is why the Chase case has gained attention exceeding the size of the company involved. **********To be sure, there has been no allegation by regulators that anyone tried to arrange a corner in Chase Medical, an obscure Florida-based chain of health clinics. But from what is known, it is clear that those buying the stock - customers of the brokerage firm Moore & Schley, Cameron & Company - came very close to producing a corner, whatever their intent. The only thing that kept the situation from progressing further was the trading halt. **********Although the issues raised by the case are complex, one fact is clear: Millions of dollars in profits and losses may be gained, or lost, as a result of whether the Government allows the apparent corner in Chase Medical to proceed to its conclusion. Since there are few precedents, the S.E.C.'s options are not clear. Louis Loss, a former S.E.C. official and retired professor of law at Harvard University, said someone who planned a corner might be charged with violating Section 9(a)2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That bars trades when the intent is to raise the price of a stock with the purpose of inducing others to buy it. The normal remedy in such cases is to bar sales by the violator until the effect of his actions is no longer present in the market. Whether such a step would prevent a buy-in is not clear. **********One investor with a short position in Chase said he believes regulators should bar buy-ins in the stock. The Amex has the power to do that, but has not invoked the rule in 30 years. **********Another trader, who has no position in the stock but would like to short it because he believes Chase Medical is overvalued, said regulators should at least force Moore & Schley to allow their shares to be borrowed, thus preventing a buy-in. ''Something has to be done, or otherwise these guys will wind up winners, and they will do it again,'' he said. **********Moore & Schley, for its part, could lose capital if the stock falls sharply, or perhaps make money if it soars. Lawsuits, by Moore & Schley customers who hold the shares, or by short sellers, or by both, are a possibility, some market participants say. The brokerage firm says it has ample capital, but will not say whether the case forced it to raise more capital. **********Almost lost in the furor is Chase Medical, the company whose stock is at the heart of the controversy. Founded four years ago, it went public in July 1987, at $5.25 per share. Its chain of medical centers cater to Hispanic patients in the Miami area, and would like to expand to other metropolitan areas where there are large concentrations of Hispanic patients. **********At the time the Moore & Schley customers began buying, Chase appeared highly profitable. But in early November, Chase said that health insurance companies, which pay most of its bills, objected to the fees it was charging and had refused to pay them. The result was a large writedown in accounts receivable and a loss. Mr. Chase says the company is again operating profitably. **********The report of the writeoff might have deterred some buyers, but Moore & Schley's clients stepped up their purchases after the bad news. The stock spurted from under $7 a share to a high of $13.75. Before trading was halted Jan. 13, it traded at $13, more than 100 times profits in the latest 12 months and more than three times revenues. **********The unusual trading in Chase began to come to light in late December, when the Amex said customers of one brokerage house had acquired a substantial part of the float in Chase; market sources identified the firm as Moore & Schley. On Jan. 16, the firm confirmed it was involved and gave the total number of shares it and its customers controlled as 1.5 million. **********Chase Medical has only 2.6 million shares outstanding, and Stanley Chase, the company's chairman, owns 1.2 million of them. As a corporate insider who owned his stake before the company went public, Mr. Chase is limited by S.E.C. rules in the number of shares he can sell. So it appears that any would-be buyer of a substantial number of shares would have to turn to Moore & Schley and its customers. **********Late last week, the Amex reported that the total short position in Chase in mid-January came to 340,834 shares. **********S.E.C. rules adopted in the wake of corners and other scandals of the 1920's require that traders disclose their positions within 10 days of acquiring 5 percent of a company, and that they ''promptly'' disclose further trades that raise or lower that position by at least one percentage point. That disclosure makes it all the more difficult to arrange a corner, for shorts can see the position being accumulated and cover their positions before the corner can take effect. **********But in the case of the Moore & Schley customers, it is still not known who they are, or how much was bought by each. No customer is required to report a position, of course, if he is not part of a group and owns less than 5 percent. Whether the buyers were acting independently is one of the aspects of the case that the S.E.C. is investigating. **********By Moore & Schley's account, customers began accumulating the shares in the summer, and stepped up their purchases in November and December. Mr. Chase, the company's founder, sold 79,000 shares, at $4.67 each in August, and 128,000 shares, at $6.75, in November. **********In December, by the Moore & Schley account, some customers failed to conform to margin rules by not putting up cash for purchases of about 300,000 shares. The S.E.C. investigation is looking into the possibility that shares were purchased for accounts of customers without authorization, and that those customers refused to pay when they learned of the transactions. **********Moore & Schley responded to the failure of its customers to pay by buying the shares for its own account, giving it an 11 percent stake in Chase. **********One puzzle on Wall Street is why Moore & Schley didn't sell the stock. ''The normal procedure for a brokerage house, if they have a bad trade, is to get out of it,'' commented one broker not involved in the case. **********David Garodnick, Moore & Schley's general counsel, declined to discuss the issue. But it is probable that, had it done so, the share price would have plummeted. The Amex has on occasion ordered brokers to buy securities from customers after the broker was deemed to be at least partly responsible for a dangerous concentration of shares and it was feared that a sale would destabilize the market. **********One investor who has a sizable short position in Chase and asked that his name not be used, said he was warned in mid-December by a Moore & Schley broker that a huge squeeze was going to occur. The broker he named declined to be interviewed. **********Those on the long side have been less willing to talk than the short sellers. ''We're fighting a war of mammoth proportions with the shorts,'' one said last week, asking that his name not be used because of pending investigations. **********To Wall Streeters with a sense of history, it seems appropriate that it is Moore & Schley that is involved in a case of highly concentrated assets. Although it is a minor player on Wall Street now, 81 years ago Moore & Schley was a leading firm that found itself in a position of even worse concentration. It had loaned large sums to Grant B. Schley, its senior partner, and his associates. Those loans were secured by shares in the Tennessee Coal Iron & Railroad Company, one of the few steel companies not owned by U.S. Steel. **********As the value of Tennessee Coal shares plunged in the Panic of 1907, it appeared that Moore & Schley would go under. That was averted only when J.P. Morgan worked out a deal with President Theodore Roosevelt to allow U.S. Steel to acquire Tennessee Coal while antitrust regulators looked the other way. Had the President not agreed, Mr. Morgan warned, Moore & Schley would fail, and perhaps take with it a major part of American business as the panic grew worse. It was one of the first accommodations between the trust-busting President and Mr. Morgan, the Wall Street giant who played the major role in creating such giants as U.S. Steel."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/25/business/deposit-fee-option-studied.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deposit-Fee Option Studied", "print_headline": "Deposit-Fee Option Studied", "body_text": " **********To resolve the crisis in the savings industry, the Treasury Department is considering charging a fee on deposits at insured institutions, a Congressional aide said today. **********He said that option was one of a number that the Treasury is discussing with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Widely Ranging Estimates **********The estimates of the dead buried here in the Bykovnya forest range from the suspiciously precise 6,329 chiseled on the pink marble slab placed at the site last May by the local government, to the 150,000 to 240,000 calculated by Mykolo Lysenko, a retired economist who has made Bykovnya a personal crusade. **********Mr. Lysenko arrived at his figure by pacing off the gravesite and calculating the number of bodies that could be packed into each pit. The Government figure is apparently based on the remains gathered during a partial excavation in the 1970's. **********The forest gravesite was studied by an official war crimes commission in 1944, while Stalin was still very much in power, and by a second commission in 1971 after the site had been vandalized by robbers in search of wedding rings and gold teeth. Both concluded that the Nazis were responsible. **********In 1987 Mr. Lysenko was visiting his wife's relatives in Bykovnya when he came upon the litter of bones and began searching out witnesses. After he collected testimony from 10 elderly villagers, the Government formed a third commission. **********It reaffirmed the earlier verdict, and in May the Government erected the stone memorial amid the slender pines and grassy hummocks, situated down a muddy side road off the highway that leads east from Kiev toward the town of Brovary. **********The stone is inscribed in Ukrainian: ''Eternal memory,'' and beneath that, ''Here are buried 6,329 Soviet soldiers, partisans, members of the underground and peaceful citizens killed by the Fascist occupying forces from 1941-1943.'' Fourth Commission Formed **********Mr. Lysenko, convinced that commissioners were covering up an inconvenient truth, went back to the village and found more witnesses, and in December the authorities agreed to create a fourth commission headed by the same man who led the last investigation, Maj. Gen. Ivan D. Gladush, the Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs. **********General Gladush recently told an interviewer for the newspaper Vecherny Kiev, that since there was ''no documentary evidence'' and ''not one witness'' of the actual shootings, he did not see any reason to doubt the earier conclusion that the bodies were delivered here from two Nazi concentration camps in the region. **********Indeed, Mr. Lysenko's evidence is largely circumstantial. **********Mr. Kukovenko, now 74 years old, provides perhaps the most compelling testimony. He says that four days after the Germans arrived in 1941, he and several friends were rounded up and led into the pine forest. They unearthed the newly decaying bodies of men and women, stacked in pits. He said the Germans took photographs of the dig and then ordered the villagers to cover it over again. **********Other witnesses confirm that the site was fenced and used years before the German occupation, and that the truck traffic stopped after the Germans came. Some claim to have seen blood on the ground where the trucks were parked during the years of the Stalin's great terror. Run on 'Statute 23' **********According to local folklore, when suspects arrested by the N.K.V.D. demanded to know what law they had broken, the interrogators in Kiev would tell them, ''You've been arrested under Statute 23,'' referring to the number of the tram line that still runs to Bykovnya. **********Recently two generals from the Internal Affairs Ministry visited villagers to ask what they knew. Mr. Nizenko, now 63, said they had quickly lost interest when he told them the dead were not victims of the Germans. **********''They say that the green fence is a myth,'' Mr. Kukovenko said with indignation. ''And I suppose I myself am a myth.'' **********It is no myth to his wife, Yelena, who wept as she described how her father was taken off by Stalin's police in 1937, perhaps to lie behind the green fence. ----Rally Marks Stalin's Death KIEV, U.S.S.R., March 5 (AP) -About 5,000 Ukrainians marked the 36th anniversary today of Josef Stalin's death by rallying to form a group to expose his crimes. **********''Our aim is to fight against modern Stalinism,'' Villan Ochakievsky, a Ukrainian dissident who was freed from imprisonment in a mental hospital last summer, told the crowd. **********More than 2,000 people heard speakers express similar sentiments in Moscow in a rally organized by Memorial, the parent group of the one founded today in Kiev. The Moscow crowd, huddling under a canopy in Gorky Park, applauded vigorously when Yuri Koryakin, a literary critic and human-rights campaigner, linked Yegor K. Ligachev, a member of the Politburo, to Stalinism and demanded his resignation. **********''Democracy Yes! Stalinism No!'' one banner at the Moscow meeting read. ''For a Society Without Executioners and Victims,'' read another. **********The 5,000 people gathered in front of Kiev's Republic Stadium formed the new group. The meeting ended with adoption of resolutions calling for a national day of mourning for the victims of Stalin and opening of secret police archives. **********Security agents did not interfere with the four-hour meeting in Kiev. **********Kiev's public prosecutor, Vladimir I. Shevchenko, made a reference at the rally to the mass grave at Bykovnya. **********Mr. Shevchenko said investigators had found evidence that people buried at Bykovnya disappeared in 1937 and 1938. But he said officials still believe the site may also contain victims of the Nazis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/24/business/finance-briefs-767889.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Interlake Corp., Oak Brook, Ill., has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $200 million in senior subordinated debentures, due in 2001, through Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Yet almost simultaneously a delay in a plan to remove border controls among just five countries by early next year underlined the difficulties. **********West Germany asked for the delay until it had clarified the rights of East Germans to travel in the border-free region it would form with France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. There were also disagreements about when police forces could act outside their national jurisdictions. **********But in working out rules for the entire 12-nation region, a still broader range of problems arise, affecting not only the freedom of movement of the 320 million citizens of the community but also the circumstances under which outsiders will be allowed to visit, migrate or take refuge here. **********Among citizens of the 12 member countries, there is particular concern over the need to chart a middle course between two disturbing extremes - a Europe with such tight police coordination as to threaten individual freedoms and a Europe with such lax border controls as to feed insecurity. **********The immigration problem, which is treated separately from drugs, terrorism and organized crime, stems from the fact that from Jan. 1, 1993, any citizen from a noncommunity country will be free to travel throughout the region once he or she has passed through any external border checkpoint. **********But while most Western European countries are eager to curb illegal immigration, above all from the third world, the source of each nation's problems is different. Seeking a Common Visa **********A statement issued here on Friday by community ministers said each government should ''bear in mind the best interests'' of others, so that a person refused entry by one should be kept out by the rest. They also suggested that community governments start by recognizing one another's visas and then move toward a common visa. What the ministers did not disclose is that there is a ''hard core'' list of around 70 countries whose nationals will need visas at the insistence of one or another community member. **********The elimination of internal borders will also require the community to align its refugee policy. With a view to avoiding multiple applications or successive rejections, the ministers said, ''A single member state should be appointed to examine the application for asylum on the strength of objectively defined criteria.'' **********Contending that they will meet the deadline imposed by the creation of a single regional market on Dec. 31, 1992, the ministers said the ad hoc group on immigration would have draft conventions on controlling external borders and on asylum policy ready in 1990. **********Drugs, terrorism and other ''transnational'' crimes are being handled by the so-called Trevi Group, which has responsibility for protecting the community from illicit activities that may profit from the removal of controls. **********''Terrorists and professional criminals are increasingly adept at exploiting the limits of competence of national agencies, the differences between legal systems in countries and gaps in cooperation between services,'' the community ministers warned. **********But while the problem has been identified, European governments still seem a long way from an effective response. So far, they have focused on the need for improved exchange of information through liaison officers, common border posts and common radio frequencies.

He succeeded Nerio Nesi, who stepped down Thursday night after 10 years in the job. **********The Government, which has a 74 percent interest in the bank, also appointed Paolo Savonna, a former central bank director long prominent in Government circles, as its general manager, succeeding Giacomo Pedde, who resigned with Mr. Nesi. No Involvement Suggested **********There was no suggestion that either Mr. Nesi or Mr. Pedde was in any way involved in the unauthorized credits granted by the bank's branch in Atlanta, but they were both harshly criticized for the inadequate internal controls that permitted the scandal to take place. **********Over at least two years, the bank's Atlanta representative, Christopher Drogoul, was said to have issued some 2,500 letters of credit covering exports of grains and machinery to Iraq without the knowledge of senior executives at the bank's North American headquarters in New York or its main office in Rome. **********Further, when the scandal broke last month, Mr. Nesi found himself without political support here. Although he is a socialist, he was said to be on poor terms with the socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, and with the Treasury Minister, Guido Carli, who is also a socialist. The socialists belong to a five-party Government coalition headed by the Christian Democrats. **********One issue of contention was Mr. Nesi's belief that Mr. Carli was intent on privatizing the bank, which is known by its initials, B.N.L. In his letter of resignation to Mr. Carli today, Mr. Nesi pointedly lamented that he would no longer be in a position to oppose the minister's ''declared intention'' of removing the B.N.L. from the public sector. Bitterness Is Cited **********In his letter, Mr. Nesi also spoke of his ''bitterness'' over the fact that during the current crisis, the Treasury ''failed to provide the bank with the support that it not only deserved but also had a right to expect.'' Denying any responsibility for the scandal, he added that he stepped down ''with a lucid mind and a serene spirit.'' **********While the replacement of B.N.L.'s top management may satisfy some Italian politicians, however, financial experts said much more public information about the Atlanta case - how it occurred, what crimes, if any, were committed and what losses might result - would be necessary to restore confidence in the bank. **********Mr. Carli, who has agreed to appear before the Senate's Finance and Treasury Committee next Thursday, can also expect to come under intense pressure to provide more details. So far, neither Mr. Carli nor any other Cabinet minister has spoken out. **********The Treasury nonetheless announced today that it had acted to shore up B.N.L's assets, which stand at around $3.2 billion. ''No asset losses have occurred,'' it said. ''The operations have resulted in an increased credit risk through the concentration of business with one particular country.'' **********Significantly, after the announcement of the new leadership at B.N.L., bank shares rose sharply on the Milan stock exchange."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/02/business/a-price-war-in-japan-on-foreign-calls.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1989-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1256, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Price War In Japan on Foreign Calls", "print_headline": "A Price War In Japan on Foreign Calls", "body_text": " **********One of the most expensive services in Japan, the land of $70 watermelons, $150 cab rides and camera gear that costs twice as much as in New York, is making international telephone calls. But this weekend, a price war broke out. **********Since well before World War II, Japan has been connected to the outside world by a single Government-approved monopoly. And for as long as most of Japan's notoriously docile consumers can remember, it has always cost far more to call from Tokyo to the United States than the other way around. **********That all ended this morning. After four years of preparation, two new competitors in international telephone service tossed switches that connected them to every telephone in Japan. Instantly, telephoning to the United States became, in some cases, 20 percent cheaper than calling Japan from the United States. Enormous Profits Cited **********''Maybe this will demonstrate to the Japanese that things here do not always have to be more expensive than they are everyplace else in the world,'' said Nobuo Ito, the executive vice president of International Telecom Japan Inc., one of the fledgling competitors. ''Japanese industry makes enormous profits by simply overpricing everything here. Maybe this will encourage them to set some reasonable prices.'' **********Few share Mr. Ito's optimism that a new era is dawning for Japanese consumers, because Japanese industry usually abhors competing on price. Discount houses and department store sales are rare. Manufacturers of video cameras and fax machines, for example, pack more and more options into their goods rather than lower the price of each new generation of equipment. **********Earlier this week Japan's Economic Planning Agency issued a devastating report on the high cost of living, attributing much of it to Japan's distribution system, Government subsidies to the rice industry and unnecessary add-on services that require more personnel in department stores. **********The arrival of competitive international telephone service comes at a politically fortuitious moment. It happened just as the Bush Administration was pressing Japan to give its own consumers a break - a theme that a parade of United States officials have struck here in recent weeks in their efforts to spur demand for American goods. **********But no one expected a price war, an event so rare here that it has a lot of people openly nervous. And the most nervous may be the top officers of KDD, formerly known as the Kokusai Denshin Denwa Company, which has held the monopoly on international communications services since 1871, when the first telegraph cable was laid between Nagasaki and Shanghai. **********''We've never faced any competition before, and even though we had time to prepare it is quite a shock,'' Takazo Ishii, the president of KDD, said last week at the company's office tower in Tokyo. Company officials fear that a plan to cut KDD's staff by 20 percent over the next few years may not be enough. Size of Cut a Surprise **********''We could not expect that prices would fall this fast,'' Mr. Ishii added. Apparently, no one at KDD, which had $1.95 billion in revenues last year, expected the competition to start its service with prices that undercut KDD by more than 23 percent. **********And when KDD last week announced a price cut to take effect in a month, it was accused of attempting to kill off its competition. Mr. Ishii responded that it was unreasonable to expect KDD not to react competitively. **********Only 10 years ago, KDD charged more than $15 for a prime-time three-minute call to the United States, about 50 percent more than the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's charges for calls to Japan. Under Government pressure, KDD's prices have fallen gradually but steadily. **********It is too early to say how much of a market share International Telecom and the other competitor, International Digital Communications, will capture. Each company says it needs 10 or 15 percent to prove truly viable. Drive for Clients Is Starting **********And now the race to attract customers is on. When service started this morning, a three-minute call to the United States on one of the services ranged from less than $3 to about $4.85, depending on the time of day. KDD's prime-time rate is $6.35, though it was forced to announce the major cut last week that will take effect in a month. By comparison, A.T.&T. charges $6.02 for a prime-time three-minute call, and $3.78 for its least costly call. **********For all the Japanese reluctance to offer discounts, price may be the only way to differentiate among competitors in telephone service. All use the same methods of transmission - the same Intelsat satellites and the same undersea fiber-optic cables to the United States. The only difference is that users of the two new communications companies have a significantly higher chance that their calls will go across the fiber-optic cable. **********That should work to the favor of the new entries because the cable provides far clearer connections than the satellites. For now, however, the two upstarts are only connecting to a limited number of countries, with most those where calling volume is highest. 'Skimming the Cream' **********''They are simply skimming the cream of the business,'' said Mr. Ishii, who complained that KDD spent millions of dollars connecting Japan to low-volume locations like Africa. **********But KDD can sustain competition much longer: The property it owns throughout Japan is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including its office tower in Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's most expensive business neighborhoods. One competitors, in contrast, is in rental space opposite Tokyo's fish market. **********Interestingly, Japanese regulators who examined the breakup of the Bell System have chosen a far different approach in promoting competition in their own telephone network. During the Bell breakup, customers had to select a primary long-distance service. That led to expensive campaigns by companies like the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, with each viewing it as essential to ''lock in'' consumers to their service. Choice Made by Dialing a Code **********In Japan, consumers vote every time they pick up the telephone. By dialing a three-digit number, they get KDD. But by dialing a different code they get the alternative services, which bill them automatically at the end of the month. ''Compared to the efforts and hardships that MCI and Sprint went through, we consider ourselves very lucky,'' said Mr. Ito of International Telecom. ''But we only have one chance. If people place a call and the quality is bad, they will go back to KDD.'' **********For both competitors, the key to success will be their ability to draw big corporate users, although for both companies many of Japan's biggest corporations are already investors. **********International Telecom's shareholders include holding companies like the Mitsubishi Corporation and the Sumitomo Corporation; trading companies like Mitsui & Company, the Marubeni Corporation and the Nisho Iwai Corporation; banks like the Bank of Tokyo, and electric companies like the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and the Tokyo Electric Power Company. The other competitor, International Digital Communications, is primarily run by C. Itoh & Company, the Toyota Motor Company, Cable and Wireless of Britain and one American company, Pacific Telesis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/20/business/greenspan-s-lincoln-savings-regret.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1989-11-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1568, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greenspan's Lincoln Savings Regret", "print_headline": "Greenspan's Lincoln Savings Regret", "body_text": " **********In late 1984, Alan Greenspan, then a private citizen, took on a consulting assignment for the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. Five years later, Mr. Greenspan, as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is finding that four-month job a source of embarrassment and regret. **********''When I first met the people from Lincoln, they struck me as reasonable, sensible people who knew what they were doing,'' Mr. Greenspan said in an interview last week. ''I don't want to say I am distressed, but the truth is I really am. I am thoroughly surprised by what has happened to Lincoln.'' **********Lincoln was taken over by Federal regulators in April in an action that is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion. Mr. Keating was removed from control. No Conflict Seen **********To be sure, no one in Washington is saying that Mr. Greenspan has compromised either his integrity or that of his office. And they add that consulting work done when he was a private economist should pose no conflict in his current role as one of the nation's top banking regulators. **********Members of Congress and banking analysts say the issue for Mr. Greenspan, a highly respected economist, is one of appearance. And his critics ask why he did not spot the germ of future troubles at Lincoln. **********The Justice Department is investigating Mr. Keating, the failure of Lincoln and also the five Senators who accepted contributions from Mr. Keating. The Senate Ethics Committee has hired a special counsel to investigate the Senators' actions. **********Mr. Greenspan concedes that he misjudged the ultimate intention of Mr. Keating and Lincoln's management. ''Of course I'm embarrassed by my failure to foresee what eventually transpired,'' he said. ''I was wrong about Lincoln. I was wrong about what they would ultimately do and the problems they would utlimately create.'' **********Mr. Greenspan's views in the winter of 1984-85 are being used now by Lincoln's past and present supporters in the fall of 1989 in their own defense. **********In late 1984, Mr. Greenspan, head of an economic forecasting firm, Townsend-Greenspan & Company, was retained by the New York law firm of Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison for four months. Mr. Greenspan says he does not remember how much he was paid but that it was at his usual rate. Heavily Involved in Development **********He was asked to conduct a study on real estate investment, known in the savings industry as direct investments, by savings and loan associations. Mr. Keating, Lincoln and its parent company, the American Continental Corporation, were heavily involved in real estate development. **********He was also to study Lincoln's financial condition, and if he considered the institution stable, to write officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco supporting an application by Mr. Keating for an exemption for Lincoln to a bank board rule forbidding substantial amounts of such investments. Mr. Greenspan sent such a letter in February 1985. Lincoln did not receive the exemption. **********A spokesman for Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and one of the Senators whose intervention with Federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln two years later, in early 1987, is the subject of the Senate and Justice Department inquiries, said that ''Senator McCain has cited the Greenspan study many times as a powerful force in his approach to Lincoln.'' **********The other four Senators involved in the inquiry are Democrats: Alan Cranston of California, the majority whip; Dennis DeConcini of Arizona; Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan and John Glenn of Ohio. Same Conclusions Today **********Mr. Greenspan says that if he had the same assignment today, confronted with the same evidence he had in 1984, his conclusions about Lincoln and about development projects in the industry as a whole would be very much the same. **********The issue at the time was whether ownership by savings and loan associations in real estate projects and other commercial ventures posed excessive risk. Mr. Greenspan, long a proponent of deregulation, argued then - and does still - that the laws Congress passed in setting up the savings industry would eventually drive it into a crisis, because institutions would be making their money from interest on 30-year fixed mortgages while having to pay depositors interest rates that at times fluctuated wildly. **********Mr. Greenspan and others argued that if the industry could diversify its mix of business by adding more short-term lending, like loans on development projects, savings institutions would be cushioned from the potentially disastrous effects of rising interest rates. Limitation Was Planned **********The Federal Home Loan Bank Board believed that such direct investments posed an excessive risk to the industry. In late 1984, when it was planning to adopt a regulation that would have limited those activities to 10 percent of an institution's activities, Mr. Greenspan was hired by the law firm on behalf of Lincoln. **********He submitted his study on direct investment to the bank board, but it adopted the regulation limiting such real estate investments anyway. Then Mr. Greenspan wrote the regulators, asking that Lincoln be given an exemption from the new rule. **********Mr. Greenspan described Lincoln's management as ''seasoned and expert in selecting and making direct investments,'' as having a ''long and continuous track record of outstanding success in making sound and profitable direct investments,'' as succeeding ''in a relatively short period of time in reviving an association that had become badly burdened by a large portfolio of long-term fixed-rate mortgages'' and that it had ''restored the association to a vibrant and healthy state, with a strong net worth position.'' View on Direct Investments **********Asked last week about his view of direct investments, Mr. Greenspan said: ''What I argued then, and argue now, is that direct investments are risky. If you give me two institutions, one that has a mix of short-term direct investments and long-term mortgages properly capitalized, or the same financing structure but invested only in long-term mortgages, I would say the first institution may well be safer.'' **********The problem was that as the economy in the Southwest collapsed in 1986, so did the value of the direct investments made by savings and loan institutions, many of which have since failed. This summer, Congress passed a $159 billion 10-year bailout of the industry. **********Although Mr. Greenspan's connections with Lincoln and Mr. Keating were raised at his confirmation hearings in 1987, they were of passing concern. Mr. Greenspan says he has met Mr. Keating twice, and has had no contact with Mr. Keating or Lincoln associates since early 1985. Troubled by Assertions **********What appears to bother Mr. Greenspan most are the assertions of the Senators that his letter to the regulators led them to believe intervention on Lincoln's behalf was warranted. **********''How could anyone use any evaluation I would have made in early 1985 as justification more than two years later?'' he asks. ''No one ever called saying, 'Do you still hold these views.' It's almost as bad as saying, 'I just read a report written two years ago that Amalgamated Widgets is a good stock to buy.' It just doesn't make sense.'' **********Could Mr. Greenspan have seen the handwriting on the wall on Lincoln, particularly signals that Mr. Keating's plans for Lincoln were far too ambitious and risky, as some critics maintain? Doubling of Size Cited **********Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va., who recently reviewed the Lincoln case, noted that during 1984 - the first year that Mr. Keating owned Lincoln - the institution's financial statements raised red flags. Lincoln doubled in size, from an institution with $1.1 billion in assets at the end of 1983 to one with $2.24 billion a year later. Its depositors' money was going to investments in raw land and unrelated businesses, which soared from $6.6 million to $308 million. **********''Any time you double in size, particularly of that magnitude, that should be a warning sign,'' Mr. Ely said. ''Rapid growth is a very risky strategy.'' **********Still, members of Congress and banking experts doubt that the damage to the Federal Reserve's chairman will be great. Mistake 'Now Meaningless' **********''The possible mistake in judgment that was made in 1984 and 1985 is now meaningless,'' said Kenneth A.

The legal spelling of an Estonian's name will be the original Estonian, in the Latin alphabet, not the transliteration into Cyrillic. **********And Estonian street and store signs will legally take precedence over their Russian equivalents, which cannot be in larger print than the Estonian.

Aquino continued for a sixth day, rebel troops in the city's business and financial district and the Philippine Government reached a cease-fire today long enough to begin evacuation of hundreds of foreigners trapped in their hotels by the fighting. **********By this morning, roughly 500 people, including about 90 Americans, were reported to have been evacuated in Government buses. Several thousand people, including more than 200 Americans, had been trapped since the weekend, when the rebels moved into hotels and office buildings in the financial center, Makati. **********But even with the evacuation under way and negotiations to end the standoff continuing, Manila remains a city divided - its business area and rich residential heart paralyzed by 400 rebel snipers and surrounded by loyalist armored vehicles, while the rest of the city goes about its business with surprisingly little sense of crisis. **********What began as an effort to topple the Government of President Corazon C. Aquino has turned into a standoff, with no sign of an early end. Makati seems firmly in the hands of a highly organized, disciplined force of rebels who are convinced that Mrs. Aquino is weakened every day that the stalemate endures. **********But a few miles away, where joggers run on a path near the bay, it was hard to find much out of place. **********Neither Mrs. Aquino nor the rebels have been able to tap into the ''people power'' that swept President Ferdinand E. Marcos out three years ago. Tired of an economy that will not run and turmoil that will not end, most people here seem sharply critical of both sides. **********The negotiations have continued on two fronts, Philippine officials said. The cease-fire discussions apparently had the sole aim of extracting the foreigners trapped in four hotels occupied by the rebels. **********Simultaneously, loyalist officers continued negotiations with their own estranged comrades, trying to find an alternative to feared building-by-building gun battles, something many fear could cost hundreds of lives. **********The Philippine Red Cross said today that 74 people had been killed in the fighting so far, more than in the worst previous coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino's Government. The latest violence has also left more than 500 wounded. **********On Tuesday, the Government troops seemed somewhat at a loss over what to do next. In a tour of the perimeter of the Makati area, Government forces could be seen massed around a large firehouse, positioning armored personnel carriers that bore yellow ribbons to make it clear that they were siding with Mrs. Aquino, who adopted yellow as the color of her campaign against Mr. Marcos three years ago. Firing at Will **********But when the troops moved into the center of the business district, a now-deserted area usually jammed with traffic, they fired indiscriminately, with no visible objective. This prompted return fire that was similarly random. **********A senior Government adviser with access to the negotiations suggested today that the troops loyal to Mrs. Aquino had little stomach for a showdown with the rebels, who include some of the country's best units. **********The adviser also said that ''the military is negotiating with its hands tied'' because it had no power to make the kind of political concessions that the rebels have demanded. **********So far, the chief demand is Mrs. Aquino's resignation and new elections. That approach has also been pressed by the country's Vice President, Salvador Laurel, who said again today that he would resign if Mrs. Aquino would step down with him. President Is Uncommunicative **********The President has rejected the idea. In the last few days she has virtually disappeared from view, saying little in public about the military standoff. **********The Government's troubles extend beyond Manila. In Cebu, 350 miles to the south, rebels still hold the airport and have reportedly wired commercial aircraft on the ground there with explosives, threatening to blow them up if attacked by Government forces. **********So far, the Government has let several deadlines for the rebels' surrender pass without mounting any attacks. **********For their part, the rebels have been trying to project an image of restraint. They have been polite to hotel guests, according to the few accounts that have emerged from the sealed-off buildings in Makati, and a leader of the group, Gregorio Honasan, issued a statement that seemed aimed at allaying fears in the United States that the coup leaders are anti-American. Not Fighting U.S., Leader Says **********''The United States of America is not our enemy,'' he said after the Bush Administration sent F-4 fighter planes over Manila to keep rebel aircraft out of the sky. ''To this great country and to our foreign friends and allies, we wish to assure them that our undertaking is purely internal to our country and is not intended to prejudice their legitimate rights or interests in the Philippines.'' **********Mr. Honasan, a former lieutenant colonel who led a 1987 coup attempt, then escaped from prison last year, asked all foreign governments ''not to allow themselves to be used in any manner to defend the criminal interests of a regime that has become the enemy of the Filipino people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/05/world/big-solidarity-victory-seen-in-poland.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1989-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Solidarity Victory Seen in Poland", "print_headline": "Big Solidarity Victory Seen in Poland", "body_text": " **********In their first chance to express at the ballot box their feelings about 44 years of Communist rule, Polish voters today appeared to have voted overwhelmingly for candidates endorsed by the Solidarity opposition and to have endangered many unopposed Communists whose election was thought to have been insured by the intricate election rules. **********Informal samplings by foreign journalists and exit polls conducted by the opposition raised the prospect that the Communists could fall short, in what would be a crushing setback, of the majority of 65 percent of the seats in the Parliament's lower house that had been guaranteed to them and their supporters by their agreement with Solidarity. **********Communist candidates and their allies, running unopposed and on a separate election list from opposition and independent candidates, appeared to be failing in many cases to get the 50 percent of the votes cast that is required for their election to be certified. If they fail to get 50 percent, their seats are supposed to be declared vacant. Majorities Seen for Solidarity **********Although the system of separate lists was contrived to minimize comparisons between the support for the Communists and support for Solidarity, it seemed clear that many more votes were cast for opposition candidates than for supporters of the regime. **********By contrast, candidates endorsed by the Solidarity movement - which became a legal organization again less than two months ago - appeared to be rolling up huge majorities in races for the lower house, called the Assembly, and the Senate. **********The contest for the 100 seats in the Senate was an open one, conducted with a single list of candidates, and there Solidarity's nominees appeared to be on their way to a solid majority in the most open election the Soviet bloc has seen in more than four decades. **********Official results were not expected until later in the week but if the results for the Communists and their allies were as poor as the samplings and exit polls indicated, the opposition may have exceeded its expectations to such an extent as to endanger Solidarity's agreement with the regime of President Wojciech Jaruzelski. **********Under the agreement, the governing party needs its guaranteed 299 seats in the 460-member Assembly to assure General Jaruzelski's election as President in an indirect vote by the Parliament's two chambers. Communist officials have hinted that they might then seek to block the convening of the Parliament on constitutional grounds, pointing to a requirement that all 460 seats in the Assembly be filled. Walesa Not a Candidate **********The Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, who was not standing as a candidate, expressed anxiety about the effects of lopsided results in favor of his movement. ''I think that too big a percentage of our people getting through would be disturbing and might force a fight on us,'' Mr. Walesa said after casting his vote in the Oliwa district of Gdansk, his hometown, according to Reuters. **********Though the day was sunny, voter turnout appeared low. The Government said that turnout by 7:30 P.M. varied considerably by province. Low attendance was marked in Lodz, where only 40.9 percent voted, and Bialystok, 50 percent. The largest turnout, according to a Communist Party spokesman, Jan Bisztyga, was in Wloclawek, in central Poland, at 70 percent. **********Adam Szostkiewicz, the spokesman for Solidarity's organizing committee in Cracow, said by phone that an informal exit poll of about 100 people in each of the city's nearly 20 districts showed that 75 percent to 80 percent had voted for the union's candidates. 'Huge Step Toward Democracy' **********The Government appeared nervous that some of its best-known candidates, running unopposed on the so-called ''national list,'' might fail to receive the required 50 percent. **********Major losses on the national list would be a blow to General Jaruzelski, who has sought to use the vote to sweep reform-minded leaders into key posts. Speaking in Gdansk, Mr. Walesa said one of the Communist candidates he had chosen was Tadeusz Fiszbach, the Gdansk party leader in the years 1980-81, when the accords that gave birth to Solidarity were signed. Mr. Fiszbach later left office in disgrace and was named Ambassador to Finland after hard-line party factions prevailed. **********General Jaruzelski, while declining to say how he had voted, said he hoped that Poland ''will get peace from these elections.'' **********''This is a huge step toward democracy,'' the Polish leader said after casting his vote. **********First partial returns were expected to begin arriving on Monday, but official results in most election districts were not expected until later this week, after hand counting of the ballots. Concern Over Cheating **********Final results will also have to include the votes of thousands of Poles abroad, including large contingents of workers employed in other Communist countries like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union. But an informal sampling by Western news organizations of about 200 voters in the capital and in Gdansk, the northern port city, found that more than 75 percent had supported Solidarity. **********The Government's polling service predicted that Solidarity would win at least 40 of the 55 Senate seats it believed would be decided today. The service gave no details of its poll, and did not say what it expected in the Assembly. **********Solidarity officials have expressed concern about the accuracy of counting in large military districts, where Solidarity has been refused entry to count the votes of soldiers. Today, the authorities took pains to allay the concern over possible cheating by admitting reporters to polling stations, where voters entered curtained booths to fill out the complicated sets of ballots, up to seven for each voter. **********To ease the process, particularly for elderly voters, Solidarity organizers set up information stands near the entrances to the polling stations. Moreover, the authorities affixed long lists with the candidates' names to the walls of voting stations so that voters could make a last check before entering the voting booth. **********Piotr Kardasz, a polling official in Warsaw's northern Zoliborz district near the big Huta Warszawa steel mill said, ''Parliamentary democracy is just getting started here.'' **********Then, employing the Polish variant of a common adage, he said, ''After all, Cracow wasn't built in a day.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/01/business/drexel-to-reduce-cash-portion-of-bonuses.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1989-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 720, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Drexel to Reduce Cash Portion of Bonuses", "print_headline": "Drexel to Reduce Cash Portion of Bonuses", "body_text": " **********Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. acknowledged yesterday that it planned to raise several million dollars of equity capital by requiring that its best-paid employees take a portion of their year-end bonuses in Drexel stock rather than in cash. **********The plan is likely to affect fewer than 1,000 bankers, traders and institutional sales representatives who make more than $200,000 a year in total compensation, said a Drexel spokesman, who added that the firm employs about 5,500 people. **********Earlier this week, Drexel told the Standard & Poor's Corporation that it would raise $150 million of equity capital by the end of the year and take other steps to shore up its balance sheet. **********The rating agency, nonetheless, decided to downgrade Drexel's commercial paper below that of other Wall Street firms, a move that slightly increases Drexel's short-term borrowing costs. **********The plan to raise capital was hammered out in meetings on Tuesday, and talk of it spread through the firm and elsewhere on Wall Street.

The numbers may change because some Drexel executives might take more of the securities than the plan requires. **********Under the plan, any Drexel employee who would make more than $200,000 this year in total compensation, which in most cases consists of salary and bonus, will be asked to take an as-yet-undetermined percentage of the amount above $200,000 in the form of a convertible preferred security issued by the firm. **********''Some people are grumbling,'' a Drexel executive said. ''But over all there's a pretty good understanding that it's the right thing to do. Intellectually, people understand it's a tough time in the industry.'' **********Awarding year-end bonuses is a tense ritual on Wall Street, because bonuses are entirely at the discretion of the firms.

He said there were ample precedents for the plan.

In a brief announcement, the Government said the chairman, Aleksandr N. Aksenov, was relieved of his duties ''in connection with his retirement.'' **********But his departure, after three years on the job, was instantly attributed by Soviet citizens to the controversy over a freewheeling television program. **********On the program, which focuses on current events, a guest suggested recently that it was time to take Lenin's remains from their case in a Red Square mausoleum and bury them in the ground, like those of other mortals. **********The notion was treated as sacrilege by ranking party officials, who denounced the proposal at a Central Committee meeting as a measure of the growing permissiveness on the Government-controlled television network. Point, Counterpoint **********As Mr. Aksenov's retirement was announced, the repercussions of another daring television program continued to reverberate. A Politburo member who was mentioned on television last week by a candidate for the new Soviet Parliament in connection with a corruption case defended his reputation today against the sensational charge. **********The Politburo member, Yegor K. Ligachev, was cited on Saturday on the Leningrad television by Nikolai Ivanov, a prosecutor who was elected a day later to the new Parliament. **********The removal pf Mr. Aksenov, 64 years old, was taken as evidence that the Government might be willing to rein in the new candor on popular television. It also guarantees that the live talk program on which Lenin's remains were discussed will be even more avidly watched as a barometer of how free expression is faring. **********The show, ''Vzglyad,'' or ''Glance,'' has become an unpredictable showcase for the more risky expressions on the edges of glasnost, the policy of openness decreed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. A Decent Burial?  ''No matter how much we hate a person, no matter how much we love him, we don't have the right to deprive a person of burial,'' declared Mark Zakharov, director of the Leninsky Komsomol Theater, on the April 21 program. He was complaining that the Lenin mausoleum tableau seemed more tacky than immortal. **********As the controversy continued last week, Vadim A. Medvedev, the Politburo power chosen by Mr. Gorbachev as chief of ideology, visited the broadcasting commission and spoke privately for more than two hours with the executives of ''Vzglyad.'' **********The sensitivity over Lenin's standing in this changing nation is indicated by the fact that, publicly, no officials would pursue the issue of ''Lenin's immortality'' beyond taking umbrage at the notion that he be buried. **********The Government said the television post was being taken over by Mikhail F. Nenashev, the head of the state publishing committee. The suddenness of the change was suggested by the fact that Mr. Nenashev was quoted in a long newspaper interview today discussing elaborate plans for continuing indefinitely at the publishing committee. A 'Rude' Suggestion **********No word was heard from the departing Mr. Aksenov. But at the Central Committee meeting, where officials surprised the gathering with furious complaints about the Lenin remarks, Mr. Aksenov sought to head off further trouble. He agreed that the suggestion of burying Lenin was ''rude'' and that on television, ''political mistakes are especially inadmissible.'' **********In the corruption case that was discussed on Leningrad television, Mr. Ligachev issued a denial and an attack on his accuser by having the Novosti press agency cite unnamed ''reliable sources'' as calling the charges ''slanderous'' and politically motivated. **********Mr. Ligachev, the party secretary in charge of agriculture, was named by Mr. Ivanov, an outspoken prosecutor who contended that the Government was trying to quash his inquiry and that the name of Mr. Ligachev ''appeared'' in the corruption case. **********Mr. Ivanov gave no details and carefully said he was not accusing the Politburo member of being a criminal. Mr. Ivanov was elected the next day, defeating 33 other candidates.

Churbanov, the son-in-law of Leonid I. Brezhnev, the late Soviet leader. **********''Yegor Ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations and called the attention of the commission to the fact that the slanderous statement was intended as political provocation,'' the Novosti statement declared, in clear sympathy with Mr. Ligachev. **********The Novosti report indicated that as things have been proceeding, Mr. Ligachev sees the virtue of endorsing glasnost.

But this official said Mr. Baker has not yet made a decision about the office. ''The decision meeting has not yet been held,'' the official said. **********Another State Department official said he expected the plan to be approved, though some details still needed to be worked out. **********Under the plan, Mr. Bartholomew's office would lead the effort to combat the spread of ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and nuclear weapons technology.

First, it will provide a high-level focus for efforts to combat the spread of weapons, which President Bush promised in his election campaign.

''They are wrong. They are hurting an Arab family that has lost its son.'' **********The son, Khalid Jaafar, 20 years old, was studying in West Germany and flying home to Dearborn on Dec. 21 when a bomb brought down Pan Am Flight 103, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.

But he said he had been told by the F.B.I. and by the State Department that his son was not a particular focus of the investigation. **********Administration officials who have been briefed on the worldwide inquiry said today in Washington that the youth might be on a list of passengers deemed most likely to have been an unwitting carrier of the bomb. But they appeared to retreat from earlier statements that tentatively identified him as having played that role. **********In an interview today, Mr. Jaafar said he believed that his son has been singled out as a subject of speculation because of his Arabic name, which was the only one on the list of victims. **********Osama Siblani, publisher of Sada Alwatan, an Arabic newspaper based in Dearborn, home to about 20,000 Arab-Americans, said he checked the list of victims' names after the bombing and called one family to inquire about its nationality.

The picture shows the youth holding a small bag and a wallet, he said, and was taken by a lifelong friend from Lebanon. **********Mr. Jaafar said he was sure that his son had been carrying only the small bag and the wallet, that he had them with him on board and that he had not checked any other luggage. Since investigators have established that the bomb blew up in the cargo hold, Mr. Jaafar said, his son could not have been involved. **********His account was slightly different from that given today by West German prosecutors, who said that the young man had checked two pieces of luggage but that they did not resemble the suitcase evidently used to carry the bomb. Belongings to Be Returned **********Mr. Jaafar also said investigators had told him that his son's hand baggage had been found intact and that his son's belongings would be returned. **********Khalid Jaafar was first mentioned in press reports within 10 days after the bombing. His father said the family was ''devastated'' last month when Cable News Network ''broadcast over and over a story saying my son had brought the bomb aboard.'' **********''I called the investigators in Lockerbie who told me it wasn't true,'' he said. ''I begged CNN to call them, but someone from CNN said they didn't have enough staff to verify it.

Just as advances in the microprocessor let computer makers pack more power in smaller machines, gains in transmission technology and microelectronics are fueling a similar miniaturization wave in satellite equipment. **********The more powerful satellites being launched today send stronger signals. The dishes that pick up their signals are more sensitive and can receive even weak radiowaves that have been disrupted. As a result, these earthstations are smaller, more flexible and cheaper, enabling them to be used in a variety of new applications. **********Among the fastest-growing of thse new dishes are terminals that enable computers in remote locations to communicate and mobile systems that help track trucks and airplanes. Sales of these earthstations are expected to grow by more than 300 percent by 1994. **********The developments couldn't have come at a better time for satellite makers. The market for high-capacity satellite systems used by television broadcasters and telephone companies, which will account for nearly half of the estimated $1.3 billion in dish sales this year, has matured. While the earthstation market is expected to climb to more than $5 billion in 1994, sales of television satellite dishesshould fall nearly 27 percent over that time and those used by telephone companies will remain flat, according to Frost & Sullivan Inc., a market research firm in New York. **********''Most major television networks switched to satellite distribution of programming in the mid-1980's and don't need to make as many big purchases,'' said Linda Lee Bower, a Frost & Sullivan researcher. ''Sales to the telephone companies have slowed because most have opted for fiber optics as the communications medium of choice.'' **********To stay abreast of the shifting market, satellite equipment makers are moving into the faster-growing fields. American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which sells satellite transmission services; Scientific-Atlanta Inc., one of the largest makers of earthstations, and the Hughes Aircraft Company, have recently acquired shares in companies that pioneered some of these new technologies. **********''In our second year we've seen sales increase three times over the first,'' said William E. Johnson, chief executive of Scientific-Atlanta, referring to the sales of Advanced Communications Engineering Inc., a maker of satellites used to connect computer networks that it purchased in 1987. ''We feel there is tremendous potential in this market.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Flamingo Hilton Reno, to Ogilvy & Mather, Los Angeles, and Pan Pacific Hotels and Resorts, to Ogilvy & Mather, Hawaii, with a combined budget of $6 million. *********** Municipality and Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, to FCB/Intermarketing, for North American marketing, with an undisclosed budget."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/05/world/bonn-finds-no-libya-tie-at-company.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1989-01-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1044, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonn Finds No Libya Tie at Company", "print_headline": "Bonn Finds No Libya Tie at Company", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said today that his Government had found no evidence yet to substantiate American assertions that a West German company had helped Libya build a chemical weapons plant, though it took the charges ''very seriously.'' **********Apparently responding to assertions that the Germans had done little since they were advised by the Americans of their suspicions about the Libyan plant, Mr. Genscher said at a foreign-policy press briefing that Bonn had ordered its national security council to begin an inquiry within three days of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's return from a meeting with President Reagan in Washington in November. **********It was at that meeting that the President reportedly advised Mr. Kohl of American concerns about a chemical plant Libya was building at Rabta, 40 miles south of Tripoli, and of accusations that a West German chemical company, Imhausen-Chemie, was playing a central role in the project. **********The Foreign Minister said the investigators reported to the full Cabinet on Dec. 20 and a decision was made to pursue the inquiry and to appoint a panel to draft legislation to strengthen export controls. That panel is to report back next Tuesday. **********The West Germans are investigating the validity of the American assertion that the German company helped build the chemical weapons plant for the Libyans. Beyond that, they will determine whether the company violated German export laws. But even if it did not, the Government is likely to take the occasion to consider whether its export laws are stringent enough. Company Denies U.S. Assertions **********But Mr. Genscher said the Government had found no evidence so far to support the American accusations against Imhausen-Chemie, nor of the assertion that the plant in Rabta was intended to manufacture chemical weapons. **********A spokesman for the Foreign Minister said that requests to the United States for additional materials had not produced corroboration of the American assertions against Imhausen. **********The board of managers of Imhausen-Chemie issued a statement today denying all the accusations against the company. ''Neither Imhausen-Chemie nor any other firm in our group is directly or indirectly in any way involved in the project of this factory in Libya,'' the statement said, adding that accusations of such connections were ''completely groundless.'' **********Finance authorities in Frieburg who had been ordered on Dec. 30 to check Imhausen's export ledgers reported today that they had found no wrongdoing. **********The absence of hard evidence in Bonn and the damaging accusations in Washington combined to produce conflicting reactions of anxiety and skepticism among West Germans. **********On one side was the fear that Germans stood accused of a deed that would quickly raise the specter of their Nazi past. Several commentaries in American newspapers did just that. **********''The thought is simply unbearable that, of all people, a German company should be responsible for supplying the unpredictable dictator and terrorists' friend Qaddafi with chemical arms,'' the daily Neue Osnabrucker Zeitung said in an editorial that seemed to capture a common anxiety. **********Government officials said that sensitivity to precisely such charges had caused the Government to open a high-level investigation so soon after Mr. Kohl's meeting with Mr. Reagan. **********At the same time, editorials and officials voiced doubts about the American assertions and irritation at what is seen among West Europeans as Washington's tendency to become sanctimonious and pushy when allies fail to jump to its latest campaign. **********The downing of two Libyan jets by American pilots over the Mediterranean today seemed to increase questions about Washington's motives. **********''Suspicions cannot be altogether dismissed that some military hot-spurs under Reagan would like to crown the Administration's farewell with a 'fireworks display,' '' the conservative Hannoverische Neue Presse said, even before the Libyan jets were downed. **********The anchorman on the main evening television program, Peter Voss, said in his commentary on Tuesday night: ''Why the deliberate naming of one German company by The New York Times? Was the purpose to prepare the way psychologically for another strike against Qaddafi?'' Reagan's Hair-Trigger Image **********There was no immediate reaction to the shooting down of the Libyan fighters, but the action was not likely to receive much sympathy in West Germany. The last American strike against Libya in April 1986, after the Americans asserted that Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, was involved in a terrorist attack on a nightclub in West Berlin frequented by American servicemen, was widely criticized in Western Europe. **********Officials in Bonn said the uncertainty here and in some other West European capitals about the solidity of Washington's assertions apparently stemmed not so much from the specific charges about Colonel Qaddafi's factory as from a sense that the Reagan Administration has been too quick at times to draw conclusions from incomplete information or to go on the offensive against perceived wrongdoing. **********But the officials also said the skepticism did not interfere in the West Germans' response to the assertions. Stronger Export Controls **********''Whatever doubts we had did not prevent us from taking this information very, very seriously,'' an official said. ''We knew that if the allegations were genuine this was truly terrible. Nobody in the Government would take the risk of downplaying the gravity of the charge that a German company was helping a tyrant make poison gas.'' **********Despite the lack of corroboration for the American assertions, Government officials and press commentators agreed that West German export controls required urgent strengthening. **********''Regardless of whether or not these allegations are true, one thing is certain: there is obviously a lack of efficient federal controls on the export of sensitive goods,'' the daily Stuttgarter Zeitung said. **********''Furthermore, there is a lack of understanding for the fact that, in case of doubt, authoritarian regimes should not be supplied with materials that could be misused for violent purposes, for the general public will ultimately just pay too high a price for that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/15/world/janos-kadar-hungary-s-ex-leader-buried.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-07-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Janos Kadar, Hungary's Ex-Leader, Buried", "print_headline": "Janos Kadar, Hungary's Ex-Leader, Buried", "body_text": " **********Janos Kadar was buried today, and those who deposed him from leadership of the Communist Party last year and cast him into virtual disgrace delivered eulogies. **********About 10,000 mourners were on hand at a service in the pantheon of the workers' movement at a city cemetery. **********''We should learn from him modesty, self-respect, hope, obedience, loyalty to principles, ability to compromise, trust among one another, patience, patriotism and internationalism,'' the man who ousted Mr. Kadar, Karoly Grosz, said in a eulogy.

He added, ''No matter how much the Americans expand their military, they have come to the point that they could do nothing if Japan were one day to say, 'We will no longer sell you chips.' '' **********If Japan decided to sell its chips to the Soviet Union instead, he speculated in the book, ''that would instantly change the balance of military power.'' Bubbling to the Surface **********Until recently, such nationalistic themes have usually been voiced only on the far left and right of Japanese politics. But now, in the midst of Japan's biggest political upheaval in 35 years, a growing impatience with the United States is bubbling to the surface of mainstream political discussion here with increasing frequency. **********Often, it seems rooted in a deepening belief that America is an ebbing power that has been slow to recognize its dependency on Japanese technology and financial resources. **********''These are the opinions of a minority, but a very substantial minority that is influential,'' said Masashi Nishihara, a professor of international relations at the National Defense Academy. Political hopefuls, he said, sense that ''in the past year Japan has become more annoyed by American demands and more nationalistic.'' **********In fact, the right often sounds these days much like the left. The Japan Socialist Party, which doubled its strength in the upper house of Parliament in the recent elections, has appealed to farmers who believe they are paying the price for concessions to the United States on beef and citrus. Candidates on both left and right complained that Japan is far too beholden to the United States for military protection, though they differ on what can be done. **********And even in the center, where the relationship with the United States is still highly valued, there are occasional signs of unease. Constant disputes over trade and, most recently, Congressional charges that Japan was trying to ''steal'' American technology in building its new fighter jet, the FSX, left a bitter taste here. Not surprisingly, arguments that Japan no longer needs the United States now strike a more responsive chord. **********What makes ''The Japan That Can Say No'' unusual is that its authors could scarcely hold more establishment credentials. Mr. Ishihara, a former novelist known for his blunt views, has served in Parliament for 21 years and held two Cabinet posts. **********The other author, more conciliatory in tone, is perhaps Japan's best-known entrepreneur: Akio Morita, the chairman of the Sony Corporation and perhaps Japan's best-known entrepreneur. And while they differ on specifics, both men take the position reflected in the title: that Japan should stand up to American demands head-on rather than suck in its breath and mutter ''very difficult.'' **********To some critics here, books like ''The Japan that Can Say No'' amount to America-bashing, the mirror image of the treatment Japanese complain they receive from Capitol Hill, Detroit and Silicon Valley. They point in particular to Mr. Ishihara's arguments that resentment of Japan abroad is based chiefly on American racial prejudice. **********In a chapter devoted to the issue, Mr. Ishihara argues that while the United States ''bombed Germany indiscriminately, but it did not drop the A-bomb.'' He adds: ''When I ask them, 'You dropped it here because this is Japan, didn't you?' they say no. But they did drop it on Japan.'' **********Mr. Ishihara argues that Americans are proud that ''whites, including Americans, have built the modern era.'' But he says that ''pride is too strong'' and ignores high culture in Japan and elsewhere in Asia since the 16th century. **********''In short, I wonder if the historical pride has gone to the length of inerasable arrogance. Right now, the modern civilization built by whites is coming close to a period of practical end, and I feel that is adding to the irritation of Americans as the postwar representative of whites.'' **********If such views seem rarely voiced in the polite Japanese-American dialogue, perhaps it is because books like this one have been published only in Japanese. Unlike ''Made in Japan,'' Mr. Morita's best-selling autobiography about the founding of Sony, ''The Japan that Can Say No'' is ''primarily addressed to a Japanese audience,'' a close aide to Mr. Morita said. **********Critics say that is no surprise. ''People in Japan are very careful about what they cast into English,'' said John Stern, who heads the Japan office of the American electronics industry and calls the book ''a manifesto for the new Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere,'' a reference for Japan's justification for its expansionism in Asia in the 1930's. **********Other critics say that while alarmist language is becoming more common in Japanese political tracts, most Japanese are still deeply grateful to the United States for rebuilding the country after World War II. And younger people seem as fascinated by America as ever - for its resources, its military strength, its diversity and particularly for its culture. **********But often that fascination seems more focused on jazz, old cars, and James Dean - in short, a nostalgia for the America of the immediate postwar years. That America, in Japanese eyes, was confident and self-sufficient. America and Paranoia **********In contrast, some of the extremist political literature circulating now suggests that America has become paranoid about Japan. **********Another book published only in Japanese is titled ''Japan as the Enemy, A New Scenario for U.S. Strategy,'' by Kazuhisa Ogawa, a military strategist. The book argues that American anger at Japan has been increasing on a ''subliminal level'' and that Japan is now considered ''the third enemy,'' after the Soviet Union and China. ''The only people who do not know about this is the Japanese,'' Mr. Ogawa contends. **********Mr. Ishihara and Mr. Morita's book, which has sold about 50,000 copies, makes no such claim. But a recurring theme in their dialogue - they wrote different chapters - is that Japan is being blamed for an America that has become fat and complacent. **********''Americans do not manufacture any more,'' Mr. Morita argues in the book. ''It is not that America does not have the technology,'' says the Sony chairman, who is quick to point out that his own company has benefited greatly from American inventiveness. On Mass Production **********The problem, he says, is that America ''cannot figure out how to mass produce goods by applying new technology, or how to market them.'' The problem, he says, lies with men like Lee Iaccoca, the chief executive of the Chrysler Corporation and a harsh critic of Japan. **********''I met the head of Chrysler Japan and I asked him how are the sales of Chrysler cars going? But he clearly said he is not in Japan to sell cars, but to buy parts, and engines and finished cars.'' At home, Mr. Morita says, workers are used ''just as tools'' by profit-hungry management that pays itself too much and lays off its employees at the first hint of trouble. **********Mr. Morita is quick to blame Japan as well, however. He says Japanese fail to communicate in terms that Americans can understand, advance into American society ''as if aliens have arrived'' without sufficient effort to become part of local communities, and contribute too little to the world. **********''I think Japanese should reflect upon themselves about whether they are doing what they are supposed to do as the second largest economy in the world.'' Later he adds: ''It hurts to open the so-far closed market, or offer Japanese money to developing countries. But the world would not improve unless we share pain.'' **********Mr. Ishihara gives no ground. He says the West perpetuates a myth that the Japanese are unimaginative mimics of other nation's inventions. But he argues that the United States could not build its new Stealth bomber without Japanese technology - in other words, Japan makes possible the nuclear umbrella that protects it. **********Meanwhile, part of inventiveness, he writes, is learning how to make high-quality goods. Japan cannot buy American electronic parts, he argues, ''because the ratio of failing products is outrageously high.'' **********''If we complain,'' he writes, ''they respond that 'only Japan complains, no other countries do.' It is so sad. I almost start to think America will never recover.'' **********What the two men prescribe is a reordering of the world that would give Japan more influence. Mr. Morita says America should ''abandon its superpower consciousness and rebuild its economy quickly.'' Mr. Ishihara wants a summit conference between the United States and Japan. **********In such a conference, he writes, ''Japan will have more of a chance to say 'no' to the U.S.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/15/business/company-news-2-groups-raise-stakes-in-vons.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 235, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Groups Raise Stakes in Vons", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; 2 Groups Raise Stakes in Vons", "body_text": " **********Two separate groups, one led by Robert M.

The 15 are Angola, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and Vietnam. **********In the Sudan, for example, the report predicts ''serious food supply difficulties.'' in the drought- and war-ravaged southern region unless emergency assistance ''is made available immediately.'' **********Important factors in declining grain production in the northern countries are the severe drought in North America last year as well as policy measures in the United States and Europe meant to curb surplus production. But in addition, many agricultural experts, citing the shortage of spare arable land in many parts of Asia and Africa, warn that some poor countries may be reaching limits of production. **********The decline in production has meant a sharp fall in grain stocks, to about 16 percent of annual consumption, their lowest level since the early 1970's, and a rise of 40 to 50 percent in prices, Mr. Saouma said. **********A fall in global grain stocks below 17 percent of annual consumption leaves the world vulnerable to a food crisis if harvests fail again and invariably trigger a sharp rise in grain prices, the agriculture organization says. Higher world grain prices will mean better returns for the world's major grain-exporting countries, which include the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Australia. **********Mr. Saouma stressed that while the richer industrialized countries can weather the current price rise, poor countries will need to raise spending on imported food from $12.3 billion in 1988 to $17.6 billion this year just to maintain the same, often indequate level of nutrition. **********''The increase in import costs will further worsen the balance of payments position of many of the low-income, food-deficit countries, which are already suffering from mounting external debt and adverse terms of trade,'' Mr. Saouma said. Less Famine Aid **********Moreover, the increase in the food costs for poor countries comes at a time when the quantity of free food that industrialized countries will provide for famine relief is expected to fall by about a quarter. This is because the donors generally budget cash sums for food assistance, and these buy less when grain prices rise. **********The amount of free food Western industrialized countries will donate for famine relief in poor countries this year is likely to fall from the roughly 13.2 million tons they gave in 1988 to about 9.7 million tons, officials of the organization say. **********As a result, officials say, some poor countries may be unable to maintain even last year's nutritional levels. **********''Over 500 million people are undernourished today and this is going to get worse,'' said James Ingram, head of the World Food Program, an agency affiliated with the agriculture organization that distributes food aid. **********In a new effort to help the world's growing numbers of poor and hungry, agriculture ministers from 36 developed and developing countries, including the United States, will meet in Cairo on May 22 to consider a new action plan prepared by the World Food Council, a body set up within the organization in 1974 to review world agricultural policies. **********The meeting will bring together ministers from countries representing 68 percent of the world's population and 75 percent of its wealth. **********''We've spent enough time analyzing hunger,'' said Gerald Trant, the World Food Council's director. ''The time has come to act.'' **********In its latest survey of world grain markets prepared for this week's meeting, the agriculture organization forecasts that total production of wheat and coarse grains like sorghum and corn will rise to 1.4 billion tons this year after dropping from 1.33 billion tons in 1987 to 1.25 billion tons last year. **********But since the global rice harvest is unlikely to be much higher than last year's record, the organization believes that total world grain production will increase by about 150 million tons this year, or less than the 200 million tons it says is needed to rebuild stocks and bring output back into line with consumption trends."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/19/world/jalalabad-besiegers-bide-their-time.html": {"writer_name": "Donatella Lorch", "pub_date": "1989-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1028, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jalalabad Besiegers Bide Their Time", "print_headline": "Jalalabad Besiegers Bide Their Time", "body_text": " **********The Afghan guerrillas move around their captured Government outpost in short spurts, dashing across exposed spaces, then crouching in the protection of bullet-pocked adobe walls.

They remain in control of all the territory that they captured in March, despite Government claims to have recaptured a 25-mile stretch east of the city on the highway to Pakistan. **********But in light of past casualties, rebel commanders in the area are wary of a frontal assault; instead they are digging in, holding ground and slowly nibbling at Government defenses. **********''We are patient fighters,'' said Haji Din Mohammad, a leading commander of the Yunis Khalis faction of the fundamentalist Islamic Party.

Lack of Rebel Coordination **********It is widely believed that the rebels face a difficult task. Western diplomats in Islamabad say one of the rebels' chief problems is that their campaign has never been coordinated from all four sides of Jalalabad. Most of the fighting in the past three weeks has been concentrated in the south and southwest. **********The Government's 81st Brigade -considered the strongest in the Afghan Army - is posted on the section of road linking Jalalabad with Mehtarlam, the capital of Laghman Province about 30 miles by road to the northwest of Jalalabad. Mehtarlam has served as the terminus for aerial resupply of Jalalabad since constant rebel rocketing made the Jalalabad airport unusable. **********Despite this supply route, another route, the road linking Jalalabad with Kabul, is still considered crucial to the success of the rebel siege. Until last week, sections had been completely blocked and convoys had been unable to come by road from Kabul to supplement the inadequate volume of supplies provided by the helicopter ferry operation to Mehtarlam. But last week the Government broke through and at least one convoy has been able to make its way from Kabul, rebels said. Rebels' 'Chaos' in Blocking Road **********The task of blocking the road is rotated among the seven parties based in Pakistan. The party now in control is the conservative Islamic Society, but officials of the group said they were scheduled to be relieved by the moderate National Islamic Front of Afghanistan two weeks ago. The relief column has not arrived, and an Islamic Society official who called himself Commander Anwar said his group's food and ammunition was running low. **********''It is the responsibility of the ministry of defense of the interim government to coordinate a calendar for the blocking of the road,'' Commander Anwar said. ''Neither the ministry nor the alliance has taken any initiative, so there is chaos.'' **********Haji Din Mohammad estimated that there are about 15,000 Government troops in and around Jalalabad, and about 5,000 guerrillas. He added, however, that fighters could be brought in quickly from Pakistan, which is only two hours away. **********As the guerrillas silently lined up to pray in the walled-in compound of a deserted village, the mullah's call to prayer was lost in the noise of tank artillery and automatic weapons fire. Later that evening, while the guerrillas shared a meal of mutton and rice, a flash of light was immediately followed by the earth-shaking, deafening blast of a Scud missile fired from Kabul, landing less than half a mile away. Guerrillas Use Captured Tanks **********Haji Din Mohammad's party has captured 16 tanks, a dozen armored personnel carriers and several BM-41 rocket launchers mounted on trucks. They have tank drivers, mostly defectors from the army, but little ammunition for the tanks' guns. **********All the major commanders of the Khalis faction, including their leader, had gathered near Jalalabad to plan strategy, and the rebels said they are preparing to launch an attack north of Jalalabad soon. But there was little sign of mass activity in any of the areas visited. The stifling summer heat has already descended on Nangarhar Province. In Samarkhel, the first major garrison to fall near the city, the buildings have been looted and are now deserted. There remains only the incessant buzzing of black flies and a strong odor of rotting flesh from the carcasses of animals and unburied bodies of Government soldiers. **********Haji Din Mohammad does not doubt that the city will fall. ''Any time God wants, we will capture the city. The regime has had to bring in soldiers from as far away as Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat. This cannot last.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/07/business/limits-audits-counting-alone-cannot-detect-fraud-if-management-juggling-numbers.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1989-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 959, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Limits of Audits; Counting Alone Cannot Detect Fraud If Management Is Juggling Numbers", "print_headline": "The Limits of Audits; Counting Alone Cannot Detect Fraud If Management Is Juggling Numbers", "body_text": " **********The allegations of fraud filed yesterday against Crazy Eddie Antar show just how easy it can be to inflate profits, fooling investors and Wall Street analysts. What appears to have been an effort to make already-impressive results for 1985 a little prettier seems to have descended by 1987 into a complicated scheme to hide huge losses. **********As put forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission, whose allegations form the basis of the following account, the fraud was amazingly simple for the first two years, focusing on overstating inventory figures and thus increasing reported profits. **********But in the third year, the simplicity vanished. As recounted by the S.E.C., evidently based on reports from people involved, orders went out from corporate headquarters to falsify numerous accounts. Even before one order was carried out, the people coordinating the fraud seem to have realized that more was needed and ordered even greater changes. **********The S.E.C. has not been able to put a figure on what it says was the 'inflation'' in profits in that third year. The agency says only that the reported pretax profit of $20.6 million really concealed a ''substantial loss.'' 'Guaranteed Lowest Prices' **********Crazy Eddie was a merchandising phenomenon, exemplified by a pitchman who screamed that the ''prices are insane'' and promised ''the guaranteed lowest prices.'' **********While its public image was of a low-price retailer, its Wall Street image was the opposite. A key item that analysts look at is the gross margin, what a company charges for an item compared with what it pays for the item. Reported markups at Crazy Eddie were about 27 percent in the early 1980's, before the fraud is said to have begun. But the figure rose to 32 percent in 1985 and 35 percent in 1986, largely, it appears, because of the fraud. **********Those margins do not tell the entire story; other costs like advertising, salaries and rent must be deducted before getting a net profit figure. But margins are closely watched, and the the rise in Crazy Eddie's gross margins helped to inspire analysts who believed that while some customers were getting good deals, many others ended up paying close to list price because they were not good at negotiating prices. **********By the S.E.C. account, the fraud began less than six months after Crazy Eddie went public in September 1984, as the company prepared to close its books on its fiscal year ending March 3, 1985. Eddie Antar, the company's chairman and chief executive, ordered an employee to overstate inventory by $2 million. By so doing, Crazy Eddie inflated pretax profits by that amount by reporting that goods that in fact had been sold were still in the warehouse. That raised its reported gross margin from 29 percent to 32 percent. The overstatement amounted to about 8 percent of inventories. **********As the following fiscal year ended, in early 1986, the tampering with the books resumed, the S.E.C. contends. Had the company done nothing, it would have under-reported pretax profits by $2 million - the amount it would, in effect, have borrowed for the prior year. Instead, the company raised inventories by approximately $9 million, or 18 percent, the S.E.C. says. In addition, on orders from Eddie Antar the company concealed that it owed $3 million to suppliers, the S.E.C. contends. **********Those overstatements add up to $12 million, or $10 million after adjusting for the 1985 charge. The S.E.C., however, contended that pretax profits were overstated by just $6.7 million. S.E.C. officials declined to explain the discrepancy. **********By 1987, the consumer electronics business in New York was plagued by intense competition. Crazy Eddie nonetheless reported profits of $20.6 million before taxes. The S.E.C. said that figure was ''tens of millions'' too high, and the correct figure should have been a ''substantial loss,'' but it did not provide a figure. The agency said numerous documents were destroyed to keep them from investigators and from the new management that won a proxy fight for control of the company in late 1987. Accusations of Tampering **********The S.E.C. said some employees, acting at the direction of Sam E. Antar, Eddie's cousin and the company's chief financial officer, wrote phony documents and concealed others. The total effect was to understate by $28.5 million, or 36 percent, the amount of money the company owed to suppliers. Inventories were also overstated by millions more, the S.E.C. charged, with some of the doctoring done by employees in a motel room. **********It is not easy for auditors to detect fraud by management, and some of the actions described by the S.E.C. would seem to have been inspired by a desire to fool the auditors from Peat Marwick Main & Co. No auditors were named as defendants in the complaint filed yesterday, although Peat Marwick has been sued by shareholders and by Crazy Eddie's current management. **********Auditors are not supposed to count every box, or review every bill, and it is not hard to see how an 8 percent inventory overstatement might slip by in 1985. But the misstatements were much larger in 1986, and larger still in 1987, if the S.E.C. accusations are true. It is not as easy to understand why Peat auditors failed to uncover any evidence of fraud in those years. Peat officials declined yesterday to comment on any aspect of the case."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/03/world/us-aides-critical-of-soviets-on-iran.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1989-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. AIDES CRITICAL OF SOVIETS ON IRAN", "print_headline": "U.S. AIDES CRITICAL OF SOVIETS ON IRAN", "body_text": " **********State Department officials asserted today that the Soviet Union appeared to be trying to exploit the Salman Rushdie affair to improve ties with Iran and delay any Iranian reconciliation with the West. **********The officials said that not only had the Soviets refrained from criticizing Iran for calling for the killing of Mr. Rushdie, author of the novel ''The Satanic Verses,'' but they also had offered to mediate between Teheran and the West, as though they were a neutral party to the issue. **********When the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, met with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Teheran last Sunday, he did not discuss with Iranian leader his call for Mr. Rushdie's murder, according to the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov. **********Mr. Shevardnadze did raise the case with Iran's President and Foreign Minister. But considering the fact that it is Ayatollah Khomeini who has personally been directing the campaign against Mr. Rushdie, it is not clear what influence these lower-ranking contacts will have on Iran's behavior. Asked by Britain and U.S.  Both Washington and Britain had asked Mr. Shevardnadze to take the matter up with the Iranians. In a 90-minute meeting with reporters today in Washington, the Soviet Ambassador, Yuri V. Dubinin, appeared to go out of his way to show understanding for the Iranian opposition to the Rushdie book, which many Muslims consider to be a blasphemy against Islam. **********The State Department officials said that what was noteworthy about Soviet handling of the Rushdie affair is how it would seem to contradict Moscow's so-called ''new foreign policy thinking'' and professed interest ''in cooperating with the West to resolve regional tensions.'' The officials said that by adopting a neutral stand, the the Soviets were in effect encouraging Teheran to continue taking a hard line. **********''Despite all the talk about 'new thinking,' what we are seeing with the Soviet behavior in the Rushdie affair is some good old-fashioned Soviet expediency,'' said a senior State Department expert in European affairs. **********''The Soviets just couldn't resist the temptation to use this to cozy up to Iran and maybe delay its inevitable rapprochement with the West,'' a State Department Middle East expert said. ''They are doing what comes naturally.'' Reaction of Redman **********When asked for his reaction to the Soviet offer to mediate between Iran and the West, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said Wednesday, ''We did ask Mr. Shevardnadze, prior to his trip to Teheran, to raise concerns with the Iranians.'' **********He added: ''From our perspective, the solution to the Rushdie case is very simple. Iranian death threats are unacceptable. We've encouraged other countries around the world to speak up on this. The United States has spoken up. And we believe its high time the Soviets spoke up.'' **********''There is nothing here that involves mediation,'' he said. **********In his meeting with reporters, though, Ambassador Dubinin showed no interest in taking up Mr. Redman's challenge. When asked why Moscow has not condemned Iran's death threat, Mr. Dubinin said that the Rushdie affair ''is something that reflects once more the importance of respect for all general human rights.'' **********He added: ''For example, religious feelings, is it a general human right? Yes. Or freedom of expression. Is it a general human right? Of course. But the skill, the science, the art, is to be balanced. Our position was formulated on the basis of this general approach.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/21/business/market-place-lowrisk-tactics-for-individuals.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Demaria", "pub_date": "1989-04-21", "snippet": "LEAD: THE stock market's recent rally, analysts say, has been propelled by institutional investing and program trading, set off by the belief that interest rates may have peaked.

The nation's small investors, by all accounts, are still wary of stocks, and are opting for safety, either in the money markets or in certificates of deposit. **********THE stock market's recent rally, analysts say, has been propelled by institutional investing and program trading, set off by the belief that interest rates may have peaked. The nation's small investors, by all accounts, are still wary of stocks, and are opting for safety, either in the money markets or in certificates of deposit. **********Fear is not the only explanation for the small investor's strike against Wall Street. The tremendous explosion in consumer debt - especially in credit cards and home equity loans - in the last few years has limited the ability of small investors to participate in the securities market, by cutting into spendable income. Sharply rising monthly interest payments on adjustable-rate mortgages may also be cramping the investment style of many homeowners. **********And the investing malaise is not limited to equities. Bond brokers, both municipal and corporate, report that retail-oriented business has slumped. **********The flight of the small investor can be gleaned from figures provided in the American Stock Exchange's 1988 annual report. The Amex is a generally recognized proxy for small-investor sentiment. In 1988, 2.52 billion shares changed hands on the exchange, down 28.2 percent from the 3.51 billion shares of 1987. Bond business was off about 12 percent. Trading in stock options fell 36.5 percent. **********Not all small investors have shied away from the markets, of course. Charles Schwab & Company, the nation's largest discount brokerage, has reported a rebound in earnings that it attributes, in part, to the addition of 65,000 new accounts. And Fidelity Investments, the Boston mutual fund behemoth, is building its own discount brokerage unit. **********But most of the action on Wall Street today is takeover-related, augmented by an occasional broad market fling sparked by the latest economic figure coming out of Washington, or in yesterday's case, out of Bonn. Stocks fell broadly yesterday after the West German central bank raised key interest rates. **********Takeover activity may be good for headline writers, but it tends to discourage small investors further because it reinforces the feeling that the stock market is risky. **********People are wary about the economy, which may be at a crossroads. Recent data seem to indicate that the growth is slowing, and the stock market can interpret that in a number of ways. **********If moderate, a slowdown can keep a lid on interest rates and inflation. That is normally good for stocks. But if the economy slips into a recession, that would hurt stock prices. **********Does this mean that investors should avoid stocks entirely? Each individual's situation is different, but most market experts point out that over the long haul stocks outperform other investments and outpace inflation. **********Given the current uncertainty, many experts are recommending conservative stock plays - strategies designed to conserve capital and provide income. Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, the Minneapolis brokerage, is recommending what it calls ''happiness stocks,'' equities that offer good dividends and the chance for appreciation. **********Among the criteria for the stocks chosen are a yield of more than 5 percent, a stock exchange listing, a Standard & Poor's rating of at least B+ and an internal cash flow triple the current dividend. **********The stocks meeting these criteria are Baltimore Gas and Electric, British Petroleum, Burlington Northern, Ford Motor, General Motors, GTE, Northern States Power, Transamerica and Southern Indiana Gas and Electric. **********Investors seeking the happiness of high dividends and safety might opt for utility stocks alone. **********Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. of Cleveland has compiled a list of 30 stocks, spread equally among the electric, natural gas and telephone sectors. Using a computer to augment its analysts, Prescott has assigned a numerical value for various criteria - price-to-book ratio, effective tax rate, plant age, coverage of bond interest - and then ranked the utilities according to their scores. **********Its top electric utility choice is Wisconsin Public Service. Its top gas choice is Wicor. And its recommended telephone issue is Pacific Telesis, the regional phone concern that announced yesterday an agreement that would make it the first Bell operating company to enter the cable television industry. Investors should be aware, however, that a portfolio of high-yield securities like utilities can lose value quickly if interest rates soar. **********Investors who already have a portfolio might consider writing call options on their stocks. The option income can provide downside protection if the market declines. **********But if the market or the stock or both rise, the stock can be called away. The bemused former owner must then be content with the premium earned, as sort of a consolation prize.

The letter, which assails Mr. Ceausescu's rule as increasingly repressive, is the first protest against the leadership from within the senior ranks of the Communist Party since Mr. Ceausescu came to power. **********Mr. Raceanu was arrested on Jan. 31, but that fact was not disclosed until Agerpress, the Government press agency, announced it six weeks later. **********Agerpress said investigations had shown that his espionage activity had started in 1974. That was the year Mr. Raceanu completed a five-year tour of duty as first secretary in the Rumanian Embassy in Washington and was appointed head of the United States desk in the Foreign Ministry. **********A recent high-level defector from Rumania said Mr. Raceanu, who received part of his education in Moscow, had also been accused of links with the Soviet Union. This source said the authorities in Rumania might put Mr. Raceanu on trial either as an American spy or as a Soviet spy. **********The announcement of the Raceanu arrest in March coincided with the disclosure that six veteran Rumanian Communists, including the diplomat's stepfather, Grigore Raceanu, had sent a signed letter to President Ceausescu protesting his regime as repressive. **********Rumanians and Americans, including the defector, say Mircea Raceanu was implicated in the veteran Communists' protest and may have been carrying an early version of their letter to the American Embassy when he was arrested in downtown Bucharest. **********The letter was written by Silviu Brucan, who served as a senior editor of Scinteia, the party newspaper, and as Rumania's Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations. **********The others signing the letter were Gheorghe Apostol, First Secretary of the party in the mid-1950's; Alexandru Birladeanu, a former Deputy Prime Minister and Politburo member who was the main architect of Rumania's independent foreign policy; Constantin Pirvulescu, a founding member and first postwar General Secretary of the party; Corneliu Manescu, a former Foreign Minister and former president of the U.N. General Assembly, and the elder Mr. Raceanu, a worker from Transylvania who joined the party in the 1930's and later became a dissident. **********After their letter became public, all six veteran Communists were taken from their homes and compelled to live in primitive dwellings, under heavy police surveillance, on the outskirts of Bucharest, the sources said. After his election as General Secretary of the party 24 years ago, Mr. Ceausescu moved gradually to eliminate these men, some of whom were of his generation, from positions of influence. But they continue to be respected inside and outside the party in Rumania. **********Mircea Raceanu, being the son of Ileana Papp, an underground Communist in the 1930's, and Andrei Bernat, also an early party member, who was shot by Rumanian Fascists during World War II - and as the stepson of Grigore Raceanu - was counted as belonging to this faction. In March, just as the Ceausescu regime launched a brief press campaign calling for ''the harshest penalty'' against Mr. Raceanu, the United States Government, which in the last two decades came to view him as a professional and effective diplomat, made an official inquiry at the Foreign Ministry. The ministry replied only that a judicial procedure was under way. **********Rabbi Arthur Schneier, head of the New York-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation, was summoned to Bucharest by President Ceausescu, whom he had come to know through previous visits. Rabbi Schneier took the occasion to ask about Mr. Raceanu, who is of Jewish origin. President Ceausescu replied that Mr. Raceanu ''betrayed me personally'' but that he would probably not have to pay with his life."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/03/business/strong-stock-market-digests-large-sale-of-texaco-shares.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1989-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 944, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strong Stock Market Digests Large Sale of Texaco Shares", "print_headline": "Strong Stock Market Digests Large Sale of Texaco Shares", "body_text": " **********The aftereffects of Carl C. Icahn's sale of the huge stake he held in Texaco Inc. rippled through the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. **********Texaco led the most-active list, trading more than 25 million shares, as the three brokerage houses that bought the stock from Mr. Icahn on Thursday continued to dispose of it. The stock gained 75 cents, closing at $49.75. **********The stock of USX was the second most active, with more than 3.6 million shares changing hands. USX fell $1, to $36.50, after rising late Thursday because traders thought Mr. Icahn might make a bid for the steel and oil company with the proceeds of his Texaco sale. Mr. Icahn already holds 29.3 milllion shares of USX, an 11.4 percent stake. **********George J. Gaspar, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee, said yesterday that the stock activity reflected a growing realization by investors that Mr. Icahn's sale of his Texaco holdings might not have any immediate impact on the USX Corporation. **********''What you see is realism setting in,'' Mr. Gaspar said. ''Investors are realizing that Carl Icahn might not step up to the plate and bat tomorrow. His intention is probably to increase his investment in USX over time.

''The sophisticated money is saying that he doesn't have to do anything right away,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified. **********Charles A. Corry, who succeeded David M. Roderick as chairman of USX on Wednesday, declined to comment at a news conference yesterday on the possible impact of Mr. Icahn's sale, The Associated Press reported. **********On Thursday, Mr. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines, sold his 42 million shares in Texaco for slightly more than $2 billion. **********Despite its record size, the Texaco transaction was handled in very little time, according to market participants. On Wednesday, Mr. Icahn approached executives at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which has provided him with investment banking services in the past. Goldman and Salomon Called Shearson officials realized they needed help to distribute the block and called Goldman, Sachs & Company and Salomon Brothers, which have strong ties to portfolio managers at insurance companies, mutual funds and bank trust departments. **********By yesterday's close, almost all the shares had been sold, according to Stanley D. Shopkorn, vice chairman of Salomon. Brokers first began calling institutional investors Thursday afternoon to say a large block of the oil company's shares was available. They were told that the brokerage firms had committed their own capital to the transaction and were trying to move the securities quickly. **********Portfolio managers at banks, insurance companies and mutual funds quickly agreed to buy these suddenly cheap shares. The stock, which yields almost 6 percent, traded as high as $55 a week earlier and closed Wednesday at $51.125. **********''I was surprised that they placed it all that quickly,'' said Robert H. Morrison, manager of security trading at Fidelity Investments in Boston, which bought some of the shares for its mutual funds. **********The three brokers divided the commissions into three equal parts, money managers said. If one customer agreed to pay Goldman a commission of 5 cents a share on a block of 200,000 shares and another investor agreed to pay Salomon 6 cents a share on a block of 100,000 shares, the commissions were divided equally among the three firms. **********None of the participants, however, would disclose the size of the commission Mr. Icahn paid the three dealers. ''I believe in this business the commission should be commensurate with the risk, and three firms put up $2 billion,'' Mr. Shopkorn said. **********In agreeing to sell at $49, Mr. Icahn had to accept a price that was $2.125 below Wednesday's close for selling so many shares at once. Even so, Mr. Icahn made an estimated profit of nearly $700 million, including dividends, on his Texaco investment. **********Mr. Icahn did not return a reporter's call seeking additional details. **********A spokeswoman for Texaco said the company had no comment on Mr. Icahn's sale. Fuel for Rally Suggested **********The willingness of money managers to snap up Texaco stock worth $2 billion in less than 24 hours suggested to some Wall Street traders that investors have large amounts of cash that could likely add more fuel to this spring's rally. And some professional investors were surprised at the market's ability to rise while a block of 42 million shares was being sold. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 27.20 points. **********''You were dealing with a very powerful market,'' said Robert J. Chamine, head of trading at Wertheim Schroder & Company. ''It's not euphoric, just solid.'' **********''I think it's impressive,'' said Martin E. Zweig, president of Avatar Associates, which invests assets for pension funds and individuals. **********What has impressed Mr. Zweig and other investors is the lack of follow-through selling on days after the market declines.

Ranieri was trying to explain exactly what he had received for his $200 million investment. Mid-conversation, he turned to the driver and asked whether he was riding in a Yellow Cab. Told yes, Mr. Ranieri let out a howl of laughter. ''Well,'' he said, ''we own this, for example.'' **********The 38 percent stake in the local Yellow Cab company was just one of many surprises awaiting Mr. Ranieri and his investor group after they took control of United Savings Association of Texas, an insolvent $5 billion institution, in the waning hours of the last business day of 1988. Mr. Ranieri, a former vice chairman of Salomon Brothers, is widely known on Wall Street for having helped create the $700 billion market for mortgage-backed securities. Vital Part of Savings Rescue **********Now Mr. Ranieri is one of dozens of new owners of failed savings associations acquired from the Government -usually after agreements by the investors to provide fresh capital. The Bush Administration's plan to rescue the savings industry hinges in good part on the ability of investors with sufficient financial and managerial wherewithal to restore the failed institutions to health. **********Although many in Congress have criticized the deals already done as too lucrative for the new owners and have threatened to undo them, Mr. Ranieri's experience suggests that making money from sick savings institutions will be far more difficult than many perceive. Unlike some of the other deals, Mr. Ranieri's was not predicated on the use of tax losses at the acquired company to shelter income from other investments. For his group to profit on its investment, it will have to make United a competitive, vibrant operation, and the Texas economy will have to rebound. **********Already, Mr. Ranieri has dramatically reshaped the institution by taking control of its trading operations, selling off some of its riskier investments, installing new people at the heads of certain businesses, and preparing to get back into the loan-making business. **********Mr. Ranieri's investment group spent close to $2 million evaluating and making bids on four other institutions before snaring United. In the final days of December, 40 accountants and lawyers combed United's records while Mr. Ranieri conducted days of round-the-clock negotiations with regulators in Washington. **********In Houston, meanwhile, a separate Ranieri team prepared itself for the final assault on United. On the last day, one group was always reachable through a Yellow Cab, of course, equipped with a mobile phone. **********''I kind of acted as the receptionist, taking their messages,'' said Jim Smith, the cab driver, who earned $300 for his troubles. (Despite his ownership position, Mr. Ranieri still pays the rate on the meter.) When the signal came, four cars carrying regulators and representatives of the new owners pulled out of a parking lot near United's main operations office. Within minutes the group had taken control of the institution and secured the premises to protect the offices and records against vandalism by any disenchanted employees. **********Auditors were immediately dispatched to United's 19 branches to count the money and report their findings.  A Bloodless Coup And a Fresh Start **********In the executive offices, the local regulators and Mr. Ranieri's man on the scene, David M. Golush, gathered nervous United executives and informed them that their new employer was Hyperion Partners. The partnership was capitalized with $500 million raised by Mr. Ranieri's firm, Ranieri Wilson & Company. **********Quietly, the regulators took the treasurer aside and dismissed him, while others delivered the same blow by phone to the chief financial officer and general counsel. **********''Traumatic'' is the only word James L. Wolfe could find to describe the last few days of 1988. Mr. Wolfe, the controller, is one of the few survivors of the previous senior management. **********Over the New Year's weekend, Mr. Golush began the next phase of the takeover plan with fervor. He had the executive conference room searched for electronic bugs and then videotaped all the offices to record the state in which the property had been received. **********''You never know what some angry employee might do,'' he said. A guard was posted outside United's offices to check employees' name tags before letting them in. The Effort to Reassure **********United - now called United Savings of Texas F.S.B., for Federal Savings Bank - reopened on the Tuesday after New Year's. Mr. Golush had a three-piece band playing in the lobby, with banners, balloons, coffee and doughnuts to reassure nervous employees. ''I found the only organ-grinder in Houston with a monkey,'' he said. About 25 or 30 of United's 575 employees have left on their own accord since Hyperion took over. Mr. Golush says that only five have lost their jobs, when Hyperion closed a small branch in Pennsylvania. **********Equal attention was given to retaining depositors' confidence. United placed advertisements in local newspapers, sent letters to customers and armed employees with fliers and fact sheets to calm depositors. Many of those actions were recommended in a brochure that regulators have prepared for new owners of insolvent institutions. Depositors Remain Calm **********The emergency tactics seem to have worked; Mr. Ranieri said United's deposit base has remained stable. **********A recent visit to several branches found customers in good spirits. ''You got your problems worked out now?'' one elderly man, clearly unperturbed, asked a teller as he stopped in for his daily cup of complimentary coffee. **********''Now, don't you turkeys go under,'' said another customer as she wagged her finger at her United investment adviser. A United depositor for more than 20 years, Billie J. Spencer said she stayed with the organization despite its troubles because she trusts the people. ''They had a soothing effect on us,'' she said.  A Study in Why The Crisis Exists **********In many ways, the organization that Mr. Ranieri's group won is a classic example of a Texas savings and loan association of the 1980's: a sprawling entity that dabbled in a wide variety of ventures, many of them risky. Its corporate structure was a morass of more than 40 subsidiaries, some of which the Ranieri team is still trying to unravel. **********Besides its stake in the Yellow Cab operation, United owns shopping malls, undeveloped land and so many foreclosed apartments that it is among the largest landlords in Houston. The savings association also had invested heavily in high-yield, high-risk ''junk bonds,'' stocks of companies involved in takeover situations and, at one point, 22 venture capital deals including high-tech start-up companies and a health club chain. **********''Most of the investments are worth nothing now,'' said Scott A. Shay, a partner in Ranieri Wilson whose responsibilities include overseeing United's venture capital commitments. He is still trying to track down one company in Latin America of which United owns a piece. ''I can't even tell you what they do,'' Mr. Shay said. Shift From Business as Usual **********While United was pursuing its farflung activities, its traditional business was sharply curtailed. Its branch network, once one of the largest in the state, fell to 19, from 104 in 1983. The organization has not made a new loan in two-and-a-half years. **********''It was kind of like walking into a house and finding that there was nothing there, that you were standing in the back yard,'' Mr. Ranieri said. **********United had as its largest stockholder Charles E. Hurwitz, a Houston-based corporate takeover artist with close ties to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Drexel owned almost 10 percent of United before the regulators took it over. **********Regulators found no evidence that fraud had been committed. They attributed the institution's failure to ''loan-underwriting deficiencies, a failure to maintain appraisal reports, poor maintenance of books and records, and insufficient internal routes and controls.'' In short, laxity in the approval process for real estate loans during the boom years of the Texas economy ultimately produced huge losses when the economy turned down. **********Mr. Hurwitz's 23 percent stake in United was wiped out when the regulators took the institution into receivership. Until the bitter end he bid against Mr. Ranieri to buy the insolvent institution.  The Investors' Turnaround Plan **********In the six weeks since he has owned United, Mr. Ranieri has radically reshaped the organization. He has sold off its $300 million portfolio of stocks involved in takeovers, and has shrunk its holdings of $3 billion of mortgage securities by more than a third. **********Mr. Ranieri's strategy for United is based on his view that the Texas economy is recovering and that the savings industry will shrink by half as the Government overhauls it. The survivors, he thinks, will be able to make plenty of money the traditional way: taking retail deposits and making loans in real estate and other areas. **********Because United had pulled out of the lending business, that will take some doing. Recently presented with the opportunity to participate in several real estate deals, Mr. Ranieri exclaimed, ''Is there no one in this entire place besides me who knows how to underwrite a commercial loan?'' The Search for Talent **********Hyperion is now looking for lending officers with the skills to analyze financial statements and evaluate risk. Other priorities include hiring a general counsel and a chief compliance officer, who makes sure that business is conducted by the book. **********Mr. Ranieri has participated in virtually every facet of United's business, from helping to pick a new loan-processing system to discussing stationery to making sure that a new check-overdraft policy is introduced for good customers. **********More significantly, he has put his expertise in mortgage securities trading to work. He is on the phone with United's four traders three or four times a day, discussing strategies and market sentiment. **********Last fall, United lost $100 million in one month on its mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Ranieri said his trading has been profitable. He calculates that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which by agreement gets 90 percent of the profits on that portfolio, has already made about $15 million from his trading acumen. A Big Investment of Time **********Mr. Ranieri is in the Houston office about four days a week. Five of Ranieri Wilson's 10 professionals are there at least that often. **********''I knew I would have to spend time here,'' Mr. Ranieri said. ''I just didn't know how much.'' Hyperion had not expected the regulators to force out so many members of the former senior management team. **********The new owners face a constant reminder of United's sorry past. They are surrounded by objects bearing small stickers imprinted with a five-digit number. The regulators have catalogued every desk, chair, typewriter and painting in the place until Hyperion decides whether it wants to buy them. Even plants are not exempt. **********''If you stand still long enough they'll put a sticker on you,'' Mr. Ranieri said. ''I feel like I'm living in a pawn shop.'' He became furious a few minutes later when he noticed that one had been put on an air purifier he had brought from New York.  The Importance Of Asking Why **********One of the biggest changes at United has come in management style. Shyness was never one of Mr. Ranieri's traits. Since arriving at United, he has taken to arranging impromptu lunches with branch managers and appearing suddenly in a manager's doorway demanding to know why something was not taken care of yesterday. **********The previous owners had their offices in a separate building about four miles from the operational staff. Employees say that people from the head office hardly ever stopped by. A top priority of Mr. Ranieri is to put the executives in the same building with what he calls ''the worker bees.'' The Overcoming of Skepticism **********At first employees harbored some suspicions about their new owners, but many seem to be charmed by Mr. Ranieri's gregarious, if blunt, manner and his rolled-up sleeves and loosened tie. **********''We heard rumors that he used to stand on desks at Salomon, and do strange things,'' said Mr. Wolfe, the controller. ''But I think people view him as kind of a real person.'' **********Others treat him with awe. While on a tour of one floor during which he was constantly peering behind closed doors, rather like a prospective homebuyer, he was asked for his autograph by one employee. **********In what is perhaps the ultimate test of acceptance, United's marketing executives have arranged for a ''naturalization process'' at their next sales ceremony, scheduled to coincide with the Houston rodeo. Those wishing to see Mr. Ranieri and friends in boots, 10-gallon hats and string ties should show up at the San Antone Rose nightclub on March 1."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/29/business/edelman-sued-on-datapoint.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Edelman Sued On Datapoint", "print_headline": "Edelman Sued On Datapoint", "body_text": " **********A suit was filed yesterday against Asher B.

If anyone expected Donald J. Trump's flamboyant entry into the shuttle business to bring cutthroat competition and rock-bottom fares, that has not happened. **********Mr. Trump's acquisition of Eastern Airlines' Boston-New York-Washington service on June 7 offered travelers relief from that airline's frequent labor difficulties and threadbare cabins. And after 12 weeks of service, the Trump Shuttle is steadily recouping market share that strike-ridden Eastern had lost to its only rival, the Pan Am shuttle. **********The battle between the two air services is being fought over amenities and image in a manner gentlemanly enough to provide substantial operating profits for both. Analysts say the only big question is whether the profit margins are large enough to make Mr. Trump's $365 million purchase price look like a good deal. **********''There are only two of us in the market - what do you think Pan Am is going to do if I cut prices?'' said Bruce R. Nobles, president and chief operating officer of the Trump Shuttle. ''We both recognize that the price is simply not going to generate business.'' **********At times the rivalry seems a throwback to years ago, when the Government regulated fares and the carriers competed by offering fancier meals. In this instance, the scarcity of airport gates and runway space - and the relative indifference of business travelers to high fares - seems to be providing Trump and Pan Am an umbrella of protection from price competitors. **********''It's just like the old, regulated airlines back in the days before deregulation,'' said L. John Eichner, an airline industry economist. **********Pan Am concedes that the Trump shuttle has raised its market share substantially, from 26 percent when Trump acquired the airline, but its exact current share is in sharp dispute. Pan Am says 40 percent; Mr. Trump says 50. Trump Attracts the Curious **********Interviews with executives at the two shuttle companies, industry analysts and passengers suggest that several factors have helped Trump gain on Pan Am, including simple curiosity about what changes Mr. Trump would make. **********A strike by Eastern's machinists, pilots and flight attendants that began on March 4 cost the shuttle operation thousands of daily customers. Before the strike, Eastern's shuttle consistently held 52 percent or more of the market, which last year totaled four million trips and about $300 million in fares. **********Airline analysts and the presidents of both shuttles attribute the Trump Shuttle's recuperation to the name change and an end to the picketing. ''I think the Trump name attracted some people,'' acknowledged Harris K. Herman, president and chief operating officer of the Pan Am shuttle. **********That was the case for Connie Torto, a costume jewelry saleswoman, who was hurrying to catch her first Trump Shuttle flight at La Guardia Airport on Tuesday morning and said she used the shuttle only because of Mr. Trump. ''I just wanted to see,'' she said. ''I've heard there were a lot of changes.'' **********Mr. Trump says his employees are happier than they were with Eastern, a claim supported by union representatives. **********''The corporate mission statements about treating people like assets are like water on parched soil for these fellows,'' said J. Leslie Robinson, chairman of the master executive council of the Air Line Pilots Association at the Trump Shuttle. **********The unions have contributed to the happier climate - and Trump's profitability - by negotiating temporary concessions on work rules with Mr. Nobles. The agreements cover pilots, machinists and flight attendants and provide greater flexibility in worker assignments. Bold New Colors **********Mr. Nobles says he expects the Trump Shuttle to continue to gain ground on Pan Am as it completes the renovations associated with the takeover. The exteriors of the aircraft have been repainted in red, white, black and gold; the interiors are still being refurbished. **********Analysts say profits should grow. The scarcity of landing rights and airport gates in Washington and New York prevents other airlines from entering the shuttle market, including those with extensive Northeast operations, like USAir Group and Delta Air Lines. **********Continental, the one airline best positioned to compete with Trump and Pan Am, has not been affected by their rivalry and has no plans to change its hourly services to Washington and Boston from Newark, said James V. O'Donnell, Continental's senior vice president for marketing. **********''You can operate an inefficient operation and still make tons of money,'' Mr. Neidl said of the shuttle business. What will not be clear for some time is whether the profits will justify the purchase price, Mr. Eichner said. **********Mr. Trump maintained in an interview that the shuttle has already proved a prudent investment, as takeover speculation has dramatically increased the price of airline stocks. The shuttle, he said, ''has become worth considerably more.'' **********George W. James, president of Airline Economics, a Washington consulting firm, said Mr. Trump might be right, but cautioned that the recent stock speculation has been in airlines with nationwide operations. **********The Trump Shuttle now projects, for its first 12 months, $202 million in sales and $157 million in operating expenses and write-offs related to the purchase and refurbishing, Mr. Nobles said. After paying interest of $28 million on a revolving $300 million line of bank credit, the shuttle should post a pretax profit of $18 million, he said, adding that profits should increase in the future. **********The Trump Shuttle collects the equivalent of 40 cents a mile for seats, Mr. Nobles said. That is roughly triple the average yield of 11 to 14 cents. The main reason prices can be kept high is that a huge percentage of travelers - 85 percent, according to Trump's most recent survey - are business customers who charge travel costs to their companies. **********But costs are also higher - ''over 20 cents'' for each seat-mile, Mr. Nobles said, compared with an industry average of 7.5 cents. The higher costs reflect the greater fuel consumption of short routes flown at low altitudes, salaries for standby crews and steep maintenance costs for the aging, fully depreciated planes that both shuttle operations use, he said. Burgundy Porcelain Sinks **********Advertising costs are also relatively high, because so far ads are the favorite weapon in the competition between the shuttle services. **********The Trump Shuttle plans to spend $8 million to $12 million on marketing in its first 12 months of operation, and has promoted even the burgundy porcelain lavatory sinks that are part of the $40 million refurbishing of its 21 Boeing 727 jets. The Pan Am shuttle has increased its annual advertising budget to $10 million, from $7 million, and has trumpeted the virtues of its ferry service from La Guardia to midtown and lower Manhattan. **********Mr. Trump began his operation with promises to insure safety and timeliness. The record so far indicates little difference between the services. About 94 percent of the Trump Shuttle's 62 daily flights in August have arrived on time, Mr. Nobles said yesterday. The Pan Am shuttle's 64 daily flights have been arriving on time ''in the low 90's'' in August, said Jeff Kriendler, a spokesman for Pan Am. **********One thing neither shuttle service has changed is the $99 one-way fare, nor does either expect to do so. **********''I don't anticipate fare cuts and have no plans for fare cuts,'' said Mr. Herman, sounding very much like Mr. Nobles. ''Price has never been one of the discussion points.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/16/world/gorbachev-urges-economic-accords.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1989-07-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 519, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GORBACHEV URGES ECONOMIC ACCORDS", "print_headline": "GORBACHEV URGES ECONOMIC ACCORDS", "body_text": " **********Mikhail S.

The commercial then cut to an overhead scene of 12,000 people around the theater in Los Angeles where the film had its premiere. **********In a recent commercial for ''Lethal Weapon 2,'' which uses the tagline ''The Magic Is Back,'' Warner signed up Earvin (Magic) Johnson, the Los Angeles Lakers basketball star, to deliver humorous lines at the end of the commercial. **********Warner is not the only studio trying some new techniques. The Orion Pictures Corporation earlier this year shot a commercial outside the premiere of ''Great Balls of Fire,'' soliciting unpaid testimonials from celebrities who attended. The commercials, featuring actors and actresses like Justine Bateman and Timothy Hutton, were put on the air the next day. **********In an age when 15- and 30-second commercials are the norm in movie advertising, the 20th Century-Fox Corporation is showing a 75-second commercial to promote its big summer movie, ''The Abyss,'' which opens in two weeks. Paramount Pictures used a 90-second commercial for ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' and Warner used a 90-second commercial for ''Batman.'' **********Gordon Weaver, who runs the Gordon Weaver Company, a motion-picture marketing consultancy in Los Angeles, said studios were generally spending more and more money on advertising. **********''You certainly hope to get the film on the cover of Life and Time and Newsweek, but if you look at all the stuff you can get for free, most of it is geared to an older audience,'' he said. ''In order to reach the core audience, people under 25, you have to use paid media,'' primarily television. **********Despite the impact and splash of 75- or 90-second commercials, Mr. Weaver said studios were increasingly using 15-second commercials, particularly in the early stages of marketing a film. **********''It's becoming more common, certainly in terms of delivering early awareness to the public of a film's title and its stars,'' he said. ''Not every film has the pre-attention of 'Batman.' '' **********The use of more 15-second commercials, he said, is ''forcing the industry to be more creative'' in getting messages across about particular films in such a short period of time."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/30/business/whats-new-in-the-horse-business-for-smallhorse-breeders-more-buyers.html": {"writer_name": "David Hollis", "pub_date": "1989-04-30", "snippet": "LEAD: Lynn Spicer takes his horse Jack almost everywhere.

Jack accompanies him to work most mornings - and wanders around the premises of Mr. Spicer's swimming pool business in Waverly, N.Y. The horse even goes on vacations with the Spicers, traveling in the family's motor home. (Jack can signal Mr. Spicer when he needs to step outside.) Jack can be treated like any other domesticated pet because he is a miniature. Miniatures range in size from 26- to 34-inches tall. And they cost less to feed and care for than standard-sized horses - about $150 a year, compared with about $600, according to breeders. **********These features have made miniatures a galloping success. They now number 28,000, up from just 9,000 five years ago, according to industry estimates. Owners include small children, who ride them, and people who are intimidated by full-sized horses. Gloria Austin, a breeder near Rochester, N.Y., says that senior citizens and people with disabilities purchase about five of the 25 miniatures she sells each year. **********Breeders, however, have been hard pressed to satisfy the growing demand for tiny horses. And as a result, their prices have soared 30 percent in two years, to an average of $5,000 today, said Mary Culbertson of the American Miniature Horse Association in Burleson, Tex. That makes miniatures double the price of full-bodied, registered horses, which cost an average of $2,250. **********Because miniature breeding has become more lucrative than raising some full-sized horses, a stampede of breeders have entered the field. No one knows exactly how many farms breed miniatures, but Ms. Culbertson says most - and there are at least 400 - have sprung up in the last five years and have fewer than 20 horses today. With nearly 500 miniatures, Dell Tera Miniature Horse Farm in Inman, S.C., is considered the nation's largest breeder. **********Still, the potential for a glut is slim, most breeders say. Originally bred in the 17th century as pets for the children of European royalty, miniatures are produced by crossing the smallest horses of a line. Many cannot be certified as miniatures because they grow too large. **********Used in coal mines since the early 1800's, miniatures re-emerged as pets in this country after Smith McCoy dispersed his herd of 100 in 1967. To promote the horses and purify the line, the Miniature Horse Association, formed by the new owners in 1978, established a registry to set size standards for the animals. The group also established horse shows for miniatures and competitions for them in existing equestrian events, which has helped expose more people to the line."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/13/world/french-honor-an-abbot-the-church-dislikes.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1989-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 690, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Honor an Abbot the Church Dislikes", "print_headline": "French Honor an Abbot the Church Dislikes", "body_text": " **********After an exhausting calendar of events, France's bicentennial celebrations ended appropriately today in an argument over history, with the Roman Catholic Church having the last word that the French Revolution was perhaps not such a good thing after all. **********The dispute focused on the Government's decision to honor Abbot Gregoire, a priest who embraced the egalitarian principles of the 1789 Revolution, despite its strong anti-clericalism, by burying his ashes in the Pantheon alongside other heroes of the French Republic. **********While President Francois Mitterrand and the Cabinet presided over the lavish nationally televised ceremony today, no official representative of the nation's Catholic hierarchy was present for an occasion that was seen as using the 18th century to send 20th-century messages. **********From the point of view of the Socialist Government, Abbot Gregoire's merits were that he was an outspoken defender of the rights of blacks, slaves, Protestants and Jews - qualities that it believes worth emphasizing at a time that France is witnessing a resurgence of racial and religious intolerance. The island of Goree, off Dakar, Senegal, one of the first important slaving ports, was represented here today by women carrying a huge banner along the avenue leading up to the Pantheon. Jacques Stewart, president of the French Protestant Federation, and the Grand Rabbi of France, Joseph Sitruk, also took part in the ceremony. **********But within the church, the Abbot is principally remembered for backing a revolution in which thousands of priests were slain and for promoting the independence of the French Catholic Church from the Vatican in Rome. When he died in 1831, he was paid homage by French intellectuals but was buried without the last sacraments of the church. **********To France's Catholic hierarchy, today's ceremony at the Pantheon also had contemporary significance because, at a time of internal tension within the church around the world, France is honoring a monk who supposedly encouraged a church split. Made a Conscious Choice **********''No one can doubt Abbot Gregoire's commitment to democracy and religious freedom,'' Le Monde wrote in a front-page article today that reflected the interest stirred by the issue, ''but it is also true that, forced to choose between loyalty to the political power emanating from the revolution and loyalty to the Pope, it was clear which side he took.'' **********Today, church discipline is something that Pope John Paul II holds dear to his heart. Nicaraguan priests who have given their first loyalty to the Sandinista revolution have been punished, while theologians critical of the Vatican have been ordered to remain silent. As a member of the diplomatic corps, however, the Papal Nuncio, Msgr. Lorenzo Antonetti, was present at the Pantheon today. **********In an article in the conservative daily Le Figaro, Annie Kriegel, a political scientist, noted that Abbot Gregoire was being honored for fighting to give Jews the right to French citizenship, but she argued that he was given credit for achievements that were not his doing. His ''Pantheonization,'' she added, was ''a grave deformation'' of history. **********In the same newspaper, though, a Jesuit priest, the Rev. Michel Riquet, argued that the Abbot ''fought before, during and after the revolution for recognition that Jews, Huguenots and blacks should enjoy the same civil rights as all men.'' **********One result of the controversy is that, while the church chose a low profile during this bicentennial year rather than dwelling on the persecution suffered by clerics during the revolution, the simmering tensions between the France's strongly lay government and the Catholic hierarchy have now come to the surface. **********Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger of Paris, a man known for his conciliatory skills, held a separate service on Monday to commemorate the Abbot's achievements. But he told reporters last week that ''Abbot Gregoire's concept of a national church is very different from Catholic traditions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/02/world/palestinian-killed-by-troops-and-another-dies-of-wounds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Palestinian Killed by Troops And Another Dies of Wounds", "print_headline": "Palestinian Killed by Troops And Another Dies of Wounds", "body_text": " **********Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian today in a clash in the village of Bethany in the occupied territories, and another reportedly died of wounds inflicted by Jewish settlers, the army and Arab hospital officials said. **********The military said the victim in Bethany was shot when a group of Palestinians stoned an Israeli Army jeep patrol and slightly injured two soldiers.

The other is the pursuit of expanded liberty in a country long accustomed to authoritarian rule but eager for change as it glows more prosperous and politically mature. 'Full Democracy' Urged **********Before the Mass, the Pope met with the South Korean President, Roh Tae Woo, and admonished him to press for ''full democracy,'' with ''authentic justice, freedom and inalienable human rights.'' **********Mr. Roh, who came to office early last year after the first genuine elections here since 1971, offered no direct public response to the papal appeal. But in welcoming John Paul on Saturday he said that with the advent of his Government, ''political oppression has disappeared.'' **********That assertion is fiercely disputed by human-rights groups. While generally acknowledging that South Korea has made notable strides in recent years -holding elections and tolerating dissent to a greater degree - they say repressive laws and the bureaucratic machinery to enforce them remain largely intact. **********Moreover, the number of arrests on politically related charges has risen of late, and among the more vulnerable are South Koreans trying to make contact with North Korea. Those people, some of them longtime dissidents, touch a raw nerve in a Government that reserves for itself the exclusive right to deal with the North. **********A few have been indicted on the serious charge of violating national security laws, and they include the country's most prominent opposition figure, Kim Dae Jung, and a 71-year-old Protestant minister, Moon Ik Hwan, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison the day before John Paul set out for Asia. 'Just Patways' to Reunification **********Without mentioning these matters specifically, the Pope said to Mr. Roh today: **********''In a nation which has to face difficult, even painful, decisions in many areas of public life, and which still bears the scars of division and conflict, you are confronted with the challenge of seeking peaceful and just pathways toward a national life and reunification based on authentic justice, freedom and inalienable human rights.'' **********Later the chief Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said the Pope did not intend his remarks to be taken as a rebuke because he recognized the changes that have occurred here since his last visit in 1984. Rather, he was ''challenging the President to go further,'' Mr. Navarro said. **********The two fundamental themes -democracy and the division of this peninsula - have been interlocked since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Technically, the two nations continue to be in a state of war, and the border that separates them is among the world's most heavily fortified. Using the North's Threat **********Over the decades, successive South Korean governments have argued that the perceived threat from the North creates a need for extraordinary national solidarity and that this, in turn, requires restrictions on individual freedoms. But critics contend that the Government has long exploited the northern threat, and even exaggerated it, to justify self-serving repression. **********The Mass today was held under wind-scrubbed skies on Yoido Island, in the Han River, which snakes through the capital. The island is studded with office buildings, hotels and the National Assembly building, but its long central plaza is deliberately kept empty. Normally, it is used for political rallies or sports events, but if war were ever to break out again, it would be turned into a landing strip. **********John Paul's appearance was the highlight of an international Catholic congress that opened here last week. Organizers had invited 20 people from the Communist North's tiny, suppressed Catholic population of about 50,000, but church officials said they never received a response. **********In a ''peace message,'' the Pope said he had in mind ''with deep affection, hope and sorrow, the people of North Korea and especially its Catholic community.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/01/world/heavy-bombardments-continue-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 279, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Heavy Bombardments Continue in Lebanon", "print_headline": "Heavy Bombardments Continue in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********Heavy clashes continued in Lebanon today, and Gen.

The next day, West Berliners managed to pry open a section of the wall there, but they were routed by East German water cannon and West German policemen. **********Now, several American and West German television crews have set up broadcast platforms there, often bathing the wall and the crowd in bright light and adding to a sense of excitement. Brandenburg Gate Is Special **********Even with 10 new crossings opened since Thursday, for many Berliners the opening of a route through the Brandenburg Gate would have a distinct symbolic importance. It would reconnect the most important boulevard of old Berlin, the Unter den Linden, which on the Eastern side remains an elegant row of imposing buildings, and on the Western side is a broad avenue named 17 June after the 1953 uprising on that date in East Germany. **********Already, some of these street signs have been replaced by hand-painted ones reading 9 November, the date the border restrictions were lifted. **********In another development, the new Prime Minister of East Germany, Hans Modrow, opened talks about forming a coalition with four small parties that had been traditionally aligned with the Communists. The parties -Farmers, Christian Democrats, Liberal and National Democrats - have become more outspoken and independent with the recent openness. **********The press agency reported that the new speaker elected by Parliament on Monday, Gunter Maleuda, the chairman of the Farmers Party, called at a party meeting today for a rewriting of the first article of the East German Constitution, which guarantees a ''leading role'' for the Communist Party."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/02/business/pact-for-crayon-maker.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pact for Crayon Maker", "print_headline": "Pact for Crayon Maker", "body_text": " **********Binney & Smith Inc., known for its Crayola brand crayons, has entered into a licensing and royalty agreement with Magic Marker Industries to make and sell products under the Magic Marker name and trademark.

It is self-evident that Berlin will be fully included in this cooperation. **********I urge all social groups and institutions to participate in the formation of such a community. **********We are also prepared to take a further decisive step, namely, to develop confederative structures between the two states in Germany in order to create a federation. A legitimate democratic government in East Germany is a prerequisite. **********We could imagine the following institutions coming about soon after free elections: A common governmental committee for permanent consultation and political harmonization; common technical committees; a common parliamentary committee. **********Previous policy toward East Germany essentially had to concentrate on small steps that strove to alleviate the results of our division and uphold and sharpen the consciousness for the unity of the nation. If in future a democractically legitimized, that is, a freely elected government, becomes our partner, totally new perspectives open up. **********New forms of institutional cooperation can emerge and be developed in stages. Such a growing together is part of the continuity of German history. Now we can again make use of these historical experiences. **********Nobody knows how a reunified Germany will look. But I am sure that unity will come, if it is wanted by the German nation. **********The development of inner-German relations remains bedded in the pan-European process and in East-West relations. The future structure of Germany must fit into the architecture of Europe as a whole. The West has to provide peacemaking aid here with its concept for a permanent and just European order of peace. ... **********The powers of attraction and the aura of the European Community is and remains a constant feature in the pan-European development. We want to strengthen this further. **********The European Community is now required to approach the reform-oriented states in central, eastern and southern Europe with openness and flexibility. This was ascertained unanimously by the heads of state and government of the E.C. member states during their recent meeting in Paris. This of course includes the G.D.R.

Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, called today on the President and Congress to consider giving the Central Intelligence Agency greater latitude in supporting potentially violent efforts to overthrow foreign dictators. **********Mr. Webster, in an interview, said a longstanding Presidential executive order barring American involvement in assassinations had been interpreted to prohibit American assistance to any coup that could lead to the death of a country's leader, even in the heat of battle. **********Asked if he would like to see this interpretation relaxed, Mr. Webster said, ''I don't think you're misreading me.'' Order Adopted in 1976 **********The executive order was adopted in 1976 by President Gerald R. Ford after Congressional investigations in the mid-1970's detailed the Central Intelligence Agency's role in assassination plots against President Fidel Castro of Cuba and others. It is the cornerstone of legal restrictions on American covert action abroad. The order was strengthened by President Jimmy Carter and adopted without change by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. **********Mr. Webster, in his first extensive discussion of the agency's role in the failed coup attempt in Panama on Oct. 3, said he now detected a willingness in the Bush Administration and Congress to reinterpret the order in a way that would give the C.I.A. greater freedom to deal with coup planners like those in Panama, while preserving the prohibition on assassination plots. **********''The United States does not engage in selective, individual assassination,'' Mr. Webster said. ''But the United States has other important overriding concerns about security and protecting democracy in areas of the world where it has a legitimate claim of interest. And when despots take over, there has to be a means to deal with that short of making us to be hired killers.'' **********Mr. Webster said the agency was ''looking at this hard and fast, right now, fast and hard.'' **********Administration officials said that various drafts of a new intepretation had been circulated but none had been adopted, and senior officials anticipate lengthy discussions about the issue with the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. **********Mr. Webster said: ''We all need to look at that and say, 'Have we pushed this beyond a practical effectiveness? Have we extended the executive order beyond its intended original meaning by both the White House and Congress?' '' **********Administration officials said that when the dissident Panamanian officers said this month that they were plotting a coup, C.I.A. officers in Panama were essentially barred from providing advice because of the possibility that the coup might lead to the death of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's leader. May 'Make a Difference' **********Mr. Webster said he wanted to formulate rules so that C.I.A. officers' authority was so clearly defined that ''they can go right up to the edge of that authority and not worry if they or their agency is going to get into trouble.'' He added, ''When you have deliberate blurring, it puts a terrible and I think unacceptable pressure on the people who have do the work.'' **********Asked if such guidelines would have made a difference in Panama, he said: ''I'm not certain it would have made a difference in this situation. But it could very well make a difference in the next one, because the likelihood of the next plotter planning that he may probably have to take Noriega out is real. **********''If there was a lesson learned, it was that sending him into the bedroom and giving him a telephone was not the way to carry out a plot.'' **********General Noriega is said by some accounts to have marshaled forces to put down the coup through a series of telephone calls to forces loyal to him. 'Noriega's Days Are Numbered' **********In the interview, Mr. Webster also made these points: *********** General Noriega retains a shaky grip on power. ''I think Noriega's days are numbered,'' he said. ''I don't want to tell you how many days, because we haven't been very good at that.'' *********** President Bush telephoned Mr. Webster today to express confidence in his performance after an article in The Washington Post recounted criticism of him after the failed Panamanian coup by unnamed Administration officials. ''There's always a lot of fallout and temptation to finger-point if things didn't go exactly the way they should, and I suppose my turn has come up,'' Mr. Webster said. *********** The C.I.A. does a thorough assessment of the risks posed by each covert operation, and the frankness of these documents has irritated some in the White House and on Capitol Hill who would like to see the agency do more. Bush Headed C.I.A. in '76 **********The first executive order on intelligence, as approved by President Ford on Feb. 18, 1976, said, ''No employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination.'' Mr. Bush was the Director of Central Intelligence at the time. **********The order's provisions were significantly strengthened in 1978 by President Carter to say that ''no person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage, or conspire to engage, in assassination.'' President Reagan retained that language in 1981 after a sharp dispute among his intelligence advisers. **********Senator William Cohen, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said Congress and the Administration should ask whether the rules on assassination had handcuffed what should be the Government's most entrepreneurial and risk-taking agency. **********''I want to know to what extent unreasonable shackles have been placed on them,'' Senator Cohen said. ''Whether there has been an overreaction to Iran-contra and other past scandals remains to be seen. But I don't think the Congress is immune to criticism on this. **********''I don't want to see a wholesale change in the rules,'' Senator Cohen continued. ''I don't want it to be open season on political enemies.'' **********Mr. Webster acknowledged that the history of relations between Congress and the intelligence agencies made it politically impossible for the executivve branch alone to recast the language of the executive order. ''I think we have too much history to try something as dramatic as that,'' he said. **********Rather, he said, Congress and the White House must find ''a way that is palatable for both branches of government. And I think there is a mood now in both places to do that.'' Webster's Detailed Analysis **********Mr. Webster, a former Federal judge, gave a detailed analysis of how he believed the executive order was interpreted at present. **********What is unequivocally barred, he said, is an American-devised plan for the assassination of General Noriega. **********''Now the next thing is, hire a guy to kill Noriega or fund a group who wants to kill Noriega,'' he said. ''Our executive order would have in the past been construed at least that we could not do that, because we would just be using someone else to do what we couldn't do ourselves. **********''Now it begins to get a little tighter when you say, 'Here's a group that says it doesn't plan to kill him, but they're going to have to play rough and it could happen.' **********''Now we're in the area that has to be addressed.'' **********In the interview, Mr. Webster said the C.I.A.'s assessment of the Panamanian coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had concluded that he was a legitmate plotter whose plan was faulty and had less than a 50-50 chance of success. He acknowledged that the military's analysis of the situation placed greater emphasis on the possibility that Major Giroldi was part of an operation intended to entrap American military forces. **********When President Bush's senior advisers met on Oct. 2 to consider how to handle the coup, they concluded that it was best to proceed cautiously, largely because of the danger that Major Giroldi was not credible. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney represented the military. The C.I.A. was not included in the session. **********Asked whether his agency should have been represented, Mr. Webster replied, ''That would have been the preferred option.'' But he said it made no difference in the outcome, because the C.I.A. analysis also suggested the need for caution. **********An Administration official said future crises of this sort would be handled by the Deputies Committee, a panel of senior officials that includes Richard Kerr, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/23/world/arafat-sends-bush-a-message-on-talks-with-israel.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1989-11-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 705, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Sends Bush a Message on Talks With Israel", "print_headline": "Arafat Sends Bush a Message on Talks With Israel", "body_text": " **********Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has sent a message to President Bush expressing a willingness to negotiate peace with Israel, Administration officials said today. **********They refused to divulge the contents, but Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said the Middle East ''situation is not measurably altered'' as a result of the Arafat message. **********The message, transmitted from P.L.O. headquarters in Tunis through the United States Embassy there, was described as vague and very general. **********''The President has received an oral message from Arafat delivered through the established diplomatic channels in Tunis, which is to say our Ambassador in Tunis,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.

''This provision is an insult to the Ukrainian Catholics.'' **********Largely because of its identification with Ukrainian nationalism, the Eastern Rite church has endured severe persecution since the western Ukraine was seized from Poland in 1939. **********The church recognizes the Pope as its head, but follows Byzantine rites."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/08/business/jefferies-questioned-further.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 325, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jefferies Questioned Further", "print_headline": "Jefferies Questioned Further", "body_text": " **********Boyd L. Jefferies testified yesterday that he did not recall verbatim a crucial conversation in 1986 with a senior executive of the GAF Corporation. The Government contends that the conversation was part of an illegal scheme by GAF and Mr. Jefferies to manipulate the price of the Union Carbide Corporation's stock. **********On the second day of cross-examination, Mr. Jefferies, the former chief executive of a large West Coast brokerage, offered slightly differing accounts of what he was told by GAF's vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, on Oct. 29, 1986, about the purchase of Union Carbide stock. **********GAF and Mr. Sherwin have denied charges that they tried to manipulate the price of Union Carbide shares by an eighth of a point, to $22 a share, after an unsuccessful takeover attempt. At the time, GAF held 10 million Union Carbide shares. In November 1986, it sold about 5 million shares at $23 each to Salomon Brothers. **********Mr. Jefferies is the Government's main witness at the trial in Federal District Court in lower Manhattan.

They also say secret funds amounting to about $30 million have been set aside under the control of the Prime Minister, Hun Sen. And the diplomats add that relatives of Government officials and senior members of the ruling People's Revolutionary Party have been purchasing real estate and factories, a percentage of whose profits will go to the party for use, if necessary, in an underground war. **********The aim is to continue the activities of the party in clandestine circumstances if the opposition coalition, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk but dominated by the Khmer Rouge, should come to power, the diplomats said.  Heightened Concern **********The nervousness has been heightened by Vietnam's pledge of a complete troop withdrawal from Cambodia at the end of September. As an international conference in Paris works on a political solution for the country after the withdrawal, Vietnam and the United States, among other countries, are opposing a Khmer Rouge role in any future government. But Prince Sihanouk and China, the Khmer Rouge's principal backer, insist on the guerrilla organization's participation. **********Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted the the Khmer Rouge, which ruled the country for more than three years and presided over a brutal remaking of Cambodian society in which more than a million people died. **********The contingency preparations to resist the Khmer Rouge are concentrated in three provinces to the east of the capital and bordering Vietnam: Kompong Cham, where Mr. Hun Sen's older brother, Hun Neng, is the party chief; Svay Rieng, where another family member plays an important role, and Prey Veng, where the brother of a powerful Politburo member, Say Phouthang, an ethnic Thai, is a major figure. **********''When top leaders here say they are confident they can hold off the Khmer Rouge, they are serious,'' a diplomat said. ''But they themselves must worry about whether they are making an assessment based on accurate information, and they know very well the weakness of the army and its morale.''  Sense of Uncertainty **********This sense of uncertainty runs through society, and especially among people in the cities. Cambodians who work for charitable and international aid agencies ask their employers about plans to escape Phnom Penh ''just in case.'' Rich Cambodians are reliably said to have arranged exit routes for their money and themselves through Koh Kong, an island off the port of Kompong Som, with Thai businessmen who are flocking into the city. **********It is too much to say that a sort of war psychosis has taken root in Phnom Penh, which has been almost entirely free of guerrilla attacks. But after so many years of tragedy, abuse and near annihilation by external powers and internal factions, many Cambodians are fatalistic and seem to expect the worst. **********While the Vietnamese were not often liked here, there is gratitude toward them for driving out Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, and they are considered reliable. With Vietnamese forces leaving, there is relief and growing nationalism, as well as fear about how the army will fare against the Khmer Rouge. **********Another measure of uncertainty is the exchange rate of the Cambodian riel against the dollar. Last December, the rate was 135 to the riel. Two weeks ago, it was 195. Today, it is 217. Similarly, the price of a gold ring, a standard currency here, was 8,000 riels six months ago. A month ago it was 8,200. Today it is 9,200. The price of rice, the national staple, is also increasing, while much land remains fallow - up to half of it in the agriculturally vital Battambang Province - because the paddy fields are often mined. **********''We need the dollars for Thai and Singapore trading,'' said an entrepreneur in the now private and bustling Central Market, where imported watches, stereos, clothes and sunglasses are on sale next to gold and jewelry shops. ''But people remember that in the Pol Pot time, having even a quarter of a gold ring hidden away could save your life.''  The Economy  A Freer Market, With Corruption **********A great deal of money has been made after measures to liberalize the economy were introduced in late spring. Constitutional amendments have allowed private enterprise and allocated land rights to farmers and apartments to their residents. Traders and businessmen have been lured here from Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore. **********Private citizens and Government officials uncertain about what the future holds - a larger war, stagnancy or a coalition Government under which they may lose their jobs - are making money while the going is good. **********Corruption among Government officials has accelerated enormously, everyone agrees, to levels that approach those of the late 1960's under Prince Sihanouk, though not yet to the levels of the 1970's under the American-backed Government of Lon Nol.  Luxuries on Paltry Salaries **********While some officials have always been engaged in petty corruption to make ends meet, high-level officials dealing with foreign business executives are reliably said to be requiring large bribes and are buying up property and luxuries, and sending money abroad. Some Government officials are seen in Phnom Penh in new Mercedes sedans that would cost them 250 years' worth of salary, which is admittedly paltry -less than $10 a month. **********At the same time, middle-level officials who don't have access to such funds are growing resentful while the work efficiency of lower-level officials, never high, has been slacking off, aid officials say. **********Khieu Kanharith, editor of the semi-official weekly Kampuchea and a member of the National Assembly, said in an interview that corruption is a significant problem now, and it was discussed at length in the last session of the assembly in July. **********''We have corruption and it is a big problem,'' Mr. Khieu Kanharith said. ''But I can assure you that this corruption is only at the middle, not at the top. I know all the people in the Politburo, and I know they live simply. **********''The main fault of this Government and this party, and for me, I blame also Hun Sen, is that they're too tolerant, too laissez-faire, and not sufficiently decisive,'' he added. **********Mr. Khieu Kanharith said he had clashed with Mr. Hun Sen on this issue. **********''I've said to him, 'You must watch your colleagues,' '' he said.  The Ruling Party  Living Royally, Losing Credibility **********There are many stories making the rounds, difficult to confirm, of the growing wealth of Mr. Hun Sen and his wife and their contacts with foreign businessmen. They are said to own five houses, renting one to the Australian office for aid agencies, and numerous foreign cars. In February, the wedding of Mr. Hun Sen's niece, Neth Savoeun, to the police colonel responsible for intelligence in Phnom Penh caused much talk. Cambodian weddings are characteristically lavish, but this affair took place here at a Government hotel and was repeated in the family's home province of Kompong Cham. **********Since then, officials say, there has been more discretion shown. ''Some part of the stories are without question true,'' said a senior diplomat. ''But it is difficult to know exactly how big a part.'' **********While most Cambodians expect such behavior of their leaders in what remains a hierarchical society, and may even admire it - ''It's not so different from some Mayors in Boston,'' the diplomat said - it has caused problems inside the party and with the peasantry, he said. **********It is one reason for the popularity of Chea Sim, the leader of the National Assembly and No. 2 in the party (Mr. Hun Sen is No. 3; Heng Samrin is the Secretary General). A simple man who had been trained as a Buddhist monk, Mr. Chea Sim is regarded as a comforting but more rigorous figure who can serve as a brake to Mr. Hun Sen's accelerator.  Discos Shut Down **********An indication of the Government's new sensitivity to the image of wealth came in late July, when discos and dancing restaurants were ordered to close; they had opened in May, when the Constitution was liberalized and the 10 P.M. curfew here was lifted. (In the countryside, there is normally a curfew of 9 P.M.) **********With the huge influx of imported and smuggled luxury items like liquor, champagne, beer and cigarettes, the display at such clubs, and the noise and drunkenness they engendered, led to many complaints. Diplomats say prostitution was prevalent, and many Government officials and army officers could be seen attending the clubs. **********A few dancing spots will be reopened soon, but regulated by the Government. Even so, at the many private restaurants in Phnom Penh, the newly wealthy create piles of imported beer cans and bottles so intricate that they seem a modern version of Angkor, the series of temples representing the Buddhist universe that marked the height of the Khmer civilization.  The Peasants  New Flow of Cash, Old Health Ills **********Diplomats and aid workers say that a risk greater than conspicuous wealth in the city is growing resentment among the poor in the countryside. While the Government has been praised for allowing farmers to keep their land and sell it or pass it on to their children, there are criticisms that party cadres take the best land. **********The cash economy is beginning to spread to the countryside, and Mr. Khieu Kanharith agrees with aid workers that usury is becoming a significant and troubling rural problem. The rates are at least 20 percent a month. **********While the Government has made some haphazard efforts to improve health care and welfare in rural areas where malaria, tuberculosis, dysentery and worms are rampant, there have been more important priorities, like national defense and survival.  14-Year-Olds in Army **********There is also resentment of the forced impressment of 14- and 15-year-olds into the army, especially in the countryside where abuses can go unnoticed. Very young soldiers met on the road from Phnom Penh to the Thai frontier town of Poipet say they have volunteered, and many have indeed, but doctors in Kompong Cham and Kompong Speu report knee wounds to young men who say they were shot by soldiers when trying to escape. **********The Defense Minister, Gen. Tie Banh, said in an interview that there have been a few cases of young men shirking their duty, but not many. He denied that soldiers shot young men trying to escape. Mr. Khieu Kanharith said soldiers were not forcing young men into trucks, but organized criminals dressed as soldiers were abducting young men to seek ransoms from their families. **********''Forced impressment is going on,'' said a diplomat. ''It's no way to build morale in the army or support in the countryside.''  Human Rights  In the Provinces, No Rein on Abuses **********There is also continuing resentment of the use of young men and women to build the border defenses near Thailand known as the ''Bamboo Wall.'' Diplomats here say many have died from mines and malaria in numbers ranging from ''a couple of thousand to a couple of dozen thousand.'' **********The labor is not forced, Cambodian officials say, but is ''a voluntary contribution to the defense of the motherland.'' **********Ith Loeur, the Governor of Bantheay Meanchey province on the Thai border, said in Sisophon that the Bamboo Wall is ''not sufficiently effective'' and did little to stop armed incursions. **********''In the dry season, fires burn the bamboo,'' he said, ''while in the wet season, the mines are light and they float away.'' **********Diplomats say human rights violations are likely to get worse in this period of war-consciousness and concern over survival. Amnesty International says that there are ''thousands'' of political prisoners, but that it has not been allowed to visit Cambodia for an examination. Mr. Khieu Kanharith and others in the National Assembly have raised the issue of a more regulated system of laws and courts, but this is a matter for the future, diplomats agree, and the Government in Phnom Penh has little control over abuses in the provinces. **********Echoing a common theme, a diplomat said the Government, starting with nothing and internationally isolated, had impressive accomplishments. **********''They have done very well, with a lot of mistakes,'' he said. ''But there are a lot of nails in the golden bed.'' **********The most serious problem, he continued, is that the Khmer Rouge are already pointing to the lavishness of city life, the consorting with foreigners and the destitution of the countryside and saying: ''It's the same as before. What was the revolution for?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/15/world/police-storm-brazil-prison.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Police Storm Brazil Prison", "print_headline": "Police Storm Brazil Prison", "body_text": " **********State troopers stormed a prison in southern Brazil today and ended a siege by inmates, killing 8 prisoners and freeing 39 hostages, the police said.

The Bundespost, the national phone company, has been the monopoly supplier of telephone and postal services. **********''This will be the first competitive license that we have awarded for voice service and we plan to start doing this for most other telecommunications fields as well,'' Klaus Czerwinski, the deputy spokesman for the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, said in a telephone interview. **********The license to build the private mobile telephone network, which will compete with an existing cellular system operated by the Bundespost, could be worth as much as 11 billion marks, or about $6 billion, to Pacific Telesis and its partners in the deal, industry analysts said. West Germany is considered a prime market for cellular phone service because it is an affluent, densely populated and well-educated nation. **********West German news organizations reported yesterday that the ministry plans to award the license to a consortium that will be headed by Mannesmann A.G., a West German engineering and steel company, and will include Pacific Telesis; Cable and Wireless P.L.C. of Britain; Lyonnaise des Eaux, a French water company that owns a variety of businesses; and Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank of West Germany. **********Industry executives and analysts said yesterday that they were confident that the license would go to the consortium. **********A ministry official declined to confirm the reports yesterday, saying only that the Postal Minister, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, would announce the decision at a news conference scheduled for 9 A.M. today in West Germany. **********The West German license would be a windfall for Pacific Telesis, which owns a 26 percent stake in the consortium. As its part of the consortium, it would gain 15 million potential new cellular customers, out of a total of 60 million potential customers in West Germany. The regional telephone company owns cellular franchises in the United States that have about 30 million potential customers. Share Price Rises **********Shares of Pacific Telesis rose 25 cents, to $47.75, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday in response to news reports about the license. **********In an effort to modernize outdated telephone systems, European nations have been opening sectors of their telecommunications markets to foreign competition. U S West Inc., the regional phone company based in Denver, said on Monday that it had signed an agreement with Hungary to build a cellular telephone system in Budapest that will be used for basic home service, as well as mobile operations. **********A cellular network transmits calls on radio waves to small receiving antennas, called cell sites, that relay the calls to local phone systems. **********In West Germany, where the basic telephone service is highly developed, the cellular system will be used for car telephones and other mobile communications. Using Digital Technology **********The new West German system will contain digital technology that is expected to provide at least five times the capacity of the current analog cellular system and do so at a lower cost for each call. The current Bundespost system, which has about 130,000 subscribers, has nearly reached its capacity and it frequently disconnects callers, industry analysts said. The Bundespost is planning to convert the system to digital technology. **********The digital system, which transmits voice and information in computer language, is much more efficient and less prone to distortion than the analog system, which sends voice and data on basic sound waves. **********The West German cellular license is perhaps the most highly valued in Europe. It covers 61 million ''pops,'' an industry term that refers to the number of potential subscribers. The number of pops is determined by multiplying the population of an area by the percentage ownership that a company has in that market. **********Joel Gross, a telephone analyst with the Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette Securities Corporation, estimated that the German franchise would evenutally add about $5 a share to Pacific Telesis earnings but that the cellular operation would not be profitable for three to four years. **********Lee Cox, group vice president of diversified companies at Pacific Telesis, said: ''We have received no official confirmation from the ministry that our consortium has won.'' Mr. Cox declined to comment on how much the consortium would spend to construct the system, but analysts put the capital costs at between $500 million and $1 billion during a five-year period. **********Total costs, analysts said, are expected to be $2 billion to $4 billion, depending on the number of subscribers. Comparison With McCaw Deal **********An industry executive noted that Pacific Telesis would be acquiring its new customers at a substantially lower price than McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. is paying to acquire American cellular franchises in its purchase of half the shares of the Lin Broadcasting Corporation. McCaw will be paying almost $3.4 billion in the Lin deal, while Pacific Telesis pays nothing directly for its new customer base. **********The Mannesmann group was chosen from among 10 consortiums that were bidding. Six of the United States' seven regional Bell telephone companies were members of various consortiums. **********Calls made yesterday to Mannesmann's headquarters in Dusseldorf were not returned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/05/business/washington-expects-a-tax-bill-but-a-minor-one.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1989-03-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Expects a Tax Bill, but a Minor One", "print_headline": "Washington Expects a Tax Bill, but a Minor One", "body_text": " **********There will be a tax bill this year, but it is unlikely to involve any major overhaul of the tax code or substantial new tax increases. So goes the prevailing wisdom among tax policy makers and lobbyists as the Bush Administration and Congress take their first tentative steps toward negotiation on the budget for the 1990 fiscal year. **********But predictions about tax legislation, like Government economic statistics, are seasonally adjusted in this city. The prevailing wisdom of March often yields to the budget reality of September. And by then the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee could find themselves scrambling for new sources of revenue to meet deficit reduction targets or to offset the costs of new programs that Congress chooses to finance through tax credits rather than direct Federal outlays. **********Should that occur, the most likely sources are an increase in the gasoline tax, higher excise taxes on beer, wine, spirits or cigarettes or further tightening of tax breaks on interest deductions or fringe benefits. **********Despite new proposals by President Bush to finance programs like child care and business enterprise zones, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, is betting against a raid on the Treasury. **********''If Congress and the President do feel a need to act this year, they'll want to do it on the cheap,'' he said recently. ''That means either programs that at least start small so they can be squeezed into the budget, or programs that cost the Government nothing at all - with the burden shifted to others.'' **********Indeed, in the two months since the 101st Congress convened, Mr. Rostenkowski and Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, have said what they will not do on taxes. **********The chairmen have made clear that they have no plans to overhaul last year's catastrophic health insurance law, despite complaints about its higher Medicare premiums and income tax surcharges. They have been chilly to President Bush's proposal for a reduction in long-term capital gains taxes, and promised real estate interests that there will be no tampering with the home mortgage deduction. **********Behind all the caution on tax policy lies a political and economic environment that gives Democrats as well as Republicans good reason to avoid an assault on the tax code this year. The most important political reality is President Bush's campaign pledge of no new taxes. **********Mr. Rostenkowski and the House Speaker, Jim Wright of Texas, have both been stating that any effort to reduce the Federal budget deficit will have to include significant revenue increases. But they have also made it clear that Democrats are not prepared to make such a move without the firm public support of Mr. Bush. And lawmakers in both parties do not believe that Mr. Bush would accept a broad-scale tax increase this year. **********Another factor working to keep the tax code a minor element in this year's budget debate is the arithmetic of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law. As revised in 1987, the law requires Congress to hold the deficit to $100 billion in Fiscal 1990 to avoid automatic across-the-board cuts. **********Congressional and Administration budget analysts have calculated that absent any major downturn in the economy or dramatic rise in interest rates, the deficit target can be achieved without tax increases this year - a calculation that can change. Under the revised law, the Administration is the final arbiter of the forecasts and estimates used to determine if Congress hits the target. Lawmakers thus have little incentive to adopt more pessimistic forecasts that would require deeper cuts or higher revenues. **********But perhaps the most significant restraint on major tax legislation this year is concern in both parties about the fragility of the economy and the skittishness of financial markets. With inflation and interest rates already on the rise, and the possibility of further monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve to check inflationary pressures, few politicians or policy makers want to start overhauling the tax code. **********''What we need is a sense of stability,'' said Representative Frank J. Guarini, a New Jersey Democrat who serves on both the Ways and Means panel and the House Budget Committee. ''And that desire for stability argues against any major tax law changes.'' **********The only major tax proposal on the table right now is Mr. Bush's recommendation to cut the tax rate on long-term capital gains to 15 percent. Mr. Rostenkowski strongly opposes such a move, arguing that the Treasury can't afford it and that it is inherently unfair. ''I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a higher rate than stockbrokers,'' he has said. **********Mr. Bentsen has said he would be willing to look at the capital gains proposal if the wealthy individuals who would most benefit from a preferential rate could be made to pay taxes in some other way. But he has also raised questions about the Administration's contention that lowering the capital gains rate would bring the Treasury an additional $16.1 billion in revenues by 1993. **********''I would not look for any quick resolution to this controversy or for consideration of this proposal anytime soon,'' said Peter J. Davis, a tax policy specialist at Prudential Bache. ''However, President Bush's strong support and the tacit support of Lloyd Bentsen maintain long-shot odds for it.'' **********Another tax-related issue is leveraged buyouts of companies. Under current tax laws, interest paid on the money borrowed to finance a leveraged buyout is deductible. To discourage excessive borrowing and give corporations greater incentive to raise capital by issuing stock, lawmakers and the Administration have talked about restricting the interest deduction and also easing some of the taxation on corporate dividends. **********But neither Mr. Rostenkowski nor Mr. Bentsen are inclined to address the buyout issue through the tax code. ''If we do anything it will be minor,'' Mr. Bentsen has said. **********What remains then to put in a tax bill? There are a host of expiring tax provisions, which are the perennial core for tax legislation and often the vehicle for carrying unrelated tax amendments. ''If Rip Van Winkle had been a Washington tax lobbyist,'' Mr. Davis said, ''his first question upon awakening would have been, 'What tax provisions expire this year?'

Ford also said it would extend holiday shutdowns at most car and truck assembly plants in early January. **********The rebates are intended to protect Ford's share in the mini-van segment in the face of growing competition and Chrysler's recent move to lower prices on its small vans, which dominate that market. The longer factory shutdowns involve 11 of Ford's 16 car and truck assembly plants in the United States and were prompted by growing inventories of unsold vehicles. **********The General Motors Corporation had said last week that it would idle 22 car and truck plants for two weeks in early January. Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter, said Chrysler would shut six factories for part of January. A Chrysler spokesman confirmed some of the shutdowns but said the entire picture would not be clear for a few days. Analysts Predict Price War **********Ford's rebate is for $1,000 on its 1989 and 1990 Aerostar vans. Three days ago, Chrysler said it would extend incentives, amounting to $1,000, to its mini-vans for the first time. **********Some analysts said the rebates, taken together, mark the opening salvos of a price war that could last well into 1990. **********G.M. said it had not decided whether to jump into the mini-van wars, but analysts believe similar incentives for Chevrolet's Lumina APV are imminent, even though the sales prospects for that vehicle look bright. **********The Lumina APV and its Pontiac and Oldsmobile siblings have sold well since they were introduced in September, but production has lagged behind schedule, leading to some shortages at dealerships. **********''Chrysler hoped to steal a couple weeks of being the only one out there with incentives,'' said Ronald A. Glantz of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''The burning question had been how quickly General Motors and Ford could obtain television advertising to promote incentives of their own.'' **********He added: ''There is real panic in Detroit. Incentives are going to continue increasing all year.'' **********It is not clear whether the latest rebates will achieve the kind of sales spurt the auto makers hope for, particularly at year-end, when the holidays and cold weather tend to keep car buyers out of showrooms. **********Leon Mudry, general manager of Galeana Chrysler-Plymouth in Fort Myers, Fla., said customer traffic through his showroom had ''picked up some'' since rebates were announced on Friday, ''although it hasn't been as good as we'd expected.'' Lukewarm Reception **********News of the mini-van rebates drew a halfhearted response from some Ford dealers. **********''This will basically match what Chrysler is doing,'' said Craig A. Kapson, manager of Jordan Ford in Mishawaka, Ind. But he criticized Ford for not introducing a comprehensive program of simpler incentives. **********''I think it's time to make the incentive programs simple for dealers and consumers to understand,'' Mr. Kapson said. ''There are so many different offerings on cars and trucks, it's confusing.'' **********Another dealer was skeptical that the new incentives would help sales much. ''The one thing that's going to stimulate our business is if the prime rate comes down,'' said Bruton Smith, president and owner of Town and Country Ford in Charlotte, N.C. ''These incentives are not enough to bring the curtain back up.'' **********With inventories rising, the Big Three auto makers are searching for ways to spur sales. But incentives have proven expensive for the companies. Third-quarter earnings dropped sharply as a result of the rebates and the extension of low-interest-rate financing to more car buyers. Rebates Could Hurt Chrysler **********Analysts said the latest round of mini-van rebates would not have much effect on Ford's profits. But they said Chrysler, which depends heavily on mini-van sales, would be hurt. **********After Chrysler made its rebate announcement last week, Mr. Glantz lowered his estimate of the company's fourth-quarter earnings to 10 cents a share, from 45 cents, a drop of 78 percent. **********G.M., Ford and Chrysler are lengthening the traditional holiday shutdowns through mid-January at most assembly plants in an attempt to reduce their inventories in the face of sluggish sales. **********Ford's shutdowns will last one week longer than previously planned at assembly plants in Atlanta; Chicago; Louisville, Ky.; Wayne, Mich.; Norfolk, Va.; St. Louis, and the van production line at Lorain, Ohio. The shutdowns will be extended by two weeks in January at plants in Dearborn, Mich; Kansas City, Mo., and St. Paul, and the car-production line at Lorain, Ohio. **********Chrysler also plans shutdowns in early January at four of its five car assembly plants as well as its Dodge City truck plant in Warren, Mich., and its Jeep plant in Toledo, Ward's reported."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/13/business/cpa-group-repeals-rule.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C.P.A.

And they are worried that the plan for a single European Community market in 1992 could erode that status and send jobs to southern Europe, where labor is cheaper and less demanding. **********''The social and societal effects remain completely unexamined,'' Ernst Breit, chairman of the umbrella trade union organization Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund, said in a recent speech. ''I fear that the cost savings of 1992 also holds a lowering of social and environmental standards. **********''Will the completion of the integrated market lead to a worsening, a weakening or even a dismantling of rights and social protection? Will the conditions we have be reduced to some European average?'' **********West German unions, which are closely allied with the Social Democratic Party, have considerable political power. In addition, they have representatives on the boards of virtually all industrial companies. **********So far the unions have no plans to oppose the 1992 program. They are beginning a campaign to focus attention on the ''social consequences'' of the open market, calling for the establishment of minimum standards on wages, work rules and other working conditions. They have not made any specific proposals. **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been a leading proponent of the single market. Although he ended his tenure as European Community president last June by urging the 12 nations to consider the social aspects of 1992, including health benefits, safety guidelines and workers' living standards, no concrete action has followed. **********West German labor is also afraid that the ebb and flow of capital, goods and people in an open market will result in what it calls ''social dumping'' - meaning that manufacturing jobs will go to Spain, Portugal and Greece. And the bargaining positions of West German workers could be eroded by the arrival of less demanding workers from poorer nations in the community. **********Mathias Hinterscheidt, the secretary general of the European Trade Union Confederation in Brussels, said the German unions' concern about 1992 was shared by organized labor in other highly industrialized European nations like the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Denmark. **********But the concern is particularly acute in West Germany, were unions stand to lose the most. They adamantly oppose any concessions on wages, benefits or work rules, because any changes in Germany, with the strongest economy in the community, are likely to be precedents in the other countries, union officials said. **********Economists and analysts believe that some labor-intensive industries that are not easily adaptable to robotics are likely to leave. But they add that with its high productivity and deep pool of skilled labor, West Germany will remain a good location for automated plants and high-technology companies. The integrated market should improve the efficiency of German industry, they say. **********Despite the virtues of German labor, Japanese investment has been concentrated on production facilities in Spain and England. Edzard Reuter, the chairman of Daimler-Benz A.G., Germany's largest industrial concern, has said he would move production abroad if necessary. **********Volkswagen A.G., the largest West German auto maker, is already operating in Spain. It bought a majority stake in Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo S.A., known as SEAT, from the Spanish Government in June 1986. In 1987, SEAT posted its first profit in 11 years. About half of Volkswagen's Polo subcompact cars are produced at SEAT's Pamplona factory and the rest are built at Volkswagen's headquarters plant in Wolfsburg, West Germany. The only difference is the cost; a Polo can be produced in Pamplona for 800 Deutsche marks (about $435) less. **********The contrast between northern and southern Europe is not new, but it takes on added significance in the context of a unified marketplace. Workers in southern Europe work longer hours for lower pay than those in the north. In Portugal, the average industrial worker puts in 2,025 hours a year, compared with 1,716 hours in West Germany. **********The German worker earns an average of 32.67 Deutsch marks an hour (about $18) in wages and benefits, while his Portuguese counterpart receives less than one-sixth of that amount. Industrial workers in West Germany receive an average of 30 vacation days a year, the second-highest in the European Community, trailing only the 36.5 vacation days of Dutch workers. **********West German industry argues that current wage and benefit levels already put it at a cost disadvantage. **********''Industry's claims about costs, particularly the benefit and social costs, are thinly veiled propaganda against union labor,'' said Michael Geuenich, a board member of the umbrella trade union organization and one of West Germany's representatives on the community's Economic and Social Committee. ''Industry gets a well-educated, highly trained and very productive worker.'' **********''The underdeveloped regions of Europe, where companies and workers are currently at a disadvantage, will be brought closer to the level in the rest of Europe,'' he added. ''We are not going to allow our unions to be weakened as they have been in Britain and the United States.'' Counting on Solidarity **********Mr. Geuenich said West German labor leaders were also counting on solidarity among Europe's trade unions to even out national and regional differences. German and European trade union officials said unions in the community agreed last summer to study the implications of the single market on the union movement while also condemning the transfer of manufacturing jobs and calling for union solidarity. **********But others say solidarity seems unlikely in the competitive atmosphere expected to grow from 1992. **********''I'm very skeptical,'' said a board member of a large West German auto company. ''Unions in Belgium or Spain aren't prepared to refrain from accepting a new plant from a major auto company just to benefit their counterparts in West Germany. That is already clear. The national unions will take care of their own first.'' **********An economic expert for the Social Democratic Party agreed. ''The solidarity of Europe's labor unions is probably weaker than it was 15 years ago because of national differences in working conditions, pay and benefits.'' **********And Mr. Hinterscheidt of the European union confederation said some union officials in southern Europe were giving tacit support to the shifting of low-skill manufacturing to their countries, believing that it will create jobs and strengthen union influence. **********''This is a mistaken view,'' he said. ''What it will do is harm the course of industrial development and keep their members locked in low-paying jobs. We are not against increased competition, but we oppose suicidal competition.'' Distinctive German Aspects **********Compounding the anxiety of West German unions about the integrated market are several distinctively German features. One is Mitbestimmung, or co-determination, in which union representatives sit on the boards of large companies, giving workers a say in corporate decisions. **********''If German companies think the single market offers management a way to get around Mitbestimmung, they are wrong,'' said Mr. Geuenich of the national trade union group. ''It has proven to be a sound practice, and German workers see it as an inviolable right. It is something we will fight for.'' **********Still, labor leaders foresee a weakening of co-determination if German multinational companies move their headquarters out of West Germany or if community industries are not required to provide representation to workers. **********Another aspect of German trade unionism is its determination to continue pushing for a reduction of the workweek to 35 hours as a way to combat persistent unemployment. In February, 2.3 million people, or 8.9 percent of the work force, were unemployed. Despite relatively robust economic growth, the jobless rate has hovered around 9 percent for months. **********Shorter work time was the key issue in a bitter seven-week strike in 1984 by the metalworkers' union, which virtually shut down the auto industry. The strike ended with industry accepting a reduction of the workweek to 38.5 hours, from 40 hours. Opposing Work on Weekends **********The German unions are also fighting to maintain the traditional five-day workweek and prevent the introduction of third-shift production. But they appear to be bucking the trend. Last winter, the International Business Machines Corporation introduced weekend shifts in its computer chip plant near Stuttgart after threatening to move production to another country. Several other major companies have begun Saturday shifts in the last year. **********And some unions believe they need to show flexibility as 1992 approaches. The chemical workers' union IG Chemie, with 655,700 members, has said it is prepared to negotiate on Sunday shifts. **********''I would rather have companies invest their money in German jobs than in Spain or Greece,'' said Hermann Rappe, the chairman of the chemical workers union. **********West German labor leaders realize, however, that unions have lost influence because of the fierce competition of the global economy, particularly from eastern Asia, and a conservative political shift in many industrial countries. **********Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, who was formerly Finance Minister of France, said at a recent labor conference that the changing global economy makes change unavoidable for both the community and its unions. **********''I have to ask myself, if there was no European Community, if Spain and Portugal weren't members of the E.C., would it really change the problem?'' Mr. Delors said. ''If one explains to the workers that looking at the horizon of 1992 they must now renounce this or that, it isn't actually correct. But certain things must be revised because of the demands that the global economy places today.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-job-shuffle-at-industry-publications.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 606, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Job Shuffle At Industry Publications", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Job Shuffle At Industry Publications", "body_text": " **********AMID a general slowdown in media trade advertising, three of the ad industry's most important publishing companies exchanged top executives yesterday. **********Act III Publishing, the New York-based company founded by the producer Norman Lear, confirmed that it had hired David Persson and Lawrence Oliver, currently the vice president-publisher and associate publisher, respectively, of Advertising Age. **********Mr. Persson, 46 years old, will fill the new position of senior vice president and group publisher of Act III's media and television publishing groups, whose 11 properties include Channels and Marketing and Media Decisions magazines.

Pendleton Tudor, Adweek's chairman. **********Executives at the three companies said the appointments and reorganizations are aimed in part at addressing the tightening of the market for media trade advertising, primarily from magazines seeking to attract advertisers. **********As in retailing and manufacturing, mergers and acquisitions have saddled many communications companies with large debts to service, leading many of them to curtail spending on marketing and advertising. **********In addition, magazine publishers are still suffering from slow growth in advertising pages. Ad pages were up only 4.4 percent in the first half of 1989, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. Although ad revenues grew 12.4 percent, publishers have still not opened their own advertising spigots. **********Adweek's ad pages dropped 30 percent between 1985 and 1988, and Ad Age's pages declined 18 percent in the same period, according to Media Industry Newsletter. **********Ad Age dropped 9 percent during the first half of 1989, compared with the 1988 period, said Rance Crain, the magazine's president and editor-in-chief. **********But Mr. Crain and W.

In fact, Paul D. Schaeffer, Act III Publishing's president, said that Media and Marketing Decisions, a magazine that is largely dependent on magazine trade advertising, finished 1988 up 8 percent in ad pages. **********Mr. Schaeffer attributed the relative success of Marketing and Media Decisions, which has a circulation of 33,500, to the fact that it is aimed specifically at staff members and executives in ad agency and corporate media departments.

But these days, the job of the ''traveling salesman'' is undergoing some subtle but important changes. **********As information technology advances, as products get more complex and as competition intensifies, a new kind of sales force is emerging: men and women with more education - and with computers as well as toothbrushes in their briefcases. **********Many of their customers are not as responsive as they once were to patter and persistence. Instead, they are demanding more sophistication and knowledge from those who would sell to them. **********''A store manager today has reams of data to throw back at a salesman,'' said Dan Dunn, a business professor at Northeastern University. ''He can choose from a huge selection of products, and he has more people than ever to buy from.'' **********Resourceful salespeople must respond with information of their own. ''The use of information technology can help salespeople change from being volume-oriented to being profit-oriented,'' said Michael Hammer, a Boston-based management consultant. ''Given the right tools, the back-slapper can become more analytic.'' **********For this reason, says Mr. Hammmer, some of his clients are arming their salespeople with customized data. One oil company, he says, has passed out 150 laptop computers to their sales representatives so they can advise gas station owners about which lubricants, additives and gasolines are the most profitable for their individual stations. **********Salespeople are using the portable computers to strengthen relationships with customers in other ways, as well. **********James Chambers, director of sales operations for the Nabisco Biscuit Company, a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., suggests a typical scenario for a company that offers a variety of products. ''The store operator might say, 'O.K., you want me to buy the coffee that's on special, but what about that order of batteries we're expecting?' '' Mr. Chambers said. ''If the sales rep can communicate with the home office instantly, using his laptop computer, and find the status of the order, he might be able to sell his promotion or at least build the relationship so he can sell it the next time.'' **********To be sure, good relationships depend on more than data bases. Presenting genetically engineered pharmaceuticals to physicians requires someone with a broad scientific background. Selling artificial vision machines, used in measuring systems, involves an engineering graduate's grasp of industrial processes and industrial computers. **********Successful salespeople are also reading more annual reports, more business publications and more research from headquarters to project a more informed image.''Anytime a salesperson can say, 'I've studied your business' and can demonstrate understanding, customers respond to that more than to a longtime friendly relationship,'' said Kevin J. Corcoran, vice president of Learning International, a sales training company. **********But friendliness, a smooth presentation and a pleasing personality still count for something. And even today, a good salesperson must use shoe leather and telephones to generate contacts, though the telephone may have moved to the car and been joined there by a fax machine and a portable computer. **********Since many salespeople also face the same burnout and anxiety that have accompanied the job for years, the need to adapt to the new equipment - as well as the higher expectations from the home office - may be too much for some. **********The oil company that supplied its salespeople with the laptop computers, for example, estimates that only half its sales force will be able to adapt. Those who cannot will ultimately resign, accept reassignment in a more conventional selling job or perhaps be fired because they do not meet their sales goals. **********Below, profiles of three people who are surviving in the new world of sales.  Tyrone Howze: Cookies Fresh From a Computer **********On a recent Monday morning, Tyrone Howze, a Nabisco salesman who sells and stocks products in 35 grocery stores northwest of Detroit, surveyed the shelves of cookies stacked before him on Aisle 6 at Danny's, a supermarket in Southfield, Mich. A gold ring on his right hand marked Mr. Howze as one of Nabisco's top salesmen during a promotional period when Ritz crackers were ''on deal,'' in other words, on deep discount. **********Mr. Howze's hand flew over the keyboard of his hand-held computer, entering his order for 20-ounce packages of Oreo cookies, the company's biggest-selling product. Later, he plugged the computer into a phone and transmitted the information to Nabisco headquarters in Parsippany, N.J. ''One of our biggest complaints used to be paperwork,'' he said. **********But reducing paperwork is one of the computer's less important advantages, as far as Nabisco is concerned. Using Mr. Howze's data, Nabisco sales executives instantly determined exactly how many cookies were sold at Danny's the previous day. Using that and other data, they can trim or expand their stocks, which will either reduce inventory costs or permit exploitation of sales opportunities. **********The store manager keeps a close eye on inventories and sales, too. And when he presents information compiled from bar-code scanners that tells how Oreos have been selling, Mr. Howze can respond, using information from Nabisco headquarters that describes sales and profits for each Nabisco product as a function of how much space the products are allotted. **********By looking at the numbers that way, Mr. Howze may make an on-the-spot pitch for more space to sell cookies and crackers or for a special display near the cash register or other prized spots at the store. **********Showing a product's high profit per square foot of selling space is important. But the 41-year-old Mr. Howze has not forgotten that positive relationships are also vital - a trick of selling that transcends time. **********''The other salespeople come in once a week or once every two weeks, but Tyrone is here three or four times every week,'' said Dan Herbeck, Danny's store manager. ''He never puts any pressure on me like the others, and he seems to know exactly when to come over to talk so that it isn't an interruption.'' **********Mr. Howze makes a point of remembering who among the workers plays golf, who follows Detroit's hockey team, the Red Wings, and who went to the racetrack the previous Friday night. **********Partly as a result of Mr. Howze's overall approach, Danny's sells about 10 cases of Oreos to its customers for every case of a rival chocolate sandwich cookie. And Mr. Herbeck has given Mr. Howze the unusual privilege, in the case of many Nabisco brands, of ordering the number of cookies or crackers he thinks the store can sell profitably. **********Mr. Howze already knew the grocery business when he was hired by Nabisco 12 years ago. He was working as a grocery clerk, and the company salesman who recruited him was struck by his positive, outgoing personality. For Nabisco, it wasn't an unusual way to find a salesperson. **********Today, Mr. Howze probably would not be considered, because he does not have the college degree that became an informal requirement at Nabisco five years ago. (He does study marketing at night at a nearby college with the hope of someday becoming a sales manager). **********''A salesperson must come to us mentally equipped,'' said Phil Gutermuth, Nabisco's director of sales. In the past, ''relationship selling was the way it was done,'' he said. ''It's not that way anymore.'' **********Salespeople like Mr. Howze supply the right balance of style and substance. ''You don't want someone so academic he can't communicate with customers, nor do you want somebody who can't demonstrate analytical ability and business sense,'' Mr. Gutermuth said. ''A mix of the two characteristics is the ideal.''  Gary Johnson: Lasers And Cafeteria Lunches **********>Gary Johnson was selling industrial microcomputers in 1982, when he joined the Perceptron Corporation of Farmington Hills, Mich., to sell ''artificial vision'' to car makers. **********For decades, automobile factories purchased manual checking devices, costing from $100,000 to $1 million apiece, to check the fit of metal parts that are welded together into vehicle bodies. In the early 1980's, Perceptron developed a lower-cost alternative using lasers and cameras. A typical laser system today costs about $125,000, Mr. Johnson said. **********A mechanical engineer by profession, Mr. Johnson understood how automotive factories worked when he was hired by Perceptron, and he was able to understand the abstract concepts that defined artificial vision's potential role in an assembly line. **********He also knew the style of plant engineers - what goes and what doesn't. ''If you're going to sell in a factory, you also have to know how to present yourself,'' said Mr. Johnson, who is 44 years old. ''Your shoes have to be shined, but expensive suits and jewelry don't work.'' **********At first, Perceptron's artificial vision lasers were not too difficult to sell. Feeling the need to modernize because of overseas competition, the auto companies often bought expensive robots and artificial vision equipment impulsively, only to discover later that they did not deliver the desired efficiencies. **********As the companies became disenchanted over the following few years, Perceptron and several other artificial-vision and robot companies ran into financial problems. This convinced Perceptron to focus on customers that seemed likely to use the equipment successfully. ''We told some factories that it wasn't the most cost-efficient solution for them and not to buy,'' Mr. Johnson said. **********As part of his quest for companies who would use the lasers, Mr. Johnson searched for salespeople with overall technical knowledge of industrial processes. This meant an engineering degree. Perceptron then enrolled the engineers in various selling courses. (An experiment to train computer salesmen, who had no knowledge of factories, failed.) ''We particularly wanted people who were conceptual, who could understand a new tooling program and convince the factory engineers that our system was the best way to go,'' Mr. Johnson said. He and others on the sales force take the time to insure that a customer is qualified to use the systems as they prepare a presentation. **********A relatively small amount of time is spent making calls, Mr. Johnson says. But when a salesman visits a factory, arriving as early as 6:30 A.M.so as not to interfere with vehicle production, it's an important event. He may have to win approval from as many as 20 plant engineers, some of whom might lose their jobs if Perceptron's equipment does not work. **********There is little ritual or formality: meals with clients consist of a quick bite in the factory cafeteria. Golf games, once a prime venue for closing a sale, are mostly a thing of the past. ''In today's world,'' Mr. Johnson said, ''the glad hand and expensive lunches are going away.''  Kristin Haser: Paper Pacts From 'Cold Calls' **********Freedom, more than any other factor, attracted Kristin Haser, 24, to a career of selling the ultimate low-tech product: paper. **********''You have your own schedule,'' said Ms. Haser, who works for the Arnold Corporation in Pittsburgh. ''It's fun to be able to meet your boyfriend for lunch or go to the mall.'' **********A college graduate with a degree in marketing, Ms. Haser accepted the job initially as a way to make money before pursuing a graduate degree in business. She had enjoyed a previous job promoting Gatorade and thought that selling might be similar. **********Selling turned out to be lucrative, though it required few of the business skills she learned in college. She didn't need a computer or a portable phone, only the perseverance to make a ''cold call'' on businesses that might need paper supplies. **********Ms. Haser's friendly manner, self-generated motivation, and gritty hard work seem to be the main ingredients of her success in selling business forms. But now and again, she uses other strategies as well. **********''I'd be lying if I said I didn't flirt sometimes with a customer,'' she said. ''So what? A good-looking guy in my office is always being asked out by women he sells to. I'll have lunch or play tennis, but I don't go out to dinner with customers.'' **********On the job for 18 months, Ms. Haser can still call up the excitement of her first big sale: an order from North Side Deposit Bank for 100,000 driver-teller envelopes, which netted her a $200 commission. **********''I was so happy I ran back to the office and blurted it out to everybody,'' she said. Her earnings swiftly soared above the $22,000 annual starting salary she had been offered by another company. **********In her first 18 months on the job, Ms. Haser also discovered some grimmer aspects of selling: disappointment, rejection and anxiety. **********A few months ago, Ms. Haser learned that a hospital in Pittsburgh was putting its paper contract up for bid. It was an opportunity for a long-term contract worth perhaps $15,000 a year in commissions. **********''I thought I had it all sewed up,'' she said. ''Then this other company flew in six guys from out of town. They got it. I was depressed for a month.'' **********During the past year, Ms. Haser has noticed that she suffers from abdominal pains shortly before a big presentation. Her doctor diagnosed a pre-ulcerous condition in her abdomen. The report scared her, she says, but not enough to make her consider changing jobs. **********''I think about going back to school or doing something with less pressure, but it's hard to quit,'' she said. ''The longer you stay, the better you do. A couple of people in our office make over $100,000 a year.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/13/business/daimler-exports-questioned.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Daimler Exports Questioned", "print_headline": "Daimler Exports Questioned", "body_text": " **********The automobile giant Daimler-Benz sold trucks to the military in Pakistan without proper export permits, a news magazine reported Saturday. **********A spokesman for Daimler-Benz, Friedrich Losch, denied that export rules had been broken, saying the trucks were multiuse vehicles not specifically designed for military purposes. **********Der Spiegel magazine said Daimler-Benz had sold Pakistan 237 trucks and 30 tractor-trailers from November 1986 through November 1987. **********Der Spiegel said the shipments had not been inspected by customs officials because they were registered as civilian vehicles.

A few days later, Mr. Menem and his wife, Zulema, attended a concert by Mr. Piazzolla, who seemed emotionally touched and announced from the stage that he would stay ''with all my heart.'' **********Backstage after the performance, the Menems and Mr. Piazzolla and his wife drank champagne, the two men embraced, and each said he believed in the other. **********''Stay, Astor,'' Mr. Menem said before leaving. ''Stay, because we need you.'' The Dark Side of Peronism **********Such has been the style and the technique that Mr. Menem has used to win over an impressive number of prominent Argentines who had forecast the worst from the return to power of the political movement created by Juan D. Peron. **********In its often convulsed four decades of life, the Peronist movement, officially called the Justicialist Party, has come to mean unpleasant things to its critics and victims. Among them have been oppressive state power, Government giveaways, inefficiency, labor thuggery and rightist authoritarianism on the one hand and leftist guerrillas on the other. **********But Mr. Menem, facing a nearly bare treasury, soaring inflation, huge debts and a collapsed economy, has set out to win over the doubters with promises to do for Argentina and Peronism what President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is doing for the Soviet Union and Communism. **********Many of those who have got on the Menem bandwagon since the election share the opinion that Mr. Piazzolla expressed a few days after his meeting with Mr. Menem: that Argentina needs miracles and Mr. Menem is the only man with a chance to make them. Some Spectacular Conquests **********In trying to broaden his base of support, he has stepped on more than a few toes within his own party, angering some Peronists because of his policies and others because he gave to outsiders jobs that party members had wanted. **********He has also received a cold shoulder from members of the Radical Party of the departing President, Raul Alfonsin, whose candidate, Eduardo Angeloz, finished second in the May election. **********But Mr. Menem - whose once shoulder-length hair is getting shorter by the week and whose cheek whiskers are getting trimmer and his suits more conservative - has made some spectacular conquests, starting with the Alsogarays, father and daughter. **********Alvaro Alsogaray is the high priest of free-market economics in Argentina and leader of the Union of the Democratic Center, the third political force, which ran him for President. Maria Julia Alsogaray, one of the most visible women in politics in the country, gave up her seat in the lower house of Congress to run unsuccessfully for the Senate this year. **********After turning down Mr. Menem's offer to be Ambassador to Washington, Mr. Alsogaray agreed to be a special economics adviser to the new President. His daughter accepted the post of president of the telephone company, the state concern that almost all Argentines love to hate because they have a limitless supply of horror stories about trying to make phone calls. 'Love Is Blind' **********Ignoring the protests of the telephone unions, one of the sources of his electoral victory, Mr. Menem announced - with a smiling Ms. Alsogaray at his side - that the phone company would be privatized right away. **********The Menem-Alsogaray partnerships produced some gasps of disbelief. Pagina 12, a sassy tabloid whose politics reflects a hint of the Radical Party and a much larger hint of politics well to the left of the major parties, published a front-page photograph of Mr. Menem and Mr. Alsogaray under the headline, ''Love Is Blind.'' **********A week later, when Ms. Alsogaray's appointment was announced, Pagina 12's banner headline said, ''Father, Daughter and Holy Telephone,'' above a photo of her talking on the phone. **********A congresswoman from a small leftist party, Silvia Diaz, complained that the appointment was ''like assigning Herod to babysit.'' Ms. Alsogaray said the reference to the biblical tyrant who had some of his own children killed was ''amusing, and correct'' as far as the telephone company was concerned, but not the telephones themselves. **********By contrast to the disillusionment among some Menem supporters, a businessman who cast his votes for the full slate of the Alsogarays' party said he felt like someone who had voted for the winner. Other Appointments Cause Stir **********Other Menem appointments that have pleased, shocked or angered include that of another member of the Alsogarays' party, Alberto Albamonte, to be secretary of internal commerce; that of Octavio Frigerio, considered to favor a greater role for foreign oil companies in Argentina, to head the state oil company, and that of Javier Gonzalez Fraga, an economist who works as a consultant for foreign companies and banks, to head the Central Bank. **********But the seeming conversion that bemused just about everyone was that of Bernardo Neustadt, host of the most widely watched television interview program. **********In the months before the elections, Mr. Neustadt put great effort into trying to convince viewers of the dire consequences that would befall the country if Mr. Menem won. The votes had hardly been tallied, however, when Mr. Neustadt began to interview Mr. Menem and his entourage with regularity. In the eyes of many, the host was gushing with pleasure. **********Asked in an interview if he had become one of the ''sudden Menemistas,'' Mr. Neustadt said that he had not but that he did have ''a bit of hope.'' **********Ricardo Zinn, president of the Carlos Pellegrini Foundation, which shares the economic thinking of Mr. Neustadt and the non-Peronist appointees, issued a sobering warning that what he called ''these sudden loves'' might end in heartbreak. **********He said that they appeared to be based on the presumption the ''lover'' would be able to bend the ''loved one'' to his will and that, in romance, such expectations seldom worked out."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/business/supermarket-merger-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Supermarket Merger Deal", "print_headline": "Supermarket Merger Deal", "body_text": " **********The California State Attorney General, John Van de Kamp, announced an agreement today with American Stores to modify a court order blocking the merger of the Alpha Beta and Lucky grocery store chains while he pursues an antitrust challenge to the merger.

Got Big Refinancing", "body_text": " **********AFTER a 15-year absence from the public debt markets, the Tennessee Valley Authority will announce today that it plans to offer about $3 billion in bonds next week as the initial phase of a $6.7 billion refinancing, T.V.A. executives said yesterday. **********The move comes after a three-month struggle with the Treasury Department. The T.V.A., the nation's largest electric utility, has been raising money by borrowing from a Treasury division, the Federal Financing Bank, at an eighth of a percentage point above the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond. But the T.V.A.'s new chairman, Marvin Runyon, sought to refinance $6.7 billion of that high-coupon debt. Since the T.V.A. raised the money in the early 1980's, when rates were above 13 percent, the average rate is 12 1/4 percent. **********The agency will save up to $100 million in annual interest costs for 20 years if the debt is refinanced, said the T.V.A.'s chief financial officer, William F. Malec. Interest is the T.V.A.'s single largest expense, eating up 34 percent of revenues. **********''We've been trying to make ourselves into a model agency,'' Mr. Malec said, adding that the T.V.A. had already eliminated 11,000 jobs and cut $800 million in annual operating expenses. **********Unfortunately, when Mr. Runyon went to the Treasury, explaining that the plan would not cost the taxpayers a dime but could eventually save the T.V.A. hundreds of millions, the answer was no. **********''The lending guidelines of the F.F.B. specifically exclude people borrowing from both the private markets and the Federal Financing Bank,'' said Michael Basham, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Federal Finance. ''They could have borrowed more from the Treasury, but not to prepay existing loans prior to the call dates.'' **********Mr. Basham noted that, although the amount coming to the Treasury from the T.V.A. would not have changed because the agency would have prepaid all interest, the contract would have been altered, and that could not be allowed. **********''If we set a precedent with the T.V.A., other borrowers could ask for changes as well,'' he said. **********The T.V.A. did not accept this. ''It is a little mysterious to me,'' Mr. Runyon said, adding that when the T.V.A. asked the Treasury to lend it the money to refinance the debt, the request was denied. **********Mr. Malec said the Treasury, after recommending that the T.V.A. go to the public debt market, added one caveat: If the T.V.A. did so, it could no longer borrow from the Treasury. Considering how crucial short-term Treasury borrowing is to the T.V.A., that could have meant vastly higher costs in the long run if low-interest short-term money was no longer available. **********At that point, political pressure was brought to bear on Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and other officials. Members of Congress from the seven Southeastern states served by the T.V.A. began making calls and visits to Mr. Brady's office. Tennessee's two Senators, Albert Gore Jr. and Jim Sasser, both Democrats, wrote to Mr. Brady to make known their support for the T.V.A. plan. Mr. Sasser, as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, apparently wielded some influence because the Treasury soon announced it had struck a special deal with the T.V.A. **********Under the deal, the T.V.A. will be allowed to borrow from the Treasury for two years after it goes into the public markets, but only for short-term loans up to $2 billion. After two years, the T.V.A. will have to renegotiate the agreement, and the Treasury is under no obligation to renew it. **********The T.V.A. will not lose out because with the money it raises, it will set up a trust that under current rules will allow it to take the Treasury debt off its books. The trust involves an irrevocable pledge of the funds raised to service the debt to the Treasury, so that while the T.V.A.'s debt will be refinanced, from the Treasury point of view nothing will have changed. **********The refinancing is expected to consist primarily of 30-year bonds with a five-year call provision. The offering will be in several issues, and if interest rates remain stable, it should be completed in four to six months. **********For Wall Street's investment bankers, the re-emergence of the T.V.A. in the public markets is another big boon to the already strong government agency underwriting market. Mr. Malec estimates the T.V.A. will pay out about $50 million in banking fees if the entire refinancing goes through. Add to that the commissions the underwriters will get for selling $6.7 billion of triple-A bonds. The lead underwriter is First Boston, and the co-managers include Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers. The total underwriting syndicate for the deal will have some 70 firms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/16/business/business-forum-the-beecham-smithkline-merger-striving-to-become-a-global-no-2.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1989-04-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1748, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Striving to Become a Global No. 2", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM: THE BEECHAM-SMITHKLINE MERGER; Striving to Become a Global No. 2", "body_text": " **********Last week, after months of rumors, the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, based in Philadelphia, and the Beecham Group P.L.C., based in London, announced their intention to merge. If approved by their shareholders, the new company - to be called SmithKline Beecham - will be the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company after Merck & Company, and would have a research budget expected to exceed $500 million a year. Henry Wendt, the chairman of SmithKline Beckman and the designated chairman of SmithKline Beecham, spoke with the Business Forum editor Joel Kurtzman about how the merged companies will be managed.  Question: It not always easy to blend two different corporate cultures after a merger. In your case, you must also blend two different nationalities. How will you go about this?  Mr. Wendt: I don't think the binational factor will be difficult. We have many British executives and they have a number of Americans. The language is almost common. **********But merging corporate cultures is the greatest single challenge for creating a trans-national company. It is a major reason for going quickly to a simple, efficient management structure. We have to succeed in building a new company and a new corporate culture. We're going to spend a lot of time mixing people, working on management development and personnel development plans and seminars. We are going to have to take time to understand each other's history and traditions. It's a lot of work. **********We have faced it at SmithKline in other circumstances, but never on this scale. I take that challenge very seriously, and I see it as part of the role I will perform as chairman of the new company. I am going to assume responsibility for the new corporate identity. That is an unusual responsibility for a chairman.  Q. What specifically are you going to do to merge the cultures?  Mr. Wendt: We will start the new company after the shareholder vote with a new incentive system based upon stock options and phantom stock units. This will probably provide more incentives than is the norm for British companies. It will be rather close to the American model and will link management performance to the creation of value. **********We have learned some lessons from our acquisitions. Bob Bauman, Beecham's chairman, also has some pertinent experience. But we both agree that we can benefit from some outside assistance.  Q. How long will it take to fully integrate the two companies?  Mr. Wendt: I wish I knew. Full and complete integration will take, years. I'd say five years, to pick a number. To have people who identify themselves with SmithKline Beecham, as opposed to one company or the other never happens particularly quickly or easily. Integration of the businesses will go faster.  Q. This is the era of takeovers. Yet you and your counterpart at Beecham, Robert P. Bauman, decided upon a merger. Why a merger and not a takover?  Mr. Wendt: We believe that merging the two companies would create shareholder value as well as a number of efficiences without being dilutive. **********Bob and I found that we had a common view of the future and many shared strategic ideas about management. We also both believe that through a true merger we can create a very powerful combination.  Q. What are some of the similarities of the two companies?  Mr. Wendt: Both companies have emphasized the three components of the therapeutics thrust: ethical pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and animal health products. That is not characteristic of all companies in our industry. **********We also both operate our businesses on a worldwide basis and on a product line basis. These structural forms are similar. We also both think that to be truly competitive, we have to move into the top tier of companies. We felt it difficult to move into the top tier on our own. **********Finally, in the global market, the combination of a company with a strong position in Europe with another company - our company - with a strong position in North America, provides a geographic balance that is highly desirable. **********So we see the advantages and we see the opportunities and we see the fit.  Q. How do you know that the other managers in your two companies agree about the symmetries?  Mr. Wendt: Well it's fine for Bob and Henry to sit down and talk chairman to chairman. But what we both wanted to do was validate our view by bringing together a team of senior management from our pharmaceuticals divisions. **********We wanted them to build a business plan from the bottom up that would represent how these businesses would operate in combination and to see how they would perform.  Q. What kind of guidelines did you give to the management team?  Mr. Wendt: We didn't set any guidelines. We didn't want to say to the team that they had to achieve sales growth of X and profit growth of Y and a return on equity of Z. We only said we want the team to sit down, bring their data with them, try to understand each other's positions and develop a plan for the combined businesses. **********Our managers approached this exercise with open minds, complete honesty and, I must say, a measure of skepticism. Out of those meetings came a plan. As a result, the idea for the merger became more than Bob and Henry's vision. That was important for both of us to know and also important for our boards of directors to know.  Q. How will this merger work in terms of your two boards?  Mr. Wendt: We will constitute a new board of directors. It will be comprised of four outside directors from each company. We will also add five inside directors from each company - senior managers. The total number of directors will 18. **********This is a high ratio of insiders to outsiders by American standards but normal for Britain.  Q. In the past, both companies have been criticized for not having enough new products in the pipeline. With the combination will you be able to accelerate product development?  Mr. Wendt: There are compounds in the pipeline coming onto the market from both companies. There are four new compounds under review by the Food and Drug Administration - two from Beecham and two from SmithKline. The other new compounds under development by the two companies are split roughly 50-50 between them. **********The challenge for the new combination will be to examine the compounds that are under development and prioritize them in terms of research so that we put our resources where we can get the best return for our shareholders.  Q. How will the research activities of the two companies be managed?  Mr. Wendt: We have no plans to reduce research. We talked about rationalizations but that does not apply to research or to development. **********The trick will be to use these resources as efficiently as possible. We will maintain a significant reseach presence in both Britain and the United States. **********That's one of the real advantages of this company. You might remember that the discoveries that led to our Tagamet brand occurred in Britain at the SmithKline French Research Insitute. **********So we see it as a great plus to have significant research activities going on in both countries. We will also be managing a blended product development organization with worldwide responsiblity. **********These are our views coming into the combination. At this stage of the game we haven't had time to organized a new research and development division. **********Let me say, we have to approach this with great care. R. & D. is delicate and is vital to our future. We won't do anything to rock our R. & D.  Q. When the new combination is formed, will you expand your activities in Japan?  Mr. Wendt: Our Contac brand is on the market in Japan and is doing very well. We are one of the few international pharmaceutical companies with both an ethical and an over-the-counter presence in Japan. **********We want to build both of these markets and our objective there too is to get into the top tier in Japan as we already are in North America and Europe. Research in Japan is also in our future, but we have no plans to do it there yet.  Q. Will you get any added efficiencies from blending the two sales forces?  Mr. Wendt: Every sales person develops a relationship with his customers based on the strength of the products. SmithKline has an excellent position in gastro intestinal medicine and cardiovascular medicine. Beecham's position is excellent in infectious diseases. **********This means that the Beecham sales force can take Engerix-B, our new recombinant DNA compound, to the major infectious disease hospitals in Britain, the United States and around the world. They have a relationship with those hospitals that in many respects is superior to that of our own sales staff. **********At the same time, SmithKline has been promoting Ridaura, for rheumatoid arthritis for several years now. That means that when Relifex, the Beecham non-steroid anti-inflamatory comes onto the market, it will be the perfect product to be promoted by our sales force in combination with Ridaura. **********Also, our sales force in the United States is larger than Beecham's and has a great presence with family practitioners and internists. Beecham, for efficiency reasons, has concentrated its smaller sales force in the United States on hospitals.

Yacos of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H., in his order, showed considerable irritation with Public Service. **********Frustrated by its inability to open the Seabrook nuclear plant, of which it is the principal owner, Public Service filed for bankruptcy in January 1988, becoming the first investor-owned utility to enter bankruptcy in 50 years. **********Since then, Public Service and the State of New Hampshire have been negotiating what electric rates will be in coming years. Those rates are the main determinant of the value of the bankrupt company. **********Public Service has spent more than $2 billion on its 35.6 percent share of the Seabrook nuclear plant. It has been unable to pass that cost on to customers because a New Hampshire law bars utilities from charging their customers for investments in plants that are not in service. **********But the plant has been blocked from winning an operating license because of an assertion by Massachusetts that in an emergency the area within 10 miles could not be evacuated. Six Massachusetts towns lie within 10 miles of the plant. **********The Nuclear Regulatory Commission hopes to resolve the issue by September, but legal challenges could drag on for years. **********In his order yesterday, Judge Yacos said of Public Service, ''I cannot find that the debtor during that period engaged in any hard bargaining in any relevant sense,'' referring to the time since the bankruptcy filing. **********The judge's order gives Public Service only 60 more days from last Thursday to lead the reorganization discussions with the other interested parties, which include creditors, stockholders and state officials. **********The other parties will be allowed to submit reorganization plans that will be considered after the 60 days. Examiner to Be Appointed **********The judge said he would appoint an examiner to work with the parties and advise him on technical questions. He also set up a procedure for future filings that gives him major influence over which reorganization plans will be considered. The judge said that other parties can file reorganization plans but that he would control the approval of disclosure statements. Disclosure statements are akin to prospectuses, without which reorganization plans connot be confirmed. **********Wilbur Ross, an adviser to the equity committee and a managing director of Rothschild Inc., said the judge had effectively put himself in charge of the negotiation process, replacing Public Service.

Extension Was Sought **********Public Service had sought to extend its exclusivity period, arguing that it would take far longer to reach a settlement with proposals by the other parties in the bankruptcy, including various categories of creditors and the State of New Hampshire. **********But the judge said yesterday that extending exclusivity ''would only result in the parties continuing to argue in circles endlessly.'' **********One party welcoming the order was Northeast Utilities, a Connecticut and Massachusetts electric company based in Berlin, Conn., that has made a bid for Public Service. The bid can now be made directly to the bankruptcy court. **********A second bid was received by Public Service last week, from the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative Inc., to buy Public Service's northern division, for $130 million.

Mr. Peres is Deputy Prime Minster too, and though that is largely a ceremonial title, in January his aides said he would use the position to set up a shadow foreign policy group so he could remain a player in the peace process, the most important arena to him. **********He promised to give Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Likud party leader, a sporting chance to come up with a peace plan, then step in with his own proposal, after what the Labor Party saw as Mr. Shamir's inevitable failure. Whose Idea?  But now friends and opponents alike say he often looks listless and deflated as he watches Mr. Shamir take over the public role of Israel's peacemaker by running with a plan for Palestinian elections, an idea Mr. Peres himself first suggested six months ago. **********All of it ''is very difficult for me,'' he said in an interview. **********In March, Mr. Peres vowed to present his own peace plan just as soon as Mr. Shamir got back from Washington, where he presented his ideas to President Bush last month. But now several weeks have passed, and Mr. Peres has said hardly a word. **********He is caught in a seemingly unbreakable political box, and it is partly a creation of the United States Government. **********Mr. Peres says he has his own ideas for ending the Palestinian uprising and reaching a peaceful settlement with the residents of the West Bank and Gaza. Elections would certainly be a part of his plan, he said, but there would be more, too. He will not say what. He cannot, and his reasoning is straightforward. 'Give It a Try' **********''Washington decided to try this idea of elections,'' he said with a shrug. ''Elections are not really a plan. But let's give it a try. Elections may sell as a means for starting a dialogue.'' **********Mr. Peres acknowledges that he cannot afford to be seen as a spoiler. As long as the election idea holds even a breath of life - and Mr. Peres says he believes the plan cannot die, so long as Washington continues supporting it - Mr. Peres knows he would lose standing both at home and abroad by trying to offer a competing plan of his own. **********So, trying to make the best of it, he and his aides are informally starting to describe Mr. Shamir's election idea as the Shamir-Peres idea. **********Mr. Peres quickly points out that in an Op-Ed page essay he wrote for The New York Times in December, he offered his proposals for settling the conflict, including ''free and secret political elections for the West Bank and Gaza, to be conducted in an atmosphere of tranquillity and - on our part - total noninterference.'' In fact, the Labor Party included Palestinian elections as a formal part of its campaign platform last October, just before the national elections. Sounding the Same **********Still, when Mr. Peres describes what he thinks ought to occur now -the Camp David model for open elections, a five-year period of interim self-rule and negotiations over the final status of the territories - he sounds just like Yitzhak Shamir. ''That's not a crime,'' he snapped. What happens if the election plan succeeds, and under Mr. Shamir's name Israel begins to resolve the problem? **********Mr. Peres smiled and said, ''Well then we shall have peace, and if that is at a cost of support for the Labor Party, well, I'm ready to take the risk.'' **********If Mr. Shamir's initiative fails, he added, ''then we shall have to try our hand very hard for a breakthrough.'' **********Already the Labor Party is at its lowest point in Israel's history. Only 25 percent of Israelis now say they identify with Labor, while 34 say they identify with Likud. Likud on the March **********This year, for the first time, Likud won a sweeping series of victories in nationwide municipal elections. And last month, after a party convention called to discuss Labor's recent election losses, Mr. Peres left relieved and gratified that there had been no major effort to depose him, as many had predicted before hand. **********Mr. Peres spent most of last year sniping at almost everything Mr. Shamir did, and Mr. Shamir sniped right back. Today, not wanting to be blamed if the new ''national unity'' Government stops working, Mr. Peres does not volunteer criticism of Mr. Shamir or take the bait, even when offered. **********In fact, in the last several days he has been a public defender of Mr. Shamir's initiative. **********Last week more than 80 leading West Bank Palestinians formally rejected Mr. Shamir's proposal, saying Israel should recognize that the Palestine Liberation Organization is their only true representative. A Philosophical Peres **********''I hope this isn't their last word,'' Mr. Shamir shot back at them. ''If they think they'll be able to achieve something better, they're not doing anything but making a mistake.'' **********In the interview, Mr. Peres said essentially the same thing. **********''If the Palestinians reject this,'' he said, ''I think they will be making a mistake because I don't know how else we can proceed.'' **********In the end, Mr. Peres says he is philosophical about his present state. **********''Maybe Shamir has gained, and some in my party already think it's the end of the world,'' he said.

I really don't think so.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/02/business/stock-rally-spurs-new-offerings.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1989-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1273, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stock Rally Spurs New Offerings", "print_headline": "Stock Rally Spurs New Offerings", "body_text": " **********Taking advantage of the recent market rally, a growing number of companies are making initial or follow-up offerings of stock. Though the activity does not come close to the frenzy of several years ago, investment bankers say the markets are as receptive to new offerings as they have been at any time since the crash of October 1987. **********''It's the strongest deal market in two years,'' said Dan Case, head of investment banking for Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment firm that specializes in taking companies public. **********That news is especially welcome for young technology companies, for which the initial public offering is a crucial part of the cycle that encourages entrepreneurialism and innovation. Going public gives a company cash to spend on growth and research and rewards its employees and venture capital investors. **********Take the case of the Genus Corporation, a maker of equipment used in producing silicon chips, which made its initial public offering in November, when the market was not receptive. Genus, which had hoped to sell stock for at least $8 a share, had to cut the price to $5 and sold two million shares, raising $10 million. **********Last week, the Mountain View, Calif., company went back to the market, selling 4.8 million shares at $12.50 each, raising $60 million. **********But the rush to go public also poses a danger that investors could get burned by a newly public company that runs into problems, which is what happened after a frenzy of technology offerings in 1983. While the offerings market is far less feverish now, analysts see signs that companies that might not be quite ready to go public are taking advantage of the current climate to make offerings at inflated prices. **********Some executives argue that exceptional new companies can go public virtually any time, but weak ones can do so only during a boom. **********''This is a caveat emptor situation,'' said Roger B. McNamee, co-manager of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, a mutual fund that invests in emerging growth companies. Mr. McNamee, whose fund has invested in some new offerings but has shunned others, added, ''We're already seeing some real cheesy merchandise.'' **********In addition to the buoyant stock market, the resurgence in offerings is being helped by the fact that some institutional investors have plenty of cash on hand and are looking for new places to invest. **********The number of new offerings, and also of secondary offerings, is still well below the pace of 1983 and even below that of 1986 and 1987 before the stock market crash, but the rebound has been substantial. **********Moreover, investment bankers say, there is pent-up demand by companies that have not been able to go public at favorable prices since the crash in October 1987. ''There's a whole backlog of inventory,'' said Shelley Floyd, an investment banker specializing in technology at Salomon Brothers' San Francisco office. **********No one knows how strong the market for new issues will be and how long it will last. In the middle of 1988, the market for offerings seemed to be recovering from the crash, only to collapse again in the fall. Recession Worries **********Also, current enthusiasm is tempered somewhat by recession fears. And in the technology sector, several well-known companies reported disappointing earnings, and a nervous market battered their stocks. **********Still, investment bankers point to the reception in the market. ''The number of deals is still modest, but the receptivity of the marketplace has been very strong,'' said Joseph M. Schell, director of corporate finance at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. Of 11 initial offerings in emerging growth sectors this year, he said, 10 have risen in price since the offering. **********Staples Inc., a Newton, Mass., company that sells office supplies through warehouse discount stores, went public at $19 a share, higher than the expected offering price of $15 to $18. Since its April 27 offering, the stock has risen to $23.50. **********Duty Free International, a Ridgefield, Conn., company that has shops at airports and on the Canadian border, went public this month at $20.50 a share, also higher than its expected offering price. Its stock has since risen to $27.50. **********With such a reception, investment bankers say, many companies might seek to go public soon, especially since there is a fear that a recession might close the window. **********In high technology, the public offering is part of a process that has long fueled innovation. Venture capitalists invest in start-up companies, and the employees, who often work long hours to help the company get started, accept stock as a big part of their compensation. The stock realizes its value when the company goes public. **********''As part of that compensation strategy you have to have a strong effort to make that equity have liquid value,'' said Gordon E. Eubanks Jr., president and chief executive of the Symantec Corporation, a Cupertino, Calif., software company that recently filed to go public. All 250 Symantec workers have received at least a little stock, and some employees will become millionaires if the offering goes as planned. **********Venture capitalists invest in new companies they hope to take public several years later, so the state of the offering market at any given time does not have a direct effect on investments in start-ups, venture capitalists say. Still, if the spigot for initial public offerings is turned off for a long time, the backup will eventually go all the way to the reservoir, and less money can flow into start-ups. Some Had to Retrench **********Since the market crash, some companies, unable to raise money for research and growth, have had to cut back on research projects, merge with other companies or license technology away. Venture capitalists have had to provide more money to keep established companies going, instead of starting new ones. **********Analysts expect these technology stars to go public this year: MIPS Computer Systems, which makes computers based on a powerful microprocessor of its own design; Sybase, a fast-growing vendor of data-base software; Claris, the software subsidiary of Apple Computer, which is expected to become an independent company, and Electronic Arts, the leading provider of game software for home computers. **********The worry is that many less sterling companies will also try to raise money. Investment bankers recall the frenzy of public offerings in 1983. While some of those companies became stars, like Lotus Development and Compaq Computer, many others, like Victor Technologies, Trilogy and Eagle Computer, quickly failed. **********Indeed, many of the stocks collapsed in 1985, when the computer industry's growth slowed and it turned out there were too many nearly identical companies fighting for a limited market. A Sour Taste **********Indeed, stocks of two out of three computer-related companies that went public from 1983 through 1988 are trading below their offering prices, and three out of four have performed worse than the Standard & Poor's 500, according to Technologic Partners, a computer newsletter publisher in New York. The experience, especially from the class of 1983, still leaves some institutional investors with a sour taste for technology."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/03/business/wall-street-outlook-american-exchange-has-strong-4th-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1989-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 649, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "American Exchange Has Strong 4th Quarter", "print_headline": "WALL STREET OUTLOOK; American Exchange Has Strong 4th Quarter", "body_text": " **********In choosing among America's three stock arenas, investors would have fared most successfully last year if they had placed their bets on the American Stock Exchange. **********Outpacing the performance of the larger-capitalized issues on the New York Stock Exchange and the smaller issues on the over-the-counter market, the market-value index of the American Stock Exchange rose by 17.5 percent. **********The Amex's best performance came in the late months of 1988, primarily because of stronger oil prices.

Testimony of Accuser Heard **********Throughout the morning, many members of the subcommittee virtually ignored the allegations against Mr. Gibbons, focusing instead on the chief witness against him, William Bertain. **********Mr. Bertain testified that Mr. Gibbons, whom he has known for three years, represented four times that he was working for the subcommittee. **********The Congressmen repeatedly asked Mr. Bertain about the legal and ethical implications of his having secretly recorded his conversation with Mr. Gibbons. Under California law, recording a conversation without the knowledge of both parties is illegal. **********Mr. Bertain responded that he had been authorized to make the recording by J. Brian McTigue, a subcommittee staff member, and that he therefore did not believe he had violated any legal or ethical rules. **********''I thought I was being requested and authorized'' to tape the conversation, Mr. Bertain said. ''I felt that I was protected under the authority of the House of Representatives.'' **********In the recording, which was played at the hearing, Mr. Gibbons said that a staff member he knew had asked him in the summer to ''confirm some trades,'' which he was unable to do. On the tape, Mr. Gibbons could not name the staff member when he was asked who it was. Response on Panel Role **********When asked specifically by Mr. Bertain if he was working for the subcommittee, Mr. Gibbons said, ''Well, not directly.'' This indicated that next week Mr. Gibbons would have to identify the staff member who he said had called him. **********Jules Kroll, head of the investigative firm bearing his name, said Mr. Gibbons did not misrepresent himself. **********Steven R. Rosen, general counsel to the clerk of the House of Representatives, said in a written opinion that Mr. Bertain was working as an ''unpaid agent'' of the subcommitee and therefore was not restricted by California law. **********But some members of the subcommittee were said to have voiced discomfort about the legal opinion, saying that it might not withstand legal scrutiny. Moreover, a number of state prosecutors in California, interviewed today, said they did not believe that a Congressional staff member could offer immunity against the California law on secret recordings. **********The California law states that it is illegal for an individual ''acting on or purporting to act on behalf of any Government or subdivision thereof'' to make such secret recordings. When asked by a reporter if Mr. Dingell had authorized the secret recording, Mr. McTigue said he would have to call back with the answer.

The company said earnings per share rose only 12.3 percent because the exercise of warrants increased the number of shares outstanding to 18.07 million from 16.94 million. **********The company's revenues dropped 6.3 percent, to $1.32 billion in the recent quarter from $1.41 billion in the period a year earlier. The decline reflected continued softness in national advertising revenues at many of the company's operations. 'Mildly Disappointing' **********The company said operating profits for its broadcasting operations rose 14 percent. The television network posted a slight loss, but the television stations and ESPN, the cable sports programming service, recorded increases. **********Edward Atorino, a media analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said: ''The quarter was mildly disappointing. Overall earnings were up, but all of the swing came in lower interest expense and higher interest income and a better tax rate. The operating numbers were a little below expectations.'' **********He added: ''Broadcast performance was disappointing due to high costs of 'War and Remembrance' and Presidential election coverage. The TV stations did O.K., but nothing to get excited about. And the publishing group was off 12 percent due to weak advertising in such publications as Institutional Investor and Women's Wear Daily.'' **********Mr. Atorino continued: ''The company received over $1 billion in cash from the exercise of warrants last July, and the investment of that cash generated significant cash and interest income of $22 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $5 million last year.''

The company said these accounting changes helped per-share earnings by $6.60 in 1988 and by $3.85 in 1987. **********On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Capital Cities/ABC stock dropped $3, to $373.50."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/22/world/fighting-in-panama-noriega-attempt-at-prosecution-would-face-obstacles.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Berke", "pub_date": "1989-12-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 961, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fighting in Panama: Noriega; Attempt at Prosecution Would Face Obstacles", "print_headline": "Fighting in Panama: Noriega; Attempt at Prosecution Would Face Obstacles", "body_text": " **********The Government's case against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is fraught with legal obstacles stemming from his past associations with United States intelligence operatives and President Bush. **********Even if the Panamanian military leader is captured and brought to trial in Florida, where he faces two indictments on narcotics-trafficking charges, a trial would likely be delayed for months or even years because of wrangling over the release of relevant United States intelligence documents, current and former law-enforcement officials and legal experts said in interviews. **********Neal R. Sonnett, one of General Noriega's lawyers, said today that he or his associates would seek to force the Government to turn over documents showing his client's long relationship with United States intelligence officials. This material could be embarrassing to the Government, or even to President Bush, who first crossed paths with General Noriega when Mr. Bush served as Director of Central Intelligence from 1976 to 1977. **********Mr. Bush's first personal meeting with General Noriega occurred sometime in 1976. The two also met in Panama City in 1983 when Mr. Bush was Vice President. Also at that meeting was Panama's President, Ricardo de la Espriella, who denied allegations that some Panamanian officials were involved in money laundering. **********Richard D. Gregorie, the former lead prosecutor in the case, who is now in private practice in Miami, conceded that the debate over intelligence data ''is going to complicate the case substantially.'' He said that in seeking information in their dealings with General Noriega, American intelligence officials may have ''sort of closed their eyes'' to his possible involvement with drug traffickers. Noriega May Have Documents **********Referring to documents that General Noriega may have regarding United States officials, Mr. Gregorie added, ''Lord knows what kind of damaging material he may have had in his possession.'' **********Another official familiar with the case said he was concerned that the prosecutors had not seen what was in the intelligence files and thus could only speculate about documents that could harm their case. **********Beyond those complications, other Federal law enforcement officials, who asked not to be named, said they were concerned that the prosecution's case was weak because the indictments were based largely on testimony and not on intensive investigations using electronic surveillance, which is more common in major drug cases. **********But the chief Justice Department spokesman, David Runkel, insisted today that the agency officials still believed they had a solid case and made such a conclusion after a full review of the two indictments against General Noriega in a meeting here on Friday. **********He said Mark M. Richard, a deputy assistant attorney general in the department's criminal division, convened the meeting, which included officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Customs Service, as well as the United States Attorneys from Miami and Tampa, where the indictments against General Noriega were returned in February 1988. **********''The Justice Department's judgment is that there is sufficient evidence to make this a winnable case,'' Mr. Runkel said. Withholding of Information **********While Mr. Runkel expressed confidence in the Government's case, legal experts said they were concerned that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh could determine that some classified information sought by the defense would be too sensitive to disclose. Earlier this month, a Federal district judge dismissed charges against Joseph F. Fernandez, a former station chief in Costa Rica for the Central Intelligence Agency, after Mr. Thornburgh prohibited disclosure of classified material in the case. **********The information sought by General Noriega's lawyers could be damaging to the United States Government. For several years, high American officials maintained a close relationship the Panamanian leader - and may well have been aware of some of his drug-trafficking activities - because they believed that his cooperation was more important than the possible harm he was causing. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Bush had access to intelligence reports on the general's suspected activities. **********From the start, the Noriega indictments set off great diplomatic debate, with prosecutors accusing the Government of conducting ''diplomacy by indictment.'' **********In recent months, in fact, there were feelers between representatives of General Noriega and the United States, presumably about dropping the case, a State Department chronology made public today indicates. **********The chronology said that General Noriega's lawyers sought a meeting with the State Department in October. At the session, the chronology said, United States officials ''request a specific proposal'' and General Noriega's lawyer ''undertakes to consult with Noriega and return with a proposal within a week.'' Last month, the United States Government was advised by a ''Noriega representative'' that he had ''been unsuccessful in obtaining any flexibility from Noriega and is under instructions not to speak to the U.S.'' **********Conceivably, the contacts were over a possible plea bargain or a plan in which the United States would pledge not to extradite General Noriega if he took refuge in a third country. **********The Justice Depatment was so eager to gather information on General Noriega's whereabouts today that Mr. Runkel announced that people interested in collecting the $1 million reward for information leading to the Panamanian's capture could call the D.E.A. headquarters at (202) 633-1000. **********But even United States District Judge William M. Hoeveler, who is handling the Noriega case, said it was premature to talk about a trial because the defendant was still not in United States custody. **********''If he gets here he gets here,'' Judge Hoeveler said, ''and we'll handle it from that point on.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/22/world/voices-party-faithful-searching-for-path-new-era-openness-about-cynicism.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 528, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series; Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OPENNESS ABOUT CYNICISM: ANONYMOUS, POET, CHINA", "print_headline": "VOICES OF THE PARTY FAITHFUL: SEARCHING FOR A PATH IN A NEW ERA; OPENNESS ABOUT CYNICISM: ANONYMOUS, POET, CHINA", "body_text": " **********A poet and assistant professor from Shanghai, he agreed to speak candidly only if his name was not used.

A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********The Bank Rate Monitor's weekly survey of the New York area showed commercial bank yields down sharply, compared with the drop at savings institutions. At commercial banks, a money market account fell by 4 basis points, to 6.73 percent, while three-month certificates fell by 6 basis points, to 7.94 percent. Six-month C.D. yields declined by 8 basis points, to 7.92 percent. **********An average money market account yield offered at savings institutions fell by a basis point, to 6.66 percent, while a three-month C.D. declined by 3 basis points, to 8.37 percent, and six-month certificates remained unchanged at 8.29 percent. Drop at 20 Large Banks **********Among 20 large banks nationwide, the average yield for money market accounts fell by 2 basis points, to 6.51 percent, with the average yield for six-month C.D.'s down by 6 basis points, to 7.98 percent. **********The sharply lower yields at the New York commercial banks have continued to widen the yield gap to the advantage of the savings institutions, which are not as aggressive in lowering yields. **********Yields offered on deposits at large credit unions were down, with money market accounts and six-month certificates down by a basis point, to 6.84 percent and 8.28 percent, respectively, while one-year and two-and-a-half-year C.D.'s remained at 8.33 percent and 8.37 percent, respectively. For the longer five-year maturity, the yield was down by a basis point, to 8.36 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/27/business/foreign-aid-for-manila.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foreign Aid for Manila", "print_headline": "Foreign Aid for Manila", "body_text": " **********Foreign governments have committed $2 billion to a five-year Philippine aid plan intended to help the economy recover, Roberto Villanueva, chairman of the aid program coordinating council, said last week.

While extolling the risk-taking investor symbolized by the bull, the commercials close with the slogan the company introduced last year, ''A tradition of trust.'' **********The underpinning of the campaign was revealed in a handwritten statement written and read by Bozell's chief executive, Charles D. (Chuck) Peebler Jr., in an early-morning interview two days after Christmas. **********Mr. Peebler went on for many minutes about how ''Merrill Lynch believes in the American spirit,'' which he said was exemplified by the country's 138 million telephones, $25 billion in annual charitable giving, 47 electrical appliances in the average American home and mere 18 minutes it takes the average American to earn enough money to purchase a pound of hamburger. ''Sometimes,'' Mr. Peebler said, ''the positives don't get accentuated the way they should.'' **********Fortunately, such dryly statistical positives are not accentuated in Bozell's new ads for Merrill Lynch. Instead, the commercials are a showcase for the creative reformation that Jay Schulberg promised to instigate when he left Ogilvy & Mather last year and became creative director of Bozell, New York. **********The three dramatic spots are visually surprising panoramas that use much of the technical trickery familiar from the plethora of MTV-influenced ads on the air. But they use the technology in soft and inspiring, rather than harsh and jarring, ways. **********''We wanted to be future-oriented without looking too high tech,'' said Paul Critchlow, Merrill Lynch's director of corporate communications. **********In ''Skies,'' for example, a bull marches silently across a plain, while in the sky above him a century's worth of images glide by, from biplanes and doughboys to Iwo Jima and Yalta to Solidarity and the space shuttle. **********''The point of that commercial is the role Merrill plays in understanding and interpreting events for its customers,'' said Charles Mangano, the company's director of corporate advertising. **********Interestingly, the other two commercials, ''Bullseye'' and ''Glass Hallway,'' also use sky imagery. **********In the first, which addresses the importance of family savings to America's economic competitiveness, the camera pulls back from a simple slice of life - a mother sending her child off to school - to present the scene in an ever-wider context, showing in turns aerial views of their block, neighborhood, town, state, nation and planet. In the end the globe turns out to be a reflection in a bull's eye. **********''Glass Hallway'' opens on an office corridor, transparent except for an endless series of doors, and suspended in midair. As the announcer talks about the future's ''limitless possibilities,'' the camera goes through the doors, skimming through a toxic-waste dump and an old-age home, then to more uplifting scenes of a robotics factory and active senior citizens. Here, the bull is a subtle presence, reflected in the grain of a desk. **********''Creatively, the point is to break out of the sameness in the financial services category,'' Mr. Schulberg said. ''Everyone is saying, 'Let us manage your money.' No one until now is saying it in a distinctive way.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/13/business/the-media-business-advertising-questions-raised-on-product-placements.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas McGill", "pub_date": "1989-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 769, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Questions Raised on 'Product Placements'", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS ADVERTISING; Questions Raised on 'Product Placements'", "body_text": " **********IS it advertising when a consumer-products company pays to have its product prominently displayed in a movie? **********Some critics of the practice say yes, and have asked the Government to regulate it under the laws and rules that apply to advertising. **********On March 29, the Center for Science in the Public Interest asked the Federal Communications Commission and the attorneys general in each state to require that the use of paid ''product placements'' in movies be disclosed in the credits. Without such disclosure, the center asserted, product placements in the movies should be removed. **********Already, the F.C.C. requires television programs to make a disclosure - usually in an announcement -when a company has paid to have its product used in a show. But in 1963, movies shown on television were exempted from the rule. The Center for Science in the Public Interest now asks that the exemption be rescinded. **********The consumer group requests that the state attorneys general investigate whether paid product placements in movies that are shown in theaters violate state consumer protection laws. **********A week before the group made its request, Representative Thomas A. Luken, Democrat of Ohio, asked the Justice Department to determine whether the Philip Morris and Liggett cigarette companies, by paying to have their products appear in the movies ''Superman II'' and ''Supergirl,'' broke the 1971 Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, prohibiting cigarette advertising on television. Both films were ''reportedly shown on television,'' Mr. Luken said in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. **********While consumer products have appeared in movies for decades, in recent years an entire industry has formed to service companies that want their products displayed in films. More than a dozen ''product placement'' companies exist. **********Associated Film Promotions, a leading product-placement company, seems to speak to the legal challenge when it says in a sales brochure, ''These ever-so-subtle endorsements may be viewed as editorial comments as opposed to paid advertising.'' **********But Charles Mitchell, a lawyer for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is based in Washington, said: ''It's an insidious form of advertising. It hits the consumer when he doesn't expect it, when he doesn't have his guard up. But advertisement should not masquerade as entertainment. People have a right to know when a message has been paid for, and who's trying to persuade them.'' **********In most cases, product-placement executives say, consumer products companies do not pay a movie producer to use their product. Rather, the companies pay an annual fee to a product-placement company, which promises to place the product in a certain number of films a year. **********The Entertainment Marketing Group, a product-placement concern in New York, takes a relatively small annual fee and then bills the client, depending on the degree of exposure its product receives. **********On the low end, the company receives $2,500 for a product that is shown in the background of a scene; it gets $18,000 for ''hands on use'' of the product, together with a ''verbal mention.'' In the movie ''Wall Street,'' Entertainment Marketing scored big for one of its clients in a bar scene where the actor Martin Sheen yells out to a bartender, ''Get this kid a Molson Light!'' **********Richard Gore, the president of Entertainment Marketing, explains that his company is able to place his clients' products in movies that reach exactly the demographic profile that the products are seeking. **********For Molson, for example, he placed the beer in movies and television shows that reach ''upscale, 21-to-45-year-old professionals,'' including the movies ''Wall Street'' and ''Talk Radio'' and the television shows ''Dallas'' and ''Thirtysomething.'' **********Richard Kurnit, a New York lawyer specializing in advertising law, said yesterday that he did not believe the petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest would be favorably received by the F.C.C.

Oppenheimer. Gold Fields is the world's second-biggest producer. **********The defensive device, known in Britain as a ''pep pill,'' was developed there by John Grieves, a partner in the London law firm of Freshfields, an adviser to Gold Fields. The idea, Mr. Grieves said, came from Martin Lipton, senior partner of the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, who late last year dubbed the idea ''protect preferred.'' **********To encourage stockholders to stick with it, a company under the Lipton plan would issue shareholders special preferred stock and then pay them a special dividend equal to the shortfall if the value of the stock and the special preferred failed to reach a certain level by a specific date. In other Lipton variations of the same idea, the company would make up the difference in special dividends if its earnings did not reach a certain level or if a proposed restructuring program did not increase the stock price to a certain level by a given date. **********Under Gold Fields' version, the company has asked stockholders to reject the Minorco offer, expiring April 26, and instead wait three years, when Gold Fields promises to pay $:6 a share, or $10.23, in special dividends if it is unable to produce total profits of $:4 a share, or $6.82, by that time. **********Both concepts have touched off enormous interest, but Gold Fields is the first to seek stockholder support. **********''Of course I can't tell you who they are,'' Mr. Lipton said in an interview, ''but several companies are looking at it.'' **********In a separate interview, Mr. Grieves said, ''It was Marty's idea that inspired me to develop something that could be used in the U.K.'' He declined to say whether other British companies were interested, but British lawyers said that would depend on the outcome of the Gold Fields battle. **********Reception to the idea in the United States seemed clouded. American lawyers familiar with the concept maintained that if Gold Fields won, American corporations would rush to adopt similar measures. But if Gold Fields lost, the question would still be unresolved because Minorco entered the battle owning nearly 30 percent of Gold Fields. **********Minorco's big stake is viewed as a particular problem for Gold Fields because it could make Minorco difficult to beat. Under British law, once a company gets 50 percent of another company, it would have three weeks to get the rest. With nearly 30 percent of Gold Fields stock in hand, Minorco needs only 20 percent more to reach the critical 50 percent level. But because Gold Fields has vast gold interests in the United States, a Federal judge in New York has barred Minorco on antitrust grounds from going ahead until he decides whether to lift the injunction and accept Minorco's pledge to sell off the offending properties. **********Explaining his protect preferred defense in a 27-page memorandum to clients, Mr. Lipton, the man who created the ''poison pill'' defense, said the idea was ''particularly appropriate'' for successful companies with sound business plans whose shares are undervalued and are under pressure to restructure. He argued that it ''may be the deciding factor in enabling a company to support a determination that the best interests of the company and its shareholders would be served by the company remaining independent.'' **********Mr. Lipton said that directors may feel that the company's stock price would indeed rise if it remains independent and pursues its business plan. ''Yet in today's takeover environment, the board of directors often may find that it simply has no time to pursue this value-maximizing alternative,'' he said. ''Quite simply, the board is likely to come under enormous pressure either to sell the company or to restructure now, incurring heavy debt which will force the company to abandon its long-term business plan.'' **********Issuing protect preferred stock, he contended, ''telegraphs to the market a company's confidence in its long-term prospects, while providing assurances to investors that the company will take additional measures in the future to enhance shareholder value if the company fails to meet its growth objectives.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/business/company-news-dunkin-donuts-hostile-target.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dunkin' Donuts Hostile Target", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Dunkin' Donuts Hostile Target", "body_text": " **********Two Canadian companies, the Unicorp Canada Corporation and Cara Operations Ltd., began a hostile $305.3 million tender offer today for Dunkin' Donuts Inc.

But they said questions about China's stability and economic policy are forcing many American companies to delay or scale back their plans for Chinese ventures. **********Motorola Inc. has put on hold its plans to build two factories in China to make semiconductors and mobile radio equipment, at least until the political situation settles down sufficiently for the company to make a long-term assessment of the venture's prospects. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has indefinitely delayed a joint venture it agreed to in May to make optical fiber transmission equipment in Shanghai. Where China Will Be Hurt **********''I don't think you're going to see any major new ventures,'' said Richard E. Gillespie, vice president of the United States-China Business Council, a Washington-based group that represents more than 300 American companies with operations in China. ''This is where China will be really hurt because they counted on foreign investment more and more each year.'' **********Moreover, executives said the future involvement of American business in China could be influenced greatly by further economic sanctions imposed by the United States. President Bush has suspended military sales to China, barred high-level contacts and delayed international loans. The House, however, has voted to impose tougher sanctions, including the suspension of trade-development and investment-guarantee programs, and the Senate will consider similar legislation. **********''The form that sanctions take will have a major bearing on the future,'' Robert W. Yeager, the Rockwell International Corporation's chief representative in China, said in a telephone interview from Beijing. **********Because of what economists and analysts in the United States see as propaganda in the Chinese leadership's efforts to woo foreign companies after the crackdown, business executives say they have no clear signs of how serious China is about continuing to make foreign enterprise welcome in the long run. For the last five years China has relied heavily on foreign investment and trade to modernize its infrastructure and reform its deeply troubled economy. **********Hang-Sheng Cheng, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said the appointment last weekend of Jiang Zemin as Communist Party chief would probably be seen as a hopeful sign by American and other foreign businesses. **********Mr. Jiang, an English-speaking former Mayor and Communist Party chief in Shanghai, is relatively well known to foreign executives and is thought to be committed to economic reform. But Mr. Cheng said any optimism about Mr. Jiang's appointment had to be tempered by ''the reality of the old guard still being in charge.'' **********Unless the situation deteriorates substantially, though, China appears to be able to count on maintaining its business ties with those companies already doing business there. No Sign of Fundamental Change **********Executives of many companies that have invested money in factories, joint ventures and sales offices said they did not see the crackdown causing any fundamental change in the economic allure of China, with its one billion consumers, its thirst for foreign currency and Western expertise and its considerable potential as a low-wage manufacturing center. **********''We recognize as much as anyone the seriousness of the events of June, but as far as business conditions go, we see very little change,'' said Ben Marsh, a spokesman for the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, or 3M, which makes products including electrical tape and reflective sheeting for highway signs at plants it owns in China. **********''We see no reason to alter our outlook for business in China, which is very optimistic in the long run,'' Mr. Marsh said. Reluctant for Now **********Rolf Larson, president of the Grumman Corporation's international division, said he would be reluctant to expand the company's business there at least until the political situation is clarified. Grumman has several commercial and military projects with China, including upgrading Chinese fighter jets and helping build fire engines. **********But Mr. Larson said he continues to view China as an attractive place to develop new business. Grumman, whose contracts on the fighter jet program are potentially worth more than $500 million, was the company hardest hit by the Administration's decision to suspend military sales to China. **********''Thinking back three or four years, we knew there would be detours on the road to economic reform,'' Mr. Larsen said. ''But in the long run there isn't any question they have to get back on the track of reform and stabilization.'' **********Still, in the short run, many companies operating in China are feeling the fallout from the Government's crackdown. Orders for toys, electronics, apparel and other goods made in foreign-owned or joint venture factories in southern China, where most foreign investment is concentrated, have fallen off. Some customers of those plants, fearful of disruptions in production, are now buying their goods in Thailand, the Philippines and other Asian nations. U.S. Investment in China **********Investment from the United States accounts for about 12 percent of the foreign investment in China over the last decade and totals more than $3.5 billion. The United States bought $9.3 billion worth of goods from China last year and exported $5 billion worth to that country. The United States is China's third-largest trading partner, behind Hong Kong and Japan, and China is the 13th-largest trading partner of the United States. **********The Chinese leadership has stressed in the last several weeks that it intends to retain its open-door economic policy. Chinese officials have gone to great lengths to assuage nervous foreign executives by speeding trade payments and making business concessions, like more flexibility about how companies take out of China the profits they earn in local currency. **********Some American companies are concerned that if they reduce their presence in China, trim their expansion plans or decide not to enter the market, they could allow foreign competitors to gain a big advantage. **********Some Japanese companies, in particular, have been rushing to resume operations in China and to press forward with new investments despite the bloodshed, enough so that Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka recently criticized them for creating an image of Japan as ''trying to make money like a thief at a fire.'' Aggressive Japanese **********''The Japanese are going to be much more aggressive and more willing to go back in,'' said one American banker, who asked not to be identified. **********Hong Kong, the British colony scheduled to revert to China in 1997, has long accounted for the bulk of foreign investment in China. Hong Kong business executives are returning to China, but remain highly nervous about how the crackdown will affect their ventures and the Chinese leadership's commitment to allow Hong Kong to remain capitalist for at least 50 years. **********Most American companies, both those that already have operations in China and those considering it, also worry about whom they will find across the negotiating table from them. Should a large number of bureaucrats, joint venture partners and local officials be removed in a purge, foreign business ties could be disrupted for a long time, American executives and consultants said. **********But Mr. Yeager, of Rockwell, said such fears, so far at least, are unfounded. ''I have met all our customers and some ministries, and there has been no change in personnel, no change in behavior,'' he said. ''Old friends remain in place, and they openly and freely discuss the events of the past month.'' **********Mr. Yeager said there had been concern in the foreign business community that Communist Party representatives would again start attending business meetings, reviving a practice common earlier in the decade. But he said that had not happened. **********Given the furor in the United States over the actions of the Chinese Government, some companies operating in China or considering doing business there are becoming concerned about public perceptions of their Chinese ties. Some executives and consultants say they worry that a ''business as usual'' attitude could brand them as insensitive to human rights concerns or make them the target of advocacy groups like companies that do business in South Africa. **********''My sense is that no one in the business community is doing a social or ethical assessment of what it means to do business in China,'' said Timothy Smith, the executive director of the Interfaith Council on Corporate Responsibility, a group that has backed efforts to pressure companies to divest holdings in South Africa. ''I think it's likely to creep up as an issue.'' **********For now, though, many of the companies with the most experience in China are pushing ahead, with no change in plans. Nike Inc., which has been doing business in China for 10 years, makes sneakers in three plants it owns in southern China with a Taiwan joint venture partner. Liz Dolan, a spokeswoman for Nike, said the unrest in Beijing had not affected the company's outlook for its operations there, which now export 90 percent of the sneakers they produce. **********''China is part of our long-term plan, definitely,'' she said. ''We think it holds potential not only as a manufacturing center but also obviously as a huge consumer market. We have no intention of just running away.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/10/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Amoco Oil, to Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis, for its motor oil, with a $2 million budget. *********** Bacardi Imports Inc., Miami, to McKinney & Silver, Raleigh, N.C., for its Bacardi Anejo aged rum. *********** Stuart-James Company, an investment firm, to Greenstone Rabasca Roberts Inc., for its corporate and recruitment advertising, with a budget of $1.5 million. *********** Albert Nipon, a clothing designer, to Kirshenbaum & Bond Advertising, with a budget of $1.5 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/21/world/upheaval-in-china-facing-the-people-the-soldiers-fall-back.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1989-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Facing the People, the Soldiers Fall Back", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN CHINA; Facing the People, the Soldiers Fall Back", "body_text": " **********When a small convoy of military trucks used to launch tear gas and to spray water on rioters rolled through eastern Beijing early this morning, the soldiers met their first unexpected challenge.

They tried to engage soldiers in discussions about the democracy movement, and often they found that the troops had no idea at all of their cause. At least some of the troops said they had been told by their leaders not to read recent newspapers or watch television news. Massing of People on Roads **********Flush with exuberance, crowds have massed along roads they think the troops may use to approach Tiananmen Square, the nation's political center. When five military helicopters encircled the area above Tiananmen Square today, thousands of fists went up in the air and angry shouts rose against the Government. **********The crowd swelled at many intersections, and the hum of the crowd's voices rose into shrill shouts every so often when someone believed he had spotted the troops. **********''We will lie beneath the wheels,'' said Wang Gang, a 30-year-old leader of a new workers organization whose members have taken an oath to risk their lives for the students. These 300 ''desperados,'' as they call themselves, wear white bandannas to distinguish themselves from the 400 ''deputies'' who wear red bandannas and take fewer risks because they have families to protect. **********''We are not afraid of guns or bullets,'' Mr. Wang said. ''But we are not allowed to smash glasses, flatten the trucks' tires or beat the drivers.'' **********Mr. Wang, a sweater factory designer who has spent most of the last few days at Tiananmen Square, spent this morning planning where the men in his organization should be placed. **********Similar volunteer groups have sprung up all over the capital as angry residents form neighborhood teams that link up with others to protect the area from soldiers. Spontaneous Teams **********Often these teams form spontaneously. In the predawn hours today in the southern suburbs of Beijing, 48 armed personnel carriers and 17 trucks holding about 850 policemen found their path impeded by a truck driver who parked his large vehicle right in front of them and then ran around the neighborhood to get the help of neighbors, witnesses said. **********''I'll never come again,'' a lieutenant in the convoy was quoted as saying. ''I'll never touch a hair of a student's head.'' **********When troops parked three supply trucks near the Beijing Steel Institute, students drained the gas from the tanks and deflated the tires of the trucks. **********This evening, people were out on the streets discussing the political state of affairs and waiting for the troops to come. **********In the Xizhimen district, thousands of people crowded around the train station because they had heard that the soldiers may be forced to come in by train since they were having difficulty entering by truck or tank. **********''We are waiting here,'' said a film worker, Wu Jianping, ''because we hear there are tens of thousands of troops coming in by train.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/08/world/peres-escapes-crowd-at-funeral-as-rage-over-bus-attack-spreads.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1989-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 900, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Peres Escapes Crowd at Funeral As Rage Over Bus Attack Spreads", "print_headline": "Peres Escapes Crowd at Funeral As Rage Over Bus Attack Spreads", "body_text": " **********Enraged mourners tried to attack Finance Minister Shimon Peres today at the funeral of a victim of a bus crash that killed 14 people, while in several other parts of the country angry Jews assaulted any Arabs they encountered. **********On Thursday morning a 28-year-old Palestinian from the Nuseirat refugee area in the occupied Gaza Strip grabbed the steering wheel from the driver of a commuter bus on a trip from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, sending it plunging more than 400 feet into a ravine. In addition to the 14 dead, the 29 other people on board were injured as the bus burst into flames. **********The police have not made public the name of the Palestinian, who shouted ''God is great!'' as he grabbed the steering wheel. United in Rage **********Today the police reported that a resident of the Khan Yunis refugee area in the Gaza Strip was seriously hurt when his car overturned after being stoned by a crowd of Jews along the coastal road outside Ashkelon, south of Tel Aviv. The Arab was reported to be in critical condition. **********In several parts of the country in recent months, Jews have taken to the streets, looking for Arabs to attack in revenge for fatal attacks against Jews. **********But the bus crash on Thursday, one of the worst terrorist attacks in Israel's history, seems to have united much of the country in rage. No single incident has killed as many people, Arabs or Jews, since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987. **********Mr. Peres, as the Government's representative at the funeral, became the focus of the crowd's anger. He was unable to deliver his statement; police officers and soldiers had to form a wedge so that he could escape to his car, which was then stoned. **********Today the group known as Islamic Holy War claimed responsibility for the bus attack. News agencies reported that in a statement issued from its headquarters in Beirut, the group called the attack ''a heroic operation.'' Father and Son in Custody **********Islamic Holy War has claimed responsibility for a large number of suicidal attacks in this region in recent years, including the truck bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 in which 241 servicemen were killed. Palestinians say the group has gained a foothold in the Gaza Strip in recent weeks, since the army arrested most of the leaders of Hamas, a rival Islamic fundamentalist group that had been a major force in Gaza. **********The Arab believed to be responsible for this attack was slightly hurt in the crash, and the man's father, who was also hurt in the crash, is in custody and has been talking to investigators. It is unclear what role, if any, the father played in the attack. **********The police said that the father has told them that he believes the attack was intended as revenge for mistreatment of his family by the Israeli Army. **********But the police also said they have learned that the man is an Islamic fundamentalist who had been planning the attack for months. He even rode the bus several times to choose the best place for the attack, the police said. 'Peres Go Home!' **********Mr. Peres was heckled when he first arrived at the funeral of Miriam Sarafi, 41, of Jerusalem this morning, then wailing mourners tried to attack him. **********Mourners shouted, ''Peres go home!'' and ''Because of you this tragedy happened!'' at Mr. Peres. **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir did not attend any of the three funerals for victims held today. A spokesman said his experience at the funeral of a West Bank settler stabbed to death by an Arab last month had disturbed him. At that funeral, in Ariel, Mr. Shamir too was heckled and his car was attacked. **********All of those killed in the bus attack were at first thought to be Israelis, but two were identified today as visitors from Canada, news agencies reported. **********The bus crash has postponed discussion of the nation's political problems. The Labor Party put off until Monday a meeting to discuss whether it will continue in the coalition Government after Mr. Shamir's acceptance Wednesday of several hard-line conditions forced on him by Likud party rivals for peace talks with the Palestinians. Police Disperse Kahane Rally **********In downtown Jerusalem, angry Jews stoned cars at random throughout the day, and one group tried to lynch an Arab truck driver before being stopped by the police. **********The police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrators after a rally called by Meir Kahane, the right-wing rabbi, who called on the crowd to seek ''revenge'' and ''death to Arabs.'' At least six people believed to be Kahane followers were arrested. **********The police reported that Jews also stoned Arab cars in the cities of Qiryat Gat, Qiryat Malachi and Beit Shemesh. **********Reuters reported that a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization in Tunis today blamed right-wing Israelis for the bus attack.

Carpenter, 41 years old and an executive vice president of G.E. Capital, a finance company once known as the General Electric Credit Corporation. General Electric owns 80 percent of Kidder, Peabody, and the investment firm's employees own the rest. **********Telephone calls to Mr. Carpenter and to G.E. and Kidder officials were not returned. **********G.E. is believed to have become disenchanted with its investment, particularly its unprofitable retail and institutional sales operations. **********G.E. is also contemplating the dismissal of up to 2,000 of its sales representatives, although no decision has been made, the sources said. Such layoffs would be a radical reduction in Kidder's unprofitable retail sales and bond trading operations, and a decision would be made only with the involvement of the new chief executive, the sources said. **********Reports had circulated that G.E. was planning to leave the retail brokerage and bond business. But G.E. feels those operations can become profitable, particularly if they can be revamped to deal largely with wealthy customers, the sources said. **********In an unrelated move, Clayton & Dubilier, a Wall Street firm specializing in management buyouts, announced that two top Kidder executives, Peter D. Goodson, 46, and Donald J. Gogel, 39, had resigned from Kidder to join it. **********The two had been co-heads of Kidder's highly profitable merchant banking operations. They said that they would maintain their ties with Kidder and that Mr. Goodson would continue to have an advisory role in developing Kidder's ''junk bond'' business in Japan. Mr. Goodson said that he would leave for Japan on Saturday to tell the Japanese that he would remain as an adviser to Kidder. **********Reports of the reorganization at Kidder developed in the wake of the Clayton & Dubilier announcement. Profits in Merchant Banking **********Kidder is estimated to have earned $50 million last year, mostly from merchant banking, while its retail operations and bond dealings are thought to have produced losses. **********In view of their successful performance, Mr. Goodson and Mr. Gogel are understood to have grown tired of G.E.'s corporate practice of requiring them, as one executive put it, to ''get a consensus before doing anything.'' **********The two are understood to have created a stir on Tuesday when they confronted Silas Cathcart, G.E.'s hand-picked chairman and chief executive of Kidder's parent company, the Kidder, Peabody Group, and Max Chapman Jr., chairman and chief executive of its brokerage arm, Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********Mr. Cathcart and Mr. Chapman said they wanted Mr. Goodson and Mr. Gogel to take on expanded roles in the reorganization and offered to go into detail on what was in the works. The two said they were not interested and did not want to hear the details so that their motives in leaving would not be misunderstood. Departures Follow Bonuses **********The two are known to have delayed their departure until after Kidder paid what were described as ''generous'' bonuses last week. **********Should Mr. Carpenter become chief executive, he would take over from Mr. Cathcart, who was expected to continue as chairman of the parent company. **********Mr. Chapman was understood to have been confering yesterday with John F. Welch, chairman of G.E., on his role in the management reshuffle. **********Most of Kidder's high-volume branch offices, including those in New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago, are believed to be safe from dismissals. Sales personnel and support staffs in some branches that handle less business are likely to be most vulnerable. **********While at Kidder, Mr. Goodson had been an adviser to such companies as Macy; Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company; Richardson-Vicks Inc., and Kidder itself in its sale to G.E. three years ago. Mr. Gogel had been active in Kidder's leveraged buyout and junk bond operations. They will become two of Clayton's seven partners.

Revised figures put spending at $407.8 billion in October, $406.9 billion in September and $403.2 billion in August. **********For the first 11 months of 1988, construction spending was up a lackluster 1 percent over the comparable period of 1987. That figure was not adjusted for increased construction costs, which were up 1.5 percent. Big Rise for Housing **********The November spending rise was driven largely by an increase in spending on housing construction, which was up seven-tenths of 1 percent, to $200.4 billion. The housing figure included a 2.3 percent rise in spending on single-family homes. **********There was a 1.9 percent decrease in apartment construction. Economists said that reflected aftereffects of the 1986 Federal tax overhaul, which made such projects less attractive, and high apartment vacancy rates, particularly in the South. **********''Until we see vacancy rates decline, we're not going to see a lot of construction in those markets,'' said Mark Obrinsky of the United States League of Savings Institutions. **********Rising mortgage rates will probably dampen growth in single-family housing in 1989, said John Savacool, an economist with the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm. He said recent increases in single-family home construction ''aren't going to stick.'' Mortgage Rates Could Drop **********However, Mr. Obrinsky predicted another reasonably strong year for single-family homes, though not equal to 1988. He said mortgage rates could drop in the second half of the year and ''take some sting'' out of expected increases early in the year. **********Spending on nonresidential construction was down a seasonally adjusted eight-tenths of 1 percent in November, to $92.3 billion, including a 2.5 percent drop in work on office buildings. **********There was a 1.3 percent increase in spending on factories and other industrial projects, and Mr. Savacool said that was a result of continued strong export markets. While companies first increase production by investing in new equipment, ''eventually you have to build some new structures to put additional equipment in,'' he said, adding, ''It's finally starting to show up.'' **********The weakness in office construction, meanwhile, reflects high vacancy rates, Mr. Obrinsky said. 'A Bit Overbuilt' **********''The same has been true for shopping centers and malls,'' he said. ''They seem to have been a bit overbuilt.'' **********Hotel and motel construction was up 6.6 percent for the month, and other commercial projects, like shopping malls, were down 2.2 percent. **********Spending on construction of government projects was up 4 percent in November, to $81 billion, including a 2.7 percent increase in highways, which is the largest category.

The changes would also guarantee all parties the right to campaign ''wherever voting-age citizens congregate'' and prohibit use of Government employees or property for campaigning. Major Demands Unanswered **********But the proposed changes leave unanswered several important demands made by the more than dozen opposition parties and factions that are expected to contest the election, now scheduled for Feb. 25, 1990. **********On a subject of deep concern to opposition leaders, the proposed amendments would permit the registration of Nicaraguan voters outside the country.

P. Morgan & Company yesterday announced a larger-than-expected drop in earnings for the first quarter. The banking company attributed the decline to higher short-term interest rates in the United States and around the world. **********Other large New York City banks are also expected to announce lower profits in the coming days, analysts said, because the interest rates they pay on funds borrowed in the wholesale money market increased faster than the rates they charge on loans. Among regional and community banks, however, the rise in rates is not expected to hurt profits as much, because interest rates paid on consumer deposits have not increased as much as in the wholesale market. Net Interest Income Cited **********At Morgan, its profits in the first quarter totaled $179.6 million, down by 36 percent from $281.4 million in the first quarter of 1988. On a per-share basis, Morgan earned 96 cents, down from $1.52 a year earlier. **********The biggest cause of the decline was a drop in net interest income -the difference between the interest Morgan received on loans and investments and the interest it paid on borrowed funds - to $299 million, from $438 million in the 1988 quarter. **********The first-quarter profits were well below the $1.20 a share some of the analysts expected. Morgan's stock fell $1.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $37.25. The share prices of other banking companies also fell, as traders began to anticipate weakness in their earnings. Among other stock-market losers were the Bankers Trust Company, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the Chemical Banking Corporation and Citicorp. 'Compressed' Margins **********''Given the run-up in short-term rates during the first quarter, other money-center banks are also going to report compressed net interest margins,'' said Thomas Hanley, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ''There will also be lackluster to weak foreign exchange results at most banks and a highly mixed report on bond trading performance,'' he added. **********The profit declines of other New York banks may not be as pronounced as Morgan's, Mr. Hanley said, because they are not so reliant on borrowing in the wholesale money market and are more diversified. **********Morgan's results were not significantly altered by special factors. Its profits in the first quarter of 1988 rose by $43 million because of a Federal tax refund, while the 1989 results were lifted $37.5 million by the sale of the company's interest in the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, a municipal bond insurer. Its interest income in the first quarter was reduced by about $21 million because Brazilian interest payments due at the end of March were not paid until early April. End in High Rates Seen **********Lewis T. Preston, Morgan's chairman, said that the sharp rise in interest rates had pushed overnight and other short-term rates higher than long-term rates in many markets around the world. But he said yesterday at the annual shareholders meeting that the rise in short-term interest rates might be near an end. **********''If the recent trend toward slower economic growth is confirmed,'' he said, ''Fed officials presumably will be cautious about further tightening for fear of tilting the economy into recession. If so, most of the rise in interest rates may be behind us.'' **********Some aspects of Morgan's business remained strong. The company's fees from corporate finance, an activity to which Morgan is devoting more resources, totaled $88 million, about equal to the high level of the first quarter of last year. Its non-interest expenses, which rose sharply in the mid-1980's, were unchanged from a year ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/25/world/us-rejects-appeal-by-bonn-for-battlefield-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1989-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Rejects Appeal by Bonn For Battlefield-Arms Talks", "print_headline": "U.S. Rejects Appeal by Bonn For Battlefield-Arms Talks", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration today rebuffed a sudden request from West Germany to open negotiations soon with the Soviet Union on reducing battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe. **********In strongly worded remarks during a midday speech, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney described the idea of such negotiations as a ''dangerous trap'' that would strip the North Atlantic Treaty Organization of its nuclear deterrent. **********Two West German Cabinet members, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg, flew in from Bonn this morning to present their proposal to Secretary of State James A.

''One of the Kremlin's primary goals remains the denuclearization of Europe. Given this goal, and the perilous circumstances that could follow in its train if it's achieved, the alliance must maintain the will to resist the call.'' The Timing Is Unsettling **********The Adminstration was not ready to accept the West German proposal, and was somewhat unhappy at the suddenness with which it was delivered. But it also wanted to avoid an irreparable rift with the Kohl Government, which it does not want to see fall and be replaced by an anti-nuclear coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. **********Secretary of State Baker issued a statement after today's discussions that attempted to play down the differences between the two countries.

In 1982, he was the Unified Socialist Party's presidential candidate, winning less than 1 percent of the vote.  I began working at the age of 15, when I left my village in Sinaloa to go and work in Sonora in a tomato packing plant, while there was a boom in tomato production to be able to export to the United States.

At art school I spent four years and linked up with the painters, many of whom, like Diego Rivera and Javier Guerrero, were Marxists, Communists. **********As a child I also witnessed the most grotesque injustices with my own eyes, things that were taking place in my own village.

So I am an adherent of Marxism, and I believe that Leninism is a theory that is quite consistent and valid for the society that emerged from the Russian Revolution. I THINK LENIN'S IDEAS will always be relevant, so long as their historical context is taken into account. He's the one who developed the idea of peaceful coexistence between systems.

But bankers still see plenty of potential in the business, particularly among younger consumers who have not yet accumulated the wealth to establish close ties to securities firms or mutual fund companies. **********The mutual fund business was growing quickly in 1987, when Federal regulators opened the door to more activity by banks. Then came the stock market crash, and investors pulled back. The Oct. 19, 1987, plunge was a blow to banking companies like the Chase Manhattan Corporation, which had announced only that day a family of mutual funds. Chase Funds Expanding **********But the early misfortune has given way to better times. The Chase funds have grown to more than $800 million, up about 40 percent since the beginning of the year. With a family of stock, bond and money market funds under the name of Vista, Chase is one of an increasing number of banks taking advantage of their customer base and adding mutual funds to their product line. **********Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar Financial Services, a Boston-based consultant to mutual funds, said there were about 20 million investors in mutual funds, out of 120 million wage earners. Because only a small minority of investors ever become knowledgeable enough to manage stocks and bonds directly, mutual funds ''will remain the best method for the largest number of people'' to accumulate a diverse portfolio of securities, he said. Some of the strongest selling points for mutual funds, Mr. Harvey said, are for retirement planning and to finance college education. **********As for banks, ''We have access to the customers, which makes the mutual fund business a good long-term opportunity,'' said Andrew B. Craig, chairman of Boatmen's Bancshares in St. Louis. **********''Banks already have relationships with the baby-boomer population, which is just now becoming old enough to begin the transformation from spenders into savers,'' said Debra McGinity-Poteet, a vice president at the Security Pacific Corporation, a Los Angeles banking company. Fee Income With Less Risk **********Another attraction of mutual funds for banks is the fee income, which can be highly profitable without the assumption of as much risk as in the lending business. ''As so many banking products have become less profitable, we need to look for ways to increase our non-interest income,'' Mr. Craig said. **********A few basic strategies have emerged for banks. **********Building on the experience of their trust departments, a few dozen banks are earning fees by providing investment advice for mutual funds offered through their own branches or by securities firms. Other banks are collecting commissions when they arrange for a bank customer to buy mutual funds of other firms. **********''What we do well is provide investment advice,'' Ms. McGinity-Poteet of Security Pacific said. The banking company advises the Pacific Horizon funds, which have assets of $2.6 billion and are sold through 91 local securities firms, and are made available to the bank's customers. Limiting Factor on Marketing **********As Federal regulations limiting bank activity have been eased since late 1987, Ms. McGinity-Poteet said that the bank's marketing of its mutual funds was restrained by its unwillingness to attract money from its own deposit accounts. ''We don't want to make big advertisements about how to do better than the bank's interest rate,'' she said. **********Another large banking company with a major program to advise mutual funds and make them available to customers is Citicorp, with about $1 billion of assets in its Landmark group of funds. **********As more banks enter the business, fears are subsiding that buyers of mutual funds would merely be shifting money from a deposit account at the same bank. James Hoolahan, vice president at Chase Manhattan, said that ''over 90 percent of the money that flows into our funds is new money, not a transferred Chase deposit.'' **********Stephen G. Mintos, director of marketing at the Winsbury Company, a Columbus, Ohio, firm that handles the back-office and marketing programs for regional banks with mutual funds, said that ''the investment advisory part of the mutual fund business is where the best profits are.'' Winsbury now works with 15 banks that are advisers for 75 funds with assets of about $8 billion. At the end of 1988, it handled fewer than 60 bank funds with $6.25 billion in assets, up from fewer than 35 funds and $4.5 billion at the end of 1987. **********Investment advisers earn an annual fee of more than half of a percentage point on the assets of stock and bond funds, while banks that merely help sell funds of other companies earn a one-time sales commission. Outside Funds Also Offered **********Some banks are offering both their own mutual funds and those of others. ''Our aim is to offer the products our customers want, even if it is someone else's mutual fund,'' said A. Rodney Boren, president of Norwest Investment Services, a Minneapolis-based subsidiary of Norwest Bancshares. **********Norwest is investment adviser to a family of mutual funds that it makes available to its one million customers without any sales commission. But for those customers wanting a different product, Mr. Boren said, ''We would rather earn revenue from the sales commission than have the customer leave us entirely.'' **********But even as banks make inroads, the giants of the mutual fund business - firms like the Dreyfus Corporation in New York or MFS Financial Services of Boston - are not close to losing their dominant position. In fact, rather than waging legal battles to keep banks out of their business, many mutual fund companies are forging alliances that use the nation's nearly 14,000 banks as partners in a vast distribution network for mutual funds. **********MFS Financial, a Boston-based firm sponsoring 52 mutual funds with assets of $23.1 billion, has agreements with more than 700 banks that make available to their customers the MFS mutual funds. And Kemper Financial Services, in Chicago, owns the ISFA Corporation, a Tampa, Fla., concern that operates 558 financial centers at 220 banks and savings institutions selling securities, including mutual funds. Trained Personnel Provided **********Concerns like ISFA, which is known as Invest, have been growing rapidly the last few years, providing the trained sales personnel that banks have a hard time developing through their branch systems. The Chemical Bank, a competitor of Chase and Citibank in the New York retail market, has chosen to work with Invest to open 10 Investment Edge centers at important branches. While Chemical still handles the securities activities of wealthy individuals, Invest has small sales offices with registered broker-dealers who handle securities activities of other Chemical customers, and split their fees with the bank. **********''I'm certain that Chemical is watching us closely, to learn all they can about the selling end of this business,'' said Steven S. Kramer, an Invest director in charge of new business development. ''Over time, I'm sure that banks will become a much bigger part of this business.'' **********New forays into the mutual fund business are not confined to the large New York banks or the super-regionals, which have assets of tens of billions. **********John R. Taylor, president of Merchants Investments Inc., an affiliate of the Merchants National Bank, in Fort Smith, Ark., which has $230 million in assets, has added mutual fund products to the more traditional securities advice and management the bank has long offered its wealthier customers. In return for an annual fee of one-half to three-fourths of a percentage point, Merchants Investments will handle the bookkeeping and manage assets, shifting money among various no-load stock, bond and money market funds as market conditions change. **********Alternatively, Merchants Investments can sell other ''loaded'' mutual funds, collecting a one-time sales commission of more than 4 percent. No-load funds do not charge a sales commission. **********''About three-fourths of our customers hire us as an investment adviser,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''which I prefer because it opens doors to their other assets and makes for a much better client relationship.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/business/more-traders-subpoenaed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Traders Subpoenaed", "print_headline": "More Traders Subpoenaed", "body_text": " **********Federal agents delivered subpoenas to eight more futures traders this week, defense lawyers said today.

Disney, agreed not to try to gain control of Polaroid for 10 years. Polaroid, in turn, spelled out in specific terms how it would disburse among shareholders the damages it collects from Kodak, which infringed Polaroid's instant-photography patents. **********A trial to determine the damages begins April 17; Polaroid is seeking $6 billion, which could be tripled if the jury found the patent infringement to be deliberate. **********As part of its accord with Shamrock, Polaroid agreed to spend $5 million in advertising on radio and television stations owned by Shamrock and to pay Shamrock $20 million to cover the expenses of its takeover bid. **********After the agreement with Shamrock was announced, Polaroid stock plunged $4.50, to $36, in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Polaroid, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has made vague promises in the past about sharing the Kodak award with stockholders. During its takeover bid, Shamrock said that if it gained control of Polaroid, it would distribute to shareholders the bulk of damages from Kodak. **********Yesterday, as part of its standstill agreement with Shamrock, Polaroid disclosed specifically how it would handle any money received from Kodak. **********Polaroid said its shareholders would share a fourth of any proceeds from $750 million to $1.2 billion, a third of any money from $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion and half the proceeds beyond that. **********Polaroid, which has 55.5 million shares outstanding, said it would pay stockholders either in special dividends or by buying back more stock. **********Shamrock held a 6.9 percent stake in Polaroid until last week, when it tendered its shares after losing a court battle to block Polaroid's buyback plan. **********After the Delaware Supreme Court approved Polaroid's plan to buy back 22 percent of its stock, Polaroid's offer was heavily oversubscribed. Polaroid said it would buy 27 percent of the stock tendered on a prorated basis.

Court Ruling Cited **********Stanley P. Gold, the chairman and chief executive of Shamrock, attributed the truce to last Thursday's court ruling. Combined with court clearance of a plan to increase the amount of stock in employee hands, the buyback made it very difficult for anyone to control enough stock to threaten the company. **********''We didn't have a chance after that,'' Mr. Gold said. **********Moreover, Polaroid, which has already spent $800 million to buy back the 16 million shares, will spend $325 million more to buy back more. The offering price, not yet determined, is expected to be far less than the original $50.

They also agree on how much of the business will be parceled out in subcontracts to other companies. **********In December, in a rare finding, the Japan Fair Trade Commission ruled that 140 companies had colluded to rig bids between April 1984 and September 1987 for a number of projects at the Yokosuka Naval Base, a big American installation southwest of Tokyo. **********The commission, which has often been charged here with timidity in facing the construction industry, issued a warning but no fines. Striking a Blow **********Seeing an opportunity to strike a blow against the dango system, the United States Justice Department hired a Tokyo law firm earlier this year and demanded about $35 million in damages. American officials here threatened to sue the companies, both in the United States and in Japan, and bar them from further work for the American Government. **********In a statement issued today by the American Embassy, the Justice Department said 99 companies had agreed to settle the claims, and a preliminary agreement was signed on their behalf by seven large construction compaanies, including the Taisei Corporation and the Kajima Corporation. **********Forty-one other companies declined to sign. In the past they have said they never bid on the disputed sections of the contract. **********The Justice Department action is not linked to American complaints that the Japanese market is closed to foreign construction companies. On Wednesday, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said she had determined that Japan is making ''significant progress'' in allowing United States companies a chance to bid on construction projects here. As a result, she delayed any decision on sanctions until next year. Two Companies Named **********In its statement, the embassy said the United States Government ''will continue to seek to recover its damages from the remaining companies that participated in the bid rigging,'' and it named two of the largest, Obayashi Gumi and Niigata Tekkosho. **********No one is quite sure why the Japanese companies acceded to the American demands, especially because the case would probably have been tied up in the slow-moving Japanese courts for years. Earlier this week, The Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's largest newspapers and one that has been highly critical of the construction industry, suggested that the companies viewed a settlement as far less politically damaging than a trial that brought many of their practices under close scrutiny. **********''They were feeling the heat,'' one American diplomat here said. ''They had to get this solved quickly.'' **********Today was a national holiday in Japan, Labor Thanksgiving Day, and none of the construction companies could be reached for comment. Under the preliminary agreement, they must sign a final agreement by Dec. 20. Strategy to Force Change **********A Justice Department lawyer who has spent the last week in Tokyo negotiating the settlement, David Schlitz, declined to comment. **********Other American officials have said recently that the United States viewed the case as an essential part of its strategy of forcing change in the Japanese system, especially because the dango cartels effectively block American construction companies seeking work in Japan. **********The Yokosuka contracts that gave rise to the charges were worth a total of $134.9 million, and they included the construction of a housing complex for military personnel. **********In separate trade negotiations with Japan, the United States has demanded far stronger penalties against companies that participate in bid rigging, including longer suspensions from performing work for the Japanese Government and written assurances from companies that they did not collude on specific contracts. Japan, however, has resisted some of the American proposals, although there is mounting criticism within the country of the dango practices. **********The United States has not been the only critic of the dango system. Many in Japan, including some prominent politicians, have complained that it is anticompetitive and costs the country billions of dollars a year. Change Coming Slowly **********But the construction industry is one of the most powerful in the country and a big campaign contributor, and few public officials have been willing to challenge the system outright. **********Slowly, that is beginning to change. The Fair Trade Commission investigation into the Yokosuka cases marked a significant change, analysts here say, because it had been years since the commission was willing to challenge the politically powerful industry on charges that it violated Japan's Anti-Monopoly Act. **********Moreover, the dango system has become something of an embarrassment for the country, undercutting the Government's argument that business here is not collusive and welcomes outsiders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/06/world/session-on-rights-in-china-to-be-test-for-un.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 588, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Session on Rights in China to Be Test for U.N.", "print_headline": "Session on Rights in China to Be Test for U.N.", "body_text": " **********An international campaign to have China condemned by the United Nations for human rights violations in connection with its suppression of the democracy movement is expected at a meeting opening on Monday in Geneva. **********The drive, spearheaded by private human rights organizations around the world and supported by most Western governments, is widely seen as a critical test of the United Nations human rights enforcement machinery as its effectiveness is being questioned. **********Over the last few weeks United Nations officials here and in Geneva say they have received more than 100 formal complaints about the Beijing Government's actions from rights groups outside the country and from individuals in China. **********At the Geneva meeting, the petitioners will ask the 26 independent members of a United Nations human rights subcommission to condemn China for human rights abuses.

The company's share price has leaped 13.5 percent, to $44.25, in the last two weeks. **********Conrail, known formally as the Consolidated Rail Corporation, was created to take over several bankrupt Northeastern railroads, notably Penn Central. The Government poured billions into fixing it up, and sold the company to the public in 1987 at $28 a share. That was considerably less than the Government's cost, but Federal officials were glad to be rid of the headaches of running a railroad. **********Conrail has since proved to be a consistent moneymaker, if not much of a growth vehicle. Its profits totaled $4.44 a share in 1988, and analysts think a small increase is possible this year, despite a decline in first-half profits and revenues that James A. Hagan, Conrail's president, said were below expectations. He blamed a soft economy and said the company would seek to cut costs further. **********But it was not profit forecasts that set off the recent speculation, sending Conrail shares above their 1987 high of $40.875. It was that traders have begun to focus on the three-year period of takeover protection provided by Congress, which will expire on April 2. Until then, any railroad that buys more than 10 percent of Conrail cannot exercise voting control over those shares, and no one else can buy a 10 percent stake. ''In play, or not in play, is the question for Conrail,'' said Donald H. Powers, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, who doubts a takeover attempt will materialize. **********Responding to the concern, Conrail has put its own anti-takeover defenses in place. A conventional ''poison pill'' provision would force anyone who wanted to buy more than 10 percent of the stock to negotiate with Conrail's board or seek to overturn the provision in court. And the company has announced plans to establish an employee stock ownership plan, although it has not yet done so. **********The company has also raised its dividend, effective this month, by a nickel, to 35 cents a quarter, while hinting that further increases are likely. **********One reason for the speculation is that Conrail is beginning to look like a cash cow to some observers, one that cannot spend all the money it generates. Graeme Anne Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston, estimates that the company will have excess cash flow this year of $130 million, after spending $600 million on capital improvements. ''In the future, they will generate a lot of free cash flow,'' she said. ''That's the type of thing that attracts financial-type buyers.'' **********In the past, such buyers would have ignored a company as cyclical as a railroad, fearing what would happen in a recession. But Wall Street now looks more kindly on such deals. Airlines, similarly vulnerable to economic cycles, are now a magnet for takeover speculation, and one railroad, CNW, has been acquired in a leveraged buyout. **********In an interview, H. William Brown, Conrail's chief financial officer, agreed that the company would probably allocate only $400 million to $500 million for capital spending in 1990, ''lower than in any year since we've been public.'' **********A bidder could encounter obstacles. ''Would the Government ever allow someone to significantly leverage up Conrail?'' Mrs. Lidgerwood asked. ''I doubt it.'' **********The use of leverage might stir fears that a buyer trying to meet debt payments would skimp on maintenance and capital spending in ways that would become evident years later. Congress decided once that rail service for the Northeast was a national necessity, and it would probably do so again if Conrail went broke. But legislators would certainly like to reduce the likelihood of such an event. **********Mr. Brown of Conrail exudes confidence that the company can survive a recession now. ''We are a straight rail that will reflect the economy,'' he said, adding that management has taken steps that will enable it to cut costs when traffic weakens. ''You'd have to have a very significant downturn before we'd run into a cash crunch.'' **********The other type of prospective purchaser would be another railroad. Norfolk Southern tried to buy Conrail from the Government, and no doubt would still be interested, but again politics could cause problems. Along with CSX, it is a leading rail competitor of Conrail, and many shippers would find themselves with no alternatives if the lines combined. ''You saw the reaction that got in Washington,'' Mr. Brown said. ''It doesn't seem to me that is a likely possibility.'' **********Mr. Powell, the Merrill Lynch analyst, suggested that Union Pacific might be another possible merger partner; a union would create a truly transcontinental railway. Mr. Brown calls that ''an idea that comes up more from spectators than from railroaders.'' He said Conrail preferred to be able to hand off traffic to one of four competing railroads running to the West Coast. Conrail, he said, has no plans for any kind of merger."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/13/world/aides-in-latin-parley-see-a-fight-with-nicaragua-over-democracy.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1989-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1134, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Aides in Latin Parley See a Fight With Nicaragua Over Democracy", "print_headline": "Aides in Latin Parley See a Fight With Nicaragua Over Democracy", "body_text": " **********The presidents of five Central American countries are to begin a regional summit meeting Monday that is described by their aides as a ''showdown'' with Nicaragua's Sandinista Government. **********''The question is whether or not the Sandinistas are ready for immediate moves toward democratization,'' said an aide to the Costa Rican President, Oscar Arias Sanchez.

'Cards We Can Play' **********Latin American diplomats said the Sandinistas, in an attempt to end any possibility of the contras' revival, appeared prepared to make several concessions, such as advancing the date of the elections and offering new guarantees for the contras' repatriation. **********''We have cards we can play,'' the Nicaraguan diplomat said. **********''The Sandinistas hope to generate some trust and earn credit for what they see as a historic package of measures,'' an adviser to the Nicaraguan Government said. But diplomats said they saw few signs that the Sandinistas were prepared to make concessions on their control of the country and the armed forces. **********In private talks last week with opposition leaders, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra said he was not prepared to discuss constitutional changes. That in effect eliminates negotiations over such issues as separating the party and the armed forces. **********''It's going to be a showdown,'' said an aide to Mr. Arias. Last-Ditch Peace Effort **********The summit meeting has been postponed six times by fears that it would end in failure. It is a last ditch attempt to revive the regional peace plan that was signed in August 1987 by the presidents of Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica. **********The treaty committed the five nations to negotiate cease-fires with rebel groups in their borders, stop aiding guerrilla forces in other countries, and to guarantee a free press and elections, amnesty for political offenses, respect for human rights and liberty for dissident groups to operate openly. **********So far, the treaty's most dramatic and lasting effect has been to end large-scale United States aid to the contras. It has also assured, at least temporarily, a place in Nicaragua and El Salvador for opposition groups. **********Diplomats said they remained skeptical that the presidents could agree on major issues facing the other countries. The negotiators also face hurdles in finding a way to verify compliance with any accords, the diplomats said. 'He'll Return the Nobel First' **********Aides to President Arias, who as the architect of the regional accord won the 1988 Nobel Peace prize, said he would never call for sanctions against any country that violated the agreement or for renewed military aid to the contras. **********''He'll return the Nobel first,'' an aide said. ''All we have is moral authority to condemn them. The only guarantee is their signature.'' **********Every country, Mr. Arias says, has violated at least one of the peace plan's provisions. And since signers are supposed to carry out the treaty simultaneously, each nation can back out if any other fails to comply. Diplomats say that makes it impossible to affix blame. Honduras Wants Contras Out **********The vanishing chance of renewed American military aid to the contras has led Honduras to fear that they will become uncontrollable bandits. In an about-face that appears to have paved the way for the treaty's resurrection, Honduras now seeks some way of expelling the contras from its territory. **********Officials preparing the summit agenda last week said they were on the verge of resolving their differences over verifying compliance with the plan to close off the Nicaraguan-Honduran border, long a regional flashpoint. President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador says that is probably the major agreement that could emerge from the meeting. **********In interiews in Managua today and Saturday, Sandinista officials said they considered the summit meeting to be a decisive test of the Arias plan. They said they believed that it would be an important opportunity for Nicaragua to build a reputation for defending and promoting human rights. Nicaragua Seeks Border Pact **********Nicaragua is also expected to press its case for an accord with Honduras that would stabilize their border. A draft agreement was presented to President Jose Azcona Hoyo by President Ortega early this month, but no final accord has been reached. **********At a meeting of the five Central American Foreign Ministers last week in New York, Nicaragua proposed strict measures to verify compliance with the political and human rights requirements of the Arias plan. **********Those measures would include guaranteed access of private human rights groups to each nation, as well as access for the United Nations and the Organization of American States. **********The agreement as proposed would require Honduras to oversee the dismantling of contra military camps along the frontier in return for guarantees that the Sandinista Government would allow voluntary repatriation of contra fighters, and would give them access to land and other assistance to help them become reintegrated into Nicaraguan life. **********While Nicaraguan violations of the treaty have received the most criticism, the Sandanistas say they have done as much to comply as any other nation. They have permitted the reopening of some anti-Government news outlets and have lifted a state of emergency. Rights Violations Charged **********But some monitors say the number of rights violations in Nicaragua have grown, as have their severity. The contras say they have collected extensive evidence of a crackdown on their civilian supporters. **********Aides to Mr. Arias say he believes that since the accord has removed the contra threat, it is incumbent on Nicaragua to lead the way in compliance. **********One aide said, ''He's going to tell them that this time it's up to you to comply. If you don't, then this time you'll have to accept responsibility for failure.'' **********Nicaraguan officials say they will not argue about who is to blame for the accord's problems or which nation has done least to comply. **********''The idea is not to dwell on what we have or haven't done,'' a Nicaraguan diplomat said. ''Rather, the idea is that we're here, so let's see what we can do.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/03/business/company-news-ici-plant-to-make-safer-refrigerant.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ICI Plant to Make Safer Refrigerant", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ICI Plant to Make Safer Refrigerant", "body_text": " **********ICI Americas Inc., a subsidiary of the British chemical giant Imperial Chemical Industries P.L.C., said it would build a plant in Louisiana to make an environmentally safer alternative to ozone-depleting chloroflourocarbons.

The dispute has threatened to lead to a cutoff in American financing for the United Nations. **********In an agreement worked out over the last few days, the President of the General Assembly, Joseph N. Garba of Nigeria, successfully appealed to the Arab representatives not to press for a vote Wednesday on a resolution that effectively recognizes the P.L.O. as the government of an independent Palestinian state. **********At the same time, the Assembly President obliquely criticized the United States for threatening to withhold its contribution to the United Nations if the resolution is approved. **********Arab and Western diplomats said that the Arab states would defer action on their P.L.O. resolution on Wednesday. **********In addition, they will agree that the Secretary General should further study their position that a resolution passed by the General Assembly last year entitles the P.L.O. delegation to sit among the observer delegations of non-member states instead of with other accredited organizations. The United States and most Western countries reject this interpretation. U.S. Is Scolded **********In a written statement, Mr. Garba reiterated the view of Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the United States has ''an obligation under the charter'' to pay its share of the organization's budget, adding, ''The United States contribution to the budget cannot in any way be linked to anything that happens in the General Assembly.'' **********He said the American budget is ''a debt'' and not ''a loan or charity.'' **********Today's agreement leaves the Arab nations with little to show for the crisis they provoked by introducing the resolution, beyond some criticism of American bargaining tactics, many diplomats said. Arab Nations Split **********Indeed, the Arab countries have shown themselves to be deeply divided over the issue, with mainstream states complaining that the P.L.O. leadership in Tunis caught them by surprise when it demanded their support for the resolution last week without any consultation. **********As of Monday, the Arab nations were demanding as their price for not pressing for the resolution that the United States promise not to threaten the United Nations with financial sanctions again and agree to reseat the P.L.O.'s observer mission with those of non-member nations like Switzerland, although without making clear whether the P.L.O. actually represented such a state. **********Explaining the compromise, the representative of the Arab League, Clovis Maksoud, said he hoped other major countries would also dissociate themselves on Wednesday from the American policy of ''financial blackmail'' against the General Assembly. **********By threatening to cut off financing over the P.L.O. issue, he said, the United States is effectively ''extending the veto power it enjoys in the United Nations Security Council as a permanent member, into the General Assembly,'' where all countries are supposed to be equal.

For decades, Armenians have maintained that as many as 1.5 million of their countrymen were murdered or were allowed to die of starvation and exposure in a deliberate Turkish attempt at genocide begun in the spring of 1915. **********It is a savage legacy that haunts Turkey to this day. But Turkish Government officials and historians insist that their country is a victim of exaggerations and outright distortions. Genocide Is Denied **********There was no calculated plan of extermination, they say. They put the number of Armenian deaths at closer to 300,000, and they add that about as many Turkish Muslims were killed by Armenians during a period marked by considerable brutality and casual violence on all fronts. **********And they say they expect their case to be proved by long-stored documents from the archives of the Ottoman Empire, which collapsed after World War I, giving way in 1923 to the modern Turkish republic. **********There are an estimated 50 million documents in the Ottoman archives, which are kept in Istanbul, and Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz said this week that the portions dealing with the Armenian issue would be made available to scholars by May. Foreign Ministry officials said that researchers have already sifted through Armenian-related material covering the period from 1691 to 1895, and everything from then until 1923 should be sorted within the next four months. **********''We will accept whatever reality emerges from the Ottoman archives,'' Prime Minister Turgut Ozal told a news conference on Wednesday. Question of Scholarly Neutrality **********Other Turkish officials were blunt in asserting their hopes for absolution. ''Historians will see that most of the prejudices used by Armenians all over the world against Turkey are unrealistic and misplaced,'' Defense Minister Ercan Vuralhan said in an interview. **********One difficulty that could arise is finding a sufficient number of experts who are neutral and also qualified to evaluate the many military and Government orders, cables, reports and other papers. The Turkish language has greatly changed over the last six decades, and not many scholars today are able to read it in the Arabic script that was abandoned in favor of Roman letters, part of a burst of modernizing changes imposed during the 1920's by the republic's founder, Kemal Ataturk. **********In addition, questions are likely to arise about whether the Turks have turned over all pertinent material. ''I don't suppose they'd be opening them up if there was anything they expected to find that would embarrass them,'' a Western diplomat said. Rounded Up En Masse **********In the spring of 1915, the Ottoman Empire began to round up hundreds of thousands of Turkish Armenians, who were a dominant force in the eastern part of the empire. During the war, the Armenians were openly sympathetic to the Allied powers opposing the Turks and the other Axis nations, and were seen by Turks as an untrustworthy foreign element helping the invading Russian Army. **********As a result, the Ottomans began mass deportations to the desert in what is now Syria. Some Armenians converted from Christianity to Islam to save themselves. Others were evacuated by Russian soldiers. But untold thousands perished from beatings or shootings, or from physical deprivation on the journey. **********Turks do not deny that many Armenians died. But they say the numbers are greatly overstated. Killings By Armenians Cited **********Often overlooked by the world, Turkish officials insist, are the anti-Muslim killings that were carried out by Armenians. Considerable attention was paid here last fall to the discovery of a mass grave near the eastern city of Erzurum. Experts said it contained the skeletons of about 100 Turks bayoneted in 1918 by Armenians. **********Turks acknowledge that the genocide label complicates an already uphill battle to show that they are finally trying to improve a sorry human rights record. From a Turkish point of view, the country is also at a disadvantage against a strong pro-Armenian lobby in the United States. **********One manifestation of this is a resolution in the United States Congress to declare April 24 - the anniversary of a 1915 roundup of Armenians - as a day of remembrance. **********The resolution was defeated last year, but it has been reintroduced in the new Congress. Many Turks, who view the motion as an anti-Turkish statement, fear that it might pass this time in a wave of pro-Armenian sympathy created by the earthquake last month in Soviet Armenia.  ARMENIAN IS SKEPTICAL **********An Armenian historian in the United States voiced skepticism yesterday that any documentation made available to researchers by the Turks would add to or alter the official Turkish line on the subject. **********The historian, Prof. Richard Hovannisian of the University of California at Los Angeles, also said it would be ''naive to believe that a government that has been so active in denial'' would make available any truly damaging papers. **********''My personal feeling is that it would be better for the Turkish Government not to spend so much resources on denial but rather on reconciliation, the way the West German Government did after World War II,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/22/business/company-news-energy-team-leaves-kidder.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 224, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ENERGY TEAM LEAVES KIDDER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ENERGY TEAM LEAVES KIDDER", "body_text": " **********Kidder, Peabody & Company lost three of its nine investment bankers specializing in energy to the First Boston Corporation yesterday.

The new Rockport ads are making their debut this week in national magazines, and they indeed hew to Jordan's trademarks, including a slogan that features the client's name. **********''Rockports make you feel like walking'' is the motif of the campaign. Its aim, said Malcolm MacDougall, Jordan's vice chairman, is to take what was heretofore a company and turn it into a brand. **********Mr. MacDougall, who created the ads with Carl Casselman, a creative director, said: ''Florsheim is a big store chain. Brooks Brothers is a store. We wanted to create a thing called Rockport, just like there's a thing called Nike and a thing called Reebok.'' **********Such things can be lucrative. Nike and Reebok, the leaders of the athletic-shoe industry, each sold about $1.7 billion worth of footwear last year. Rockport, which was acquired by Reebok International Ltd. in 1986, had 1988 sales of $171 million. Many in the shoe business think that the $12 billion market for casual and dress shoes - Rockport's specialty - is set for greater growth, as young professionals age, bringing with them a desire for athletic-shoe comfort in professionally respectable footwear. **********In part, that was Jordan's pitch to Rockport - a presentation that included a film of an agency art director, Alex Ross, running a 10-kilometer race in Central Park wearing a pair of black Rockport wing tips. It won the agency the account over Chiat/ Day, Keye/Donna/Pearlstein and Rice & Rice. **********Chiat's relationship with Rockport has been intricate. Reebok had been impressed with Chiat's work for Rockport before it acquired that company. After the acquisition, Reebok gave the agency its own account. But when Reebok decided to expand into its own branded casual shoes, Chiat resigned from the Rockport account because it considered the two lines in conflict. Rockport went to Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer for a year, but the two split over creative differences. Rockport then returned to Chiat briefly before settling on Jordan. **********Previous Rockport ads had either focused on the company's sneaker-like casual shoes or had associated the company with country living and rugged Yankee individualism. **********For example, Chiat's understated 1987 campaign for the company featured letters sent to Rockport by satisfied (and suspiciously literate) customers. The ads, which showed the shoes but not their wearers, also showed warm accoutrements like a cup of tea and an apple core. **********The new set of Rockport ads leaves the country for the grit of urban America. Each ad features a panoramic city view - including Park Avenue in Manhattan and a hill in San Francisco - with a tiny figure striding briskly. ''We decided to capture the good feeling you get when you walk instead of taking a bus or a cab,'' Mr. MacDougall said. The shoes are not emphasized, except in a separate set of ads that highlight their suitability as office wear. **********In effect, the switch from Chiat to Jordan resulted in a transition from a concentration on image and the wearer's psyche to an approach that emphasizes product benefits. The campaigns are as different as Chiat's ''Reeboks let U.B.U.'' is from Jordan's ''Zest-fully clean.'' **********Jordan's focus on urban professionals instead of weekend poets resulted in part from studies conducted at the agency. Several staff members wore pedometers for a working week, and determined that on average, the women walked seven miles a day and the men walked eight miles. **********In the business, that's called ''mother-in-law research,'' as in, ''My mother-in-law says . . .'' The betting at Jordan and at Rockport is that mothers-in-law throughout America are saying it is time for their children to wear sensible shoes to work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/30/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1989-10-30", "snippet": "LEAD: * Volvic still water, a unit of the Perrier Group, to Lord Einstein O'Neill & Partners.

He said that ''the workers can no longer be left in suspense'' about their future and ordered ''the competent authorities'' to make a final decision about the fate of the company by the end of this week. **********Later today, a Government official said that the privatization of the company, known as Telmex, ''is a fact'' and will be made public before the end of the month. A formal announcement was not made today, the official said, because Mr. Salinas wanted to give the union, which opposes the company's sale, time to make ''an internal adjustment'' to the Government decision. 51% Stake Acquired in 1972 The sale of Telmex, in which the Government acquired a 51 percent share in 1972, has long been expected and would be politically popular. As Mr. Salinas said today, ''the citizenry is complaining, more and more each day, about the bad service'' the company offers to subscribers. **********The privatization of Telmex would continue a Government campaign to rid itself of inefficient or money-losing companies. In May, the Government put its majority stake in Mexicana de Aviacion, its flag carrier airline, up for sale, and last month the state-owned Cananea Mining Company, owner of the largest mine in Mexico, was declared bankrupt. Complaints About Phone System **********Mr. Salinas came to office last December promising to carry out a sweeping modernization of Mexico's economy. Businessmen have complained loudly in recent years that the backwardness and unreliability of the telephone system has made it difficult for them to compete in international markets and has slowed the entry of computers and other modern communications technology. **********With a population of 85 million people and a gross national product now approaching $200 billion a year, Mexico has the 14th-largest economy in the world. But with only 4.9 telephone lines per 100 people, the country ranks 82d worldwide, according to a recent Government study. **********Earlier this year, the Minister of Communications and Transport, Andres Caso Lombardo, said that Telmex would have to undergo a complete overhaul over the next five years, and he put the cost of the modernization program at $14 billion. But the Government, burdened with a foreign debt of $100 billion, has been trying to hold down public spending and does not have the needed technology. **********Telmex ''ended up in the hands of the state because formerly it was not adequately administered, but the Mexican state did not have resources sufficient to achieve adequate expansion,'' Mr. Salinas said. ''Today, eight of every 10 homes in our country don't have telephone service, and there are more than 1.5 million requests for new installations that Telefonos de Mexico has not been able to satisfy.'' **********As a result of changes in Mexico's foreign investment code announced in April, foreign companies are now eligible to acquire up to a 49 percent share in companies offering telephone and telecommunications services. Bankers and stock analysts here said that leading American, Japanese and European communications companies have in recent months expressed interest in investing in Telmex. **********Nevertheless, Mr. Salinas promised the company's almost 50,000 unionized workers that any change affecting the company ''will have to guarantee that the state maintains its guiding role in the nation's telecommunications.'' He also said that ''Telmex will have to remain under Mexican majority control.'' Deepest Doubts by Union **********In the past, some Mexican business leaders have expressed reservations about investing in Telmex, arguing that the private sector should be allowed to form new telecommunications companies to compete with the utility and force it to become more efficient. But the deepest doubts have been expressed by the union, which fears its attractive labor contract will suffer if control of Telmex passes from Government hands. **********''Privatization is not the sole and conclusive solution for the problems of the company and the telecommunications sector in our country,'' Francisco Hernandez Juarez, head of the telephone workers' union, said in a speech introducing Mr. Salinas today. ''To privatize cannot be the result of a mere financial squeeze or of ceding to economic interests engaged in exacerbating things so as to take control of areas of national interest and security.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/20/business/sun-hires-apple-official.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sun Hires Apple Official", "print_headline": "Sun Hires Apple Official", "body_text": " **********Charles Berger has resigned as vice president of integrated systems at Apple Computer Inc. and has joined Sun Microsystems Inc. of Mountain View as vice president of product marketing in the entry systems group.

''Often employees say, 'I'm not going to work for you if you report it,' '' he said, and many employers also want to avoid the cost and the paperwork. **********But, he warned, ''The costs of not complying far outweigh the costs of complying.'' A woman in Mississippi failed to pay Social Security taxes for her maid for years, he recalled. ''Her words were, 'Let's just let sleeping dogs lie.' '' But the maid - a human being, not a sleeping dog - eventually retired and filed for Social Security. She had records of what she had been paid, and her former employer had to pay both the tax and thousands of dollars of interest and penalties. **********If an employer has failed to withhold income and Social Security taxes, the employee is still liable for the taxes. If he or she does not pay the taxes, the I.R.S. will try to collect them. But if it cannot, the employer may be held liable for a portion of the employee's taxes, Mr. Stricof noted. **********People may be unsure if a person they pay for services - a private-duty nurse or a governess or gardener provided by an agency, for example - is an employee or an independent contractor. **********Wilson Fadely, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said the first step was to ask the agency or hospital that refers the person. ''You can have lots of different scenarios,'' he said. The person might be an employee of the hospital or agency, rather than of the person receiving the service or he or she might be an independent contractor. **********''Section 3506 of the I.R.S. code is very specific in regard to sitters for children or the elderly or disabled,'' he said. If the parent or relative gets the sitter through an organization and pays the sitter who, in turn, must pay the organization a fee, the sitter is an independent contractor, he said, so there are no withholding requirements. **********But the law is less specific about drivers, gardeners and others who may work in private homes. Gardeners or maids might work a half day a week in 10 different homes, for example, but may still be employees, not independent contractors. In the case of employees, the homeowners have the right to exercise control over their work. So all 10 employers would have to file Forms 942 and W-2. **********Payers who are uncertain may request a ruling by filing Form SS-8. Any tax forms or publications needed are available at I.R.S. offices or can be requested by calling 1-800-424-FORM toll-free, he said. I.R.S. publication 926 explains employment taxes for household employers in detail. **********One way to avoid tax difficulties is to hire domestic help through agencies that send out employees. **********''We get the SWAT team,'' said a partner at a national accounting firm. He and his wife work, so on Saturday morning, an agency sends a half-dozen workers to clean house. ''It's done in an hour, and there are no reporting requirements,'' he said. **********Another advantage of such an arrangement, Mr. Block said, is that an agency is insured and bonds its employees. Still, many people would rather have someone they know personally, he added, so they are willing to pay both the employee's and employer's share of the Social Security tax. For a part-time maid who is paid $50 a week, or $2,600 a year, that comes to just under $400."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/02/business/computer-trading-outcry-forcing-changes.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1989-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1749, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Computer-Trading Outcry Forcing Changes", "print_headline": "Computer-Trading Outcry Forcing Changes", "body_text": " **********The outcry on Wall Street and Main Street over computerized stock trading, often blamed for accelerating the market crash of October 1987 and the recent share-price gyrations, has become so great that new market rules are being adopted and others appear imminent. The rule changes come as even investment houses that once championed the practice are abandoning the business in droves. **********The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a main arena for the sophisticated trading, announced yesterday that it would tighten its rules on trading halts in falling markets. John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, said yesterday that he could support giving the Federal Government authority to suspend a form of computerized trading, called index arbitrage, during times of wild price swings in stock prices.  [ Page D2. ]  In addition, the New York exchange is meeting today to discuss possible changes in market rules, including expanding the scope of curbs on index arbritrage. The complex technique involves virtually instantaneous computer-driven stock trading based on minute-to-minute differences in the prices of shares and the stock-index futures markets in Chicago and New York. **********In Washington, the issue is attracting increased attention. A bill on making significant changes in the market structure is currently working its way through the House of Representatives. Meanwhile, there is increasing debate about imposing a new tax on short-term trading profits, which some in Congress believe would hinder such computerized trading tactics. **********Index arbitrage is the most visible target in the growing debate and concern over the volatility of America's financial markets. At stake, according to some Wall Street bankers, stock market officials and corporate executives, is the future of investing in America. Many opponents of index arbitrage maintain that individual investors will be scared out of the market by price gyrations, leaving the stock market even more in the hands of big institutions and Wall Street firms. **********''They are destroying the public's confidence in our stock market,'' said Robert Kirby, chairman the Capital Guardian Trust Company, an institutional investor, and a member of the Presidential commission that explored the causes of the 1987 market crash. ''If this velocity caused by index arbitrage makes the public feel that the insiders are running it up and down to make billions, they are going to get disenchanted with the whole bloody system.'' **********Moreover, there is a more fundamental worry that America's fast-moving financial markets are undermining the ability of the nation's corporations to compete with international rivals from countries like Japan and West Germany, whose financial markets are more stable and traditional. This view holds that gyrating share prices scare corporations away from trying to tap the stock market for money needed to expand production and upgrade technology. **********''Volatility is going to drive away and destroy the capital-raising process in this country just when the time is coming that companies are going to need it most,'' Mr. Phelan said. **********Some financial executives say that there is more hysteria than common sense in the current flight on Wall Street from index arbitrage. Index arbitrage, they say, is essentially being made a scapegoat for the larger problem of volatility, which they say has several causes. While curbing computerized trading would certainly reduce some market swings, it is uncertain that it would significantly reduce overall market volatility. **********Sometimes, even executives at firms that changed their rules about the trading technique concede it was less a reasoned judgment than following the Wall Street crowd. 'The Whole Thing Is Crazy' **********''The whole thing is crazy,'' said Alan C. (Ace) Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bear, Stearns & Company, one of the firms that last week abandoned index arbitrage for its own account under pressure from clients. ''But the whole world is crazy, so who am I to fight it?'' **********Still, the opponents of index arbitrage clearly have the upper hand so far. Increasing numbers of investment firms have abandoned or curbed their activities in the lucrative business for fear of becoming the focus of their customers' wrath. **********In the last week, three Wall Street firms have abandoned the business completely, while four others said they would no longer do the program trading strategy for their own accounts. Those who have pulled out include Merrill, Lynch & Company; Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., and Paine Webber Inc. Besides Bear, Stearns, the firms that will now only handle client orders include Kidder, Peabody & Company; Oppenheimer & Company, and Morgan, Stanley & Company, the largest practitioner of index arbitrage. **********At the heart of the dispute is a trading strategy that depends on the existence of stock index futures, a financial innovation less than a decade old that lets investors and speculators place large bets by computer on the movement of stock prices. A Contributor to Volatility **********Under index arbitrage, large institutional investors or investment firms attempt to profit from discrepancies between the stock market in New York and the futures market in Chicago by moving huge sums of cash rapidly in and out of both markets. Although there was little statistical evidence that index arbitrage had much to do with the 1987 market crash, it contributed to volatility and became a focal point of criticism. That criticism died down as prices advanced in the next two years, but it rose again after the Dow dropped 190 points on Oct. 13. **********Indeed, a recent poll by the American Stock Exchange found that 60 percent of individual investors believe that such program trading techniques are ruining the market. Partly as a result, investors are pulling out of investments in stocks, contributing to the shakeout since the crash in the retail brokerage business. **********As a result, in large part, the central issue in the index arbitrage debate is money. Retail firms are at the forefront of the current opposition because they believe they are losing business. But other firms that do not depend on individual investors have been reluctant to give up the highly profitable business. **********The current environment on Wall Street is not one where supporters of index arbitrage come out of the woodwork easily, for fear of being criticized by the institutions that oppose it. ''You've got real hysteria built up now, and I'd be crazy to talk about it,'' one Wall Street executive said. Firms Reversed Positions **********Whether the rapid shifts in policy mark a watershed for Wall Street or simply a temporary reaction to complaints of new-age Luddites unable to adjust to modern markets will become clear only if significant changes are made to market rules, and if those changes substantially reduce volatility. Indeed, a number of firms took similar steps to reduce their index arbitrage business shortly after the 1987 crash, but they later reversed their position this year after concern about the trading practice diminished. **********Critics of index arbitrage contend that the trading destroys the market's ability to value the stock of companies because so many investors are betting on averages of hundreds of stocks rather than corporate performance. It is argued that volatility scares away investors and perhaps results in a lower overall level of stock prices. **********Defenders say index arbitrage is far less important, simply helping to keep prices in the stock index futures market in line with prices in the stock market itself. And they add that, while concern grows vocal when prices are falling, such strategies have helped to raise stock prices at other times. **********The rise of volatility this year is clear, but some say that index arbitrage may not be the culprit. ''There are a lot more failings that are causing volatility in the market than just index arbitrage,'' said Stanley B. Shopkorn, head of equity trading at Salomon Brothers. He added that the very institutional investors who are complaining about index arbitrage have reduced the commissions they are willing to pay to brokers like Salomon, who as a result are less willing to risk capital by buying stocks that institutions want to sell during times of market stress. Low Commission Rates Cited **********Some institutional investors who are critics of index arbitrage agree. ''We have forced the trading firms into doing index arbitrage business for their own acounts in order to make money, because we have been grinding commission rates down so low,'' Mr. Kirby of Guardian said. **********In some ways, it is surprising that a concept as simple as arbitage could produce so many accusations and anxieties. Under its most simplistic definition, arbitrage is nothing more than buying low in one market while simultaneously selling high in another. **********In 1982, when regulators approved futures contracts based on an average value of hundreds of stocks, index arbitrage added just an extra dimension. Traders could now take advantage of the difference between the price of a futures contract based on a stock index and the actual stocks in that index. The result is what traders call a ''hedged'' position, with firms theoretically able to make money regardless of the direction of the market. **********When the markets change, the index arbitragers make their moves in a flash, dumping millions of shares of stock into the New York Stock Exchange's computerized order delivery system. Rather than making their judgments based on the fundamentals of a company's shares, traders in index arbitrage make their decisions based on mathematical formulas that dictate sell or buy orders for hundreds of stocks. The result is that, when the market turns bearish or bullish, programs kick in that can accelerate the trend. **********''Institutional traders have a herd mentality, and index arbitrage provides them with a supercharged vehicle,'' said James M. Stone, a former chairman and member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the futures industry regulator, until 1983, and currently president of Plymouth Rock Assurance Corporation, an insurer in Boston. ''Everyone rushes for the door when someone thinks they heard the word fire, and these instruments allow the rush to be much faster and much more dangerous than it was before.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/11/world/colombians-fear-for-the-economy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 888, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COLOMBIANS FEAR FOR THE ECONOMY", "print_headline": "COLOMBIANS FEAR FOR THE ECONOMY", "body_text": " **********As Colombia's stepped-up campaign against drug trafficking goes into its fourth week, many Colombians are divided over the wisdom of trying to abruptly shut down the country's most lucrative industry. **********Both Government and independent economists say that a sudden halt to the drug trade, which last year yielded $4 billion, would throw the country into a deep recession that might run four or five years. **********''It should be reduced gradually over five or six years,'' said a leading economist, who requested anonymity. **********The Government's anti-narcotics campaign has slowed dramatically since the first few days of raids and none of the major traffickers have been caught, although an economist accused of helping the Medellin cartel launder $1.2 billion was extradited to face Federal charges in Atlanta last week. But Government officials deny that economic concerns are a factor. 'Committed to This Fight' **********''President Barco is committed to this fight,'' a senior Government official said. ''I've never heard any Government ministers or important pressure groups argue that we should soften the effort for economic reasons.'' **********''On the other hand,'' he added, ''there are decent people who would prefer to keep things as they were.'' **********Immediately after President Virgilio Barco Vargas declared war on the drug traffickers on Aug. 19, 11,000 people were arrested and hundreds of planes, boats, cars and weapons were seized. But since then the traffickers have had the Government on the defensive with almost nightly bombings in Medellin, the country's drug trafficking hub, and sporadic attacks in the capital. **********Today, the Associated Press reported that the Government had signed extradition orders for three more imprisoned Colombians. They were identified as Ana Helena Rodriguez, jailed in Bogota on drug trafficking charges, Bernardo Londono Quintana, 47, jailed in Bogota on money-laundering charges, and Alberto Orlando Gamboa, 37, held in Medellin on money-laundering charges. **********The income from cocaine last year was more than three times the $1.2 billion expected this year from coffee, Colombia's leading legal export. Eighty percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States is processed in Colombia. **********The Colombian Government, which insists that it is not dependent on cocaine and not influenced in its policy-making by cocaine dollars, says that most of the traffickers' earnings are stashed in banks and investments outside the country. 'It Could Be Disastrous' **********Even so, Government and independent economists estimate that as much as $1.5 billion in drug trafficking profits circulated in the Colombian economy last year, accounting for 20 percent of the country's total export earnings. By some estimates, as many as 300,000 of Colombia's 32 million people may be directly or indirectly employed in the cocaine business and as many as 1.2 million may benefit from the proceeds. **********''If the narcotics trafficking stopped suddenly,'' said Fernando Tenjo Galarza of the Department of National Planning. ''it would be like having a coffee crisis and oil crisis at the same time.'' A university economist said: ''I think we would see a very deep recession. It could be disastrous if you don't manage it properly.'' **********In recovering from a cocaine-induced recession, the economists said, Colombia would need substantial aid from the United States and other countries. Colombia would probably not ask for money, they said, but would expect American support for an agreement guaranteeing favorable prices for Colombian coffee as well as a reduction in import restrictions. **********Colombia might also ask for leniency in repaying its $16 billion foreign debt, which is now devouring 42 percent of its export earnings. Where Drug Barons Invest **********Narcotics trafficking is an embarrassment to the Government and it refuses to acknowledge that tens or hundreds of thousands of Colombians are living better because of it. It makes no effort to track the flow of narcotics dollars and omits the income from official reports and calculations. **********The drug barons have amassed fortunes that exceed anything previously known in Colombia. Often using ficticious names and dummy corporations, they have invested extensively in Colombian business and industry. But most economists say they doubt reports that the traffickers also own large blocks of corporate shares traded on the Colombian stock market. **********The traffickers have bought millions of acres of prime farm and ranch lands and invested heavily in construction. **********Jorge Enrique Vargas, the deputy director of the Department of National Planning, portrays the cocaine money as an unwelcome factor that distorts the Colombian economy. **********In the last three years, he said, it has caused the price of real estate and houses to double. The finance industry has suffered, he said, because ''these people pay cash'' and food production has declined because workers have been lured away from farms and ranches by higher paying jobs in the drug trade. **********The Government does not appear to expect a quick end to the cocaine business. It has developed no plan for coping with the loss of cocaine dollars, Government economists say, and no one is working on such a plan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/01/business/greenspan-defends-lifting-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greenspan Defends Lifting Rates", "print_headline": "Greenspan Defends Lifting Rates", "body_text": " **********By raising interest rates substantially in the last 10 months, the Federal Reserve helped extend the nation's long economic expansion, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said today. **********Mr. Greenspan said the higher rates helped suppress the forces that ultimately create recession, particularly inflation. He said the Fed's policies had contributed to prospects for continued sound growth, provided Congress and the Administration can agree on a credible long-term policy to cut the budget deficit. **********''There is nothing embodied in the current balances within the economy which in any way, in my judgment at least, predisposes us to a recession,'' Mr. Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. **********Mr. Greenspan was responding to questions by Representative Lee H.

Uncalculated Savings **********In a discussion with Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, Mr. Greenspan said that while the American savings rate was poor, it was depressed to some extent by the method of calculation. **********He noted that the down-payment equity of home buyers was counted as savings while the capital gains received by sellers was not. **********This means much of the appreciation of house prices in recent years is not captured by the reporting system even as owners are presumably factoring this into their own assessment of well-being - and spending accordingly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/20/world/soviet-prime-minister-faulted-over-ecology.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 178, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Soviet Prime Minister Faulted Over Ecology", "print_headline": "Soviet Prime Minister Faulted Over Ecology", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Nikolai I.

That increase, however, was the only one this year and reflected the drop in interest rates that made deposits at savings institutions competitive with rates paid by money market funds. **********''Institutions know they have to meet higher capital requirements, and the easiest way to do that is to shrink,'' said James Barth, chief economist for the thrift office, adding that the shrinkage process ''is not going to go away for a while.'' Confidence Not Big Factor **********Mr. Barth added that he saw little indication that the loss of deposits was the result of a lack of confidence by customers. **********Indeed, while the loss of $5.1 billion is large, it is only half the losses posted by the industry in January, when depositors fled savings and loan institutions, fearing a possible tax on their deposits as a way to finance an industry bailout, in favor of higher rates paid by money market funds. **********But even though the erosion of customer confidence appears to have been stanched, the industry has still lost almost $62 billion of deposits in the last year. **********The industry is coping with requirements under the bailout bill that force executives to retain much higher levels of cash and cash-type holdings as capital, or a cushion against losses. The bailout, passed by Congress in August, will provide $159 billion to close down almost 700 sick savings institutions over the next 10 years. Requirements Doubled **********While the industry for years was permitted to operate at capital levels between 1 and 3 percent of assets, the bailout bill has more than doubled those requirements. Some analysts predict the industry could be forced to raise more than $30 billion in new capital through stock offerings and cash infusions from mergers with outside investors. **********But a much easier way to increase capital levels is by shrinking the size of the overall institution, while keeping the amount of capital constant. This, according to Mr. Barth and other industry experts, was what the industry began to do in August. **********Moreover, Mr. Barth added, almost half of the shrinkage was concentrated at five very large California institutions that needed to raise their capital levels. **********The thrift office added that the numbers included the outflow of deposits from 264 sick institutions under the control of the Government. **********''The surest way to meet higher capital requirements is by letting your deposits run off and selling assets so that you have a smaller base,'' said James W. Christian, chief economist for the United States League of Savings Institutions. Interest Rates Are Lowered **********Mr. Christian noted that in August, while interest rates essentially held steady, many California savings institutions were lowering the rates they paid on deposits, which is the easiest way to pare deposits and ''a clear signal that it was deliberate.'' **********''What is interesting is that we are seeing a very quick and dramatic impact'' of the bailout legislation, said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va. **********But Mr. Barth said that some of the loss of deposits was not intentional. August tends to be a heavy spending month for families. ''Getting ready for back to school, parents shell out money for tuition, clothing and suppliers,'' he said. **********Accompanying the loss of deposits, which do not include the crediting of interest, was an even larger shrinkage in the industry's total assets. For August, the total fell by $13.4 billion, to $1.318 trillion, the thrift office said. **********Most of that was accounted for by the sale of $8.3 billion in mortgage-backed securities and $3.5 billion in non-mortgage securities held by the industry, the Government said. These assets tend to be much easier to liquidate than individual home mortgages and other direct real estate holdings, which fell $3 billion. **********Besides not offering competitive rates on deposits, which encourages customers to go elsewhere, the industry paid off large amounts of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks, the agency said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/world/lebanon-cabinet-talks-begin-despite-protest-by-christians.html": {"writer_name": "Ali Jaber", "pub_date": "1989-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 551, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanon Cabinet Talks Begin Despite Protest by Christians", "print_headline": "Lebanon Cabinet Talks Begin Despite Protest by Christians", "body_text": " **********Lebanon's new President, Rene Moawad, started consultations today on the selection of a Cabinet to serve as a ''government of national entente,'' but his rival, Gen.

Hired last year as the record company's chief executive, he has the task of turning around an operation whose name, while more than a little faded of late, reverberates through popular culture like few others. **********Last week, Mr. Busby pulled off his first major coup at Motown. After months of talks, the singer Diana Ross agreed to return to the label, where, with the Supremes and on her own, she virtually defined the Motown sound with hits like ''Ain't No Mountain High Enough'' and ''Reach Out and Touch.'' **********Ms. Ross, who left Motown for RCA Records in 1981, has most recently been under contract at MCA Records, where Mr. Busby had been president of the black music division before taking the Motown job. **********Saying that ''people all around the world associate the name Motown with a sound that touched their lives,'' Ms. Ross has also agreed to purchase an unspecified stake in the label. ''It's like the queen returning home,'' Mr. Busby said. ''This is a huge portion of the process of writing the second chapter of Motown.'' **********Motown's first chapter ended last year, when the company was acquired by a partnership of Boston Ventures, an investment firm, and MCA Inc., the parent of MCA Records and Universal Studios. The partnership paid $61 million to purchase the company from its founder, Berry Gordy Jr., under whose direction the label became a music-industry icon in the 1960's and early 70's, only to lose its hit-making touch by the 80's. **********Responding to concerns from black executives that Motown would no longer be black-owned, Mr. Gordy insisted that 20 percent of Motown be available to black investors. The unspecified stake being taken by Ms. Ross is apparently coming from that pool. Mr. Busby also owns a portion. **********For Mr. Busby and the other new owners, even the boost from the return of Ms. Ross to the fold is just a small step in the turnaround effort. The company they took control of was a far cry from the one that once consistently topped both the black and pop charts with performers like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, the Jackson Five, the Temptations, Gladys Knight and the Pips, the Spinners and the Four Tops. **********Like Diana Ross, many of the biggest acts, including the Jacksons, defected over the years to other labels that could afford to pay more money and provide more marketing and distribution clout. The company's success in finding and developing new talent in recent years has been spotty, and it missed out completely on new black-music trends like rap. **********Sales, which reached nearly $100 million annually during some of the best years, slipped to a reported $20 million recently, with $12 to $14 million of that accounted for by sales of old hits. For the past two years, the label has been eighth on Billboard magazine's rankings of black album sales. **********But Mr. Busby is confident that he can reinvigorate Motown. With the financial backing of Boston Ventures, the majority partner, and MCA, he is formulating plans to get the most from Motown's remaining stars, including Stevie Wonder and Lionel Richie. He is also developing new artists, signing stars who are unhappy at other labels and finding more ways to use the Motown brand name. ''The one thing we are not is undercapitalized,'' he said. **********Mr. Busby has a powerful heritage working in his favor. A distinctive blend of pop and soul, Motown music transcended racial barriers in a way that perhaps only the jazz greats had before and no sound has since. Founded in Mr. Gordy's Detroit home nearly 30 years ago (the company moved to Hollywood in 1971), Motown at its peak had an uncanny knack for identifying new talent and producing records that appealed equally to rhythm and blues listeners and rock-and-roll fans. **********Even now, on soundtracks of films like ''The Big Chill,'' TV shows like ''The Wonder Years'' and countless commercials, old Motown hits continue to evoke nostalgia for those who came of age in the 60's and 70's. **********Mr. Busby, a low-key, soft-spoken 39-year-old in an industry overrun with big egos and loud mouths, has an impressive track record of his own. **********After starting in the business as a merchandiser for now-defunct Stax Records, he went on to various promotional and marketing jobs at Casablanca Records, Atlantic Records, CBS Records and A&M Records. In 1984, he moved to MCA and built, virtually from scratch, a black-music division that now racks up $50 million in sales and has been No. 1 in black album sales for the past several years. His success there came with the success of established singers like Patti LaBelle and new groups like New Edition. **********His move to Motown has competitors watching the label with renewed respect. ''In Motown, you have a legendary name,'' said Step Johnson, vice president and general manager of Capitol Records Inc.'s black-music division. ''In Jheryl Busby you have one of the top executives in the business, with an ability to make things happen. If I had to put my money on it, I'd say they're going to succeed.'' **********From Mr. Busby's perspective, Motown's decline in recent years has been overstated. ''Anything that sold for $61 million wasn't exactly dilapidated,'' he said. ''What Motown needed was for someone to come in and say where we go from here.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Busby acknowledged that Motown had, over the years, lost some of its ability to develop new talent, especially after Mr. Gordy added motion picture and television programming operations. (Mr. Gordy has retained ownership of the programming company, which recently had its first major success with ''Lonesome Dove,'' the highly rated and critically acclaimed CBS mini-series.) ''When Motown moved from Detroit to Hollywood and Berry diversified into movies, there may have been a failure to keep their ears on the street, where the creativity comes from,'' Mr. Busby said. A spokesman for Mr. Gordy did not return calls. **********Miller London, Motown's vice president for marketing, sales and distribution and one of the few executives to have remained with the company through its ups and downs, said there were times in recent years when even if the label spotted promising talent, it did not nurture and develop it as well as in the early days. ''We would give an act a one-album shot rather than develop them,'' he said. **********Right now, Motown is counting on continued big sales from its Big Three - Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie and Diana Ross - all of whom are scheduled to release albums this year. Smokey Robinson and the Temptations are still at the label, as well. But the company cannot bet its future on artists who have been around for nearly three decades. Mr. Busby, whose most difficult task is to improve Motown's record of finding and developing new talent, said he wants to instill a more aggressive, marketing-oriented approach to that part of the business. **********His basic philosophy, he said, is ''developing artists' careers rather than selling records.'' In a few cases, he explained, the creative genius of a musician can sell the product. But ''to just depend on that to fuel the revenues of an entire label is a tough thing.'' More often, in his view, an act has to develop an image and a target audience and be marketed aggressively and consistently. **********One example: The Boys, the first major success of the ''new'' Motown. A group of four brothers from Los Angeles, The Boys were signed by Mr. Busby at MCA and went with him to Motown before the release of their first album last year. ''Right now in America, if you're between the ages of 5 and 16, there is no act directed at you,'' Mr. Busby said. The Boys, with their clean-cut looks, charismatic presence and similarities to the Jackson Five, are ''an opportunity to seize that marketplace.'' **********To give the group exposure to music fans and parents alike, Motown has carefully plotted television appearances on ''Soul Train'' as well as on more general audience shows like ABC's ''Good Morning America.'' This summer, The Boys will appear in theme parks around the country. So far the strategy appears to be paying off. The Boys' first album has sold more than 700,000 copies and seems a sure bet to reach platinum status - one million albums. ''If this is going to be a big act,'' Mr. Busby said, ''it's because Motown understood it and made it work.'' **********He has high hopes for other relatively new acts, including the group Today, composed of four young men, and for established acts that Motown executives think can become even bigger, like the Pointer Sisters, who signed on last summer. **********Mr. Busby said the company is also interested in broadening its musical horizons. ''Motown should have been first in all black music forms,'' he said. Rap music is the most obvious example, he said, but Motown could also move into jazz and gospel music. **********Still, he is not ignoring the label's library of old hits and the wide following it has in the general market. Motown wants to find ways, perhaps by drawing on the distribution strengths of MCA Records, to increase sales of old recordings by as much as 50 percent. ''That's a real important part of the company,'' Mr. Busby said. ''It underscores how much of a general-market label it is.'' **********Mr. Busby is intrigued, too, by the value of the Motown name outside the recording industry. ''It's sitting there in front of the consumer, but no one has done anything with it,'' he said. **********He foresees obvious promotional and merchandising opportunities, like sellng the right to use the name on clothing. ''There are endless opportunities, and we are looking for aggressive, smart people who specialize in that field,'' he said. ''This is not on the back burner.'' **********Mr. Busby and Motown's owners have also shown that they are not averse to growing through a merger or acquisition. The company recently held merger negotiations with Solar Records, whose chairman, Dick Griffey, has been interested in a Motown stake. Talks with Solar, now the largest black-owned record company, broke down last month. **********If Mr. Busby succeeds in turning Motown around in the next several years, Boston Ventures will almost certainly sell its stake. The most likely scenario: MCA will exercise an option to acquire the rest of the company from Boston Ventures. **********For now, the company wants to capitalize on the hype surrounding its upcoming 30th anniversary. And Diana Ross's return to Motown seems to have galvanized the company. **********Ms. Ross's new album, ''Workin' Overtime,'' will be released in May. The first single is due in April. She will also tour in the United States, Europe, Australia and Japan. ''Her returning to Motown,'' said Mr. Busby, ''is a hot sizzle.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/15/business/gm-idles-plant-in-atlanta-and-stirs-uaw-s-anger.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1989-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M.

The Chevrolet Caprice is also built in G.M.'s assembly plant in Arlington, Tex., but both vehicles might be built at Arlington as part of a new generation of rear-wheel-drive full-size cars. **********The union's angry blast came from Stephen P. Yokich, U.A.W. vice president, who assumed his current post two months ago. His anger was an indication of a worsening climate of labor relations between the company and the union. Moreover, Mr. Yokich said some ''cooperative programs'' between G.M. managers and hourly workers were not working well. Cooperative Programs **********Mr. Yokich replaced Donald Ephlin, who was an outspoken proponent of the auto maker's cooperative programs, which sought to formalize worker involvement in management issues like quality and productivity improvements. Mr. Ephlin's criticism of recent G.M. plant closings had been somewhat muted; many G.M. managers and executives have been saying they are anxious to find out if Mr. Yokich is as enthusiastic about cooperative programs as Mr. Ephlin was. **********''We are tired of the hypocrisy of congratulating workers for a job well done and rewarding them with layoffs,'' Mr. Yokich said in a statement, noting that the G.M. announcement had praised Lakewood workers for 60 years of ''building fine products.'' **********Technically, the Lakewood plant could be reopened at some future date if General Motors decided to locate a vehicle program there, a company spokesman said. But Lakewood is the fourth G.M. assembly plant to be idled since ratification of the 1987 labor agreement with the U.A.W. that barred permanent plant shutdowns. The other idled plants are in Leeds, Mo.; Pontiac, Mich., and Framingham, Mass., and G.M. unofficially acknowledges it is unlikely they all will reopen. **********Under the terms of the 1987 agreement, G.M. was permitted to idle plants if it was forced to do so by falling sales. But Mr. Yokich said, ''G.M. management is not trying nearly hard enough to fulfill its obligations under the national agreement and to source offshore production back into domestic plants if necessary to maintain employment here.'' 'Short-Sighted Decisions' **********Mr. Yokich also said G.M. senior management ''continues to make short-sighted decisions that shatter morale and suggest that the near-term bottom line is still what matters most'' at G.M. headquarters. **********''There's still time for G.M. to demonstrate that it truly wants a new relationship with the union and union workers,'' he added, ''but episodes like this aren't helping at all.'' **********G.M. said both hourly and salaried workers would be eligible for a variety of unemployment benefits, but a U.A.W. spokesman said some of the benefit programs do not have much money left in them because of the number of layoffs at G.M. in the last two years."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/29/business/company-news-digital-to-use-bonding-technology.html": {"writer_name": "Nina Andrews", "pub_date": "1989-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Digital to Use Bonding Technology", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Digital to Use Bonding Technology", "body_text": " **********In one of the first important commercial developments by the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation said today that it would use the consortium's tape-automated bonding technology to connect silicon processing chips in its computers. **********The technology is considered more efficient and more reliable than traditional bonding methods, which employ metal wire.

Word-of-mouth estimates countinued to soar, some reaching far into the thousands. Outbreaks of firing continued today, as more convoys of troops moved through the city. **********The bloodshed stunned Beijing and seemed to traumatize its citizens. Normal life halted as armored personnel carriers and troop trucks rumbled along debris-filled roads, with soldiers firing their automatic weapons in every direction. Smoke filled the sky as workers and students vented frustration and outrage by burning army vehicles wherever they found them separated from major convoys,in side streets or at intersections. Square Is Sealed Off **********The area around central Tiananmen Square was completely sealed by troops who periodically responded with bursts of automatic-weapons fire whenever crowds drew close to the square. **********By ordering soldiers to fire on the unarmed crowds, the Chinese leadership has created an incident that almost surely will haunt the Government for years to come. It is believed here that after the bloodshed of this weekend, it will be incomparably more difficult to rule China. **********Many fewer people than normal were in the streets Sunday and today, and some of them ended up in the hospitals or in the morgues. The number of casualties may never be known, because the Government has asked hospitals not to report any numbers on deaths or injuries. However, based on accounts pieced together from doctors at several hospitals, it seems that at least 200 died in the hospitals and that many other corpses were probably left in the hands of the military. Saving the Living **********''We had to concentrate on those who were still living,'' one doctor said today. ''We had to leave behind most of those who already were dead.'' **********When troops finally seized Tiananmen Square early Sunday morning, they allowed the student occupiers who held on to the center of the square for three weeks to leave and then sent tanks to run over the tents and makeshift encampment that demonstrators had set up. Unconfirmed reports rapidly spread that some students had remained in the tents and were crushed to death. **********The troops sealed off Tiananmen Square and started a huge bonfire. Many Beijing residents drew the conclusion, again impossible to verify, that the soldiers cremated corpses to destroy the evidence. A Higher Estimate **********The student organization that coordinated the long protests continued to function and announced today that 2,600 students were believed to have been killed. Several doctors said that, based on their discussions with ambulance drivers and colleagues who had been on Tiananmen Square, they estimated that at least 2,000 had died. But some of these estimates, based principally on antipathy for the Government, appeared to be high. **********Soldiers also beat and bayonetted students and workers after daybreak on Sunday, witnesses said, usually after some provocation but sometimes entirely at random. **********''I saw a young woman tell the soldiers that they are the people's army, and that they mustn't hurt the people,'' a young doctor said after returning from one clash Sunday. ''Then the soldiers shot her, and ran up and bayonetted her. I ran away, so I couldn't tell if she lived or died.'' **********News of the killings quickly spread to other parts of China, principally by radio reports from the Voice of America and the British Broadcasting Corporation. **********Chinese-language broadcasts have been jammed recently, but not on all frequencies. **********In Shanghai, some supporters of the democracy movement reacted to the killings in Beijing by going on strike, a diplomat there said in a telephone interview. However, few factories are open on Sundays, so the real test of a strike will come today, and many people doubt that a strike will be successful because of a lack of organization among workers. Strike Possibility **********In addition, Shanghai residents expressed protest by erecting barricades throughout the city to block traffic. **********In northeastern China, small demonstrations to protest the killings in Beijing were held in Shenyang, Dalian and Changchun. However, in those areas there has not been much talk of a general strike, a diplomat said. **********Huge convoys of scores of army vehicles, led by tanks, continued to roll through the main roads of Beijing this morning and early afternoon, skirting trucks that had been set on fire by civilians with molotov cocktails. Troops in the vehicles fired their submachine guns constantly, mostly in the air. However, some casualties were reported. **********Troops still fired periodically when clusters of people gathered near the Beijing Hotel, and several people were reported killed and injured. Among them was a middle-aged Western man was hit in the leg and stomach, according to a witness. He could not be immediately identified and his condition was not known. **********In a sign that the troops' mission is not over, the television news today broadcast a letter from the army headquarters to the soldiers, congratulating them on their ''everlasting historic exploits in defending our republic'' and warning that ''the struggle is a long and complicated one.'' **********''Arriving at the scheduled positions and restoring order at the square is only the first elementary victory we have achieved,'' the letter added, without elaborating. ''More dfficult and challenging tasks remain before us.'' **********China's television news on Sunday night showed the army knocking down a replica of the Statue of Liberty that students had put in place on the square. The broadcast hailed troops for ''victoriously crushing this counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' **********The broadcast did not mention civilian casualties, but said that three soldiers had been killed and two were missing. **********In fact, one of the three, a man who was described as ''beaten dead by ruffians on Jianguomen Bridge,'' had actually been run over by an armored personnel carrier. Destruction of Army Vehicles **********The official news also indicated that people had destroyed 31 military trucks, 23 police cars, two armored personnel carriers and 31 buses. But those numbers seemed much too low, for everywhere in Beijing people reacted to the killings by torching vehicles and creating blockades. The troops only controlled a few major thoroughfares, and elsewhere citizens continued to control the streets. **********One soldier who had shot a young child was overpowered by a large crowd in the Chongwenmen district early Sunday, and then hanged and burned as he dangled from a bridge. Troops later arrived at the scene and cut down his smoking corpse. **********The Government issued an announcement calling for the return of weapons it said had been taken from the army, as well as demanding that ''kidnapped'' troops be returned. The announcement could be interpreted as preparing the way for an attack on several universities, on the ground of recovering stolen weapons. **********Student leaders apparently have some submachine guns that were taken from soldiers or from supply trucks, but at least so far they have seemed more interested in displaying the weapons than in using them. Students at People's University also seized an armored personnel carrier this afternoon and drove it around their neighborhood, but there was no indication that they planned to use them against troops. No Word From Deng or Li **********There was no announcement from the senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, Prime Minister Li Peng or other officials who presumably ordered the military attack on student demonstrators. Mr. Li is believed to be winning so far in a major power struggle with the Communist Party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, who favors a more moderate line toward protesters. **********Some accounts had Mr. Deng in poor health, and even in a hospital, but diplomats noted that such rumors invariably surface whenever the 84-year-old leader has been absent from view for a period of time. Mr. Deng has not app eared in public since he met the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, on May 16. **********The demonstrations began after the death April 15 of a former Communist Party leader, Hu Yaobang, who was widely admired for his moderate policies. Until the weekend, both the Government and the demonstrators had been very restrained, but the army's use of violence seemed to radicalize many protesters. **********Students at Beijing University were busy today making firebombs that they planned to hurl against troops whom they expected to assault the campus. Rumors of such an assault circulated throughout the day but by the early hours of Monday morning, none had taken place. A Stunned Response **********Beijing residents seemed stunned by the violent attacks on the protesters for democracy, but unsure how to respond. While many students and young workers are militant and insist that they will win in the long run, older people already seem to have accepted defeat. **********''The democracy movement is already finished,'' a Chinese journalist said despondently. **********After the first attacks Sunday, calls for a general strike were heard from the outraged protesters. However, a physician said that there was little chance for a stppage to succeed because the army would immediately force people to do their jobs on threat of death. **********''We have no guns so we can't fight,'' the doctor said. ''But after a few months, the movement will bubble up again.'' Debris and Chaos **********A long drive through much of the capital on Sunday - on almost deserted streets filled with the twisted remains of barricades run over by tanks and armored personnel carriers - suggested how far the city must go to restore normal conditions. Smoke rises at major intersections from the carcasses of military trucks that have been turned over and set alight, and automatic-weapons fire is now part of Beijing's background noise. **********The northern section of the second ring road was a tangle of debris from road blocks that tanks had pushed aside, as well as long buses that are arranged to block traffic. At every intersection, curls of smoke rose from burning trucks, and in some places when the air is still, the air is so acrid that it is quite uncomfortable. **********More than 100 people, mostly local workers, lined each of the overpasses above the second ring road. They no longer police their own checkpoints, but they still show up to to see if there is anything they can do to keep the government at bay and protect the students. **********It remains very difficult to find out what is happening in other parts of the capital. Telephone services are overloaded and unreliable, and so are the rumor networks. Indiscriminate firing by troops discourages people from staying on the main roads, and barricades make it difficult to take narrower routes. **********No foreigners are known to have been died in the recent shooting, but at least two suffered minor bullet wounds and several other foreigners have been beaten, usually for taking photographs. Two CBS News employees, Richard Roth, a correspondent, and Derek Williams, a cameraman, were released Sunday night after spending the entire day in detention."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/20/business/pentagon-cuts-contract-list.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pentagon Cuts Contract List", "print_headline": "Pentagon Cuts Contract List", "body_text": " **********The Defense Department said Thursday that it would soon raise the dollar amount for contracts listed in its daily report to the public and Congress. **********Effective March 1, the Pentagon said its daily listing of contract awards would be restricted to contracts worth $5 million or more.

But just as investigations into wrongdoing on Wall Street, the Chicago commodity markets and the savings and loan industry are beginning to yield results, the securities, commodities, accounting and other industries have gone to Congress asking to be retroactively relieved of liability under the civil racketeering laws. **********America is suffering through a white collar crime wave. But just as investigations into wrongdoing on Wall Street, the Chicago commodity markets and the savings and loan industry are beginning to yield results, the securities, commodities, accounting and other industries have gone to Congress asking to be retroactively relieved of liability under the civil racketeering laws. Lawmakers should spurn these pleas to weaken the nation's anti-corruption laws. **********The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization law - called RICO - is among the few effective tools against economic crime. Law enforcers have used its enhanced criminal penalties against insider trading and government corruption. The law's civil provisions let victims receive three times their damages plus attorneys' fees, but only if they can prove a pattern of crimes conducted through an organization. **********Civil RICO has been a powerful tool against white collar crime. For example, Federal bank regulators have brought suits against those who purportedly looted savings and loans. A class- action racketeering case is pending against Ivan Boesky. **********Civil RICO's multiple damages let moderate-income consumers have their day in court, too. Victims of retirement home fraud, home improvement fraud and investment scams have successfuly used the law to recover their losses when no other effective remedy was available to them. **********Foes of civil RICO bemoan a flood of lawsuits; actually, it has been more like a trickle. According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, less than one-half of 1 percent of Federal lawsuits are civil RICO cases - and the number is dropping. Even if there are two or three times as many cases as reported, total civil RICO cases still would account for less than 2 percent of the Federal docket. Critics also warn of frivolous suits, but courts quickly dismiss almost all such claims. **********Now, for the third Congress in a row, powerful industries are lobbying to weaken RICO. The most recent version of this bill was introduced last week by Representative Rick Boucher, Senator Dennis DeConcini and others. The resulting legislation is a hodgepodge of special provisions inappropriately benefiting those most in need of strong enforcement. **********Most important, the plan slashes by two-thirds nearly all defendants' liability to victims unless a prosecutor has already won conviction for the same fraud. **********This dramatically dilutes deterrence, since punishment must exceed gain to prevent difficult-to-detect economic crime. Limited punitive damages are available to consumers, but only those who traverse some serious legal barriers. **********Remarkably, the bill would exempt from consumer punitive damages any claim arising out of securities fraud (except for some forms of insider trading). Proponents argue that other securities laws are adequate - a dubious claim in the face of unending scandals on Wall Street. Similarly, the bill exempts from full consumer damages commodities fraud claims. **********At the behest of insurance companies, the legislation includes special procedural roadblocks for regulated industries. This ''affirmative defense'' lets a defendant delay trial by arguing that it relied on the action - or inaction - of a regulatory agency. And while most government agencies retain their right to seek automatic treble damages, insurance commissioners and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, mysteriously enough, are hindered in bringing such suits. **********Finally, the provisions reducing RICO to actual damages would apply retroactively to pending cases. This provides a windfall for defendants whose liability - no matter how clearly established - would be abruptly reduced. And it is unfair to plaintiffs who have invested time and resources pursuing claims. Retroactivity sends a terrible message to corporate defendants: If you can't win your case in court, go to Congress for relief. **********Does RICO need reform? To be sure, it makes sense to remove ''racketeer'' from the statute, so defendants are not smeared simply by being sued. Congress also could avoid abuses by tightening the definition of a ''pattern'' of crimes (the Supreme Court may do just that), and by enhancing penalties for frivolous suits. Protections may be needed to insure that civil RICO is not used as a club in labor-management disputes. **********Civil RICO is not perfect. But it is one of the few Federal laws designed, in the words of Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, ''to attack the business of crime.'' Instead of heeding special-interest pleading, Congress should fine-tune RICO - and strengthen, not weaken, the white collar crime laws."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/16/business/nathan-s-investors-predict-national-growth-for-chain.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1989-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 565, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nathan's Investors Predict National Growth for Chain", "print_headline": "Nathan's Investors Predict National Growth for Chain", "body_text": " **********Nathan's Famous Inc. said yesterday that it planned to accelerate its national expansion after an investor group bought a majority interest in the fast-food chain, which is based in New York. **********Founded in 1916 as a hot-dog stand on Coney Island's boardwalk, Nathan's sells frankfurters, hamburgers, pizza and a variety of other foods at its 30 stores in the New York-New Jersey area. **********About $10 million in Nathan's stock has been purchased by the new group of shareholders and investors led by Benson/Landberg Associates, a partnership specializing in corporate acquisitions and real estate, and Anfang Resources Inc., a real estate investment company, Nathan's said. **********The group acquired more than 50 percent of the ''A'' stock and 100 percent of the ''B'' stock, Nathan's said.

Wojciech Jaruzelski, who let it be known that he would honor a pledge to step down from all party posts after his election nine days ago to the powerful new job of President. **********The session will be called upon to devise immediate policies to deal with the economic crisis and to set the stage for a total overhaul of the party's structure and program at an extraordinary party congress that is expected to take place this fall. **********President Jaruzelski's resolve to step back from party affairs, if carried out, will reflect the measure of the leadership's intention to separate the functions of state and party. That intention was underscored by the party's decision to invite for the first time its 173 members of Parliament to the discussions, although as guests without voting rights. Legislators 'a New Force' **********Janusz Reykowski, a sociologist and member of the Politburo, described the legislators as ''a new force in our discussion.'' **********At a news conference after the first day of debate, Mr. Reykowski said the legislators ''do not want to be treated as an instrument.'' He added, ''They want to take part themselves in shaping policy.'' **********That appeared to dovetail with the wishes of General Jaruzelski, who sought to use the June elections to forge a vanguard against functionaries who oppose change by attracting more aggressive and independent leaders into party ranks. **********The first round of struggle for the succession appeared to open when Wladyslaw Baka, the chief architect of the party's economic policy, announced his resignation as head of the Central Committee's economics department, asserting that failure to abide by the department's recommendations in the last year had touched off Poland's soaring inflation. **********By attacking inflation, Mr. Baka appeared to mount a frontal assault on the incumbent Prime Minister, Mieczyslaw Rakowski.

New Openness of Debate **********Still, the meeting appears to open a new chapter in the openness of debate within party bodies that will allow a measure of factionalism not tolerated until now. **********Describing the mood during the first day of discussion, Mr. Reykowski said there was a strong feeling that the party should shed a ''a certain dogmatic posture'' that prolonged a fiction of ''artificial unity.'' **********There was a minor uproar when one newly elected legislator staunchly defended a colleague, Marian Czerwinski, who broke party discipline in last week's presidential election to vote against General Jaruzelski.

Loewy, senior grain and oil seeds analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. ''But the trade had expected much worse damage.'' Spot Corn Contract Plunges **********At the close yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, the nearest -or spot - corn delivery, for March, was down the daily limit of 10 cents a bushel, at $2.78 1/4. The unrestricted spot January soybean contract fell 37 cents a bushel, to $7.66, and the May delivery fell the daily price limit of 30 cents. Spot soybean oil fell 0.95 cent a pound, to 21.30 cents, and soybean meal plunged $9.70 a ton, to $254. **********Because the bulk of the nation's wheat crop was harvested in early July, before the full impact of the drought was felt, the spot March wheat delivery closed 10 1/4 cents a bushel lower in Chicago, at $4.34 3/4.

As usual, there will be no limits on price moves in the spot months. Some traders in Chicago said the change should eliminate the large pools of unsatisfied orders created by the price limits. Soviet News Is No Surprise **********As for the news from Moscow, Mr. Loewy said the reduced Soviet harvest was in line with trade estimates and had already been factored into the market. A top Soviet official said yesterday that the harvest last year was about 195 million tons, 40 million below the official target. **********Mr. Loewy said the markets had also factored in large crop losses suffered by Canada, a large grain exporter, because of the drought. A severe drought is also devastating crops in Argentina. **********The Soviet Union's import needs are expected to consist mostly of soybean meal, corn and other coarse grains used as animal feed. Brazil, the second-largest exporter of soybeans and byproducts, is only now starting to harvest its crops. Focus on December Report **********The domestic grain and oil seeds trade focused on the December crop report, Mr. Loewy noted. **********''While the Agriculture Department put last summer's corn crop at 4.92 billion bushels, down 30 percent from the previous season, most market participants expected a much lower figure,'' he said. ''Also viewed as bearish was the nation's corn stockpile, although it fell to roughly 7 billion bushels from 9.77 billion.'' **********Even the sharp drop in the soybean harvest to 1.5 billion bushels, from 1.9 billion, failed to impress traders. Many had apparently expected the drought to reduce the crop even more. Nor did the drop in the estimated soybean carry-over from the previous harvest, to about 125 million bushels from 302 million, generate much buying enthusiasm, Mr. Loewy said. **********But an estimate of the winter wheat acreage was viewed as bullish, he said. The Department of Agriculture reported that 54.45 million acres were planted in winter wheat last fall. Winter wheat accounts for about 75 percent of the total wheat output. **********''The trade has expected winter wheat acreage to be 58 million acres,'' Mr. Loewy said. ''Also considered bullish were the total wheat estimate and carry-over.'' **********Total wheat output was put at 1.81 billion bushels, down from 2.1 billion the previous season.

Majority Doubt It", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; Recession in '89? Majority Doubt It", "body_text": " **********WHAT lies ahead for the economy in 1989? **********The consensus forecast among American economists is for strong growth in the first half of the year. With the economy up against its capacity the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten the money supply and push up interest rates, slowing down the rate of growth in the second half. But the majority of economists say there will be no recession in 1989. **********According to preliminary findings of the latest survey of Blue Chip Economic Indicators, only 33 percent of economists now expect a recession to start in 1989, compared with 40 percent of those surveyed in September. **********Twenty-seven percent of the 44 economists polled thus far predict that the next recession will not come until 1990, down from 49 percent in September. And, most reassuringly, 40 percent see no recession until 1991, up from 9 percent in September. **********But how severe do the economists expect a recession to be, whenever it begins? Robert J. Eggert, the former chief economist of the Ford Motor Company, who conducts the Blue Chip survey, is in a minority of one among the group of 44 in predicting that it will be more severe than the 1981-82 recession. Of the 44 economists reporting, 37 expect the next recession to be milder than the 1981-82 recession, deepest of the postwar period. Only five expect the next recession to be as severe as that one. Most expect it to last only two to three quarters. (The final results of the survey, covering 50 economists, will be released Tuesday.) Apparently the majority believe that the Government and the Federal Reserve have the means and the will to prevent the next recession from turning into a protracted calamity. The ability of the economy to withstand the shock of the October 1987 stock market crash seems to have reinforced economists' belief in the stability of the system. **********But some participants in the financial markets are not so sanguine. Some fear that the United States is losing its economic and political leadership, and that the consequences will be grave. At a recent seminar of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in New York, George Soros, president of the Soros Management Fund Inc., said the October 1987 stock market crash marked ''the transfer of economic and financial power from the United States to Japan.'' **********Mr. Soros held that Japan has emerged as the world's banker, taking deposits from, making loans to, and investing in the rest of the world. He declared, ''It is only a matter of time before the yen supplants the dollar as the international reserve currency.'' Arguing that the central lesson of last year's crash was that the world financial system cannot function without a stable currency as its foundation, he contended that the weakness of the dollar presaged ''a period of continuing turmoil in financial markets.'' **********At the same meeting, David A. Stockman, President Reagan's former budget director who is now a general partner of the Blackstone Group, said the tax cuts of the 1980's and the buildup of American military expenditures were ''clearly overdone,'' and maintained that this was still ''not fully appreciated or even understood in Washington - in neither branch of Government.'' **********The 1987 stock market crash, he said, had not ''penetrated conventional thinking,'' which holds that the deficit problem can be solved incrementally. ''This is not likely to change,'' Mr. Stockman said, ''until there are truly disastrous dramatic international shocks, which are not likely to occur before 1990-1991.'' This would leave the consensus view of the economists for 1989 intact - with financial disaster around the corner. **********But Prof. Robert Mundell of Columbia University saw no such great imbalance in the world. He said Japan was ''producing things that we need and this can be the basis of the U.S.-Japan partnership.'' He disagreed with Mr. Soros that the yen was about to replace the dollar, as the dollar replaced the pound after the 1929 crash. **********Anthony Solomon, formerly president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and now chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA.) Inc., agreed with Mr. Mundell that there would be no dramatic move away from the dollar to the yen, though he expected the dollar to stay weak for many years. Mr. Solomon saw a gradual change in the currency system, in which the yen, instead of representing 7 percent of the world's reserves, might go up to 25 percent, the West German mark, instead of constituting 11 percent, might rise to 20 percent, and the dollar, instead of representing nearly 80 percent, would decline to 40 to 50 percent. **********The gradual erosion of American economic growth, many economists now warn, could cause international political instability. Where the prospects of long-term slow growth in the United States would show up, Mr. Solomon said, would be in ''the enormous domestic pressure to place limits on its security responsibilities.'' Pressures are building, he said, to bring American troops home from Europe. **********The most important political event of 1988 was probably the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's overtures to the United States and the growing prospects of detente - and reduced military outlays - in both the capitalist and Communist sides. **********In the capitalist world, it could mean avoiding the financial crisis that some experts and much of the public still fear. **********The hope is that 1989 will not only continue the long spell of economic growth that most economists expect, but also mark the beginning of a cure for the underlying economic and political problems that so weakened the United States and threw such a scare into world financial markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/19/business/company-news-combustion-engineering-pact.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Combustion Engineering Pact", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Combustion Engineering Pact", "body_text": " **********Combustion Engineering Inc. and Paris-based Alsthom S.A. announced plans today to combine their steam-boiler businesses in a joint venture that would have combined revenues of about $2 billion.

''But in the longer term, it will leave a very serious scar in the minds of people who should be cooperating with each other.'' **********The American-Japanese dispute centers on an agreement reached at the end of the Reagan Administration to share high technology information and then jointly develop an advanced fighter to be known as the FSX. The plane would involve Japanese modifications of the American F-16. A Split in the Administration **********Congressional criticism of the accord prompted a review that brought to light differences within the Bush Administration over the wisdom of going ahead. Accordingly, Mr. Bush decided to try to seek revisions this month to prevent a giveaway of technology secrets to Japan for use in developing its own aircraft industry, potentially undercutting the United States. The Administration also seeks to determine the Japanese technology that the United States might expect to share as a result of the project. **********Japan resisted the changes, arguing that it never wanted to develop and build the FSX plane with the United States in the first place. Only under pressure from the Reagan Administration did Japan agree last year to a joint $1.2 billion project instead of building a plane on its own. **********One Japanese official said the FSX dispute was ''the most intense case I've ever seen'' on matters relating to defense issues. Is National Security an Issue?  He and others complained that the United States seemed to be invoking national security concerns in the case of the FSX simply to gain economic advantage - the Commerce Department has been raising the issue of national security while the Pentagon has been pushing hard for the FSX deal. **********As for American fears that Japan could use the information gained from the deal to develop a civilian aircraft industry, officials point out that the accord had already called for the plane's flight computer to be ''sealed'' from Japanese engineers. **********Under American pressure, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita last week dispatched the deputy director general of the defense agency, Seiki Nishihiro, to discuss the changes requested by Bush Administration officials in Washington. Mr. Nishihiro is due back in Japan later this week. **********Mr. Takeshita is widely seen here as having limited latitude to make concessions because financial scandals and the introduction of a new sales tax have sent his popularity skidding in recent weeks. Government officials say the dispute over the FSX could not have come at a worse time for him. The 'Clarifications' **********Some Japanese newspapers reported today that the Bush Administration and Japan were close to agreement on a set of ''clarifications'' that would permit the project to go forward. Among these clarifications were reported to be protection of American high technology secrets and a possible guarantee that American contractors will receive 35 to 40 percent of the multibillion-dollar production work in the 1990's. **********But Japanese officials said enormous damage had already been done by Mr. Bush's demand that the original agreement be revised. In addition, officials said they were apprehensive because the deal has raised opposition in Congress, where a movement seems to be growing to block it altogether. **********A top official said there was particular dismay in the Government that Japan was increasingly viewed in Washington, especially in the Congress, as ''a more alarming kind of ally - not really an enemy, but a country to watch, maybe comparable to the Soviet Union.'' **********He was referring to widely discussed news reports here quoting members of Congress and some in the Bush Administration portraying Japan as more of a fierce rival than a friend. An article today in Asahi Shimbun, Japan's No. 2 newspaper in circulation, referred to a new round of ''Japan bashing'' and to resentment among Americans that Japan had become ''a giant in their daily life.'' The Toshiba Dispute **********Japan and the United States have gone through several contentious disputes in the last several years on trade issues, reflecting American difficulties in adjusting to growing Japanese economic power. Of special concern in the United States is the fear that Japan is gaining superiority in computers, electronics and other areas deemed vital to American national security. **********Among the recent disputes have been American charges that Japan was exporting semiconductors, or micro-electronic chips, below cost to drive American manufacturers out of business. Two years ago, the United States was also angry that the Toshiba Corporation shipped large machine tools to the Soviet Union for use in making submarines that run more quietly, damaging Western and Japanese security. **********American second thoughts about the FSX deal have led to second thoughts in some quarters in Japan, with some defense industry people saying that Tokyo should walk away and develop the plane on its own or seek a European partner. But these views are not reflected in Mr. Takeshita's Government, Japanese officials say. 'Politically a Good Deal' **********''Some sectors of Japanese industry do favor the demise of this project,'' said an official. ''But the view of the Government is that this is politically a good deal because of the sharing by each side.'' **********A senior official at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the prime Japanese military contractor, also expressed hope that the project could go forward as a precursor to further military cooperation. ''The Japanese side does not wish to see this good arrangement slip through our fingers,'' Takaaki Yamada, executive vice president of the company, said in an interview. **********He added that it would be difficult for Japan to proceed by itself, but that the most important reason for a joint arrangement was the need for cooperation between allies. ''It is important that the U.S. side be familiar with Japanese support fighter aircraft,'' he said. **********The FSX is the product of years of Japanese efforts to develop a civilian and military aerospace industry, becoming competitive in an area where the United States still maintains superiority. All along, Japan said it wanted to develop its own expertise in this area, and it rejected an American offer to sell F-16 planes outright, saying that the plane was not suitable to Japan's defense needs. **********The Reagan Administration, meanwhile, made a calculation that it could benefit from the deal by having American defense contractors, led by the General Dynamics Corporation, receive 35 to 40 percent of the $1.2 billion development costs, and possibly some of the multibillion-dollar production costs if the plane proves itself. **********In addition, advocates of the deal say the United States stands to gain from learning about Japanese technology, particularly the use of strong and lightweight composite materials for the aircraft wing. Washington also wants to cement Japanese-American cooperation on developing the Strategic Defense Initiative, the American anti-missile program also known as ''Star Wars.'' **********Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is considered the potential prime contractor on any deal to cooperate on ''Star Wars.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/the-media-business-advertising-hill-and-burson-at-top-of-latest-survey.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Hill and Burson at Top Of Latest Survey", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Hill and Burson at Top Of Latest Survey", "body_text": " **********Hill & Knowlton and Burson-Marsteller again finished first and second, respectively, in the annual ranking by size of public relations agencies by O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms, the influential industry directory. **********Jack O'Dwyer, the publisher, released the 1988 survey yesterday, which showed that Hill & Knowlton, owned by WPP Group, finished the year with $145 million in net fees, a 29.6 percent gain over 1987, and that Burson, owned by Young & Rubicam, finished with $138.6 million, an 18 percent gain.

No Chance of Winning **********During that competition, Hazeltine hired Mr. Muldoon as a consultant. The affidavit said Mr. Muldoon learned details of the Pentagon's evaluations of competing companies from a fourth consultant, Mark Saunders, and passed the information to a Hazeltine official. **********The information, which showed that Hazeltine stood no chance of winning the competition, enabled the company to end its expensive effort to secure the radio contract, the affidavit stated. **********The affidavit contended that Mr. Saunders had obtained that information from a second Navy official, George Stone, a manager in the Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Command."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/06/business/business-people-expansion-on-its-mind-nestor-picks-first-chief.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1989-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 373, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Expansion on Its Mind, Nestor Picks First Chief", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Expansion on Its Mind, Nestor Picks First Chief", "body_text": " **********Nestor Inc., a small scientific company that deals in neural network computer systems, yesterday named a chief executive, David Fox, in a move to broaden its management. **********Mr. Fox, 53, brings ''a proven capacity to run an operation poised on the brink of major expansion,'' the company said.

''At the time, he said such a party could never hurt the people. But he was wrong. And so many party members think the same way he does. They are all deluded.'' **********Despair seemed to silence the woman's sobs as she sat on an old bench outside the intensive care unit where her husband lay. The despair was accompanied by a fear that kept her from disclosing her name. A City of Sorrow **********Throughout the capital today, untold numbers of people found their lives shattered by a similar grief. Their tales were all different, but they were bound by a common source of tragedy - the military crackdown against China's democracy movement - and by a common rage at the Government. Beijing today was nothing so much as a city of sorrow. **********The woman's husband, a 31-year-old engineer who has seven Chinese patents to his name, had sensed that something would happen Saturday night, and he had made sure to carry a piece of paper with his name, address and phone number on it. **********Early in the night, the two of them had gone out together and seen the troops chatting rather comfortably with local residents.

It lasted seven hours. **********The hospitals this afternoon were calmer than in the early morning, when wounded students and workers were brought in every few minutes. Several stretchers are still splotched with blood stains, but the pools of blood on the hospital floors are gone and the frenzy has subsided. **********The possibility that the bloodshed may continue alarms doctors, however.

''If there are many more wounded again in the next couple of days, we won't be able to handle them.'' **********The growing expectation of a widespread crackdown frightens some hospital employees from revealing details about their patients or the number of deaths, and doctors at several hospitals say they have been told that visitors other than kin or close friends are not allowed through the gates. **********This afternoon, sympathetic workmen led a reporter into the Union Medical College Hospital by an underground passage, past the guards at the gate. **********A small crowd gathered in the center of one of the special wards, where the bloodied young men and women lay side by side on mattresses on the floor.

Without the cooperation of the army, it was difficult to enter or leave certain parts of the Tiananmen area with the wounded. Bullet Holes in an Ambulance **********One doctor who traveled in his hospital's ambulance to Tiananmen Square said machine guns raked the sides of the ambulance when it was making its way out of the square with several wounded citizens. He showed the bullet holes in the vehicle. **********Everywhere in the hospital corridors there were stories of dashed hopes and lives that had been changed forever by a moment on Tiananmen Square. **********A 24-year-old Government official was fleeing from a volley of bullets on a side street just northeast of the square when three men near him were hit with bullets. He went to help them, but a People's Liberation Army officer stopped him from tending the wounded. **********''Don't stir or you will be dead,'' a soldier said as he pointed a rifle at the official's head.

Even Shoppers Are Shot **********A 28-year-old Government official stayed at home during the night and wandered out only at daylight to see what happened. When he strolled over at 9 A.M. to the Beijing Hotel, a few hundred yards east of the square, he was shot in the hip. **********''I feel as though my leg isn't there,'' he moaned to a doctor beside him.

''The new administration in Washington should dump it.'' **********Under terms of the embargo, no American goods other than medicine and certain other items considered humanitarian may be shipped to Nicaragua. Its effect has been felt by owners of farms and factories, many of them private entrepreneuers who rely on replacement parts from the United States. Consumers here, long accustomed to American products, have been forced to change their habits. Effect Called Modest **********But economists say the true effect of the embargo has been modest. Many spare parts can be bought from other Western countries, and those available only in the United States are imported through companies in Panama and elsewhere. At hard-currency stores now functioning in most Nicaraguan cities, shelves are lined with Campbell's soups, Kleenex, Oreo cookies and a host of other American products that theoretically should not be available here. **********Customs agents at American airports have periodically confiscated small amounts of goods being carried into Nicaragua by tourists and agents at the Mexican border have detained several caravans carrying supplies donated by private groups. But whenever an American item is needed in Nicaragua, it is easily obtained despite the embargo. **********No other country observes trade sanctions against Nicaragua. Much of the business once conducted here by American companies is now being done by companies from Canada, Brazil, Japan and other countries. **********In 1984, the last year before the trade embargo was imposed, 17 percent of Nicaragua's foreign commerce was with the United States. 'It Just Costs More' **********The embargo also prevents Americans from importing Nicaraguan goods. The Sandinista Government has dealt with this provision in various ways. Some products that were once sold in the United States, like bananas, are now being shipped to Europe and elsewhere. Others, like frozen seafood, find their way onto American shelves in the guise of exports from Honduras. **********''The embargo has had no practical effect,'' said Gilberto Cuadra, who heads Nicaragua's largest business federation. ''I don't even know if there really is an embargo. Everything seems to get through; it just costs more.'' **********The Reagan Administration imposed the embargo as part of an effort to bring the Sandinistas to their knees economically. The United States also discouraged its allies from aiding Nicaragua, and urged international financial institutions not to approve Nicaraguan loan requests. **********Partly as a result of these measures, the economy is indeed in ruins, but the ultimate goal of deposing the Government seems no nearer than before the embargo.

Families were wiped out, while their next-door neighbors were untouched. **********Perhaps the most striking case was that of Stephen Flannigan, 14 years old, who was saved when part of the plane crashed into his house and killed the rest of his family. But Stephen had gone outside to fix his sister's bicycle. Joanne Flannigan, his sister, will be the first local victim buried Thursday. **********More than 700 people filed into the Dryfesdale church, made of reddish brown sandstone, some wearing white carnations, some bearing bouquets, some weeping.

Congress approved the accord in September. **********Duties are being reduced or eliminated in more than 8,000 categories in the start of a 10-year process that will end practically all trade barriers between the countries. **********What is already the world's largest bilateral trade - in 1987 Canada and the United States exchanged $161 billion worth of goods and services - is expected to get even bigger, stimulating economic growth and exerting far-reaching influences on the global trading system. $2 Less for a Skateboard Herbert C. Charlton, president of the Dominion Skate Company of Brampton, Ontario, which makes ice skates and skateboards, and George Montgomery, director of marketing for the K-2 Corporation of Vashon, Wash., an American ski manufacturer, are among business executives laying plans to capitalize on the cuts. **********Mr. Charlton's Ultimate and Firefly skateboards, which now sell in the United States for $25 to $50, could be about $2 cheaper after the 4.6 percent American skateboard tariff is abolished. **********Dominion's chrome-tempered skates, which cost $50 to $100 a pair in the United States, could be $3 to $4 cheaper with the lifting of a 5.8 percent tariff. **********Mr. Charlton said his principal competition in the United States market is from producers in East Asian nations, which will get no tariff relief and will therefore be less able to cut prices. **********''We foresee a doubling of our sales over the next five years,'' he said. A Ski Company's Hopes **********Mr. Montgomery said his K-2 skis, which sell in Montreal and Toronto for about $400 a pair, should be about $25 cheaper after the elimination of an 11.3 percent tariff on skis. ''We have targeted the Canadian market for growth,'' he said. **********The other principal American maker of downhill skis, the Olin Ski Company of Middletown, Conn., is also gearing up for the Canadian market, said its president, Robert B. Colburn. **********Both are emphasizing the tariff action in their sales literature and in presentations in Canada. American ski exports to Canada now stand at about $2 million a year; Canada exports no skis to the United States. **********The main competition is from French and Austrian companies, which must still pay the 11.3 percent tariff on their skis. **********But retail experts caution against expecting widespread price cuts immediately. If savings are passed on -and they could be absorbed by distributors before reaching the consumer - they would not become visible until current inventories, acquired at existing tariff levels, are depleted. 'Incredibly Good Thing' **********William Kay Daines, executive vice president of the American Retail Federation, representing one million retail establishments, termed the agreement an ''incredibly good thing.'' **********He said that in the present highly competitive retail environment in the United States he expected most of the tariff savings to be passed on. **********''I'm sure the retailers will have to pass them on,'' he said. ''The competition is such that no one can hold the price if the entry cost is reduced.'' **********He also said domestically produced goods should be under some price pressure from the Canadian competition, and that this should act as a brake on United States inflation. **********''The immediate business impact will be modest,'' said Ann Hughes, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for the Western Hemisphere. ''The consumer impact should be a little more significant.'' **********Although Canada and the United States have substantially lowered tariffs in seven postwar rounds of trade liberalization and 70 percent of bilateral trade is already duty-free, tariffs continue to act as significant barriers in certain sectors. **********Canadian exporters of petrochemical products, for example, face an American duty of 18 percent on methanol. American furniture makers must overcome Canadian tariffs of 15 percent. **********Over all, the average Canadian tariffs, at 9.5 percent, are about twice as high as American tariffs. Complex Transition Schedule **********Under the free trade agreement, which was negotiated by the Governments in 1987 and signed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on New Year's Day of 1988, all tariffs were either wiped out or cut by 10 percent or 20 percent. **********A complex transition schedule calls for products that have the least impact on domestic employment to be the first to lose protection. **********Losing all protection now are computers, furs, whisky, skates, knitting needles, skis, vending machines, motorcycles, ferro-alloys and air brakes for railroad cars. **********Tariffs on a second cluster of products were cut 20 percent and will be cut an additional 20 percent annually over four years. These include furniture, paper and paper products, some telecommunications equipment, chemicals, subway cars and after-market auto parts. **********And finally, tariff cuts on the products with the most impact on domestic employment are phased in at 10 percent a year for 10 years. These include most farm products, textiles and apparel, softwood plywood, steel, rail cars, tires and appliances. **********Industries on both sides of the border were trying to assess the probable impact. **********In furs, for example, Canadian dressed skins of beaver, fox, chinchilla and ermine will come in minus an 8 percent tariff, which will lower costs of manufacturing fur coats in the United States. **********Canada's 25 percent duty on imports of fur coats has been eliminated, and this could help American coat makers export more to Canada. The Canadian fur industry has expressed concern. **********''We'll be monitoring this situation very closely,'' said David Sebben, marketing director of the Canadian Fur Trade Association.

State Assurances Received **********Public Service, which is seeking an arrangement that will allow the company to be reorganized without being taken over, said it had received assurances from the state that the rate package approved for Northeast would also be approved if presented by Public Service. **********''We think we've made a lot of progress,'' said Nicholas J.

And largely because of Zantac, Glaxo's pretax earnings topped $:1 billion ($1.6 billion) in the year that ended June 30. **********But Dr. Mario, the first American to head the company, knows Glaxo cannot afford to ''get too heady.'' It must keep Zantac's sales growing until an array of promising new drugs comes to market in the 1990's. In the last fiscal year, Zantac accounted for 50.2 percent of Glaxo's sales of $3.98 billion. **********''The challenge at Glaxo is to defend and build on Zantac's existing franchise and to follow on with commercially meaningful products to take up the slack as Zantac slows,'' said Ronald M. Nordmann, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York. **********Glaxo hopes to promote new uses for Zantac - like a formulation for children and a lower-dose version for adults to prevent ulcers from recurring. And Sir Paul Girolami, the 63-year-old chairman, believes that Glaxo, the world's fourth-largest drug company, can take additional market share from Zantac competitors like Tagamet. Zantac catapulted Glaxo from No. 25 in the industry in 1981 to No. 2, before two recent mergers pushed it down two notches. **********Meanwhile, Zantac's growth is slowing, although the drug's sales still increased by 30.5 percent in the fiscal year 1989 while the anti-ulcer market grew by just 20 percent. Analysts expect Zantac's sales growth to decelerate by three or four percentage points a year. **********In addition, Glaxo executives know only too well after what they did to SmithKline Beckman, whose Tagamet had been the dominant anti-ulcer drug, that being No. 1 is one thing, and staying No. 1 is another. **********Zantac, which is similar to Tagamet, is not a revolutionary ulcer treatment. Glaxo simply outmarketed SmithKline, sending Tagamet's sales into a tailspin and SmithKline into the arms of Beecham, the British company with which it recently merged. Zantac now has 53 percent of the American market to Tagamet's 28 percent. **********There is no shortage of competitors who would like to do to Zantac what Glaxo did to Tagamet. Glaxo is counting on the merging of operations at SmithKline Beecham to distract that company for a while. Merck Is Feared **********But a competitor that Glaxo has every right to fear is Merck & Company, the world's largest pharmaceutical concern and a formidable marketer. ''Anytime Merck comes into the market, you can't take them lightly,'' said the 51-year-old Dr. Mario, an irrepressible cheerleader who has spent much of his time urging on Glaxo's troops around the world since he became chief executive in May. **********Merck's Pepcid, which, like Zantac and Tagamet, is what is known as an H2 antagonist, has been growing rapidly and will have about $400 million in sales this year, up from $280 million last year, Mr. Nordmann of Paine Webber predicts. **********In what analysts call a much bigger threat, Merck in late September introduced Losec in the United States, a drug many experts believe is a revolutionary ulcer treatment. Made from a compound called omeprazole, Losec is what is known as a proton-pump inhibitor and is much more effective in reducing acid production than H2 antagonists. Merck is licensing Losec from A.B. Astra of Sweden, which has been selling it in parts of Europe for about a year. **********Glaxo's leaders like to dwell on the problems with Losec - namely that in some tests it caused rats to develop tumors. Glaxo had a similar drug ''and we decided not to develop it because of the same safety issues,'' Dr. Mario said. **********Satisfied that the drug is safe, however, several European countries allow Losec to be used to treat a broad range of conditions, including duodenal ulcers, the most common peptic ulcers and a big market for Zantac. **********But the Food and Drug Administration has so far given Losec only limited approval, for the short-term treatment of certain acute illnesses. 'Still Very Hopeful' **********Merck and Astra are trying to get the F.D.A. to broaden the approval. ''We're still very hopeful that Losec will be a big drug for Merck,'' said Cindy Zarsky, a Merck spokeswoman. **********Astra contends that Glaxo is using the hardball tactics for which it is legendary to fight Losec and is having its sales force raise the safety question with hospitals and physicians. ''That's Glaxo's strategy,'' said Staffan Ternby, an Astra spokesman. **********Even though Glaxo's sales force of 2,000 is outnumbered in the United States by a Merck force that Mr. Nordmann puts at 2,700, part of Hoffmann-La Roche's American sales force of 1,200 also markets Zantac. **********Given Glaxo's marketing prowess and the limited approval so far in the United States, most analysts expect Losec's sales to increase slowly. ''It's a challenge to Zantac, but I don't think Losec is going to do to Zantac what Zantac did to Tagamet,'' said Eile Gibson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. Promising New Drugs **********Of the drugs in Glaxo's pipeline, the company sees three as the most promising: odansetron, a compound intended to counter vomiting of those undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment; sumatriptan, a possibly revolutionary treatment for migraine headaches, and salmeterol, an asthma drug. **********Salmeterol is important because the patent for Ventolin, Glaxo's mainstay asthma drug, expired in Britain in 1987 and expires in the United States at the end of this year. After Zantac, respiratory drugs are Glaxo's most important. In the fiscal year 1989 they generated revenues of $906.8 million, or 22.8 percent of Glaxo's total. Glaxo has 42 percent of the world market. **********But Dr. Mario, who still gets excited when he recalls getting his first bike when he was 12, can barely contain himself when he talks about the anti-migraine and anti-emetic drugs. **********The anti-migraine, he said, ''is very, very important because there are people suffering today who can't find relief.'' He added, ''There is nothing that is safe and effective. And odansetron is the first really safe anti-vomiting agent.'' Market Potential Studied **********Analysts are uncertain about the size of the market for Glaxo's anti-emetic: estimates range from $120 million to $150 million a year. But they think that if the anti-migraine drug is as good as Glaxo bills it to be, it could be another Zantac, with sales possibly topping more than $1 billion. **********To be sure, other competitors are working on similar drugs. SmithKline Beecham and Sandoz, the Swiss drug company, are developing similar anti-emetics, and Eli Lilly, analysts say, is working on an anti-migraine drug. **********Glaxo is thought to be at least a step ahead in the race to bring the anti-emetics to market and even farther ahead with its anti-migraine. But it typically takes at least three years from the time a drug is introduced to market it globally, which would give competitors a chance to close the gap. **********Glaxo's leaders are undaunted. ''We're not worried about competition, we thrive on it,'' said Sir Paul, Glaxo's chairman. 'Great Failure' Seen **********In many ways, Sir Paul, who joined Glaxo as financial controller in 1966 and became chief executive in 1980, was the one who transformed the company into a global giant. When he talks about Tagamet, it is clear where Glaxo got its aggressive drive. **********''It is a great failure on our part that Tagamet still exists,'' he said, only partly in jest. **********Sir Paul focused on prescription drugs, moving Glaxo not only into many other European countries but also into Japan and the United States. In the 1980's, he sold a number of businesses, which were involved with generic drugs, pharmaceutical wholesaling, veterinary products and infant food and nutritional products. A Grand Alliance **********It was Sir Paul who played a leading role in devising the critically important alliance with Hoffmann-La Roche to co-market Zantac in the United States. The alliance was extraordinary in that Glaxo retained total control. **********But if Sir Paul has been Glaxo's grand strategist, Dr. Mario, a janitor's son from New Jersey, has proved himself to be its grand operating man in the three years since he joined as president of Glaxo Inc., the American subsidiary. **********In the early 1980's, Glaxo had greater sales in Nigeria than in the United States, the world's biggest drug market. Now it is No. 2 in America, behind only Merck, and the United States accounts for 41 percent of Glaxo Holdings' sales. Under Dr. Mario, the American sales force more than tripled and the research and development staff has nearly doubled, to more than 600. **********Sir Paul and Dr. Mario intend to keep Glaxo focused on what it does best: developing and marketing prescription drugs. They see a third of Glaxo's growth in five years coming from Zantac, a third from other existing products and a third from new products. **********Glaxo's leaders want to continue to build the company's research strength. In the last fiscal year, expenditures on research and development totaled $500.7 million, up 40 percent from the previous year. That amount is budgeted to rise an additional 36 percent in this fiscal year. **********Glaxo's research operations are already highly respected in the industry. They are headed by Richard B. Sykes, who left Glaxo in 1977 to join Squibb in the United States, and returned in 1986. **********It was Dr. Sykes who brought Dr. Mario to Sir Paul's attention. Dr. Mario had been running Squibb's medical instruments business, but Squibb decided to divest itself of half of that business. Dr. Mario, who at one point also ran Squibb's chemicals business, had gone to Squibb from SmithKline Beckman. **********Glaxo's leaders are not panicking about the mergers of SmithKline and Beecham and Bristol-Myers and Squibb, which will make them larger than Glaxo. Indeed, they feel that if those companies had Glaxo's drug pipeline and marketing force they would not have needed to merge. **********In their view, the biggest threat to Glaxo is its phenomenal success. While celebrating Glaxo's triumphs, Dr. Mario also said he has felt compelled to ''make sure everyone recalls that six to eight years ago we were a dot on the horizon.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/24/world/quotation-of-the-day-480989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quotation of the Day", "print_headline": "Quotation of the Day", "body_text": " **********''Everywhere people were falling around me.

My view is that HDTV will take longer to become widely available than most people think and that it will not alter the decline of the American consumer electronics industry. HDTV has, however, been helpful in focusing attention on the need for an American industrial policy. I am cautious about HDTV for three reasons: First, HDTV will take longer to become widely available than many people expect. A review of the pace of introduction of color TV as an enhancement of black-and-white TV, or of FM radio as an enhancement of AM radio, shows that these successful technologies took four to five years, from initial commercial availability to about 1 percent penetration. To reach over 50 percent of households, took another 10 years. Video cassette recorders, show a similar pattern. **********Successful consumer product revolutions in the United States take 10 to 15 years on average. In my view, HDTV will probably not achieve a 1 percent penetration level before 1995, and will not be widely implemented in a majority of homes until 8 to 10 years later. **********Second, improved TV picture clarity will arrive via several different technologies. I see a reasonable prospect for fully distinct American, Japanese, and European HDTV standards, with American standard-setting delayed until at least 1991. Furthermore, I see existing American conventional TV as a moving and improving target for HDTV to compete against. **********Part of the opportunity that HDTV enthusiasts point to - for more video memory, faster digital signal processors and analog/digital converters - will also be driven by enhancements to conventional TV. **********Third, HDTV manufacturing will almost certainly continue to be dominated by the existing non-American worldwide consumer electronics leaders. Over the last 40 years, American-owned manufacturers have seen their domestic market share decline from nearly 100 percent to less than 15 percent. There is no reason to believe this decline will be reversed without changes in the way Americans do business and in the way those business are regulated and protected. **********HDTV in the United States could enhance some opportunities for the Zenith Electronics Corporation, and it could fuel downstream product development for North American semiconductor, telecommunications equipment and flat-panel display manufacturers. Texas Instruments Inc.'s announcement last week that it will license technology from NHK, Japan's public television company, will enhance Texas Instruments' component sales in Japan and the United States. **********But the principal beneficiaries of HDTV will likely be the vertically integrated worldwide consumer electronics leaders - Sony, NEC, Mitsubishi, Philips and others. This outcome results from a condition of open international trade and investment flows, and from worldwide market share expansion won by the most competitive producers. **********HDTV has been used in Washington to help focus attention on the need for a stronger industrial policy. A number of groups - including former President Reagan's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness, the M.I.T. Commission on Industrial Competitiveness and more recently the Electronics Industries Association's Advanced Television Committee - have advocated policies to reverse long-term declines in American manufacturing productivity and world trade. These analyses emphasize the need for economy-wide, rather than piecemeal policies.

Page 5. ] **********The Bush Administration decision, in effect, means that the political goal of American policy in Afghanistan now that the Soviet troop withdrawal is virtually complete is to hasten the collapse of the Kabul Government. **********It also underscores the Reagan Administration's policy formulated at the time of the United Nations-sponsored Geneva accords that American aid to the guerrillas is not contingent on the presence of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The Soviets are scheduled to complete their withdrawal by Wednesday.  Called a Change of Emphasis **********''As long as Najibullah holds on, the potential and risk of Soviet activity is very much alive,'' a senior Administration official said, referring to the Afghan President. ''If the Administration took the policy decision to cut off aid because of Soviet good behavior, it would be hard to get started again if the Soviets start up again.'' **********Senior Administration officials assert that the decision does not reflect a change in policy, only a change in emphasis because of new circumstances in light of the Soviet withdrawal. But the decision to continue military aid to the rebels is likely to be interpreted in Moscow as an uncooperative step. **********In a speech to the United Nations on Dec. 7, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, outlined a new plan for an Afghan settlement, including a cease-fire to be policed by United Nations peacekeeping forces, negotiations to form a new government and a cutoff of military aid to the warring factions. **********The United States rejected the proposal, arguing that it was up to the Afghans to decide their own political future. In addition, the United States did not want to seem to be lending credibility to the Kabul Government. **********Mr. Gorbachev's proposal was a reversal of a position taken last spring, when the United States failed to persuade Moscow to agree to a ban on all new military shipments. As a consequence, the United States made clear in a document separate from the Geneva accords that mandated a Soviet troop withdrawal by Feb. 15 that it retained the right to ship weapons to the guerrillas, an arrangement that became known as ''positive symmetry.'' Bush Wants Own Imprint **********''Our basic policy is support for the resistance,'' a senior State Department official said in describing today's meeting. ''Our policy remains one of positive symmetry.'' Administration officials said continuing military support for the rebels does not reflect a violation of ''positive symmetry.'' The official said, ''We never said our support to the rebels would be proportional to what the Soviets sent.'' **********Mr. Bush has decided that he wants to put his own imprint on American policy toward Afghanistan, a key component of the so-called Reagan doctrine, which supported ''freedom fighters'' against Communist governments around the world. Last week Mr. Bush ordered the National Security Council to conduct a high-level interagency review of the policy. The State Department, the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and the White House have agreed that the military aid should continue, officials said. U.S. Aid Authorized **********The continuation of American aid to the guerrillas in the post-Soviet era does not require a new intelligence ''finding'' because the current finding authorizes the United States to aid the rebels in the absence of Soviet troops. **********Administration officials said Mr. Bush will have to act formally on a decision document before the recommendation becomes policy. They added that even after the decision was formalized, there would be no need to inform Moscow, although Pakistan, which has channeled the shipment of American military aid to the rebels, will be kept informed along the way. **********The military aid program to the rebels is is run by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon, and Administration officials declined to specify the level or type of equipment the United States might ship to the rebels in the future. **********American military aid to the Afghan rebels is estimated to have totaled $600 million last year. American aid has included Stinger missiles, infantry equipment and other arms, as well as clothing, food and medicine. **********Officals acknowledged that the rebels have received large amounts of supplies in anticipation of the Soviet troop withdrawal.

The Nikkei 225 average fell 575 points, or 1.8 percent, to 31,876.86 during the six trading days through yesterday. **********Japan's stock market has been the wonder of the financial world for years. In 1987 the Tokyo market suffered the least when all the world's markets crashed. In 1988 it was the best performer among major markets, and international money managers who eschewed the Japanese market looked bad in the performance ratings. Over the last four years stocks in Japan have risen more than four times as fast as stocks in the United States. **********Foreigners, who were net sellers of Japanese stocks for years, began to turn positive last fall. **********The Finance Ministry said last week that overseas investors bought a net $4.78 billion of Japanese shares in January, up from $1.25 billion in December and easily surpassing the previous record of $2.83 billion, set last October. And Japan's three largest stock exchanges said the buying continued in February, although at a slower pace. **********The buying has come amid a growing consensus that the worst that can go wrong in Tokyo is that stock prices will rise less rapidly than normal. ''One can be in a Japanese bear market and still see prices go up,'' said a recent report by Steven H. Nagourney and Stephen Beinhacker of Shearson Lehman Hutton. Prices might rise, but at a slower rate than profits, so the price/earnings multiple would drop, Mr. Nagourney said in an interview. **********By American standards, that would be no bear market, but one thing successful Tokyo investors have learned is that it is folly to heed those standards. As the Shearson analysts point out, the Japanese market trades at ''four times book value, 60 times earnings and 200 times dividends.'' But they argue that economic growth has been rapid and that ''high economic liquidity and a low inflation environment have kept interest rates the lowest in the world.'' Their report concludes, ''In the end, these economic factors can only be conducive to higher equity prices.'' Mr. Nagourney expects the Nikkei 225 to rise to 38,000 this year, he said. **********A weaker yen last week was one of the things that bothered traders in Tokyo, where investing this year has focused on domestic companies that are expected to benefit from rising consumer spending. A lower yen, it is feared, could slow that trend and possibly force the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. **********Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan, scared some traders by warning that the Japanese price situation was becoming ''more severe'' and that it was necessary to act ''promptly and flexibly'' to deter inflationary worries. Another bank official said yesterday that Japan's money supply was growing too fast. **********''I think the Japanese Government will have to move interest rates up,'' said Nimrod Fachler, managing director of international investments for Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc., a subsidiary of the Paine Webber Group. **********Mr. Fachler said Paine Webber's Atlas Fund cut its exposure in Japanese stocks to 30 percent of assets last week, from 33 percent, and might further reduce it to as little as 25 percent. But he thinks that any fall in the next couple of months will be reversed later, and he sees the market moving to new highs later in the year. **********The bullish case on Japan is based largely on the idea that there is so much money available that prices can only go up and that while growth might slow, there is no chance of a real recession. **********The last Japanese recession came in 1974 as the shock of rising oil prices hit the country. But no one now expects another recession in the forseeable future, and little significance was attached to a report, issued last week, that Japan's trade surplus shrank in January, partly because of higher oil prices. **********A Bank of Japan survey of corporate managements, which was released last week, showed manufacturers more optimistic about business prospects than at any time in more than 15 years. ''The latest survey represents the near-best scenario for the economy,'' a central bank official told Reuters. The results of the survey, he explained, meant that the economy was robust but not overheating. **********Contrarian investors may want to note, however, that recessions sometimes take investors and governments by surprise. The last time the Bank of Japan survey found such confidence, Reuters reported, was in November 1973. By the end of 1974, Tokyo share prices were down one-third from their previous high.

They tinkled bells and rattled keys, tea cups and beer mugs not only in Prague, but in cities from one end of the country to the other. **********Taxis, ambulances and even police cars joined in the joyous cacophony by hooting their horns to welcome the installation on Sunday of a Cabinet that for the first time in 41 years puts the Communists in the minority. **********The opposition Civic Forum had called for the brief celebration of freedom at noon in place of a two-hour general strike it had been planning if the Communist authorities had not acceded to demands for power sharing. Husak Forced Out, Too **********The three-week-old organization had also demanded the resignation of the hard-line Communist President, Gustav Husak, and that demand was met as well on Sunday. **********The gleeful noise-making came just two weeks after an earlier call by the Civic Forum for a general strike drew the response of millions of Czechs and Slovaks and brought the country to a standstill. **********That action set in motion the developments that led to Mr. Husak's departure and the appointment of the 21-member Cabinet under the new Prime Minister, Marian Calfa, a Communist. Communist ministers hold a total of 10 Cabinet portfolios out of 21 in the new Government. **********The short outburst provided a fitting conclusion to what has been a gentle revolution - fought not with arms, but with banners, posters, buttons and immense protest demonstrations. **********''I'm looking forward to a new future; I am just very happy,'' said Eva Zaloudkova, a woman in her 20's who stood on Wenceslas Square in the center of Prague. Nodding to her 3-year-old son, Matej, perched jauntily on her shoulders, she said, ''His life will be more full than ours was.'' Resistance in the Family **********Maria Kopecka, wrapped against bitter cold in a thick fur, said: ''I am very sorry my husband could not live to see it. He would have been very happy.'' **********Her son, she said, had been a student in 1968, during the crushing of the liberal leadership of Alexander Dubcek in an invasion by the Warsaw Pact. Now, Mrs. Kopecka said, her grandson was among the students whose persistent protests had caused the present Communist regime, without the backing of Moscow's tanks, to crumble. **********The Communist Party leadership , appeared ready to negotiate with Civic Forum over the election of a new President to succeed Mr. Husak within the next two weeks. **********The opposition group has already begun a lively campaign, complete with posters, banners and buttons, promoting the candidacy of Vaclav Havel, the playwright and longtime dissident. Mr. Havel has served many prison sentences in the 21 years since the crushing of the Prague Spring era of 1968. **********Seeking to keep the pressure up, the Civic Forum plastered the main sections of Prague with posters showing the smiling playwright over the words, ''Havel to the Castle,'' meaning Hradcany Castle, the formal residence of the chief of state. Other posters, crudely hand-painted, read, ''He was our dissident; he shall be our President.'' **********On Sunday, Mr. Havel let it be known in a formal statement that he would accept the office, if elected, but only until free elections are held, perhaps as early as June. Division of Offices **********Under traditions governing the apportionment of public offices between Czechs and Slovaks, the President was expected to be a Czech and a non-party member to balance Mr. Calfa, the Prime Minister, who is a party member and a Slovak. Mr. Havel fulfills both conditions. **********But this morning, other candidates, some Slovaks and others Communists, tossed their hats into the ring. On Sunday, the 68-year-old Mr. Dubcek, who made a return to public view last month, said he would seek the office. **********The Communist Youth Organization proposed the former Minister of Education in Mr. Dubcek's Government, Cestomir Cisar, who fell from grace and was sent to Rumania as Ambassador. Rude Pravo, the Communist Party organ, published statements by workers in various factories proposing the former Communist Prime Minister, Ladislav Adamec. **********But the Communist leadership, evidently seeking to burnish a new-found conciliatory image, announced that it had agreed with Civic Forum that the new President was to be a Czech and have no party affiliation. ''These are macro ideas we have agreed upon,'' Ondrej Saling, a Central Committee secretary, told a news conference at the party headquarters in narrow Celetna Street. **********Mr. Saling said he expected talks to begin soon with the Forum and two other small parties, once loyal Communist satellites and now fiercely independent, the Socialists and People's Party, to settle on a single candidate. Too Bitter a Pill?  Asked whether the Communists could accept Mr. Havel, he replied evasively: ''This is a question that will be answered in the coming days.'' **********Communist agreement is crucial to the election of a new President, since their members of Parliament control a majority of seats. It is Parliament that actually elects the chief of state. **********Today, at exactly noon in Prague, people flooded into the streets around Wenceslas Square, the central shopping thoroughfare, rattling key chains and tinkling tiny bells. The jingling of keys, acts symbolizing the opening of hitherto locked doors, has become a common gesture in the wave of demonstrations. **********A worker in blue coveralls banged a dustpan with a screwdriver. A man wrapped against the cold in a blue parka with a Havel-for-President button pinned to his breast, blew a whistle. **********On the pedestal of the statue of St. Wenceslas, the sainted Czech king that stands at the top of the square, a young man waved a red, white and blue Czechoslovak flag. On the green copper dome of the headquarters of Cedok, the state travel agency, a huge red neon star that had perched there until Sunday was gone, and in its place fluttered the national flag. Colors and Castanets **********The distinctive red, white and blue flag hung from balconies, fluttered from stanchions, and decorated buildings everywhere throughout the lovely city. **********On Jungmanova Square, Mr. Havel himself stood beaming broadly on the balcony of a building that last week was turned over to the Civic Forum to serve as its headquarters. He lustily jingled a bunch of keys. On the street in front him, a man rattled two glass beer mugs like castanets, careful not to break them. **********In the street, crowds chanted, ''Havel, Havel!'' demanding that he address them.

''This was a very competently executed operation.'' **********The officials said it was not clear why the Revolutionary Guards had arranged with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command for the attacks on Americans, although analysts presume it was in retaliation for the American downing of an Iranian jetliner in July. **********The Palestinian group has long been closely linked with Syria and has headquarters in Damascus. Syria, in turn, has been allied to Iran since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980. **********American intelligence officials who investigated the barracks bombing concluded that the Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon, acting under orders of a faction of the Iranian Government, had carried out the attack that left 241 Americans dead. **********An Administration official said the inquiry into the Pan Am bombing was keeping open the possibility that other groups or nations could have been involved. **********Administration officials said the discovery of an Iranian link to plans for attacks on Americans has added a troubling element to the West's relationship with Teheran. Iran's Government, long relatively isolated, had been seeking to improve its relations with the outside world in recent months, until the furor over Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call for the killing of the British novelist Salman Rushdie. Some Senior Aides Unaware **********Several senior Administration policy makers said in interviews that they were unaware of any possible Iranian involvement in the Pan Am bombing, although lower-level officials were familiar with signs of an Iranian role. **********Bill Baker, chief spokesman for the Central Intelligence Agency, declined to discuss what evidence had been gathered by the agency. He said, however, that William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, had been regularly briefed on the investigation by agency officials, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a Scottish official heading the inquiry. The findings have been provided to high-level officials ''on a need-to-know basis,'' Mr. Baker said. The issue of Iranian involvement in the bombing has been raised several times in recent weeks. Reports by CBS News and The Washington Times, for example, have quoted unidentified officials or people in the terrorist underground as saying the bombing was ordered by Iran as retaliation for the American downing of the Iranian jetliner. **********The Iranian Airbus passenger jet was shot down July 3 by an American warship over the Persian Gulf, when the American commander reportedly mistook it for a warplane preparing to attack. All 290 people aboard were killed. **********The State Department has denied that the investigation of the Pan Am bombing has yet narrowed to any single group or country. Reconstruction of Events **********Government officials gave this account of events, as reconstructed so far by the inquiry. **********In late 1988, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards asked the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command to undertake a series of attacks on American targets, including a train bombing and an airplane bombing. The group is believed to have been involved in two previous attacks in West Germany aimed at trains carrying American military personnel. **********On Oct. 26, 1988, the West German authorities detained 16 people who were believed to be preparing to carry out the operations. Twelve were later released, and four remain in custody in West Germany. **********The evidence seized by the West German authorities showed that group members were well on the way to bombing a civilian jetliner. **********According to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration that was distributed to the international airlines, the Germans found several explosive devices in various stages of construction, one of which was a Toshiba ''Boombeat 453'' radio containing 300 grams of a plastic explosive covered by a metallic-coated candy wrapper. **********The bomb that was found ''would be very difficult to detect via normal X-ray inspection, indicating that it might be intended to pass undiscovered through areas subject to extensive security control,'' the F.A.A. wrote. **********A former Government official with access to the investigation said the bomb was intricately constructed. It relied on a barometric timer that would be started when the plane reached 10,000 feet. After about 45 minutes, the timer would detonate the plastic explosive. **********If the plane did not stay above 10,000 feet for at least 45 minutes, the device would shut itself off and would begin the cycle anew when it was next subjected to the appropriate pressures. **********The Toshiba product, the former official said, is sold only in the Middle East and North Africa. **********The intent of the device was to circumvent the pressure chamber in use at the Frankfurt airport, which subjects luggage for a short period to the pressures of flight. The chamber would thus explode any bomb that was set to go off at a pre-arranged altitude. Similarities Are Cited **********On Dec. 21, 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded in the sky over Scotland. Within weeks, investigators had begun to suspect that the attack was ordered by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon, perhaps as another of the operations that were to be carried out the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine - General Command. **********There are several similarities between the foiled plot and the Pan Am bombing. Investigators announced last week, for example, that the bomb had been hidden in a radio cassette player. They did not identify a brand name. The bomb is believed to have been checked aboard the flight in Frankfurt, a city frequented by some of the Popular Front members who were arrested. **********A former Government official said the device captured on Oct. 26, 1988, in Germany would not have blown up the Pan Am flight over Scotland because the timer was set for 45 minutes after the plane reached 10,000 feet. But the former official said the device could be easily shifted to a different time sequence. **********American intelligence has gathered varying levels of evidence of involvement by foreign governments in previous terrorist attacks against American targets, but only once, when American planes bombed Libya in 1986, has military retaliation been deployed. That attack was in response to what the United States said was Libyan involvement in the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque in which an American serviceman was killed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/credit-markets-retail-data-push-us-bonds-up.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1989-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Retail Data Push U.S. Bonds Up", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Retail Data Push U.S. Bonds Up", "body_text": " **********The Treasury successfully completed the final stage of its quarterly auctions yesterday as market participants received an unexpected psychological lift from a retail sales report that was much weaker than anticipated. **********The surprising report caused an abrupt shift in attitude among market participants, pushing up prices of Treasury securities and helping to smooth the sale of $9.5 billion worth of new Treasury bonds. Concerns about the bond auction's prospects had arisen earlier in the week as the Treasury auctioned 3-year and 10-year notes as part of the $28.75 billion quarterly refunding. The fears, largely over today's report on producer prices, were in large part offset by the retail sales figures released yesterday. **********The retail sales report showed that sales rose last month by a modest four-tenths of 1 percent, about half the rise that many economists had been expecting. The figures seemed to confirm the perception that economic growth is slowing. 'It Changed a Lot of Minds' **********''The retail sales number reinforced the story that the economy is losing some steam,'' one government bond trader said. ''And it changed a lot of minds among retail investors.'' **********The trader added that the release of the retail sales figures was followed by good buying of short- to intermediate-term issues. **********Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, pointed out that the retail report did not mean the inflation danger was over. ''The consumer has downshifted his spending, and will continue in that mode,'' he said. ''But it will take significantly subpar growth to put a dent in inflation, and push it back to the 4 percent to 4.5 percent range the Federal Reserve wants it to be.'' **********With the auctions over, the focus shifts to today's producer price report for April. Most dealers seem to have accepted the fact that the report will show a large rise related to higher energy prices. **********But a number of traders and analysts said that Treasury prices could shoot higher if producer prices excluding the volatile food and energy components posted only a modest increase. **********''A four-tenths-of-a-point increase excluding food and energy would be viewed as a very good number,'' the bond trader said. ''If the P.P.I. number isn't bad, the market has room to go higher.'' Highest Yield in a Year **********Bids at the bond auction produced an average yield of 9.11 percent, up from the average of 8.91 percent at the last such auction in February and the highest since the auction last May 12. As expected, foreign demand for the long-term bond was tepid. **********As previously announced, the Treasury chose to reopen the outstanding 8 7/8 percent issue of 2019 rather than to create a new bellwether issue. In the secondary Treasury market, the 8 7/8 percent bonds were offered late yesterday at a price of 98 1/8, up 15/32, to yield 9.05 percent. Late Wednesday, the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 9.10 percent. **********Secondary Treasury note issues also posted handsome gains. The 9 5/8 four-year notes, for example, were offered in late trading at 101 3/4, up 11/ 32, to yield 9.07 percent. And the 9 1/4 percent two-year notes rose by 7/32, to 100 1/4, to yield 9.10 percent. **********Meanwhile, short-term Treasury bill rates eased. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 8.42 percent, down seven basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates fell nine basis points, to a late offered rate of 8.41 percent. **********In the high-yield market for ''junk bonds,'' attention focused on the array of $4 billion worth of securities for RJR Nabisco Inc. Details of RJR Nabisco Offering **********Late yesterday, preliminary pricing information was made available on the record-size five-part deal: *********** $1 billion worth of pay-in-kind subordinated notes due May 15, 2001, will be offered at par with a coupon of 15 percent. *********** A $2 billion issue of subordinated discount debentures also due May 15, 2001, will be offered at a price of $48.656. Like the pay-in-kind notes, the debentures will not pay cash interest until April 1994, when the rate will be 15 percent. Drexel Burnham Lambert is acting as sole lead underwriter for the pay-in-kind notes and the zero-coupon debenture issue. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is acting as co-lead manager with Drexel on the three other parts of the financing. *********** A $525 million issue of subordinated debentures maturing in May 2001 will be offered at par with a coupon of 13 1/2 percent. This issue, like the other, will be non-callable for five years. *********** A $225 million issue of 13 1/8 percent subordinated extendible reset debentures will be offered at par. This issue will reset after two years to value the bonds at $101, and then reset each year thereafter. The issue is callable on the reset date at the price of $101. *********** A $250 million issue of subordinated floating-rate 10-year notes will be offered with a coupon of 3.85 percentage points over the three-month London interbank offered rate. Rates on the notes will be reset and are payable quarterly. **********All five parts of the financing have been rated B-1 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

U.S. Has Led the Way **********The United States has historically taken the most hard-line stance among the 17 nations in the agency, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, also known as Cocom. In the past, once Washington has agreed to ease export restrictions, the whole organization has moved, a pattern that would likely be followed again. **********In the computer industry, companies like Data General and Control Data are already positioning themselves to benefit from looser controls by Cocom, whose members include Japan, Australia and nations in NATO. **********President Bush, after meeting today with President Francois Mitterrand of France on St. Martin, said the Administration ''should and will review'' the Cocom arrangement. ''I think it's timely we take a new look at some of the commercial constraints,'' he said.  [ Page 32. ]  Mosbacher to Offer Revisions Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said he would soon recommend a ''substantial shortening'' of the list of more than 100,000 items that Cocom tries to keep out of the Eastern bloc. And the United States and its allies are now discussing a reappraisal of the entire control program at a high-level Cocom meeting in February in Paris, American and West German officials said. **********''If the strategic threat from the bloc has changed, then it's only natural to change the controls that exist because of that threat,'' said a senior Administration official who asked not to be identified. **********Of the effect of the recent political changes on the controls program, Mr. Mosbacher said in a recent interview: ''The whole thing just boggles the mind. We're going to have to sit down and look at the whole picture. I'm not sure that any of us until recently even thought about the possibilities that have now opened up.'' **********Poland and Hungary would be early beneficiaries of the reassessment, officials said. Both nations are likely to be assigned a status similar to that for China, which until the crackdown on dissent ordered by Beijing last spring was allowed under Cocom guidelines to obtain computers two and three times more powerful than those available to the Soviet Union. **********Cocom, which has offices in an annex to the American Embassy in Paris, was created in 1949, at the same time as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to keep war-making technology out of Soviet hands. State Department Takes Lead **********Historically, the Commerce Department, the Government agency most responsive to the business community, has led Cabinet initiatives for relaxation of Cocom controls. This time, officials said, the lead has been taken by the State Department, whose chief, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, has just outlined proposals for transforming NATO from a primarily military organization into a political alliance. **********In a symbolic move, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will be a guest at NATO headquarters in Brussels next week - something Mr. Baker characterized as ''very natural in light of the changes that are taking place.'' **********Commenting on Cocom on Friday in Brussels, Mr. Baker told reporters: ''We still want to protect strategic technology, but we should rationalize the system to the extent that things that are to some extent available off the shelf should not be locked up, especially at this time of reform in Eastern Europe.'' **********Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger has already announced one significant decontrol measure. Starting within six months, he told a recent conference on government-business relations, the United States will no longer require prior approval on export licenses for goods like computers that can be used either for military or civilian purposes. Hindrance for U.S. Companies **********Only the United States now requires foreign enterprises, even in countries that are its closest allies, to obtain prior approval if they sell products of American origin outside their borders. Such controls have cost American companies some business. **********According to a recent report of business advisers to Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, European countries have cited such controls in denying American participation in the development of a European fighter aircraft and in other major European projects. **********Even the Defense Department, which has been the most vocal opponent of decontrol in the past, is signaling flexibility, though officials refuse to discuss the department's position for the record. **********The Pentagon has just approved a proposal from a small Boston-based computer company, Innovation International Inc., to work with the Soviet Ministry for the Radio Industry to assemble personal computers in the Soviet Union. The license covers 1,250 assembly kits, but many more could follow. **********''The Defense Department knows that this was part of an overall plan in a joint venture with the radio ministry,'' said Frank G. Wright, Innovation's chairman. ''Our plan is based on a requirement to assemble one million units over a three-year period.'' Past Reluctance at Pentagon **********Until recent months, Pentagon officials said, the Defense Department had vetoed such proposals on grounds that they would help Moscow improve its computer manufacturing and that this would bolster the Soviet Union's military might. **********The interagency approval process that determines the United States stand on a Cocom issue involves chiefly the Commerce Department and the Pentagon, and in some cases the State Department, with the President making the final decision. Within days of the Pentagon decision, the company received its license. **********Another sign of a thaw is the license that the Data General Corporation of Westboro, Mass., has just won for sale to the Soviet Union of a low-end minicomputer, a 32-bit MV 2000, for demonstration purposes. **********Data General is providing the hardware for a computer joint venture it has formed with Voest Alpine Industrieanlagenbau of Linz, Austria, and NPO Parma, a Soviet software enterprise based in Perm. **********Data General has now applied for a license to export a somewhat more powerful computer, the 32-bit MV 7800 model, and is hoping for approval in the new year. Control Data's Agreement **********Similarly, the Control Data Corporation of Minneapolis has reached agreement with the Soviet Research and Development Institute of Power Engineering, which researches the design of nuclear reactors, to provide six even more potent computers to increase the safety of the country's civilian nuclear power plants. **********The Soviet Union has one of the largest civilian nuclear power programs in the world, with 50 plants estimated to be in operation. The lack of computers for nuclear safety analysis has been cited as a factor behind the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl in April 1986. **********The order for the air-cooled Cyber 962 mainframe computers - the company still needs a license - is valued at $32 million. The computers are more powerful than any yet approved for the Soviet Union, but similar computers have already been shipped to China. **********The Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have made no bones about their need for advanced technology. Western European countries, led by West Germany, are eager to satisfy that need. Officials say the debate now is over the pace and extent of Cocom reform. **********''The U.S. is trying to balance the strategic risk of taking things off the list versus the genuine risk that you could see Cocom collapse if we are out of step with reality,'' said Paul Freedenberg, former Under Secretary of Commerce for export administration."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/29/business/company-briefs-601989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 329, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Curtice-Burns Foods Inc., Rochester, a food processing company, and its affiliate, Pro-Fac Cooperative, said they had purchased Globe Products Co., Clifton, N.J., a maker of fruit and cream fillings for bakery use. *********** DPC Acquisition Corp. extended until Jan. 9 its $10-a-share tender offer for Dataproducts Corp., Woodland Hills, Calif., a maker of peripheral data processing equipment. *********** Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., Riverside, Calif., a manufacturer of motor homes, acquired Coleman Co.'s trailer operations in Somerset, Pa., for $36.5 million. *********** Georgia-Pacific Corp. said the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association had arranged $4.5 billion in financing for Georgia-Pacific's bid for the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation.

Though human rights and political groups here and abroad have long suspected, based on fragmentary evidence, that some Mexican Government agencies have in the past resorted to extra-judicial killings, Mr. Osorio's grim account is the first by a purported member of such a group. **********Frequently a critic of human rights abuses elsewhere, the Mexican Government has largely deflected questions about its own practices. It has maintained that attitude despite incidents like the discovery after the 1985 earthquake of manacled corpses that bore signs of torture in Government offices here and regular complaints by human rights groups about the killings of members of peasant and Indian organizations in rural areas. 'Make These People Disappear' **********In the immigration hearings, Mr. Osorio told Canadian authorities that he took part in executions ordered by senior Mexican Army and Air Force officials, some of whom are still on active duty. ''The Ministry of Defense issued official documents'' for such killings on a regular basis between 1977 and 1982, he said, and the prisoners were then removed clandestinely from a military prison here, killed, and their bodies disposed of. **********Mr. Osorio, a 32-year-old former parachutist, said he was a member of a three-man team that made ''between 15 and 20 trips'' to a pair of military firing practice ranges north of the Mexican capital. On each trip, his squad, one of at least three that he said were assigned to such duties, transported between four and seven hooded and handcuffed prisoners, who were lined up and riddled with gunfire until ''the bodies were practically torn apart.'' **********''The order I received was to make these people disappear,'' Mr. Osorio said in sworn testimony to the Canadian Immigration Board that approved his application for refugee status. ''That is, the order was for them to die because they were troublesome or bothersome to the high command.'' Trips to a Military Camp **********Mr. Osorio also said he had made several trips to at least five Mexican states to pick up at least 80 hooded prisoners and guard them during return flights on Mexican military aircraft to Military Camp Number One here. The groups ranged in size from 8 to 30 prisoners, he said, but he could provide no further information about their identities or ultimate fates. **********But on one occasion, according to Mr. Osorio's account, his unit was sent to the southern state of Guerrero to ''pick up about 25 or 30 people'' who were involved in a land dispute with the general who was the military commander in the area. Mr. Osorio said that though he did not take part in the execution of this group, he understood that ''they are all dead.'' **********In its 1988 report, issued last fall, the human rights organization Amnesty International said it was ''working on 52 cases of people who 'disappeared' between 1972 and 1983'' in Mexico, mostly political activists, peasants, students, teachers or union organizers. Reports of Disappearances **********A United Nations work group investigating ''forced and involuntary disappearances'' listed 194 unexplained disappearances in Mexico as of 1988. The National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners, the Disappeared and Political Exiles, a Mexican human rights organization with links to Marxist parties here, reports a total of 543 disappearances for political reasons. **********In the early and mid-1970's, Mexico was plagued by a series of rural and urban left-wing guerrilla insurgencies, which were firmly repressed by the military and police apparatus. President Jose Lopez Portillo, who took office in 1976, declared a political amnesty in 1978, but human rights and opposition groups continued to report disappearances and politically motivated killings throughout his term, which ended in late 1982. **********Mexico, which has often criticized human rights violations in countries like Chile and El Salvador, has repeatedly denied that it holds any political prisoners. A recent statement issued by the Ministry of the Interior in response to questions raised by Amnesty International and Mexican groups said that the Government had ''duly investigated and clarified'' all allegations of politically related disappearances and found them to be ''groundless and with no basis in fact.'' **********A spokesman for President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office three months ago, referred a reporter to the Attorney General for reaction to Mr. Osorio's allegations. Neither the Attorney General's office or the Ministry of National Defense responded to telephone calls requesting comment. 'It Definitely Adds Up' **********In a telephone interview from London, an Amnesty International researcher who deals with human rights abuses in Mexico and Central America, noting that ''the latest report we have of a disappearance in Mexico was in 1983 or 1984,'' said she found Mr. Osorio's testimony credible. ''There is a consistent pattern of such reports from that period, and it definitely adds up,'' said the researcher, who asked not to be identified by name. **********''We've never actually called this a death squad, as we have done in Central America,'' she added. ''This was the military acting under higher orders, soldiers in uniform acting in an official capacity rather than individual officers or soldiers acting on their own or as part of some parallel organization.'' **********Mr. Osorio, born to a peasant family in the State of Veracruz, testified that he deserted from the Mexican Army in 1982 because the execution duty ''really affected my head'' and because three requests to be transferred to another unit had been rejected. He said he then made his way to the United States, where he was an undocumented worker for several years, and eventually ended up in Canada, where his case has attracted considerable attention in the press and among human rights groups. His testimony was reported only briefly and incompletely in the Mexican press, Hearings on Mr. Osorio's application for political refugee status were first held in Montreal last March, and the Immigration Appeal Board issued a written decision in his favor last summer. The Canadian Government initially appealed the decision, but on Jan. 30 it decided to drop the case, and formal ratification of the decision is expected early next week. **********''By deserting the army and telling the whole world - as no one had ever done previously - about the atrocities committed by agents of the Mexican Government, Mr. Osorio Cruz broke his oath of obedience and became a traitor in the eyes of certain Mexican authorities by expressing his strong political disagreement,'' the appeal board wrote, explaining its ruling. ''There is no doubt the worst kind of punishment reserved for political prisoners would be awaiting him should he return to Mexico.'' **********At the time Mr. Osorio alleges the killings were carried out, the two top Mexican officials in charge of internal political security were Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, the deputy Minister of the Interior, and Miguel Nazar Haro, head of the Federal Security Directorate. Mr. Gutierrez Barrios was appointed Minister of the Interior in the new Government that took office here Dec. 1, and Mr. Nazar Haro is now chief of police intelligence for the capital. **********Through his lawyer, Stewart Istvanffy, Mr. Osorio declined to discuss the case with a reporter. In a telephone interview from Montreal, Mr. Istvanffy said, ''He was completely traumatized by the trial and does not really want to talk about it ever again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/31/business/treasury-offers-proposals-aimed-at-drug-laundering.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1989-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Offers Proposals Aimed at Drug Laundering", "print_headline": "Treasury Offers Proposals Aimed at Drug Laundering", "body_text": " **********The Treasury Department yesterday disclosed the range of the new guidelines it is reviewing to regulate the electronic transfer of vast sums of money among banks around the world. **********The regulations are being drawn up in response to recent Federal prosecutions and reports showing that narcotics traffickers have been laundering billions of dollars of drug money through the banking community's international computer systems. **********In a major policy change, Treasury officials earlier this month said that they will regulate international electronic transfers for the first time and require recordkeeping by the financial institutions to help investigators trace the flow of illegally earned money. Yesterday's announcement starts the formal rule-making process. **********Banks are already required to report domestic deposits of more than $10,000, but the foreign transfers have gone largely unregulated. **********The Government estimates that drug revenues in the United States total $110 billion a year, 80 percent of which represents illegal profits. Much of this money is now making its way to Latin America and Asia. **********For banks, the regulations could mean a substantial amount of additional paperwork, though the banks' computers themselves will be able to assist with some of the monitoring. For law-enforcement authorities, this paperwork is expected to provide a more detailed money trail for routine and suspicious transactions. **********The Bush Administration is about to open a new financial-crimes center in Arlington, Va., with computers that will receive some of the new data and will monitor money laundering information to be supplied by more than half a dozen Federal agencies as well as state authorities. **********In the type of modern electronic transfer, or wire transfer, that has become so hard to monitor, a customer may instruct his personal computer to tell his bank's computer to take money out of his account and send it to another account in a foreign bank. In most of these foreign transfers, no person ever talks to another, regardless of the amount. **********The bank's computer then tells a bank clearinghouse - a kind of automated middleman that assists banks in switching money from one to another - to send the customer's money to the account abroad. More than $1 trillion a day is moved through the nation's main clearinghouses, and the average transfer is $5 million. **********One rule will require that either the bank that sends or receives a transfer keep a record of it, including the name and account of the customer transmitting and receiving the funds. Another rule would require that financial institutions receive more information about the nature of the business of a customer who makes use of international transfers. Profile of Suspicious Transfers **********Businesses that do not have an established relationship with a bank would also be more closely monitored than those that do. The Treasury Department also wants financial institutions to develop a profile of what constitutes suspicious transfers. **********Clearinghouse officials said yesterday they supported the proposals. **********''I can't see any problem with them,'' said John Lee, president and chief executive of the New York Clearinghouse, which moves an average of about $700 million each day through its computer system.

Looking Toward 1992 **********The contest for control of the British agency reflects the intensity of the war for marketing primacy in Western Europe, as nations there prepare to eliminate trade barriers in 1992 and create a unified market of 340 million people. **********The 1992 plans have led to an acquisition frenzy among advertising companies amid what some ad people are calling ''Europhoria.' This is part of a larger worldwide trend in the advertising business, the most dramatic example of which was the British WPP Group's takeover of the American Ogilvy Group last month. **********Omnicom, the American parent company of BBDO Worldwide and DDB Needham Worldwide, plans to merge Boase's London agency, BMP Davidson Pearce, with DDB Needham's London office. Although DDB Needham is highly respected in England - Advertising Age named it ''International Agency of the Year'' this year - it is only the 28th largest in billings. **********The merger would make the new agency, called BMP/DDB Needham, Britain's fourth largest, with billings of more than $400 million, said David Grimbley, an analyst with Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage. **********Bruce Crawford, Omnicom's president and chief executive, said Omnicom would benefit from Boase's strength in marketing services; the company is one of Britain's strongest in sales promotion and direct marketing. ''Our top priority is continued expansion in Europe, and as everybody knows, the weak link in our chain has been the U.K.,'' he said. **********B.D.D.P., France's fourth-largest ad agency and the creator of flashy work for McDonald's, Hertz and BMW automobiles, has virtually no presence in Britain, where many European marketers are planning to make their base because of the sophistication of the marketing services industry there. **********In March, B.D.D.P. began its assault on Boase with an offer of 300 pence a share, or a total of $161.8 million at current exchange rates. On May 11, the French agency raised its bid to 345 pence a share, or a total of $186.1 million. **********Omnicom entered the picture a week later with an offer of 365 pence a share, or a total of $197 million While some analysts expected a bidding war to develop, B.D.D.P. did not act. Nicholas V. Baum, the managing director of B.D.D.P.'s international operations, said the company had reached ''the upper limit of what we felt was a fair price.'' **********Mr. Baum said he expected that B.D.D.P. would tender to Omnicom its stake of more than 15 percent in Boase. With shares bought in London yesterday and those voted to it by Boase's board, Omnicom now holds 38.5 percent of Boase. Potential Conflicts **********The Omnicom-Boase merger would create several potential client conflicts. DDB Needham, for example, currently handles the Bass brewery products, while BMP Davidson Pearce does advertising for Courage, a competing brewer. A Boase spokesman has said that such conflicts could result in the loss of 5 percent to 10 percent of the combined business. **********A takeover of Boase also leaves uncertain the fate of Ammirati & Puris, the award-winning New York agency known best for its advertising for Club Med and BMW automobiles. Ammirati executives, who sold the agency to Boase in 1987, suggested repurchasing it last year, a proposal that was rejected by Boase."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/business/company-news-davis-makes-a-2.6-billion-offer-for-nwa.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1989-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 623, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Davis Makes a $2.6 Billion Offer for NWA", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Davis Makes a $2.6 Billion Offer for NWA", "body_text": " **********The parent of Northwest Airlines received a takeover offer yesterday of $90 a share in cash, or about $2.6 billion, from a group led by Marvin Davis, the oilman and investor. **********In a letter to the board of NWA Inc., which owns Northwest, Mr. Davis said his group was prepared to acquire all the outstanding 29.1 million shares of common stock and wanted to open negotiations promptly. **********Mr. Davis said he and his partners, whose names were not disclosed, owned 3 percent of NWA's stock. **********Mr. Davis's offer was substantially higher than NWA's market price. **********On Tuesday, the stock rose $9.75, to $70.375, after NWA said an investor group was considering making an offer for the company.

W. Botha, who led the party for more than a decade, suffered a stroke Jan. 18, and resigned the party leadership two weeks later. **********Last weekend, he made clear that he meant to resume his duties as head of state later this month, which precludes his successor as party leader, F. W. de Klerk, from inheriting the powers needed to carry out party policy. **********The issue is sure to be raised at the National Party's weekly parliamentary caucus on Thursday, which Mr. Botha is not expected to attend. But some political strategists, taking stock of Mr. Botha's tactical skills and capacity for stubbornness, said they doubted that the crisis would be resolved before the President returned to work after Easter late this month. De Klerk's New Tone **********Mr. Botha, who is 73 years old, has inspired such obedience in the party -some legislators privately call it fear - that no Nationalist politician seems prepared to ask him to quit and make way for Mr. de Klerk, who in only a month set a new tone that has captured the party's imagination. Significantly, nobody has publicly urged that Mr. Botha stay on either. **********The issue is sensitive enough that Nationalist legislators interviewed about it did not want to be identified. One estimated that 95 percent of National Party supporters now favored Mr. de Klerk, which meant that hardly more than a half-dozen of the party's 130 members of Parliament wanted Mr. Botha back. Another analyst in Parliament estimated that Mr. Botha commanded the loyalty of fewer than a third of his party's legislators. **********Party members say their dissatisfaction is rooted not only in the political stagnation that set in under Mr. Botha but also in the more approachable manner of Mr. de Klerk, who is 20 years younger and more willing to seek consensus than his predecessor. **********A legislator expressed admiration for Mr. de Klerk's systematic planning. ''P. W. Botha is much more an intuitive politician,'' the legislator said. ''His political intuition has been excellent throughout, but it's frustrating sometimes, because you couldn't have a proper argument.'' **********Peter Soal, a legislator from the liberal Progressive Federal Party, said Mr. Botha's hold over Parliament was broken by the stroke. **********''In a week, one detected a sense of adventure permeating the National Party caucus,'' Mr. Soal said. Speaking of Inevitable Change **********This has been reflected in recent speeches by Mr. de Klerk and J. Christiaan Heunis, who is acting President in Mr. Botha's absence, on the inevitability of change, including a new dialogue with members of the country's black majority. Mr. de Klerk declared that white domination must end, though he qualified this by saying that black domination should not replace it. **********Mr. Botha, who is recuperating at his home in Cape Province, made clear in an interview published last Saturday that he had no plans to quit. The implication was that Mr. de Klerk, who was not Mr. Botha's choice as successor, would not be granted the powers to carry out his new party role. **********An Afrikaans-language newspaper, Die Burger, contended that Mr. de Klerk's situation had become intolerable. ''A party with a leader-in-chief whose hands have been cut off is a party without arms,'' it said. ''It is undesirable if it is the governing party.'' **********The problem of presidential unaccountability was anticipated by some critics of the 1984 Constitution, which added smaller chambers for mixed-race and Indian legislators to Parliament's existing white chamber. Blacks remain excluded from Parliament. President Unanswerable to Party **********The Constitution also created the post of state president, which is filled not directly by white voters but by a 50-member electoral college proportionately representing the majority party of each chamber. This provision has let the National Party effectively choose the nation's president, but left whomever it chose him unanswerable to its wishes. **********Under the Constitution, the president can be removed only for misconduct or inability to perform his duties, and this must be done through the electoral college at the request of all three chambers of Parliament. **********Some Nationalist legislators said that deposing Mr. Botha by such means was not an option because he deserved to retire with dignity. **********Consequently, said another, time offers the only remedy. The Constitution obligates Mr. Botha to call parliamentary elections by March 1990. A new president must be chosen within a week after Parliament convenes. **********Nationalist regulars want Mr. Botha to let Mr. de Klerk succeed him as president before the elections. Once above the political fray, Mr. de Klerk would not need to defend his parliamentary seat in Vereeniging, a blue-collar town in Transvaal Province that has been under pressure from the right-wing Conservative Party. **********If Mr. Botha hangs onto the presidency, they say, and the Conservatives marshal enough support to unseat Mr. de Klerk, he would lose his power base in Parliament and his credibility as National Party leader. It is a scenario, several believe, that would work to Mr. Botha's advantage. **********''P.W.'s trump card is the timing of the election,'' said a political analyst.

But at least through October, Drexel was showing an operating loss for the first time since it became a power on Wall Street. The losses stem largely from the declining ''junk bond'' market, the source of most of Drexel's revenue, and from Drexel's falling share of that market. **********So far in the fourth quarter, Drexel has been the lead underwriter for just $264.6 million in junk bonds, placing sixth among Wall Street houses, with 5.2 percent of the total market. Until this year, Drexel had never ranked below first in this category, which it pioneered, and often the firm took more than half of the market. **********Citing the firm's dependence on the junk bond market, Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, recently downgraded Drexel's commercial paper. That would increase the cost of financing, although Drexel has said that commercial paper accounts for only 2 percent of its financing. **********People inside and outside Drexel have also reported the loss of talented employees from its junk bond unit, as well as the departure of some longtime clients, and a kind of siege mentality lingering from Federal securities-fraud charges to which Drexel pleaded guilty. As part of its settlement with the Government, Drexel agreed to beef up oversight of its operations. In April, it named John S. R. Shad, the former S.E.C. head, its chairman. **********The problems at the firm and in the junk bond market have made it more difficult for Drexel to sell some debt offerings, and Drexel has been forced to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of some bonds it has underwritten, only to see those bonds plunge. **********Frederick H. Joseph, the chief executive of the firm, said he was aware that rough times had led to widespread talk that Drexel was in trouble but said the stories were not true. He and other top executives at Drexel said the firm was solid financially, and he said he thinks the firm's management team is one of the best on Wall Street. **********''I fully believe that we will end this year in the black,'' he said. ''You've got air pockets in the high-yield bond market, and that is creating opportunities for us.'' An air pocket is a sudden, sharp decline in the price of a bond; the opportunities include refinancings for troubled companies. **********Some analysts agree that despite the difficulties Drexel is experiencing, the firm will survive, albeit in a different form. ''I think Drexel is going to make it if the environment doesn't get much worse,'' said Perrin Long, an industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. ''But the firm is going to be a more streamlined, modest firm.'' **********Nevertheless, the uncertainty about Drexel's future is so pervasive that rumors about a possible sale of the firm or other drastic measures are common. Indeed, Max C. Chapman Jr., the head of the American arm of Nomura Securities Inc., the Japanese investment house, recently telephoned Mr. Joseph, asking whether the two private firms should issue a denial of a rumor that Nomura would buy all or part of Drexel. Mr. Joseph said the men had decided not to release a statement. **********''We're not in any conversations about selling Drexel,'' Mr. Joseph said. ''Our capital position is satisfactory.'' Competition Is Tougher **********But even people within Drexel acknowledge that the firm is heading for a very tough winter. The junk bond market has been in tatters for months, and is only now showing tentative signs of a mild recovery. The future of Drexel depends in good part on a continued recovery, as well as on the firm's ability to succeed in other parts of the financial marketplace. But many of these areas are characterized by fierce competition and overcapacity. **********In addition, important executives of the firm's junk bond division in Beverly Hills, Calif., are expected to be indicted soon on criminal charges of securities law violations, filings by Drexel with the Securities and Exchange Commission show. Michael R. Milken, head of Drexel's junk bond division, was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering, mail fraud, insider trading and other charges last March. **********And while some Drexel executives said they expected the firm to end the year in the black, other people inside Drexel said it had losses of more than $130 million in the first 10 months of this year. Indeed, in October alone, Drexel lost more than $50 million, they said. Capitalization Drops **********The firm has a total capitalization of $1.7 billion, down from $1.96 billion in the previous year, a Drexel spokesman said. Despite the decrease, the firm's level of capital is still considered satisfactory, some analysts said. **********The October loss stemmed both from the declining junk bond market, which Drexel mastered to transform itself from a third-tier player into one of Wall Street's most powerful investment houses, and from losses stemming from speculation by the firm that the leveraged buyout of the UAL Corporation would be completed. The deal fell apart after sufficient financing could not be arranged. **********The loss of more than $130 million compares with a loss last year of more than $160 million, but last year's loss would have been a large profit except for charges against earnings to cover the $650 million penalty Drexel agreed to pay in its settlement of charges of securities law violations. The firm made more than $400 million in 1987 and more than $1 billion in 1986, Drexel executives said. Excess Reserves Cited **********Mr. Joseph said that the data showing the firm with losses for the first 10 months did not include excess reserves that were taken during the year as a precautionary measure for bonuses, legal expenditures and charitable contributions, which would be accounted for at the end of the year. He declined to provide details about the magnitude of those reserves, but said they would help put Drexel in the black or at least break even. The firm is a private partnership, and does not have to report its earnings publicly. **********Other firms are also running into difficult times, but none were more dependent than Drexel on the junk bond market, a fact that played a significant role in the decision to downgrade its commercial paper. **********And because Drexel is the only independent securities firm to have pleaded guilty to criminal charges, it is faced with some difficulties not encountered elsewhere on Wall Street. For example, while the firm is laying off about 11 percent of its staff in the junk bond division, it continues to pay millions of dollars in compensation to executives who have agreed to testify against Mr. Milken, even though those executives no longer go to work. The Government has told Drexel not to take retaliatory actions against the executives who are testifying. **********Because of its problems, people inside and outside Drexel said, the firm is but a shadow of the rugged battler it once was. ''It seems to be hemorrhaging from all sides,'' one person inside the firm said, referring in part to the shrinking of the firm to about 5,500 employees from 10,000 in less than a year. ''We've lost people. We've lost money. We get memos telling us that the top guys are optimistic. But they're the same ones who told us that we weren't going to settle'' charges of securities violations. Costs Reported Reduced **********But Mr. Joseph, in saying that the firm remains strong on its own, added that Drexel had trimmed its operating costs to $1.3 billion from $2.4 billion over the last year. Much of that was the result of the disposal of assets that contributed to costs without adding much to the firm's earnings, like the retail division. **********Nevertheless, some longtime clients have begun pulling away from Drexel. After the settlement, the Stone Container Corporation said it would no longer use Drexel exclusively for its financings. In addition, some investors who were made rich by Drexel have stopped using the firm. **********''The talent's gone,'' one large former client said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. ''They don't have the trading network anymore, and they've got a bunker mentality because of the charges.'' **********This client cited the loss of Mr. Milken as a significant setback to the firm, as well as the recent decision by Peter Ackerman, a senior executive in the junk bond division, to leave the unit and begin working for Drexel in London. **********To address the concerns of the rating agencies about its financial condition, Drexel plans to raise $150 million, in part from Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, a Belgian bank and the largest shareholder in the firm. Telephone calls to executives at the American office of the bank were not returned. **********But more than 50 percent of that financing will come from the firm's employees. Those making more than $200,000 a year are being required to take 15 percent of their salary in securities in the company. Executives making more than $1 million a year must take 18 percent of their salary in the securities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/29/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-12-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Christian Dobles has been named senior vice president of Uniworld Group Inc. *********** Joyce Rehlich has been promoted to chief financial officer of TFB/BBDO Business Communications. *********** Thomas W.

After they got there, the building collapsed around their heads. **********Tass, the official press agency, identified the others who were saved as Rafik Simonyan, Karlen Sarkisyan, Vanik Khachaturyan and two young men whose names Mr. Akopyan apparently could not remember in his exhausted state.

Oversight Hearings **********Congress's primary activity after the recess is likely to be oversight. Committees in the Senate and House are planning to hold hearings to insure that the bailout legislation is being carried out. **********The Senate Banking Committee has already scheduled for early October the first oversight hearings on the new Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created by the legislation to sell or liquidate hundreds of sick savings institutions. **********The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, has announced that he will reopen hearings on the billion-dollar transactions for the sale of sick savings and loans that were worked out in late 1988 by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. **********Mr. Gonzalez has also said he would hold hearings on how M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the bank board and now director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, handled the supervision of the now insolvent $5.3 billion Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif. Regulators estimate that the Lincoln failure will cost the public more than $2 billion. **********Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, a trade group for small and medium-sized commercial banks, said he and bankers were concerned that in addition to the stiff penalties for fraud and lending violations imposed on bankers by the bailout legislation, Congress would put even more pressure on regulators to oversee the operations of even well-run banks. He said that could create a situation in which bankers would have to pay more attention to regulators than to their day-to-day business. **********In fact, in the wake of the bailout legislation, which came down heavily on both bankers and savings and loan officials, some experts are concerned that Congress will over-regulate the industry, making it less competitive with foreign institutions. Deposit Insurance **********On a related issue, Frank Annunzio, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the House Banking Financial Institutions Subcommittee, has announced he will hold hearings on the financial health of the nation's deposit insurance funds. But other issues on Congress's menu of financial regulation are so sticky that lawmakers have toyed with them for years. **********One of the most bitter battles involves whether to permit banks to enter new areas of finance, like securities underwriting and the sale of insurance. For years, Congress has struggled with trying to appease interest groups on all sides, and so far has been stalemated. **********Officials at the Treasury Department say they plan to renew that push. And bankers acknowledge that deregulating their industry to grant new products and services is at the top of their list. But to do so, they have to defeat the securities and insurance lobbies. **********''Our members are particularly interested in getting the right to sell insurance,'' said Mary-Liz Meany, chief spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association. She acknowledged that such new powers were most likely to come faster from bank regulators, state legislatures and the courts than from Congress. **********Indeed, bankers have looked more to the Fed, which has slowly been granting them new securities underwriting powers. **********Nonetheless, she added, the banking trade group plans to stress that the United States is losing its international competitive edge in the financial services industry, particularly as the further unification of the European Community in 1992 approaches. Restrictive Laws **********But other bankers admit that after passing the bailout of the savings and loan industry, Congress will be reluctant to pass a bill that could be characterized as deregulatory. **********Instead, Congress is likely to be more willing to pass restrictive laws that give it a sense of curbing excesses and speculation. As such, laws that might limit hostile takeovers and the use of high-yield junk bonds in leveraged buyouts would be an appealing step. **********Such a move, however, would clearly be opposed by the Bush Administration, as well as by Richard C. Breeden, who is Mr. Bush's nominee to be chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-valvoline-ads-make-comparative-claims.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-03-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Valvoline Ads Make Comparative Claims", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Valvoline Ads Make Comparative Claims", "body_text": " **********Faced with a tougher market, Valvoline Motor Oil has pulled off the driving gloves in its new advertising campaign.

Praise by Private Sector **********Leaders of the private sector praised the Government action, saying it will make the money they can borrow for plant expansion and other pressing needs more plentiful and less costly. But they also said they will only be fully satisfied when the Government relinquishes majority control of the nation's commercial banks. **********As part of the official package, the Government will relax reserve requirements that now call for banks to keep on deposit with the Banco de Mexico any combination of cash deposits, treasury notes and Government bonds that adds up to 30 percent of retail deposits. Since mid-1985, reserve requirements at Mexican banks have been perhaps the most stringent, and most complex, in the world, running as high as 90 percent and choking off credit for all but the largest and well connected of borrowers. Parallel Banking System **********As a result, a parallel banking system has sprung up, centered in major stock brokerages and insurance companies. Unable to obtain credit through conventional channels, private companies have increasingly found the private financial institutions, flush with cash that previously had gone into bank accounts, willing to arrange loans and place commercial paper. **********''This is a very sensible action,'' one foreign economist here said of the Government package, which the Banco de Mexico, the country's central bank, made known to commercial banks late last month. ''It represents a movement back toward the traditional sector, enabling them to fight the parallels, and a recognition that the restrictions did not work.'' **********To many here, the timing of the measures also suggests a connection to talks with the World Bank for a crucial $1.5 billion loan expected to pave the way for agreements with other foreign creditors. ''It could be they decided to do this on their own before the World Bank told them to,'' said one diplomat here who specializes in economic affairs, referring to proposals already under discussion with the Washington-based institution. Lower Interest Rates **********The measures are apparently aimed at driving down Mexico's high interest rates, which make the Government's service of its $45 billion domestic debt costly, and at providing more money for borrowers. But the Government has also indicated the infusion of new money will be staggered over several months so as to avoid an inflationary surge. **********There was also speculation that the financial liberalization may signal Mexico's intention to allow foreign banks to take a more active role here, another measure being suggested to Mexico by its creditors. This school of thought, advanced by both Mexican and foreign financial analysts, says the Salinas administration intends to give Mexico's 18 commercial banks time to modernize before taking such a step. **********Last October, Banco de Mexico took a preliminary step toward revitalizing the traditional financial system by allowing banks, which in 1987 were also permitted to sell a third of their stock to private investors, to set their own interest rates on banker's acceptances, which are used to pay the specific bills owed by customers as they come due. As a result, the share of total bank deposits funneled into that financial instrument rose to 78.9 percent in February, from 1.1 percent last September. Restrictions Lifted **********The lifting of restrictions on interest rates, which have been running over 40 percent in nominal terms and 25 percent after adjusting for inflation, officially went into effect last Monday. But bank officers, still unsure of how they should make use of their new latitude, have apparently decided to postpone any action until this Monday, and so there was little movement in interest rates last week. **********Bankers and other financial experts say the Government's action is likely to bring about a rapid consolidation in the banking sector, where power is already concentrated. In 1988, Mexican banks earned profits of about $1 billion, analysts here have estimated, and the bulk went to a few giants, like Banco Nacional de Mexico, Banco de Comercio and Banca Serfin. **********An analyst at one leading brokerage house here predicted that the number of banks in Mexico ''will be cut in half over the next year or two,'' with less competitive institutions being forced to merge with rivals. **********''The big banks are going to do all right, and so a m most of the smaerer regionalanan, , which owow their limid d market and operate efficiently within it,'' he added. ''It's the banks in the middle that are going to have problems and will probably be swallowed up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/01/business/soviet-plant-us-managers.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1989-10-01", "snippet": "LEAD: It is the last thing anyone would expect to see in the office of Charles W.

He suspects that the Soviets might use the Phoenix Group agreement to squeeze more favorable terms from another, larger company. **********Phoenix also faces the risk of abrupt change in the Soviet Union. Perestroika has earned President Mikhail S. Gorbachev more popularity abroad than at home. If the Russians retreat from restructuring their economy and cooperating with foreign businesses, the computer venture could be a casualty. **********Mr. Missler said he is already used to defending his company and his contract. Soviet officials told him that at least one larger American company maligned the Phoenix Group, and is still trying to steal the deal. **********The selection of Phoenix serves as a primer in the challenges of doing business in the Soviet Union. Phoenix executives learned to play by Soviet rules. They say they won the contract because they offered a long-term joint venture instead of straight sales. And Phoenix was willing to rely on a complicated barter arrangement for payment. Ultimately, the Phoenix deal would give the Soviets their own personal computer industry. **********''We had to have a distinctive strategy,'' said Peter von Braun, Mr. Missler's 49-year-old partner and the principal negotiator. ''We had to think about what the Soviets really wanted. And we decided that if we were in their position, we would want a joint venture. So when everyone else was shopping them a straight sales agreement, we presented them with a complete business plan.'' **********It is not the sort of arrangement many American companies would accept. The International Business Machines Corporation, for example, operates no joint ventures with the Soviet Union and demands direct payment in hard currency for any sales. ''It's a long, drawn-out process to do a deal with the Soviet bloc,'' said A. G. W. Biddle, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a trade group. ''With the lack of clarity on the part of the U.S. about East-West relations, most companies have been reluctant to make the heavy investment required to try to negotiate a deal.'' **********Phoenix took the dare. It was founded by Mr. Missler and Mr. von Braun, a former executive of the McKinsey & Company consulting firm, in 1988. Phoenix has grown primarily through acquisition. Its Netcom Research Inc. subsidiary holds a $49 million, 27-month contract to supply networking equipment to a consortium of international computer distributors. Resdel Industries, another subsidiary, recently divested itself of more than $100 million in defense contracts, partly due to fears the American government would object to the Soviet operation. Resdale is now negotiating a joint venture to provide digital microwave equipment for telephone service in India. **********The Soviet work is being managed by another subsidiary, the American P.C. Corporation. Like the computer equivalent of an interior decorator, American P.C. buys computer components and designs and assembles systems instead of manufacturing the equipment itself. **********It is a deal that could only take place in 1989. Until this summer, the United States had banned shipment to the Soviet bloc of the computers the Phoenix Group intends to assemble. In July, the Commerce Department removed export restrictions on these computers after determining that they were available from other sources. **********And only recently has the Soviet Union seemed ready to accept such a huge computer deal with a foreign company as a partner. The Soviet Union has had other joint ventures, and other contracts with computer companies, but nothing of nearly this size. ''Really, the Phoenix deal is an extension of a trend that is already taking place,'' said William McHenry, an assistant professor in the Georgetown University School of Business Administration who follows the Soviet computer industry. ''This deal indicates the Soviets are putting their stamp of approval on this method of getting PC's.'' **********The Russians desperately need more computers. In 1988, American companies sold six million IBM-compatible personal computers. The Soviet Union manufactured only about 100,000 computers - most of them ''toys or junk,'' said Seymour E. Goodman, a professor of management information systems at the University of Arizona. ''The state of the industry there now is remarkably weak for a country that is supposedly a military and industrial superpower.'' **********In Soviet universities, 10 or 15 researchers usually share one or two of the sort of personal computers an American college student might own. An I.B.M-compatible computer that sells for $1,000 or less in the United States fetches 30,000 to 50,000 rubles, or about $48,000 to $60,000 at official exchange rates. More sophisticated personal computers can cost the equivalent of more than $100,000. **********The agreement with the Phoenix Group was announced at a New York press conference on Sept. 11. It took two weeks of intense negotiations in a spartan conference room at the State Committee of the Soviet Union for Public Education. Mr. von Braun and the Russian bureaucrats reached a complicated agreement to suit both the Soviet Union's special requirements and Phoenix's. **********For Phoenix, it is as much a management as a manufacturing contract. So far, the company has invested only a few million dollars. **********Phoenix will order computer components from its subsidiaries and other suppliers and sell them at a mark-up to Samcom, the Soviet-American computer joint venture. Phoenix will keep 75 percent of the profits that result and give the Russians the rest. **********The Soviet Union will provide the factory and the workers, while the Phoenix group provides management and expertise. From there, making the computers will be simple, said Bo Denysyk, a former Assistant Secretary of Commerce and now senior vice president at Global U.S.A. Inc., trade consultants. ''This doesn't involve manufacturing disk drives or integrated circuits. They are getting all the major components from different manufacturers and providing a little staff to assemble it there, while the Soviets are providing the distribution channel. Almost anyone can do it.'' **********Ownership and profits from Samcom will be evenly split. To take its profits out of the Soviet Union, Phoenix will use the Austrian Laenderbank of Vienna as its barter clearinghouse. Bank traders will find buyers in the West for materials like chemicals and scrap steel that the Soviets want to sell. As hard-currency receipts from the sales flow to Phoenix, the company will ship more computer components to the joint venture. **********Mr. von Braun said he clinched the deal with a thick business plan, ambitiously titled, ''Developing a 'World Class' Computer Industry in the U.S.S.R.'' The plan, which was translated into Russian, promises that the Phoenix Group will assemble 12,000 computers in the United States this year and ship them to the Soviet Union. Then, as enough Soviet workers receive training in Pensa, the joint venture will start assembling and servicing its own computers. In 1994, the last year of the contract, a self-sufficient Samcom will assemble two million personal computers and manufacture some of the parts. **********Mr. Missler said he hopes the Russians will not charge the going rate for computers. ''A lot of what's going on is basic business education,'' he said, referring to his talks with Soviet officials. ''They want to sell the computers for $100,000. I say, 'That will invite competition.' They say, 'What's competition?' '' **********The Soviet computers will be a simplified version of the I.B.M. AT. They will blend technology from I.B.M. and from Phoenix's Netcom subsidiary, which has found efficient ways to create computer networks. The Soviets will link groups of 12 computers, letting students and workers operate independently while a teacher or supervisor can monitor their screens. **********Three million computers will go to schools, the other three million to factories and offices. The machines will be sold through the government - probably at a discount to schools. Soviet officials say that the spread of computers will improve education, create thousands of jobs and make factories more efficient. **********''Perestroika requires that the quality of Soviet specialists' training must be sharply increased, as well as the level of education in general,'' said Leonid M. Tereshcenko, a high-ranking Soviet education official, at the New York press conference. ''It is virtually impossible to solve these problems without the introduction of computer technology into the education process.'' **********Some experts believe that, in a country where copiers have been regarded as potential instruments of subversion, computers will offer a vital new way to communicate. ''The introduction of the PC to schools and in general to the civilian population does not in one fell swoop open Soviet society, but it is one more wedge,'' said Richard W. Judy, director of Soviet and Eastern European Studies at the Hudson Institute, an ndianapolis-based think tank. **********Mr. Judy said that computers will be invaluable if a Soviet bill to legalize private publishing houses becomes law. ''Then we're going to see a flourishing of desktop publishing, something that had been absolutely impossible in the past,'' he said. ''You could have the ability for interest groups to communicate with individuals.'' **********Nothing would make the Phoenix executives prouder to fly the Soviet flag. ''President Gorbachev has brought about changes that were impossible to forecast. We felt that his achievements almost demanded a response from the West,'' said Mr. Missler. ''If we as Western businessmen can somehow help build trade relations, we figure it's healthy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/01/business/what-s-new-in-magazine-redesign-concocting-a-formula-of-paper-type-and-colors.html": {"writer_name": "Debora Toth", "pub_date": "1989-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 428, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONCOCTING A FORMULA OF PAPER, TYPE AND COLORS", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEW IN MAGAZINE REDESIGN; CONCOCTING A FORMULA OF PAPER, TYPE AND COLORS", "body_text": " **********Whenever a magazine publisher and editor decide to redesign, they usually do it to keep a step ahead of the competition or to make a distinctive mark. ''One reason to redesign is when the raw materials you are using are old-fashioned,'' said Jan White, a communications design consultant based in Westport, Conn. ''Fashions in typography do change. Presentation techniques evolve. You have to stay abreast.'' **********Many of the magazines redesigned this past year upgraded to heavier, glossy stock. This supercalendered paper allows a better print quality. Other magazines are reorganizing their contents pages, features and columns to a cleaner, easier-to-read format. Many of the fashion magazines are following a trend started in Europe of having a model in a casual, minimal setting. **********Walter Bernard, a designer whose credits include the revamping of Time and Fortune magazines, sees several trends in magazine redesign. ''The magazine business is to be contemporary. Now, black and white is fashionable. Perfect binding is popular, as well as larger widths,'' he said, referring to book-style binding. **********Another element of change in a redesign is the typography. ''I see many designers going back to some old faces,'' says Mr. Bernard. ''With the use of a computer, designers have a greater range of typefaces to choose from.'' For example, Mr. Bernard cites Spy magazine's use of tiny type in some instances. ''It's so small, it makes the reader pay attention. It's an ingenious and contemporary choice. It wouldn't work in all magazines, but it works in Spy.'' **********Publishers and editors often want their magazines redesigned in a way that sets each apart from its competition. For some, it's the choice of colors. ''We deliberately chose colors not being used on other magazines,'' said Anthea Disney, the editor of Self magazine who chose teal and magenta. **********Past approaches may again become popular, but in a different form. ''Magazine design is like current fashion. In the 1960's, women wore miniskirts with go-go boots,'' said Mr. Bernard. ''In the 1980's, women are wearing short skirts again but would never wear those boots. When you redesign a magazine, you have to recognize what designs are current and what can be used again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/28/world/at-a-solidarity-meeting-the-call-is-for-strength.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1989-01-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 884, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At a Solidarity Meeting, The Call Is for Strength", "print_headline": "At a Solidarity Meeting, The Call Is for Strength", "body_text": " **********Andrzej Milczanowski took Solidarity's case for talks with the Government to the grass roots this week, and ran into a wall of suspicion and disbelief of the Government's intentions. **********He and his audience agreed on one thing: that the outlawed union could act only from strength. ''It's not enough to be right,'' he said. ''That's too little. It's also important to be strong. The history of the world shows that more often people who were right lost than won.'' **********The remarks came as Mr. Milczanowski, stroking his thinning, sandy hair, stood for several hours Monday night in a church basement, responding to queries and discussing, town-meeting style, the decision by Solidarity to negotiate with the Government. **********Mr. Milczanowski (pronounced mil-cha-NUF-skee) belongs to Solidarity's national executive commission, which met Sunday in Gdansk and agreed to accept a Government offer of talks on broad social and economic change, including a return of Solidarity to legal status. Back home, the commission members sought not so much to convince the rank and file that the authorities were to be trusted, but that negotiations were worth a gamble. Mounting Labor Tension **********The tactic reflected concern over mounting labor tension that was evidenced, even as Solidarity met Sunday, by strikes at a textile mill near Lodz and by bus drivers in Elblag, in northern Poland. **********About 150 people attended, men and women from their 20's to their 60's, most of them Solidarity organizers, some simply parishioners. The Catholic Church opens its doors to such gatherings even though the Government declares them illegal. **********Mr. Milczanowski, who led the discussion, organized strikes last summer that crippled the port of Szczecin (pronounced sh-CHEH-cheen), Poland's largest, and the city's buses. He describes himself as one of Solidarity's ''pragamatists,'' who say the union should be tough on the labor front, organizing strikes for concrete gains like higher pay or job security, but should keep out of politics. They are opposed by the ''fundamentalists,'' who say Solidarity must spearhead the drive for political rights, like free elections. **********In his view, Solidarity went too far in 1980, seeking political goals like power sharing with the Communists. ''Solidarity has to avoid the mistakes of 1980,'' he said, referring to the union's brief heyday, ''and become a labor union, and not take on political issues. There should be political clubs for people who are of a political nature.'' New Factory Chapters Urged **********''We have to be prepared if the economic balance tips,'' he said. ''A union has to be there to assure that people get work corresponding to their qualifications, assuring that they get support while they're requalifying themselves. This is nothing new. That's the way it is in the whole world.'' **********Fresh strikes would erupt, he said, if the Government refused to recognize Solidarity. **********Many appeared to agree. But applause rippled through the room only once, when a young man demanded that Solidarity continue its efforts to organize new factory chapters, an activity opposed by the Government. ''We must gather our strength, because only strength will get us what we want,'' he said. ''Why bother with politics?'' 'Lost by Skin of Our Teeth' **********Mr. Milczanowski, in a brown jacket and jeans, said: ''We played in 1981 and we lost by the skin of our teeth. Now there has to be compromise.'' **********People like Mr. Milczanowski rose to prominence because of their ability to organize the big strikes of last spring and summer. They replaced an older generation of leaders, like Marian Jurczyk, the local leader in 1980, who now accuse them of gullibility for putting aside political aims and settling for talks with the authorities. **********Though the old leaders have little support, their arguments echoed in the assembly. A young man in a leather jacket grumbled that Communism made a travesty of the legal system. **********''What kind of justice is this?'' he asked. ''Today they condemn me, tomorrow they pardon, the next time they'll kill me.'' Mr. Milczanowski replied that ''no doubt the legal system is treated in this country as an instrument,'' implying that the authorities used it repressively. But he said Solidarity demanded legal changes. **********One man who listened attentively said he was as skeptical as anyone, but was still pleased that things appeared to be changing. The Solidarity leader agreed. ''Two years ago,'' he said, ''five minutes after this thing started the police would have come and taken us off you know where.''

This decrease is largely offset, however, by an increase in American imports of capital goods, like high-tech devices, components and equipment American industry needs to make its own products. Imports of machinery over all increased 82 percent. This is one reason why the total United States-Japan trade imbalance does not appear to improve. **********It is, of course, an indication of the integration of the United States and Japanese economies that for many products design and final assembly are done in the United States while manufacturing is carried out in Japan or elsewhere. But America's loss of competitiveness in so many areas of high-tech manufacturing suggests that there is something fundamentally amiss in American industry. If the United States loses too much of its high-tech manufacturing base, it also loses its ability to be a technology leader in the coming century. **********This is something Americans should be concerned about. But it is also a global concern that American industry regain its competitiveness. **********The real key to competitiveness lies not in trade policy and protection of high-tech industries, but in increased investment, strengthened research and development and work-force development. Basic education and on-the-job training need to be improved. **********My most basic message is that the United States Government and American companies should shift their time horizons. Investments are needed today that will pay dividends in 10, 20 or 30 years. The short-term orientation of corporate management in the United States encourages the neglect of long-term investment vital to industry, depriving it of the ability to create attractive products. Both Senator Lloyd Bentsen and Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, have recently made similar points. **********Mr. Darman courageously used the phrase ''now-now-ism'' to accurately describe the American obsession with getting quick results at the expense of long-term considerations. **********Seeking hasty results is especially dangerous in manufacturing industries, where it takes 10 years to develop a new technology, 10 more to apply it to a new product, and maybe another 10 to turn that product into a profitable business. Patience, consistency and continuity are required. Yet the financial community seems to concentrate on 10-minute time frames. **********In the financial sector, now-now-ism causes currency fluctuations that undermine the future-oriented manufacturing industries and weaken the global economy. Because manufacturing is fundamental to a healthy economy, the most important role of the financial community should be to provide manufacturers with the best economic atmosphere. **********There are two other challenges to be considered with regard to international competitiveness and the trade imbalance. First, successful international companies must emphasize localization and globalization of business operation. **********Localization is the first important step for a global enterprise. That is why I established the Sony Corporation of America in 1960 with local management and with an ongoing commitment to manufacturing, research and development, and engineering activities in the United States. **********Through localization we can get the best talent and performance available in each location. If we accomplish this locally, we can achieve the full potential of our global work force. But we must also globalize operations, conducting our worldwide operations with a common business philosophy. One reflection of this global-localization at Sony is that we have named an American and a Swiss national to our board of directors. **********The second challenge is one faced collectively by all industrial nations. It is obvious that we need larger markets for the future development of the global economy. **********To this end, I agree with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore. The countries of Southeast Asia must become consumer societies, and Japan too must exercise a powerful import pull. Then America, Europe and Asia - including Japan - could be three important regions contributing to worldwide economic development. **********People in business face many challenges. If we cannot offer attractive products that satisfy customers, and cannot afford long-term investment, it will be difficult to succeed. But no nation, and no company, can by itself address the compelex issues of competitiveness, trade imbalances and long-term commitment to manufacturing that lie at the heart of commerce.

They are among tens of thousands of people killed, wounded or displaced in West Africa's fiercest ethnic feud in recent years. **********The expulsions began in April after a land dispute between Senegalese farmers and Mauritanian herdsmen near Bakel, a border town in eastern Senegal, erupted into riots. Thousands of people fled north and south across the Senegal River, the dividing line between Mauritania and Senegal. Ancient Arab-Black Resentment **********Since then, however, the flight north has virtually ceased. But a growing stream of black Mauritanians, many of them with Mauritanian passports and other national identity papers, have been deported by Mauritanian security forces, often through this frontier town on the banks of the Senegal River. **********On an elemental level, the dispute is a reminder that here along the southern edges of the Sahara ancient resentments between Arabs and black Africans stubbornly endure. Senegal's population, about seven million, is virtually all black, while about two-thirds of Mauritania's two million people are Moors, as those of Arab and Berber descent are known, and one-third are black. **********And to many blacks, this vast country of ocher-colored desert and swirling sandstorms has taken on an air of almost palpable menace. **********''The Arabs want to either get rid of us, or make us slaves again,'' said a black herdsman, who insisted on anonymity, fearing that he too would be deported. Government Version Disputed **********The dispute has nearly crippled Mauritania's economy while pushing the two former French colonies toward war, Western diplomats say. **********Mauritania insists it is expelling only Senegalese nationals. **********''We have been very, very careful about how and whom we expel,'' said the Mauritanian Information Minister, Mohammed Lemine Ould Ahred, in a recent interview in Nouakchott. ''There have been absolutely no expulsions of Mauritanian nationals.'' **********The Government's version of events, however, is strongly disputed by accounts from relief workers and African and Western diplomats. Reports of Torture and Arrests **********Last month, Amnesty International said it had received ''consistent and credible'' reports of torture, extrajudical executions and arbitrary arrests of people ''who had refused to leave or to have their property expropriated.'' The group said it had the names of ''at least 10 people said to have died after torture,'' and it feared the true total is higher. **********Africa Watch, a London-based human-rights advocacy group, estimated that since April, 40,000 and 50,000 black Mauritanians had been expelled, mostly members of the Peul, Wolof, Sonninke and Bambara ethnic groups. **********''A cause of particular anguish for many parents who have become separated from their children is the fear that they have been sold as slaves,'' said the report, made public earlier this month. **********Disquieting evidence of the effect of the expulsions is visible in much of this country, about the size of Texas and California combined. Black-Owned Shops Abandoned **********All along the nearly 500-mile southern border, in fact, relief workers say that dozens of villages once inhabited by black Mauritanians and Senegalese farmers are now empty. **********Farther north in Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital, shops once run by black merchants have been abandoned, their shelves stripped of merchandise. And squatters have settled into many of the businesses and adjoining homes, confident that their former neighbors will never return. **********The differences in living standards between Moors and blacks is especially startling in the chaotic slum areas on the outskirts of Nouakchott.

But now, with mounting concern over the heaps of plastics piling up in the country's landfills, manufacturers are struggling to deflate the notion of plastics as polluters. **********Last year, for instance, the Society of the Plastics Industry formed the Council for Solid Waste Solutions to fund research and consumer education on alternatives to disposal. With contributions of $1.8 million from 13 companies in its first year, the council is now negotiating to set up recycling programs in several cities. **********Over the last year, several plastics makers, including Mobil, Dow Chemical and Amoco, have embarked on recycling projects of their own. For its part, the Amoco Corporation will begin a pilot project this spring with the McDonald's Corporation to make products like insulation materials from fast-food containers collected from the restaurant chain. **********Manufacturers have also created advertising campaigns to promote recycling over more severe measures to reduce waste. In response to a law passed last year by the legislature in Suffolk County, N.Y., that bans nonbiodegradable food packaging, like plastic grocery bags and fast-food cartons, the Mobil Corporation, the maker of Hefty garbage bags and other plastics products, created ads that promote recycling and thinner plastics as more effective over the long term than bans. **********Other manufacturers have taken decidedly lower-key strategies to help polish the industry's image. This spring, a local chapter of the Society of Plastics Engineers will open the nation's first plastics museum. In Leominster, Mass., the new National Plastic Center and Museum is supported by Tupperware International and the E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, among others. ''In general, the public image of the plastic industry leaves something to be desired,'' said Jack Keville, vice president of the center. **********The museum will house a research library and the 17-year-old Plastics Hall of Fame, and will sponsor exhibitions that demonstrate the wonders of plastics. One of the first will expose plastics to freezing and superhot temperatures. The museum also is developing educational videos for secondary school students stressing the wide uses of plastics and career opportunities in the industry. **********The city of Akron, Ohio, the nation's tire-making capital, is another believer in the benefits of fostering an appreciation for plastics among youngsters. With the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as its consultant, the city schools in 1986 developed a curriculum on polymers to educate children in kindergarten through the third grade about the complex structures and everyday uses of polymers. Last year, the program was expanded through grade six. ''We realized we needed to start early to keep students here in Akron and to expose them to the industry,'' explained Jeanne Bodine, director of elementary education at the Akron Public Schools.

Five days later, Eastern was placed under bankruptcy protection by the Texas Air Corporation, its owner. Customer Base Eroded **********Mr. Bakes said it was now impossible for Eastern to go back to its original size, because its customer base had been eroded by the strike. He added that other alternatives, including selling the airline, had also become unrealistic because no potential buyers had made a viable offer. ''There are a lot of people who kick tires,'' he said. **********Eastern would offer lower fares initially to recapture its former passengers and attract new customers, Mr. Bakes said, but he added that the carrier would not be a no-frills People Express-type of operation. He said the airline would be a full-service carrier that would seek business travelers, improve its food service and refurbish its planes. **********Earlier this month, a deal in which investors led by Peter V. Ueberroth would have bought Eastern for $464 million fell through when the airline's unions refused to back down from their demand that Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air, have no hand in running Eastern before the sale was completed. Refusal to Sell Reiterated **********Eastern has already agreed to sell its Washington-New York-Boston shuttle to Donald J. Trump for $365 million. Mr. Bakes reiterated Mr. Lorenzo's statement last week that Texas Air no longer wanted to sell the rest of Eastern. **********Under the plan Eastern would retain 157 of its current 255 aircraft, including its fleet of new Boeing 757 planes. It would serve 77 cities, compared with 102 before the strike. **********In addition to the Atlanta hub, Eastern would retain many north-south routes, as well as service to the Caribbean and Latin America. Some Latin American routes could be put up for sale, Mr. Bakes said. **********Mr. Bakes said Eastern wanted to negotiate new contracts with its pilots and machinists but was prepared to reshape the line without them. About 150 Eastern pilots are flying, most of them part of the management staff. Mr. Bakes said the airline could revive itself with its present work force of 5,000, supplemented by new employees. He added that he expected the carrier to have about 17,000 employees when it reaches its projected size. **********John Bavis, head of the pilots' union at Eastern, said that while Mr. Lorenzo's plan looked plausible on paper, ''it lacks one key ingredient - the 1,000-plus pilots he will need to operate the airline.'' In the 51 days of the strike, he added, the number of Eastern flights has remained the same, and ''there have been virtually no defections across the picket lines.'' Creditor Approval Needed **********The Eastern plan would have to be approved by the 15 members of the creditors' committee, on which Eastern unions hold two seats. It would also have to be approved by Federal Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is overseeing Eastern's attempt to reorganize under protection of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. **********In a move aimed at gaining the support of the creditors, Mr. Bakes said Eastern would pay off about $914 million in debt from the money it raised in asset sales. About $700 million of that amount would be paid before it was due. The carrier has about $2.4 billion in total debt. **********Mr. Bakes added that the carrier hoped to have its reorganization plan approved by Sept. 1 and that the management intended to pay off creditors in full. Plans for Ticket-Holders **********Holders of Eastern tickets would be given the opportunity of applying the face value of their tickets to new, lower fares, he said. Those holders who did not choose to use their tickets, he added, would receive full refunds plus interest. Judge Lifland has frequently expressed concerned for the rights of ticket-holders. **********After listening to the plan, Raymond E. Neidl, an analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, said, ''I think it's possible if things go right.'' **********Eastern's unions are still pursuing a sale and Judge Lifland has repeatedly urged all the parties to find a way to rebuild the airline. Further Bids Expected **********David I. Shapiro, an attorney who has been appointed by Judge Lifland as an examiner in the case, said yesterday that further bids for Eastern could be made next week. **********Representatives of Jay Pritzker, the Chicago financier, have been given financial information on the airline, and Carl C. Icahn, the owner of Trans World Airlines, has also expressed interest. **********Mr. Bakes said he and Mr. Lorenzo were now committed to their plan to rebuild a smaller airline. He estimated that it would probably begin to break even by the end of the year. **********The reason that Altanta was chosen as Eastern's main hub, he explained, was that the hub ''was dying for a competitive choice.'' Atlanta has long been dominated by Delta, with Eastern in second place. Mr. Bakes said Atlanta was big enough to support two major carriers, as Chicago supports United and American. More Jobs for Miami Area **********Eastern's large maintenance base in Miami would be kept and its excess capacity would be used to do work for other carriers, possibly increasing employment in the Miami area, Mr. Bakes said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/17/business/company-news-closing-by-pauley.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Closing by Pauley", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Closing by Pauley", "body_text": " **********Pauley Petroleum Inc. said it intends to close its Newhall Refining Company refinery at the end of the year, offer the site for sale and lay off about 70 people.

Last year, consumption of hard liquor fell to 1.6 gallons per person, from 2 gallons in 1981, said John C. Maxwell, a beverage analyst at Wheat First Securities in Richmond. Liquor sales in 1988 dropped for the ninth straight year, to 161 million nine-liter cases, from 199 million cases in 1979, according to the 1989 American Distilled Spirits Annual Study, published by M. Shanken Communications in New York. Retail revenues dropped slightly, to $15 billion. ''It's not a healthy picture,'' said Frank Walters, director of research at Shanken. **********Government restrictions are not helping matters. This fall, all alcoholic beverages will be required to carry warning labels about drunken driving and drinking while pregnant. Congress is considering legislation to further curb drunken driving and will probably draw on a report issued in May by C. Everett Koop, the departing Surgeon General. Among his 200 recommendations for reducing drunken driving are prohibiting alcoholic beverages from sponsoring sporting events and from using celebrity endorsers and eliminating the tax deductibility of alcohol advertising. **********Taxes also continue to be a thorny issue. Taxes already account for about 45 percent of the average retail price of a 750-milliliter bottle of liquor and new taxes could force prices higher. This year, 69 proposals to increase taxes on liquor have been introduced in state and local legislatures. While 35 have been defeated, six have become law. The industry is also worried about an increase in the Federal excise tax; the last such rise - by 19 percent, to $12.50 per proof gallon - occurred in 1985. ''The industry can't withstand another increase,'' said F.A. Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group of distillers. **********The downturn has driven some distillers out of the business. Others have diversified, struck up joint ventures and made acquisitions to survive.

The United States originally insisted it would not agree to adjournment until the Soviet Union adopted legal provisions to release all its political prisoners, including those in mental hospitals. But in January it accepted Soviet assurances that the issue was being dealt with and agreed to wrap up the conference and hold another in Moscow in 1991. **********The American psychiatrists said today that they ''could find no evidence of a mental disorder'' in 14 of the 27 patients they interviewed. In another 3 of the 27 cases, they said, symptoms were so mild that they ''would not typically warrant involuntary hospitalization in Western countries.'' **********Maximum-security hospitals in the Soviet Union still have many characteristrics of ''psychiatric prisons'' even though the Health Ministry has begun to take responsibility for such institutions, formerly run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the report said. Political Behavior Punished **********The American team found that some people had been hospitalized for ''anti-Soviet thoughts'' or political behavior, that drugs were used for ''punitive rather than therapeutic purposes'' and that patients had few rights and did not take part in decisions about their own treatment. **********In short, it said, ''the transition to a more humane regime has just begun.'' **********The American delegation included longtime students of Soviet affairs and prominent authorities on forensic psychiatry. Among the members were Dr. Loren H. Roth, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and former chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Psychiatry and Law; Dr. Darrel A. Regier, director of clinical research at the National Institute of Mental Health; Robert W. Farrand, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, and Prof. Peter Reddaway of George Washington University, who has written two books on Soviet psychiatric abuse. **********In a formal response, the Soviet Union admitted that certain drugs, including sulfazine and atropine, had been misused. It said it had developed guidelines to ban the use of those two medications in psychiatry. Moscow also acknowledged that it needed to strengthen the protection of patients' rights to meet international standards. **********But Soviet officials said the American team had given too much credence to the statements of patients who were mentally ill. Moreover, they said, in Soviet medical practice ''it is not the accepted custom to discuss with patients the methods for treating them, except for cases where a physician is the patient.'' **********The report is much more detailed and comprehensive than the preliminary findings disclosed by a few members of the American delegation at the end of their visit to Moscow four months ago. **********Professor Reddaway said the professional organization of Soviet psychiatrists should not yet be readmitted to the World Psychiatric Association."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/23/world/bonn-sees-wide-gulf-in-missile-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1989-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonn Sees Wide Gulf in Missile Dispute", "print_headline": "Bonn Sees Wide Gulf in Missile Dispute", "body_text": " **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl today sent President Bush his response to the latest American proposals in the dispute over short-range missiles, but West German officials indicated that the two sides remained far from a resolution. **********A week remains before the heads of the governments in the North Atlantic alliance meet in Brussels for the alliance's 40th anniversary, and the German officials said Bonn hoped another round of high-level exchanges might break the impasse. **********The officials would not disclose what Mr. Kohl said in his message.

The Bonn Government's official position is that it opposes total elimination ''under the present circumstances,'' but it has hesitated for political reasons to commit itself beyond that. **********''O.K., Washington accepted that talks on short-range systems were not completely taboo,'' a West German official said. ''But with the conditions they set this was basically a restatement of the American position and no easier to swallow.'' **********Administration officials in Washington said Bonn had communicated three objections to the latest American stand. These officials said, confirming German reports, that Bonn reportedly objects that the American approach would unduly delay American-Soviet negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. Bonn also opposes the American suggestion that NATO endorse development of a successor for the present Lance missiles. And Bonn reportedly objects to foreclosing the possibility of eliminating short-range missiles eventually. **********The West German official said the American position is politically ''just not in the cards.'' He added, referring to the opposition party, ''The Social Democrats would jump for joy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/10/business/swiss-computer-fails.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 159, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Swiss Computer Fails", "print_headline": "Swiss Computer Fails", "body_text": " **********Dealers at Switzerland's fully automated options and futures exchange have gone back to doing deals by telephone because their $40 million computer system has failed.

It also said it had sent to the national Parliament a draft of a new constitution defining a state ''striving for peace and freedom in Czechoslovakia as well as among the states and nations of the world.'' Revamping in Republic **********The moves follow the opposition's rejection of a new Government announced on Sunday that includes non-Communists for the first time since 1968. The Cabinet was made up of 16 Communists, 2 members of parties that had traditionally been aligned with the Communists and 3 independents. **********Civic Forum, the main opposition movement, charged that the Cabinet did not reflect the distribution of political power and that it would mean a perpetuation of the Communists' leading role in society; in a concession last week, the constitutional guarantee of that role was removed by Parliament. **********With the revamping of the Czech regional government today, it appeared that the Communist Party had taken another major step toward dismantling its grip on power. It has been prompted to concessions by mass protests in recent weeks, renewed on Monday after a weeklong lull, as well as by upheaval elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Talks With Prime Minister **********''The revolution has advanced by several days,'' Jiri Dienstbier, the Civic Forum spokesman, said today after the announcement of the agreement on the Czech Government, reached in talks between the Communists and the opposition since Friday. **********Mr. Dienstbier and other Civic Forum leaders said the agreement would influence talks on reallotting seats in the national Cabinet that began today between Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright and Civic Forum leader, and Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec. **********Mr. Dienstbier provided no details of the demands set forth by Mr. Havel's team, and he did not give a definitive answer when asked if the formula in the Czech republic would suffice in the national Cabinet. **********''Yes,'' he said when the question was put to him, but he added that ''we have some reservations about the Czech Government.'' **********The formation of the Czech Cabinet by the regional leader, Frantisek Pitra, a 55-year-old Communist believed to have ambitions for the national leadership, was explained by some as an effort to placate the Civic Forum movement. Negotiations Renewed **********Nevertheless, Mr. Pitra's move can be expected to put pressure on Prime Minister Adamec, who has seemed conciliatory toward the opposition but represents a leadership that is grudgingly so, to judge by the Cabinet unveiled on Sunday. **********Mr. Adamec renewed negotiations with Civic Forum after a mass demonstration was held in Prague on Monday to as he was in Moscow for a meeting of Warsaw Pact leaders. At the meeting, the Soviet Union and the four other nations that invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 issued a statement condemning the intervention. The Government here had already condemned the invasion, which crushed the Prague Spring of political liberalization. **********The Warsaw Pact condemnation has the effect of further weakening Communist influence here, since Communist leaders always defended the invasion as a necessary measure to save Communism. **********In a further exertion of pressure, the opposition has called for a general strike next Monday if the national Cabinet is not replaced. **********Addressing a news conference, Mr. Dienstbier said the allotment of seats in the Czech regional cabinet was a ''step in the right direction.'' Protest Statement Endorsed **********Two of the nine non-Communist ministers are from the Socialist Party and two are from the People's Party, both of which had been compliant allies of the Communists but are playing an increasingly independent role. The five other non-Communists have no affiliation. **********While welcoming the new Cabinet, Mr. Dienstbier endorsed a protest statement by leaders of the People's Party, which demanded that non-Communists be given more power. It also demanded that the party give control of the Czech Interior Ministry, which oversees the regional police, to a nonparty figure. **********Demonstrating that it is willing to support reform-oriented leaders regardless of affiliation, Civic Forum said it endorsed eight of the Cabinet members, including a Communist, Milan Lukes, the 56-year-old director of the drama section of the National Theater. **********Explaining the endorsement of Mr. Lukes, a Civic Forum spokesman recounted how in the 1960's Mr. Lukes, a theater historian, had edited a strikingly nonconformist theater periodical until it was banned when the Warsaw Pact forces invaded. A Confederated State **********Czechoslovakia is a confederated state consisting of the Czech Republic and the smaller Slovak Republic, in the mountainous east of the country. **********Under Czechoslovakia's federal system, the Czech and Slovak Governments have control over several areas where the opposition wants reforms, including education, justice and culture. Communists still dominate the Slovak regional government. **********Responding to the pressures of recent weeks, the federal Government last week surrendered its 41-year monopoly on political power and agreed to allow non-Communist ministers.

Perelman, the chairman of Revlon Group Inc., showed interest in acquiring the brokerage firm. Two Takeover Attempts **********It was also Mr. Perelman who put Gillette into play through two aborted takeover attempts. Later, Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm, waged an unsuccessful proxy fight against the company to influence the board to put the company up for sale. Both parties have signed standstill agreements that prevent them from buying shares in Gillette. **********Since then, takeover rumors have been fairly quiet, but Gillette is thought to remain interested in shoring up its defenses, and has disclosed it is considering setting up an employee stock ownership plan, another anti-takeover device that has been upheld by the courts. **********''The primary interest on the part of Gillette is to find somebody that would give them a little protection, and Warren Buffett seems to be going into the business of competing with Lazard's Corporate Partners as a white squire,'' said Paul E.

I. Newhouse Jr. says he is a ''very predictable man.'' **********The resignation yesterday of Robert L. Bernstein as chairman of Random House did stun the publishing world, but the onset of sudden, disorderly change in a Newhouse-owned property has indeed become very predictable of late. To be sure, yesterday's change was a bit more disorderly than usual, since no successor to Mr. Bernstein was named. **********Mr. Newhouse, known as Si, has recently been at the center of a cauldron of harsh opinions for abrupt dismissals in his media empire. Other Sudden Changes **********Some two and a half years ago, Mr. Newhouse replaced William Shawn, longtime editor of The New Yorker, with Robert Gottlieb, drawing heated protest from New Yorker employees who felt Mr. Shawn had been shabbily treated. And last year, he removed Grace Mirabella, longtime editor of Vogue. She first learned of the action from a friend who heard it reported on television by the gossip columnist Liz Smith. When Mr. Newhouse gave Ms. Mirabella the bad news, she said he offered no explanation. **********Several months ago, Anthea Disney was replaced as editor of Self after only a year. She was told about her removal when Mr. Newhouse stopped at her Connecticut house while she was on vacation. **********''There are certain decisions I have to make,'' Mr. Newhouse said yesterday. ''I don't think there is any ideal way of handling this very sensitive area. I think it's quite true that the Grace Mirabella thing was handled awkwardly and could have been handled better. I try my best.'' Family-Held Publishing Empire **********Si Newhouse and his brother, Donald, own one of the biggest and most prosperous family-held publishing empires. The company was nursed to prominence from a single newspaper, The Staten Island Advance, by Samuel I. Newhouse Sr., the self-made publisher. Since his death a decade ago, there has, oddly, been no chief executive; responsibility for the company's swelling array of properties has been split between his two sons, Si, who is 61 years old, and Donald, 60. **********Advance Publications, the holding company for the media properties, is estimated to be worth at least $8 billion. Si Newhouse's official title is chairman, and Donald Newhouse is president, but their power is equal. **********The company consists of daily newspapers (including The Star-Ledger in Newark and The Plain Dealer in Cleveland) the Random House group, Newhouse Broadcasting (which owns some of the country's largest cable television systems), The New Yorker, Details, Parade and Conde Nast Publications (which includes magazines like Vogue, Mademoiselle, Glamour, Vanity Fair, HQ, Bride's, GQ, Gourmet and Self). Division of Responsibilities **********Random House and all the magazines are the province of Si Newhouse; Donald Newhouse tends to the newspapers and broadcasting group. The two brothers, however, keep in constant contact with each other -both at work and socially - and they live only a block apart on Manhattan's Upper East Side. **********Sprinkled throughout the empire are some 20 other Newhouses, far less of a family presence than there once was. ''In the 40's, we once counted up that there were 64 of them,'' Si Newhouse said. ''They were even sweeping the floor.'' **********Si Newhouse refused to say who might succeed Mr. Bernstein. Early conjecture has been that one of the younger Newhouses might get the job. Among those high in the organization are Sam Newhouse, Si's son, publisher of The Jersey Journal, and Steve Newhouse, Donald's son, editor of The Jersey Journal. Donald's other son, Michael, is a Trenton Times executive. Mark Newhouse, the son of Norman Newhouse, the brother of S. I. Newhouse Sr., runs The Newark Star-Ledger, and his brother, Jonathan Newhouse, is being groomed to take over Conde Nast's international operations, based in Paris. Decentralized Management **********The Newhouses have always adhered to decentralized and nonstandardized management. They abhor red tape. Newhouse executives have shied away from conventional management tools, like budgets, long-range planning and profit goals. Though the Newhouses are lavish with top people - some top editors and publishers get costly cars and clothing allowances - they keep a tight lid on salaries further down. **********''We have no real middle management,'' Si Newhouse said. ''Individual entities will have budgets if that's what they want, but we don't have a corporate budget. In fact, I would say very few of our properties do have a budget.'' **********John Reidy, a media analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said: ''From what little we've been able to track, they have tended to set some parameters and let people go. But they are among the most private of private companies. It's hard to know too much about them.'' **********And John Morton, a communications analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington, said, ''Of the major companies, they are by a very, very long stretch the most decentralized company.'' No Headquarters **********The company has no headquarters. Samuel Newhouse's office, in fact, had been his battered brown briefcase. Si Newhouse operates more comfortably. He has a rather bland 14th-floor office in the Conde Nast building on Madison Avenue, and he can typically be found during the lunch hour at his regular table at the Four Seasons. Around the office, he usually goes without tie or shoes. Donald Newhouse operates out of the offices of The Star-Ledger in Newark. **********Both have a reputation for being shy and reluctant to give interviews. Of late, however, Si Newhouse has become more accessible. ''I try to keep private,'' he said. ''I sometimes succeed and sometimes don't.'' **********Si Newhouse gets fairly actively involved day to day at Conde Nast, where he is in effect chief executive. He stays more remote from The New Yorker, Details, Parade and Random House. His main interaction with Random House has been a weekly meeting with Mr. Bernstein, often attended by one or two other top Random House people. Regular Standing Meetings **********Si Newhouse keeps a relatively open calendar, though he has a regular round of standing meetings. He has lunch at the Four Seasons each Tuesday with Mr. Bernstein. On Wednesday morning, he meets with Mitch Fox, the publisher of Details. For lunch on Wednesday, he normally dines at the office with Carlo Vittorini, the chief executive of Parade, though yesterday he ate with his brother and another corporate executive. On Thursday, he lunches at the Four Seasons with Alexander Liberman, the Conde Nast editorial director. Every Friday at 6 A.M., Steven Florio, president of The New Yorker, comes by Mr. Newhouse's office. Mr. Florio often brings a roll, though Mr. Newhouse skips breakfast. **********Because of the swirl of personnel changes recently, a number of publishing people have wondered whether Mr. Newhouse has become impatient and more inclined to be concerned about short-term performance. **********''I don't know,'' he said. ''I don't know if I ever was patient. Somebody else has to comment on that. I'm not sure I'm any different as an executive. I think I've just been me.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/08/business/italy-indicts-35-in-scandal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Italy Indicts 35 in Scandal", "print_headline": "Italy Indicts 35 in Scandal", "body_text": " **********Magistrates investigating Italy's biggest postwar banking scandal indicted 35 people today but cleared the financier Carlo de Benedetti of any wrongdoing in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano. **********Licio Gelli, a financier accused of masterminding right-wing terrorism, subversion and spying, was among 34 people indicted on charges of complicity in fradulent bankruptcy.

His mother and four sisters cry too, for he was the youngest child, the only son, and the family's hope. **********Hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of people were killed when the Government used troops to crush China's democracy movement, and this young man was one of the faces behind the numbers: a 21-year-old apprentice driver who was bicycling to work on Sunday morning when the People's Liberation Army shot him in the back, killing him instantly. **********Each victim has his own story, and the time, place and circumstances of the tragedies differ. But what happened to this young man, who cared little for politics, suggests how the Government's violent clampdown shattered the lives of many innocent families throughout the capital. An Obituary of Sorts **********His story is one dimension of an event that seems likely to leave a permanent scar on the Chinese political process and may take years for the nation to come to grips with. **********Seeking solace in one another's company, family members gathered in their living room this evening as they had each of the previous five days. Since they cremated the body on Wednesday, their fury and horror have turned to numbness and resignation, and the conversation often lapsed into silences that were interrupted by gentle sobs. **********After some discussion, the family members of the young man asked not to be named in this article. The parents seemed too dazed to deal with the question, and they let their daughters and sons-in-law decide. **********They did allow his photo to be published. While they said it probably could be traced, they did not believe the Government would go to such lengths. And they yearned for some way of giving him an identity, an obituary of sorts to record his passing and commemorate his life. The Fateful Morning **********The sisters had all married and moved out of the apartment in the eastern part of the city. So on that Saturday evening, only three family members - the son and his parents - were at home, as the crackle of gunfire echoed throughout the night. The neighborhood is more than four miles from central Tiananmen Square, which had been occupied by student demonstrators and was the epicenter of the violence, but troops were still passing through the area and firing their submachine guns. **********When the son got up Sunday morning at 5:15, he left the apartment and walked downstairs in his slippers to the small entrance of the building. There, he saw a friend who told him that soldiers were shooting into crowds. **********The son returned to the apartment and begged his father not to go to work that day. His father decided to go, because otherwise there would be no one else that day to manage the market that he supervises. So after his father left, the son headed out for work, too, despite his mother's pleas. At 5:50 A.M., he got on his bicycle and turned toward a nearby intersection. A Shot in the Back **********Soldiers on military trucks still were parading through the area. When the young man saw the troops, he turned around and started cycling back home, witnesses told the family. In a moment, he was shot in the back by a bullet that pierced his heart. He collapsed on top of his bicycle, probably already dead. It was not even 6 A.M. **********Soon after that, the sounds of gunshots subsided, and residents in the area took his body to the hospital, along with others who had been wounded. Witnesses said that up to eight people were killed in the area. **********At 7 A.M., a neighbor came around to the house and told the victim's mother that her son had been shot to death by the People's Liberation Army. A son-in-law who works in the neighborhood had heard what had happened, and ran home to tell his wife, who then immediately went over to see her mother. She would not let her mother go to the hospital, and instead, the daughter and other family members who lived nearby went to the local hospital where the son had been taken. They confirmed the body was his. **********''A mother hears that her small child has been killed, and how is she supposed to feel?'' said the mother, tears in her eyes as she sat on the edge of the couch. What a Chinese Father Fears **********Finally, at noon the mother went with some of her daughters to the hospital. Soon after, the father returned home to find only an empty apartment. The daughters hesitated to tell their father, since he had once suffered a heart attack. But at 2 P.M., the mother told the father about their son's death. **********''When a man gets old, what he fears the most is that he will lose his son,'' said the father, who talked less than his wife and daughters. In China, it has been a tradition to favor sons, and every family wants at least one. Now, his only son had been killed. **********The father may also feel a twinge of blame, because he had refused to heed his son's advice to stay at home that day. If he had, perhaps his son would also have remained at home. **********The son, a junior high school graduate who did not attend high school, had been apprenticing as a bus driver. Every Sunday the apprentices rotated work at the depot in a suburb of Beijing. **********To work as a driver is to have one of the best and most lucrative careers in China. The son would have graduated next month, around the time of his 22d birthday. Torn by Old Loyalties **********''He never understood politics,'' said his mother. ''Sometimes he would play mah-jongg, although he was only an average player.'' **********He spent most of his time in the neighborhood with friends. His parents said he rarely went to Tiananmen Square during the recent unrest, although he almost always watched the news and read the newspapers. **********His father has been a member of the Communist Party since the 1950's, and for him, his son's death is not only spiritually painful, but also intellectually vexing. **********''I believe in Communism,'' his father said with great effort. He admits that he does not believe entirely in the Government's explanations of events of Sunday morning, but he tries to explain that the crackdown does not discredit the entire party. **********While his daughters are openly critical of the Government and the Party, the father is clearly torn by a loyalty and sense of obligation that has been conditioned by years of party discipline, but that is now slowly being eroded by the circumstances of the death of his son. **********''The political situation is very complicated, and there is a great deal I don't understand,'' the father said. ''I think the yearning for democracy is good. But a later generation will have to grapple with it. We cannot judge events in our own times.'' So Many Bodies, So Little Room **********He did not comment directly on the Government, but said passionately that he believes the massacre was the greatest disaster that has befallen Communist China. **********''Public opinion will be just,'' said the father, and then he quoted a common saying. ''Those who are just will be supported by the people. Those who are not just will not win support.'' **********The conversation turned to logistical difficulties the family has had to face during the week. The first hospital the young man was brought to was small and did not have a morgue, but friends brought blocks of ice to help preserve the body. The family then transported him to a larger hospital, and even then they had to rely on connections to secure him a place. **********''They were turning away the bodies of those who had been shot because there were just too many,'' said the youngest of the sisters. ''The front yard of the hospital was covered with dead bodies.'' **********Even making preparations for the cremation ceremony was difficult, because going around town and notifying people was more complex when troops patrolled the streets and public transportation was virtually nonexistent. 'I Can't Understand Why' **********He was cremated on Wednesday morning in a Western suit, his favorite set of clothes, and many neighbors helped the family, making wreaths and white flowers or cooking meals for them. None of the friends seemed worried about helping a family whose son had been killed and might be accused posthumously of being a counterrevolutionary. **********After all this, his mother is direct about her feelings. ''A few days ago, the television news said the People's Liberation Army had come to maintain order, not to crush the masses or the students,'' she said. ''It said we should continue to work, and so we did. And then they killed my son.'' **********''I simply can't understand why they killed my son,'' she said. ''He didn't burn any trucks and he didn't fire at the soldiers. He just went to work.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/world/leftist-salvador-party-accuses-army-of-3-killings.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1989-11-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 619, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leftist Salvador Party Accuses Army of 3 Killings", "print_headline": "Leftist Salvador Party Accuses Army of 3 Killings", "body_text": " **********A left-wing political party charged today in San Salvador that the army had kidnapped and murdered three civilians, including at least two of its members, in the western city of Sonsonate.

Agents of the Office for the Protection of State Secrets got one check from Prague, the pun goes, and another from their real bosses at K.G.B. headquarters in Moscow. **********The disturbing news from Eastern Europe this winter, American intelligence officials say, is that the punch line has not yet changed. **********Despite a democratic revolt that has shaken Communist rule in Czechoslovakia and five other Eastern bloc states, those nations' espionage agencies have not slackened their vigorous efforts to steal Western technology and military secrets, often at Soviet direction, several officials said in interviews. **********''We don't see very much indication that any of these countries are diminishing their overseas intelligence activities, with the possible exception of a somewhat greater emphasis on their own interests as opposed to the broader interests of the East bloc,'' a State Department official said. Infancy of Democratic Revolt **********That official and others caution that the democratic revolt is still in its infancy. Eastern bloc spy agencies, they predict, will eventually warm to Western-style government and to inducements, like trade agreements, that will reduce their incentive to spy on the West. **********They also agree that the radical changes in the East bloc will eventually cripple the ability of the Soviet Union's primary intelligence agency, the K.G.B., to use its old allies as surrogates in espionage battles between East and West. **********''In general, what liaison there was is going to break down further; no question about it,'' said an Administration expert who declined to be identified. **********''If I were Kryuchkov I wouldn't be a happy man right now,'' he said. Col. Gen. Vladimir A. Kryuchkov is the K.G.B. chief. **********Yet there are few signs that such changes are occurring this winter. On the contrary, several Administration officials and private experts said, the K.G.B. appears in some cases to have stepped up its ''tasking'' of Eastern bloc agencies for specific missions against Western targets. Communists in Control **********Of the six nations swept by pressures for democratic change - Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania and East Germany - Communists allied with the Soviet Government remain in apparent control of intelligence-related agencies in all but Czechoslovakia and Rumania. **********Intelligence experts also noted that there has been but a trickle of defectors from Soviet bloc spy services during the democratic upheaval, although defections usually increase in times of political uncertainty. **********Although Central Intelligence Agency officials refused to be interviewed, the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, said publicly this fall that the warming of East-West relations is stirring an increase in espionage, not a decrease. **********In remarks Nov. 29 to the National Press Club, Mr. Webster said it was too early to tell whether Eastern bloc nations would curb their spying on American targets. **********''Let us not assume that because we are getting friendly and seeing freedom come up from the streets, that freedom has been endorsed by some of those aggressive intelligence services,'' he said. Well-Founded Concern **********Mr. Webster's concern is well-founded, officials say. While the public views espionage as a purely Soviet affair, some of the decade's most damaging spies were recruited and run by the K.G.B.'s East bloc allies. **********East German agents managed a ring of spies from 1978 to 1988 inside one of the United States' most sensitive electronic listening posts, atop a wooded hill in West Berlin. The American inquiry into the case has produced one espionage conviction and a guilty plea and is continuing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Friday. **********Czechoslovak and Polish agents this decade have sought Western military and technological secrets with great success, and Hungarian agents ran a spy network within United States Army installations in Europe that acquired some of NATO's most tightly held war plans. **********Much, if not all of that information was sold or given to the Soviets. ''Obviously, these are still countries that had their own interests, but historically the K.G.B. could get access to just about anything they wanted,'' said W. Douglas Gow, the F.B.I.'s new assistant director for counterintelligence. Change Is Unlikely Soon **********Mr. Gow and others say they anticipate some easing of the K.G.B.'s grip, but few expect serious change soon. For one thing, they said, the new civilian rulers in some nations - playwrights, coal miners, exiles - are probably too naive or too consumed by economic problems to worry about spying. **********''We've often found that changes have taken place in the East bloc countries without any similar changes taking place in those countries' foreign-intelligence-gathering networks,'' said John C. Whitehead, Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. ''That's not because the new governments wanted to keep the networks in business, but simply because the new people in office didn't know what was going on in their own services.'' **********In any case, friends of the Soviet Government appear to control most spying outright through the interior ministries, which generally manage the domestic secret police and espionage. **********For example, Poland's Solidarity leadership conceded the Interior Ministry to Communists in what some American officials called a tacit agreement with Mr. Gorbachev to allow a peaceful transfer to democracy. Intelligence in East Berlin **********East Germany abolished its Ministry for State Security and its hated secret police, but re-established an intelligence service that will report to Prime Minister Hans Modrow, a Gorbachev favorite. **********''No one will be so naive as to think that our country is the only one in the world that can do without intelligence service reconnaissance abroad,'' the East Berlin newspaper National-Zeitung said two weeks ago. **********Even in Czechoslovakia, where the Interior Ministry has been moved from Communist control to a troika that includes two leaders of the opposition, American officials say they see no change so far. **********Other East bloc nations are likely to feel the same need to spy on the West as long as a vestige of the cold war remains, some experts noted. Zdzislaw M. Rurarz, a former Polish diplomat who defected to the United States in 1981, noted pointedly in an interview that the United States was undoubtedly continuing to spy on the Solidarity-run Government there. **********It would be foolish, he said, to expect the Poles not to reciprocate. Two Question Marks **********The two question marks are Hungary and Rumania, American officials say. In Rumania, it is unclear whether the Communist or anti-Communist factions of the ruling Council of National Salvation will gain the upper hand, but hatred of Communism runs so deep that many experts doubt that the Communists will prevail. **********Hungary's intelligence directorate is Communist-run, but the state has dismantled the Communist Party bureaucracy, leaving it in civilian control. The United States has also warned Hungary that thefts of American technology will kill plans to ease curbs on the legal export of those technologies. **********''The Hungarians seem further along than anybody,'' one official said, and have even offered to help prevent the leak of sensitive technologies to hostile countries. **********In an apparent bow to American intelligence concerns, Hungary's new Government this fall deported Edward Lee Howard, a turncoat C.I.A. agent who in 1985 helped the K.G.B. destroy much of the agency's Moscow espionage network. The Hungarians have denied deporting Mr. Howard, but American officials confirmed a Los Angeles Times report of the action. 'Net Loss' for the K.G.B.  How deeply the K.G.B. will be hurt by the East bloc changes looms as the biggest unanswered question of all. **********Roy Godson, head of the Washington-based National Strategy Information Center and a well-known intelligence scholar, called any democratic change ''a net loss'' for Soviet intelligence. But he cautioned against euphoria. **********''The Soviets wouldn't have relied on just official cooperation,'' he said. ''It would be surprising if they haven't unilaterally penetrated friendly services with their own agents, too.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/22/business/company-news-forest-city-stake-of-15-is-sought.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-06-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 205, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Forest City Stake Of 15% Is Sought", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Forest City Stake Of 15% Is Sought", "body_text": " **********A group led by Interstate Properties Inc., a New Jersey development concern, and two of its general partners filed for permission from Federal antitrust regulators to raise its stake in Forest City Enterprises Inc. to 15 percent.

Tula is a factory town of 600,000, about 120 miles south of the Soviet capital. **********But this time, as the congress beams home relentlessly to the provinces, Tula residents are beginning to show signs of behaving like constituents demanding service from politicians they elected, as the possibility dawns that they might even diselect them the next time around. **********''We waited for this so long they better start passing some real laws soon,'' said Valery I. Seredkov, a worker at the Kosorgor metals factory. ''Their speeches had better get more specific.'' **********His comment, offered as a word to the wise, was fleshed out by a colleague, Anatoly I. Grachev. ''We need to manage our own money in this factory,'' he said, demanding budgetary and administrative independence to build workers' pride. An Unfamiliar Responsiveness **********''We have many nannies above us,'' he added. But still he estimated that enough of the new legislators were listening to the voters that he actually expects progress on local self-management, long a cliche of the Communist agenda. **********A mix of confidence, considerable curiosity and a touch of show-me crankiness about the display of democracy in the Kremlin emerged in a day of interviews in Tula. **********''Tula was always a quiet, slow place,'' said Aleksandr G. Yermakov, deputy editor of the local newspaper Kommunar, describing how the congress has fixed residents to their TV screens, cutting down letters to the editor from the daily average of 100 to 12. ''I'm surprised it's waking them up. But when the congress took a day off, people felt something was lost. If Tula can be moved that way, that means the whole country is moved.'' **********The paper's editor, Yevgeny S. Nazarov, was hoping that the congress would soon offer a clear law regarding journalists. ''We need to know what we can and cannot do,'' he said, anxious as the authoritarian certitudes are eased. **********However his deputy, Mr. Yermakov, tninks that things might best be left to evolve in the current gray areas that he finds increasingly creative. Last year, he recalled, the people prodded the paper with letters and then protest meetings about a new luxury hospital being built strictly for the privileged of the Government hierarchy. The paper risked one story, then another, and Moscow soon reversed plans and ordered that the hospital be opened to the public. Red Becomes Green **********More remarkably, the local environmental movement has grown strong enough to create a curious problem out at a new factory. The plant is to produce laundry detergent, one of the commodities in shortest supply nationwide. But its machinery is so pollution-prone that objections from the community have succeeded in stopping the factory for now. **********The concern is understandable, for Tula sits under a cloud of industrial pollution. For three centuries, it has been a conservative bastion - with its prosperity tied to factories making armaments, pride of the patriot's spirit, and samovars, fonts for the Russian soul. **********Tula's downtown offers the lean and dusty look of a mid-American town in the 1940's. The outskirts are stippled with charming old ax-hewn homes. But the surface quiet is misleading, according to Anatoly I. Ovechkin, the chief political reporter on Kommunar, who knows how deeply concerned the party wheelhorses are over the local elections next year. Insurgents are already lining up even greater challenges to the party apparatus, emboldened by the more outspoken congressional deputies. **********''In the past, there were only stereotypes,'' he said. ''It didn't matter whether the voters responded to campaigning because there was only one candidate. Now the party is discovering how ridiculous that was.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/06/world/salvador-rebels-issue-threats-against-judges.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salvador Rebels Issue Threats Against Judges", "print_headline": "Salvador Rebels Issue Threats Against Judges", "body_text": " **********El Salvador's leftist rebels today threatened officials connected to a court order that briefly released two army officers and a right-wing businessman thought to be involved in a kidnapping ring. **********The threat came as the guerrillas stepped up their attacks throughout the country, bombing banks in the capital and hitting government offices in the provinces, military officials said. **********After protests from church and government officials and from the President-elect, Alfredo Cristiani, a judge's order releasing the three kidnapping suspects was reversed on Monday.

Two territorial policemen were killed and 14 wounded, it said.  [ In New York, an official of the guerrilla organization denied the South African account of the infiltration and battle. Rather, he said, he had received reports that South African helicopters had attacked two villages in northern Namibia, killing eight people. ]  The clash appeared to be one of the bloodiest in the 22-year insurgency against South African rule. **********South African military units requested and received permission from the United Nations, which is supervising the transition, to dispatch helicopters to evacuate the wounded. The military units have been confined to their bases, starting today, under arrangements for independence. Warning From Pretoria **********The United Nations special representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtissari, who arrived Friday, said that he considered the development ''very serious'' and that he was dispatching four senior aides Sunday to the area where the fighting was reported. **********The South African Foreign Minister, Roelof F. Botha, warned that unless the Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar clarified his position on what Mr. Botha called a ''flagrant violation'' by the guerrillas, South Africa would have no choice but to ask the United Nations to leave Namibia ''until Swapo can be brought to its senses.'' He was referring to the guerrilla group by its initials. **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who visited Namibia today, said a special session of the United Nations Security Council should be called to consider the alleged incursion. ''This a most serious challenge to the authority of the United Nations and the agreement, and we condemn it totally,'' she said. **********While it was too early to predict the effect of the incident, it seemed unlikely that either side would let such a clash scuttle a process that was painstakingly worked out over the last year in a succession of capitals before being formally signed at the United Nations in December. **********South African officials declined to say where the clash took place, but it was understood to have happened near the frontier town of Ruacana, where Cuban and Angolan prisoners of war were exchanged Friday for a captured South African soldier. **********According to Mr. Botha, the fighting involved two separate groups of infiltrators of from 30 to 40 men each. Ceasefire in Effect **********A South African spokesman would not specify whether the fighting took place before or after a formal cease-fire between South Africa and the guerrillas went into effect today at 6 A.M. local time. Through the spokesman, Mr. Botha had called the guerrillas' agreement to cease all hostile actions ''farcical and meaningless.'' **********The rebel group's acting chairman here, Daniel Tjingarero, seemed surprised to learn of the incident and said he would have to consult with Swapo headquarters in Luanda, the Angolan capital, before commenting. **********Under the agreement, armed rebel units were to be deployed well away from the border, though unarmed Namibian refugees may return home. **********Today, after 73 years of South African rule, Namibia embarked on its long-awaited transition to independence under United Nations supervision. **********Prime Minister Thatcher, who completed a tour of four other African nations, flew from Malawi to Namibia today, ostensibly to visit British troops serving in the United Nations Transitional Assistance Group. **********Before leaving Namibia, Mrs. Thatcher met Mr. Botha at the Windhoek airport, where he briefed her on the alleged cease-fire violation. **********The United Nations contingent was created under Security Council Resolution 435, which provides the timetable for the end of South African rule. **********The resolution was adopted in 1978, but was only put into effect after the political settlement, brokered by the United States, which linked Namibian independence to the pullout of Cuban troops from Angola. **********The timetable envisions national elections in seven months for an assembly that will draft a constitution. It concludes, after another round of elections, with an April 1990 target date for full independence. **********Namibia has a population of about 1.3 million people, of whom about 80,000 are white and 50,000 are of mixed race. **********South Africa captured Namibia from Germany during World War I and has ruled it since as the territory of South-West Africa, initially under a mandate from the League of Nations. For years, South Africa rejected United Nations demands that it relinquish the vast territory. **********Under the terms of Resolution 435, South Africa will continue to administer the territory until independence while the United Nations supervises ''free and fair elections.'' The United Nations contingent will include 4,350 infantry and support troops, 300 military observers, 500 policemen and more than 1,300 civilians. Fewer than 1,000 soldiers and about 100 civilians have arrived. Marchers Are Turned Back **********The rebels tried to mount a march into Windhoek this morning from the adjacent black township of Katatura. But the thousands of marchers were turned back along the highway by a line of armed territorial policemen. **********Gerhard Roux, a spokesman for South Africa's administrator, Louis A. Pienaar, said the organizers had failed to request permission. Rebel officials insisted they had applied and blamed the United Nations force for not overruling the police. **********Swapo and two other political coalitions later held rallies in Katatura.

At the same time, it concluded debate over whether the 1956 revolt, put down by Soviet forces, was a popular uprising against Communism, as many Hungarians privately hold, or a counterrevolution, as the Communists maintained. **********By contrast, Czechoslovakia, one of the bloc's most rigidly controlled states, still rejects any re-evaluation of the Soviet-led invasion of 1968, which crushed the brief liberalization under Alexander Dubcek. **********East Germany's hard-line Government, tracing its origins to Stalin's determination to install a pro-Soviet Communist regime on German soil after the defeat of the Nazis, refuses to even consider joining the anti-Stalinist campaign sweeping the Soviet Union of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Relationship With Stalin **********In Warsaw, too, the origins of power intertwine inextricably with Stalinist Russia. **********Most of the documents the Government cites to support its Katyn massacre accusations against Moscow consist of reports by Polish teams that visited the forest in 1943, shortly after the bodies were exhumed by the Germans. The Polish teams, sent at the request of the pro-Western Polish government-in-exile in London, concluded that the men had been executed in 1940 by Soviet troops who took them prisoner in 1939. The Poles, not wanting to provide grist for the Nazi propaganda mill, withheld the reports. **********But when Nazi Germany later accused Stalin, the Russians said the Germans themselves had executed the officers in 1941, after overrunning the Soviet camps where the Poles had been held prisoner. When the Polish government-in-exile called on Moscow to explain, Stalin used the affair as a pretext to sever ties with that regime and to establish one that became, in effect, the forerunner of today's Warsaw Government. **********For the Polish leadership, severing that link with Stalin is at least part of the justification for the about-face over Katyn. Spoken of in Private **********The issue is a delicate one. If the truth about Katyn has long been known by most ordinary Poles, who kept it alive in the private remembrances of homes, churches and cemeteries, it has also become a kind of sacred trust of the opposition movement around the Solidarity trade union. **********Solidarity's underground press kept alive discussion of the events, and during the union's legal existence, a monument to those killed at Katyn went up at Warsaw's main cemetery, only to be removed by the police when the union was crushed after martial law was declared in December 1981. **********The party, now negotiating with Solidarity about the shape of change in Poland, apparently finds it more conducive to its own survival to feed national feeling than to mollify Moscow. Today, for the first time since martial law was declared, the authorities allowed students to march legally in Warsaw to commemorate an attack on students March 8, 1968, that signaled the start of a crackdown against students, intellectuals and Poland's few Jews, and the crushing of hopes for liberalization under the leader Wladyslaw Gomulka. Pictures at a Demonstration **********The demonstrators marched past the giant Palace of Culture, a pile of granite thrown up at the behest of Stalin, while Soviet tourists took snapshots of themselves with those registering the protest. **********The Government's continued search for accommodation also includes overtures to the Roman Catholic Church and to Poles abroad. Much of this centers on the events planned later this year to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the war in Europe. **********Last week, an official committee to plan the commemorations called on the Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, to restore Polish citizenship to Gen. Wladyslaw Anders. General Anders, who died in 1970, formed an army in the Soviet Union in 1943 but evacuated it to the West when Stalin broke off relations with the Polish government-in-exile. For years after the war, the official view was that veterans of that army, which was anti-Communist and the largest and best-organized Polish resistance force, were traitors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/business-people-2-ford-grandsons-get-key-committee-posts.html": {"writer_name": "Doron Levin", "pub_date": "1989-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 506, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2 Ford Grandsons Get Key Committee Posts", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; 2 Ford Grandsons Get Key Committee Posts", "body_text": " **********Two grandsons of Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford Motor Company, were named yesterday to the executive and finance committees of the company's board, an important step toward their goal of keeping a family member at or near the top of the company. **********A Ford spokesman said Edsel B.

Such sales are viewed as distinct from routine Fed buying and selling of Government debt issues on behalf of customers. **********The overnight matched sales by the Fed had little impact on the Federal funds rate, its chief tool in manipulating the credit market. The funds, which banks charge each other for overnight loans among other things, was 9 3/8 percent at the time of the Fed's operation before noon, but closed a touch high at 9 7/16 percent. **********Meanwhile, the discount rate on 90-day Treasury bills fell 7 basis points, to 8.15 percent; the six-month bills were unchanged at 8.08 percent, and the one-year bills lost 6 basis points, at 7.92 percent. **********In the last five sessions, the Fed is believed to have sold an average of $500 million of Treasury paper for the Bank of Japan and much lesser amounts for other central banks. Much of the proceeds of the sales are believed to have been or will be used in operations to arrest the rise in the dollar. Improved Market Sentiment **********The strengthening of the dollar also improved market sentiment, but dealers also pointed out that much of the ''retail'' buying came from the speculative element, which normally focuses on the more volatile long end of the Treasury market. **********As a result, the bellwether Treasury long bonds, the 8 7/8 percent issue due 2019, were being offered late in the session at 106 17/32, up 22/32 on the day, with the yield falling to 8.28 percent, from 8.34 percent the day before. **********Among other respresentive issues traded in the secondary market, the 9 1/8 percent notes of 1999 climbed 13/ 32, to 105 13/32, as the yield fell to 8.31 percent from 8.37 percent; the 8 5/8's of 1994 rose 7/32, at 101 2/32, with the yield declining to 8.35 percent from 8.40; the 8 3/4's of 1991 gained 3/32, at 100 16/32, while the yield dropped to 8.46 percent, from 8.51 percent the day before. **********Whether the bond market will resume its advance at the same strong pace as in the recent past is considered unlikely, according to Akira Akiyama, vice president and chief economist at the New York branch of the Sanwa Bank. As Mr. Akiyama explained in an iterview: **********''We expect that Japanese financial institutions, such as pension funds and insurance companies, will limit their purchases of Treasury securities for the foreseeable future. The Japanese Ministry of Finance is, shall we say, encouraging this position until it studies the situation.'' Volatility of the Dollar **********Perhaps the recent sharp rise in prices of Treasury issues has alarmed Japan's monetary officials, or the volatility of the dollar, or the unsettled political situation in Japan, Mr. Akiyama suggested. But the fact remains that yields at the long end of the Treasury market have dropped to about 8.3 percent from 9.2 percent in the last few weeks. he continued. **********''That is quite a drop in so short a time,'' Mr. Akiyama said. ''But we do not expect a similar decline over the next four weeks. For one, the domestic economy here may be softening, but it is not headed for a recession.'' **********What does concern many Japanese and other foreign investors is the huge amount of debt that may be issued by Washington as part of its plan to salvage the beleaguered savings and loan industry.

The optimists believed the economic analysis of the 12 Federal Reserve district banks will provide ample evidence that the economy is weakening and therefore encourage the Fed to ease. Others say the report, commonly termed the ''Tan Book'' in Wall Street, is a compilation of data that are already known and thus will have little if any impact on the market. **********Today, the Treasury is scheduled to announce the terms of its auctions of new two- and four-year notes, which would then be held next Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/25/business/business-forum-how-business-behaves-wall-street-s-greed-is-fueled-by-fear.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Shames", "pub_date": "1989-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street's Greed Is Fueled by Fear", "print_headline": "BUSINESS FORUM: HOW BUSINESS BEHAVES; Wall Street's Greed Is Fueled by Fear", "body_text": " **********DURING the 1980's, proven or alleged business crimes tended to be perpetrated by people who were already rich and whose hunger for more cannot be linked to any reasonable need. From the escapades of Ivan Boesky to the smirking and pseudo-shrewd misdeeds of the so-called yuppie crime ring, this decade has featured some of the more tawdry goings-on in American business history. But did Michael Milken, who stands accused of multiple infractions of the securities laws, need the relatively small proportion of his $500 million income that the Government claims was ill-gotten? And how about the others whose actions were beyond the bounds of social propriety? **********Something beyond reason and beyond ordinary ambition has been feeding this runaway avarice. And for all the righteous blather that has poured forth in response to this cynical and blatant grabbiness, I have yet to read an explanation that rings true as to why the 1980's have been such a shamelessly greedy time. **********The explanation I have heard most often I call the too-much-temptation argument. This argument says that because of high-yield ''junk bonds'', the feverish activity in mergers and acquisitions and the sheer volume of trading in the pre-crash days, unprecedented amounts of cash flowed in the direction of Wall Street. Bright people who had been weaned on the idea of acquiring wealth just could not pull themselves away from the trillion-dollar candy counter. **********There is something comforting about this explanation. It suggests that our problems - both economic and moral - are simply problems of excess: an excess of wealth being pursued with an excess of zeal. Thus, even while we beat our breasts about ethical lapses we are, perversely, bragging. Our problem, according to the too-much-temptation argument, is simply that we have gotten too rich and too clever for our own good. **********However, the too-much-temptation argument fails to square with almost everything we know about history and human nature. People do not play grab-and-hoard when they believe times are good. People act like squirrels, stuffing their jowls and stashing away their gains, when instinct tells them that harder seasons are to come. It has been demonstrated again and again, from Imperial Rome to Weimar Germany, that epidemic greed is a symptom not of reveling in present triumphs but of a fear that the game is winding down. **********Fear - that is the important word. And it is my contention that people are greedy when they fear that the money may not be there tomorrow. But if I am correct, why has there been so little talk about the role of fear and pessimism about the future as the underpinnings of the greed? **********My belief is that Americans will go to almost any length to avoid acknowledging fear, because fear is thought to be subversive, unpatriotic and even morbid. It seems so much more wholesome, so much more constructive to cleave to a blithe chamber of commerce-style boosterism - even when that attitude is out of keeping with what can be readily observed in the nation. **********It is a fact that, beginning in 1973 and continuing through the 1980's, real earnings nationwide have gone basically nowhere. It is a fact that, for all the hype about the Reagan recovery, there have been, for more than 15 years now, shifting pockets of recession - from the Rust Belt to the Oil Patch to the financial centers - with no region immune. It is also a fact that all the erudite manipulations of the dollar have failed to solve the trade deficit. And it is a fact that the national debt shows no real signs of coming under control. **********In light of these problems, can anyone really believe that the greed of the 1980's has been a function of hale high spirits and flush and free-wheeling times? Isn't it more accurate to portray this decade's money frenzy as being motivated by the desire to make one's bundle before the casino closes? **********Don't misunderstand me, I am not trying to promote panic or gloom. But there are reasonable grounds to fear for America's economic future, and I fail to see anything subversive, disloyal or shameful about admitting it. If we don't admit it, where's the incentive to do something about it? **********America does have a great stock of zeal for doing business and a great stock of ingenuity for pulling wealth out of almost any situation. On those points, I heartily agree with the too-much-temptation school of thought. **********But pulling private fortunes out of troubled waters - and pretending in the meantime to a confidence that one doesn't truly feel - is an ignoble use of talent and brains. We would be wiser to fess up to our fears and reserve our highest honors for those who meaningfully assuage them by creating wealth that is more widespread. Feeling fear, and not admitting it, can only perpetuate the greed that has made the 1980's not only a crass decade but a time when American business sometimes acted against its own best interest."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/20/business/the-media-business-advertising-grace-rothschild.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-03-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grace & Rothschild", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Grace & Rothschild", "body_text": " **********Grace & Rothschild was the beneficiary last week of the Century Furniture Company's decision to move its in-house advertising account to an outside agency.

Those in the market for a new home would be well advised to be sure they are eligible for the capital gains rollover, lest they inadvertently create a situation that will make them liable for a big tax. **********For example, Joel S. Isaacson, a certified public accountant who is in charge of personal financial planning for Weber Lipshie & Company, said he had an unmarried client who bought a co-op apartment in January 1988. Since then the client became engaged, and he wanted to sell his co-op and buy a larger apartment. But there was a catch - the two-year rule. **********The client had rolled the gain from an earlier apartment over into his current one. According to the Internal Revenue Service's Publication 523, ''Tax Information on Selling Your Home,'' ''if you sell your new main home within two years after the sale of your old home and any part of the gain was not recognized, you generally may not postpone tax on the gain on the sale of the new home.'' **********The couple decided they would live in the smaller apartment for a time after the wedding, until they could legally roll the capital gain over into another home. **********But another of Mr. Isaacson's clients, an older couple, felt that family sentiment was more important than the tax consequences of a move. They inherited a family home worth $500,000 in Massachusetts and decided to sell their New York apartment and move there. The apartment, which had a cost basis of $100,000, sold for $700,000. Because they were over the age of 55, they could exclude $125,000 of the capital gain, bringing it down to $475,000. **********The couple could sell the family home, buy a comparable home nearby, rolling the gain on the apartment over into the new home, and bank the inheritence, Mr. Isaacson pointed out. But the couple, who felt personal ties to the family home, chose to move there and pay the tax on the capital gain. **********With the trends toward older marriages and more second marriages, where both husband and wife may already own a home, many situations are arising that call for careful tax planning, Mr. Isaacson said. For example, if both own a home and they decide to live in one and sell the other, depending on personal circumstances, it may be advantageous to convert the one to be sold to a rental property for some period before selling. **********Sidney Kess, a certified public accountant and tax lawyer in New York, pointed out that when the old residence is owned individually by one spouse but the replacement residence is bought jointly, or vice versa, an unintended taxable gain may result. But it can be avoided by making an elective consent under Code Section 1034(g) to reduce the basis by the gain that is not recognized as a result of filing the consent, he added. **********If an elderly widow and widower who plan to marry each own a home and have not previously taken their $125,000 exclusion, from a tax standpoint they would be wise to sell both homes before the wedding, he said. That way each can take the exclusion. Afterward, only one exclusion is available. Deduction Denied **********Robert Willens, a senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton and a certified public accountant, studies tax records that could affect the firm's corporate clients or investors. He says a Tax Court decision against Willamette Industries late last month could be of widespread corporate interest because it concerns contested liabilities, which are quite common. **********Willamette and several other plywood producers were found guilty of price-fixing in 1974, but the jury did not set the dollar amount of the liability. During the appeals process Willamette paid the Bank of America $85,000 for a $20 million letter of credit, which was transferred to a trust in December 1981 to be drawn upon in the event of a final judgment or of a voluntary settlement. **********''A liability does not create a tax deduction until it's fixed and determinable,'' Mr. Willens noted. ''Thus, generally, contested liabilities such as asbestos liabilities or Dalkon Shield liabilities cannot be the subject of a tax deduction,'' he said, unless the taxpayer puts money or other property into escrow to satisfy the asserted liability. **********Letters of credit have been held to be property if received, and Willamette claimed a $20 million deduction on its 1981 return. But a special trial judge, Carleton D. Powell, reasoned that Willamette had merely transferred a contingent liability to the plaintiffs for a contingent liability to the bank, and said, ''This type of legerdemain does violence to both the letter and spirit'' of the law."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/29/world/clamor-in-the-east-bush-pledges-no-surprises-at-malta-on-cuts-in-troops.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1989-11-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 766, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Pledges 'No Surprises' At Malta on Cuts in Troops", "print_headline": "CLAMOR IN THE EAST; Bush Pledges 'No Surprises' At Malta on Cuts in Troops", "body_text": " **********President Bush declared today that he does not intend to strike a deal that would sharply reduce troop levels in Europe when he meets this weekend with Mikhail S.

'No Surprises' **********Administration officials insisted today that Pentagon budget planning and preparations for the summit meeting were proceeding on separate tracks. Mr. Fitzwater had linked the two issues in his regular briefing Monday, saying that Mr. Bush would be taking the Pentagon's budget proposals with him to Malta. **********In his comments, Mr. Bush also appeared to be sending a message to the Western allies that there would be ''no surprises'' from the Malta meeting. **********American officials and Western diplomats said the recent spate of news reports about the Pentagon's plans for significant spending cuts over the next four years have unnerved members of the alliance, who were assured only a few months ago that the United States was not planning far-reaching reductions before the conventional-arms talks with the Soviet Union were concluded. **********''I am not going to go off and prematurely jump out there and try to grandstand by committing them to something,'' Mr. Bush said of the NATO countries.

And on Friday, even the low inflation numbers in the Producer Price Index report for June did not send yields lower, as might have been expected, and the long bond traded at a yield of 8.09 percent. **********Some investors say that the 8 percent yield may be difficult to pierce for several weeks. In fact, even the bond bulls think that yields may rise, or ''back up,'' temporarily before resuming the decline that began in late March when the yield peaked at 9.30 percent. **********''I wouldn't be surprised to see the market back up first,'' said Frederick Quirsfeld, portfolio manager of the IDS Bond Fund in Minneapolis, who thinks the long bond's yield could drop to 7.5 percent. ''This might be a good place to take a rest.'' **********Bondholders have enjoyed stunning investment returns this year. Indeed, since late March the 30-year Treasury bond had a total return - interest income plus the price appreciation that occurs when yields fall - of more than 17 percent, according to the First Boston Corporation. **********Yet the bulls believe that the bond rally has more in store. In fact, after grudgingly accepting this rally, more strategists like Edward Hyman, vice chairman of C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell & Company now believe that the yields on long bonds could drop to 7 percent by the end of the year. The decline in inflation and the weakness in the economy suggest to them that interest rates will decline further and that the Federal Reserve will ease credit further, making long-term bonds more attractive. **********A resumption of the rally in bond prices could in turn be strong enough to attract buying from the individual and professional investors who were surprised by the decline in yields and who so far have missed the move. ''I don't think this market is overbought,'' Mr. Hyman said. **********Indeed, Mr. Hyman and others pointed out that a large number of individuals and professional investors had not yet benefited from the drop in long-bond yields. Dealers say the decline has been fueled by large purchases by foreign institutions, which rushed in when the dollar began to climb in value early this year. **********In April and May, for instance, Japanese investors bought $24 billion in foreign stocks and bonds, according to Robert V. DiClemente, a director of research at Salomon Brothers, and dealers estimate that much of this buying was in Treasury securities. **********But for the most part, investors were caught off guard by the rally, and some even sold bonds when the move began. For instance, in the first half of the year, individuals withdrew $8 billion from mutual funds that invest in Government bonds and securities backed by the Government National Mortgage Association, according to the Investment Company Institute, a Washington trade group. **********Professional money managers were just as unprepared for the sudden rally. In May, the portfolio managers of bond mutual funds had their highest cash levels since 1984, according to the investment institute and a weekly poll of 50 portfolio managers by C. J. Lawrence indicates that institutional bond managers have not invested all of their available cash and that they own fixed-income securities with maturities that are lower than the managers' so-called benchmark. **********This study indicates that the money managers' investment returns probably are lagging behind the market indexes and that they may feel pressure to buy more bonds. ''People who've been left out will look for opportunities to get in,'' Mr. DiClemente said. **********There are some signs that new buying may have begun already. Because short-term yields also have fallen - though not as much as those on the long bond - at some firms individual investors are beginning to move back into bonds. Investors are starting to move out of short-term funds and into long-term bond funds that offer greater price appreciation, say officials at these organizations. **********As a result of the decline in short rates, investors directed $12 million in new cash into the IDS Bond Fund in June, reversing an outflow of almost the same amount earlier in the year. **********Ironically, one of the few sectors of the bond market where individuals have invested has been one of the worst performing.

Falls Short of Goal", "body_text": " **********A United Nations resolution calling for 30 percent of the organization's professional posts to be filled by women by 1990 appears unlikely to be observed, although the personnel director says he intends to meet the deadline. **********''I am determined to persevere in our efforts to fulfill the mandate of the General Assembly and to reach the goal of 30 percent by the end of next year,'' Kofi Annan, the Assistant Secretary General in the personnel office, told the General Assembly's Fifth Committee. ''While some progress has been achieved,'' he said, ''I consider that much more needs to be done.'' **********The deadline itself is unclear. The resolution, approved in 1985, says only that women should fill 30 percent of the posts by 1990. **********The Office of Human Resources Management reads that as meaning the end of 1990. Others say it means by the end of 1989, and some consider the deadline to be June 30, 1990, when the personnel office closes its books on yearly hiring. **********Whatever the deadline, most officials here agree that the goal will be difficult to meet. Of the 2,523 staff members in ''geographical'' posts - jobs distributed among member nations in proportion to their budget contributions -only 679, or 26.9 percent, are held by women. Most of those women hold lower-level positions. **********Despite its professed commitment to women's advancement, the United Nations has been appointing more men. Since the goal of 30 percent was set, the percentage of women has increased only incrementally, from 24.7 percent in 1986 to 25.7 percent in 1987 to 26.3 percent in 1988. **********In the year that ended on June 30, 98 men were appointed to geographical posts, compared with 36 women. Some say the problem is less a reflection of the organization than of the member countries who nominate applicants. **********''Governments nominate men,'' said Nafis Sadik, the executive director of the United Nations Population Fund. ''The U.N. can only do so much if governments don't help it.'' **********The United Nations would have to appoint an estimated 144 women to reach its 30 percent target. If last year's hiring rate for women continues, this would take seven years. 'History of Failure' **********The advancement of women ''is the best-documented history of failure in the United Nations archives,'' said a former president of the Group on Equal Rights for Women in the Secretariat who asked not to be identified. **********Women are conspicuously absent from positions of power. Of the 42 undersecretaries and assistant secretaries general in the United Nations administration, only two are women: Therese P. Sevigny, the director of the press office, and Margaret J. Anstee, director of the Center for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs in Vienna and a coordinator of anti-drug efforts. **********In a recent debate on women's issues, Australia's Ambassador to the United Nations relayed the ''dismay'' of his country, Canada and New Zealand over the organization's failure to meet its hiring target. **********''The Charter of the U.N. in its very first article asserts the equal rights of men and women,'' the Ambassador, Peter Wilenski, told a committee. ''This organization should be in the vanguard of making those equal rights a reality.'' **********The representation of women at the diplomatic level is similarly low. This year, women held only 20 percent of the positions at missions to the United Nations. **********Sixty missions had no women on their professional staffs. **********At the most symbolic level, only 5 of the 159 ambassadors to the United Nations are women. **********No matter what their job classification, women generally describe the United Nations as an uncomfortable environment. Many say they feel like a conspicuous minority in meetings, and that they must contend with sexist comments from male colleagues. **********''I have been thought to have been a secretary when I entered a room,'' said Dame Ann Hercus, the Ambassador from New Zealand, and ''it has been assumed that my views might be narrowly focused.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/14/business/the-media-business-advertising-3-decades-of-creative-inspiration.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 772, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Decades Of Creative Inspiration", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 3 Decades Of Creative Inspiration", "body_text": " **********IT'S been about a year since Jim Durfee returned to peonage, having run his own advertising shop for 10 years, and the folksy, white-haired former copywriter could not be happier. **********''I missed the mainstream,'' said the vice chairman and director of corporate creative services at Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, who had previously Durfee & Solow with Martin X. Solow. ''It's more satisfying doing an Isuzu ad than a Lotus ad. A real advertising person gets a charge out of a two-step process: making things happen creatively that make things happen in the marketplace.'' **********Mr. Durfee, 60 years old, is one of advertising's creative stalwarts, a beloved figure for several generations of copywriters who studied the peculiar form of guerilla warfare that passed for advertising at Ally & Gargano, which Mr. Durfee helped to establish in 1962. **********When Avis was overtaking Hertz with Doyle Dane Bernbach's ''We try harder'' campaign in the late 1960's, James M. Durfee locked himself in a hotel room and wrote the two pages of text that ran under the headline, ''For years, Avis has been telling you Hertz is No. 1. Now we're going to tell you why.'' Hertz's slide stopped, and what became known as the Great Rent-A-Car War between Doyle Dane and Ally entered advertising history. **********His fame as the Faulkner of body-copy has only grown with time. An all-text Durfee ad for Volvo that ran 24 years ago at the back of a Life magazine issue filled with colorful new-car promotions is even cited in a current house ad extolling the power of advertising by Anderson & Lembke, a Chiat/Day subsidiary. **********''Jim is a copywriter in the purest sense of the word,'' said Ron Berger, who was hired by him at Ally and is now a partner at Messner, Vetere, Berger, Carey, Schmetterer. ''He's a guy who sits down and labors over body copy and twists on phrases.'' **********''He's always been my hero,'' said Jerry Della Femina. ''At one point or another in his life, he had every top writer and art director working for him - Ed McCabe, Marty Puris, Ralph Ammirati, David Altschiller, Mike Tesch, Tom Messner. A lot of these people have their own agencies now, based on things they learned from Jim.'' **********In people like Mr. Durfee resides the collective memory of advertising's creative revolution of the 1960's. His longevity is the subject of a favorite quip by Mr. Della Femina that ''Jim is the answer to a great agency trivia question - who is the only man to work on the Pan Am account in the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's and 1980's?'' (Pan Am, now at Della Femina, was an Ally client and before that at J. Walter Thompson, where Mr. Durfee started his advertising career.) The stories these people tell often evoke bittersweet memories of days when creative directors would battle clients over the integrity of single words in headlines. But for the tall, bearded Mr. Durfee, the memory of that time serves more than a nostalgic purpose: his aim is to inculcate in advertising's MTV generation the pride in literary craftsmanship that defined the revolutionaries of the 1960's. **********He recalled attending a retrospective of the television commercials of Howard Zieff, one of the great advertising directors of the 1960's who is best known to the public as the director of the film ''Private Benjamin.'' **********''They were slow, 60 seconds and 90 seconds,'' Mr. Durfee said. ''But they represented persuasion. Today, it's all technique. Action. There are all these toys. Commercials today, it's hard to tell how bad they are.'' **********''Television advertising is a tribal activity; print, you're alone,'' he said. ''Weak creatives can thrive in tribal activities. But in print, weak creatives get caught. And print is like TV today - it's beautiful, more than ever, but weaker than ever.'' **********What advertising needs, Mr. Durfee insisted, is a return to the simplicity of print, which he sees, for example, in the character of Joe Isuzu (not surprisingly, a Della Femina campaign). **********But even more, he said, young creative people must learn to take selfish joy in their work. **********''At Della Femina,'' he said, ''people still run through the halls yelling, 'Look what I did!' Chiat/Day is that way. Messner is that way. But most New York agencies aren't.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/21/world/namibia-reaches-agreement-on-a-western-style-charter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 446, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Namibia Reaches Agreement On a Western-Style Charter", "print_headline": "Namibia Reaches Agreement On a Western-Style Charter", "body_text": " **********This territory's constituent assembly agreed in principle today on a democratic, Western-style constitution that should clear the way for independence within months and end 74 years of South African rule. **********The final draft is expected to be reviewed and approved in January, the assembly's Committee on Standing Rules and Orders said.

Brady has won the formal approval of the steering committees of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank for his effort to reduce the debt burdens of third world countries. The United States urged, and the communique declared, that the new and revolutionary debt strategy will move forward ''as a matter of urgency.'' That does not mean a solution is in the bag. **********Far from it. Everything depends on how, and how much of, the debts (whose global total has reached $1.3 trillion) are written down; where the money to translate shaky debt into solid debt will come from; what risks there may be to the creditor agencies, the United States and other creditor countries, and what obligations will be imposed on the debtors to set their fiscal and monetary affairs in order. In judging the worth of this new initiative, as the philosopher said, ''God is in the details,'' and the details still need to be negotiated. **********A sticking point raised by Britain and West Germany this week concerns that part of the Brady proposal that calls for guarantees on interest payments that would be due on the new bonds. **********Some skeptics are asking why the World Bank, the I.M.F. and creditor governments should bail out the commercial banks, which lent rashly and now are stuck with depreciated paper. And the critics fear that even if the immediate costs look low, the residual liabilities would impose a heavy cost on the creditors if the new loans went sour. The conferees agreed to table the guarantee proposal, referring it to the I.M.F. executive board for further study. **********But the United States stands by the guarantee proposal. Indeed, if the new bonds are no safer than the old, it is difficult to see why any bank would want them, even if it had its arms twisted by Mr. Brady or President Bush. **********Since the guarantee would cover only part of the interest on the new loans, the commitment would not be huge relative to the resources of the creditor institutions or countries. The World Bank and I.M.F. agreed to put up $25 billion together. Japan, which strongly favors the approach, said it would put up $4.5 billion. Presumably the other major creditors would put up roughly the same amount as Japan, spreading it among themselves according to some formula. **********Nevertheless, a spokesman for one bond-rating house warned that if the new debt went bad, the standing in credit markets of the World Bank, which has always been AAA, would be undermined and its ability to borrow impaired. That seems unlikely. The World Bank, United States experts insist, would continue to adhere to its very conservative rule of not lending in excess of its total capital and surplus. **********The World Bank has a surplus of $8.5 billion, and could presumably raise $7 billion or so in additional capital by subscription from its member countries, proportionate to their resources. Similarly, the I.M.F. has $35 billion in resources that it could use from the unrealized value of its gold holdings at their present market value. **********The real risks are not to the World Bank, the I.M.F. or the rich countries. The real danger is in not doing enough to stave off third world defaults and economic collapses. If too little is done to rescue failing Latin American countries or the Philippines, social and political disasters loom, like the recent riots and killings in Venezuela. Thus some American economists warn that if outstanding third world debts are reduced by, say, just 20 percent, the worst-off countries would be compelled to default, and others might follow suit lest their leaders be charged with insufficient anti-Yankee fervor. Debt reductions of 50 percent or more may be necessary to make the debtor countries viable again. **********And they will also need a fresh inflow of capital and, when possible, a return of their flight capital. But, to achieve capital inflow, the debtors will have to make a determined effort to reduce inflation. Debt reduction and cheap capital, at subsidized rates, alone cannot rescue them. **********Higher inflation in the developed countries would also jeopardize the poorer lands, for it would drive up interest rates and put fresh loans out of their reach. Hence, prudent monetary and fiscal policies are as crucial to the developed as to the developing countries. In the United States, the monetary restraints imposed by the Federal Reserve have started biting on housing, autos and other durable goods - and the economy appears to be slowing. Interest rates may have peaked or soon will. With the danger of recession emerging, the Fed, urged by the Administration to be cautious before it acts again, is holding off from another increase in the discount rate. **********Recession, not just in the United States but on a worldwide basis, would gravely worsen the problems of the third world debtors by choking off the market for their exports; that would dump them from the frying pan of too high debt payments relative to exports to the fire of too low exports relative to debt payments. **********Coordinated policies among the United States, Japan, West Germany and Europe as a whole are needed to insure continued economic growth and to prevent a trade war or an interest rate war, with the third world being devastated by the fallout. **********The agreement of the Group of Seven industrial countries this week to hold their currencies ''stable'' (which the foreign exchange market is interpreting as a trend toward a lower dollar) looks like a step in the direction of broader stability - toward a lower American trade deficit, lower interest rates and slower but possibly sustainable growth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/08/world/asian-allies-back-us-china-policy.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1989-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 552, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ASIAN ALLIES BACK U.S. CHINA POLICY", "print_headline": "ASIAN ALLIES BACK U.S. CHINA POLICY", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State James A.

He still insists that interest rates ''shot up unexpectedly'' between 1978 and 1980. What was so surprising? **********The Federal Reserve Board limits the supply of money, just as oil producers embargoed exports to the United States in the 1970's. In any such situation, price will skyrocket unless it is regulated. The deregulation of depositor interest rates, and an increase in the number of competitors chasing depositors (money markets, interstate banking, etc.), have given depositors windfall profits at everyone else's expense. **********Interest rate deregulation has created many problems and provides no benefits except for undeserving depositors. Until rates are re-regulated, using the inflation rate as a yardstick, the woes will continue (depressed housing market, merger mania, loan-shark borrowing rates, inflation pressure).

Last week, she completed the final draft of an appeal entitled ''For Our Country,'' which argues for protecting the separate identity of the German Democratic Republic from West German encroachment. The appeal has already been signed by a quarter of a million citizens. **********Christoph Hein, a 45-year-old author of novels and plays, is dedicating his waking hours to participation in the independent Investigation Commission on the Events of Oct. 7-8, the days on which hundreds of civilians were severely beaten and injured by riot squads and the secret police during mass demonstrations in East Berlin. Writer Turned Investigator **********Hermann Kant, the 53-year-old novelist who heads the East German Writers Association, has been immersed in his role as a member of the Volkskammer, or People's Parliament, and, until Sunday, as a member of the Communist Party Central Committee. **********He said that if times were calmer, he would be working on his autobiography. He interrupted work on a libretto to serve on the committee investigating police brutality. **********''The commission is more important than anything else,'' he said. ''It is a question of hygiene - not just of cleaning up people, but whole structures, not just this man or that but whole systems.'' **********Asked how the political tumult here would affect the work of writers, Mr. Hein said that a Spanish author had remarked after the Franco dictatorship ended in 1975 that one writes better under censorship. ''Under the censor you write more precisely,'' Mr. Hein said. Bracing for Western Media **********He said he doubted that East German authors were attempting at the moment to write fiction about the political and social upheaval that has swept the country since October. Noting that the authorities will soon allow West German magazines and newspapers to be sold openly, Mr. Hein commented sardonically, ''When those publications are sold here, people won't read books anymore.'' **********As for his own writing, Mr. Hein said, ''I only work on themes that are 10 years old, or older.'' His latest novel, for example, ''The Tango Player,'' presents an East German perspective of the Prague Spring of 1968, when a reform movement in Czechoslovakia was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion. **********Both Mr. Hein and Mr. Kant said in interviews that the role of writers in East German society was quite different from that played, for instance, in the United States. **********''Under Erich Honecker, the writers were the only independent people,'' Mr. Kant said, referring to the Communist Party chief who was unseated on Oct. 18 after 18 years in power. **********''A person who talked about freedom was suspect under Honecker because freedom was identical for them with the so-called free world, that is, the West,'' he said. ''Only writers addressed this issue. Writers, through their publishing, also had a Western connection, and this caused corresponding mistrust.'' An Ode to Joy **********Musicians and painters have recently joined in staging artistic events with a political purpose, such as a combined concert and exhibition at the newly restored Berlin Playhouse on Tuesday evening. The performance commemorated East Germany's ''victims of Stalinism.'' **********With a crowd of several thousand spilling from the auditorium to the foyer out into Academy Square, where loudspeakers were mounted, the Berlin Radio Symphony and the Berlin Radio Chorus performed Schiller's ''Ode to Joy'' and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. **********One of those attending was Gustav Just, the chief editor of the weekly Sonntag, who was imprisoned by the Communist regime in the 1950's. Organizers also invited Walter Janka, a highly decorated officer of the Karl Marx Division on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. Mr. Janka, who became a publisher here in 1951, served three years in a Communist prison as an anti-Stalinist. He was unable to attend the performance. An End to 'Antis' **********The musicians and artists who planned the concert-exhibition have set up a fund for a monument to victims of Stalinism. During recent decades of Communist leadership, a number of monuments have been erected to victims of fascism in this country. **********Wolfgang Kohlhase, a 58-year-old screenwriter, predicted that the political changes eventually will mean ''there will be no more antis.'' **********''For years,'' he said, ''we had a method of esthetics using metaphors of indirection for dealing with our social conditions. **********''Our literature freed itself from this practice sooner than films,'' he said. ''With films it was tougher because you needed contracts before you could even start shooting. **********''Now,'' Mr. Kohlhase said, ''we will see who has something to see in films. We will see more joys, and more cares. To grasp the Socialist development as a tragedy - that's one point to begin at.'' He said he planned to write a new screenplay next year. **********''In our time,'' he observed, ''the free flow of information is a one-way street marked in the English language.

''Everything has changed in the last week. Whole new frontiers have opened up.'' **********Not everyone thought it would mean German reunification. Many close watchers of the developments in East Germany seemed increasingly to believe that while the German question had been thrust to the forefront, a single Germany remained a distant prospect. Not Atop Protesters' Agenda **********For one thing, it had not been a dominant demand among the millions whose demonstrations over the last month had forced the Communist rulers to make concessions. Most slogans and placards demanded internal change, and many had proudly declared ''We're Staying Here'' and ''We Are the People.'' **********For another, the process of disentangling the two Germanys from a web of separate alliances and economic systems, created over the last 40 years, was staggering. **********Hundreds of thousands of American and Soviet soldiers with the largest concentrations of arms in the world still stood facing each other from the soil of the two German states, and each Germany was a major economic power on its side. **********Finally, the rapidity with which change had come to East Germany had not allowed for preparation in the West - either in West Germany or among its allies. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had been caught on a state visit to Poland at the moment the Berlin wall was breached. And the intensity of the weekend celebrations that swept the nation thrust thoughts of the future aside for the moment. No Longer 'Unthinkable' **********But no one could be certain any more. As the East German daily Neue Zeit noted in a plaintive editorial: ''It is really a crazy situation. Every day something happens that would have been unthinkable even a few weeks ago. Suddenly everything seems possible, but still it is not enough. Everything always comes too late.'' **********For the moment, there was a lull in the action. But it was like waiting for the next installment of a soap opera: Will the East Germans now launch into a headlong rush toward reunification, or are they only seeking a kindlier, gentler socialism, as the opposition groups maintain? **********Will West Germany maintain its allegiance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and West European integration? Will it fulfill its promises to Poland and Hungary? Or will it now focus all its wealth and might on reviving its Eastern kinfolk? **********''There is anxiety abroad in Europe,'' the West Berlin daily Tagesspiegel wrote in an editorial today. ''The real reason for the West European summit next weekend is anxiety about the future path of the Federal Republic - the fear that the Federal Republic could concentrate too much on aid and support for the reform process in Eastern Europe, that it will neglect its engagement to Europe and European union.'' Process Already on Track?  There was anxiety, too, that the current momentum could push the two Germanys inexorably together, as the direct contacts now possible made East Germans increasingly frustrated with their lesser lot. **********There were fears, too, that in the absence of a broader arrangement worked out with their allies, the Germans would be tempted to go it alone, shaping a German solution that might alienate allies and conceivably even destabilize the Continent. **********And within the Western alliance, there was concern that Americans might wonder why 300,000 of ''our boys'' were sitting in West Germany while Germans were crisscrossing the trenches with impunity. **********In West Germany, there were certain to be new questions about the lingering remnants of military occupation. With German police from East and West working shoulder to shoulder at the Wall, and the mayors of East and West Berlin chatting cheerily at Potsdamer Platz, how long could Allied troops continue to pretend they were maintain the security of Berlin? A Threat That Lacks Credibility **********The notion of American G.I.'s in camouflage fatigues training guns across the Fulda Gap while East Germans were popping over to shop in the West nearby seemed quaintly out of date now. And officials in Bonn openly declared that any idea of deploying new short-range missiles, over which the Germans argued so bitterly with their NATO allies last spring, was simply unthinkable. **********But senior officials insisted that Bonn would not risk the dangers of going it alone. **********''We're going to play this by the book,'' one of them said. ''We will play this in the alliance framework, but the alliance will have to come up with some credible answers when people ask, 'Why are you still there after 1989?' '' **********The first glimmers of the policy taking shape in Bonn indicated a consensus that the East Germans should be left alone to decide the future of their state. Under the West German Constitution, the goal of unity is to be achieved through self-determination, and if the East Germans ''decide to form a socialist or nonsocialist state of their own, we have got to respect that,'' the official in Bonn said. **********''If, however, they decided of their own free will that they want closer association, in whatever shape or form, in that case we are not only willing but constitutionally committed to going in that direction,'' he said. Western Integration **********At the same time, the official said Bonn would insure that relations with East Germany did not alter its commitment to Western European integration. **********''We have to do both,'' he declared. ''You're not going to get public support in this country for voodoo policies that say we are going to reunite with the G.D.R. and throw over European integration. The only thing that makes sense is to continue where we are in European integration policy and to help the G.D.R.'' **********That help, as outlined by the Government in Bonn, was conditional on East Germany's adopting a market economy, and opposition politicians charged that this amounted to blackmail on East Berlin, requiring that it abandon its separate system and accept an economic absorption by West Germany. **********The Communist Party in East Germany, of course, remained dead-set against reunification, and there was little chance of it as long as Egon Krenz remained in power. What Opposition Wants **********The New Forum and other opposition movements also declared themselves opposed to union. The opposition, composed largely of reformist socialists, insisted that its goal was to create a new form of democratic socialism in East Germany. **********But the quiet revolution repeatedly demonstrated that these groups had little control over the mass demonstrations. The power had come from the masses who went spontaneously into the streets, and there the message remained tantalizingly ambivalent. **********Only a handful of banners mentioned unity, and none named West Germany, heartening those who hoped to find in the demonstrations a new, separate East German national identity. But at the same time those who fled through the summer, abandoning all they owned, demonstrated no allegiance whatever to their separate state. They were Germans fleeing to Germany. **********The absence of a clamor for reunification seemed to disappoint some West Germans, who had become accustomed to a paternalistic view of East Germany as a land of poor cousins yearning to become Westerners. The Great Question **********As Fritz Ullrich Fack wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine: ''At the end of the first and stormy part of the great German reunification festival, there is the inconvenient discovery that many compatriots over there are obviously not very much interested in reunification.'' **********But there were those who suspected that the process set afoot on Nov. 9 could only lead to reunification, sooner or later. **********''Something fundamental has changed,'' said Pierre Hassner, the research director of the National Political Science Foundation in Paris. ''It seems they can no longer stop free elections, and this will oust the Communist Party. German industry seems absolutely ready to plunge into East Germany. **********''Pretty soon, the East Germans will say enough to being second-class citizens, their 'new form of socialism' will go down the drain, and since they're exposed to West German society, the second phase will be pressure for reunification.'' **********PLEASE THIN SUBHEDS"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/19/world/lawyer-says-dying-marcos-is-unfit-for-trial.html": {"writer_name": "William Glaberson", "pub_date": "1989-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 569, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lawyer Says 'Dying' Marcos Is Unfit for Trial", "print_headline": "Lawyer Says 'Dying' Marcos Is Unfit for Trial", "body_text": " **********A lawyer for Ferdinand E.

Iron ore was fed through one end of the sprawling complex, and Fords rolled out the other. **********Now Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. are creating an equivalent in the entertainment industry. At one end will be a rich lode, with singers like Madonna; the journalists at magazines like Time, People and Sports Illustrated; the producers of films like ''The Accidental Tourist'' and television shows like ''Dallas,'' and the authors at publishing houses like Little, Brown. **********At the other end - ready to distribute to the nation's living rooms the music, words and images that emerge - will be a powerful entertainment engine that will include the nation's biggest pay television channel, Home Box Office; the nation's second-largest cable television operation, and a publishing force that could spread more widely the good word about Time Warner's personalities. **********Industry experts were still trying to sort out the impact of the merger, which was announced Saturday and, if approved, will create the world's largest media and entertainment conglomerate, to be called Time Warner Inc. But it is clear that a behemoth this large and wide raises troubling questions for competitors that will not have so broad a reach. Indeed, a merger would probably accelerate the drive by many entertainment companies to expand and combine, the analysts said. **********The three major television networks are prohibited by the Government from producing more than a limited portion of their programming, and they are not permitted to sell reruns of programs like ''The Cosby Show'' in syndication. Those areas are the more profitable end of the business. **********The networks' problems are worsened by the fact that they cannot also own cable systems, and are therefore barred from participating in the fastest-growing area of the entertainment business. **********In light of the fact that Time and Warner would be able to produce programming and distribute it not only in movie theaters, in which they now have an interest, but also on home video and more than ever on cable television, several industry experts said it seems likely that the rules that keep the networks from syndicating programming will be revised. **********''If they don't get on the 7 A.M. shuttle on Monday to Washington and fight to have those laws changed, they ought to all be sued,'' said one movie industry executive who asked not to be named. **********Dennis Leibowitz, an entertainment analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said, ''In the short term it might be bad for the networks, but long term it gives them more ammunition to have the financial-interest and syndication rules revoked.'' **********Should that happen, the networks might merge with movie studios. **********A Time-Warner merger would also undoubtedly trouble independent cable programming companies like the Financial News Network and USA Network. Those companies must negotiate fees with cable operators. The more powerful the cable operators, the more leverage they have in such negotiations. Industry experts foresee more mergers among smaller cable operators. **********One movie industry executive raised concern about the leverage Warner would gain once it not only produces its own programming but controls distribution outlets. **********Despite the concerns, company officials and Wall Street analysts said they were confident that there would be no antitrust problems in the Time-Warner deal. They said the largest area of concentration created by the merger would be in cable television systems, in which Time's American Television and Communications Corporation is already the nation's second-largest operator. They said that even with the addition of Warner's systems, the combined company would still be smaller than Tele-Communications Inc., the industry leader. Approvals Needed **********The proposed merger is subject to the approval of regulatory agencies, and will be subjected to antitrust scrutiny. **********Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's chief spokesman, David Runkel, said yesterday that he did not think the Justice Department's antitrust officials had begun to review the merger. **********The Time-Warner combination reflects an acknowledgment that as media companies prepare for the future, entertainment has come to overshadow news, and an integrated empire like the one announced this weekend is seen as the most potent way to become a global giant in the 1990's. That means a further eclipsing of Time magazine, once Time Inc.'s most prominent business. 'Re-examine Your Wardrobe' **********Several experts were unsure that an expansion like this one is necessarily beneficial, but as one movie executive put it yesterday, ''When everybody around you is wearing short pants, you begin to re-examine your wardrobe.'' **********Nonetheless, the advantages of a company with interests at all levels of the business are significant. David Londoner, a managing director at Wertheim Schroder & Company, said the economics of making programs is such that companies want control over their end markets. ''They want to own theaters, or pay television -all the outlets for their product. Producing is so risky and the economics so difficult that they want to be sure that they have control over the outlets.'' **********The two companies are complementary in many ways. Time's cable operation, American Television and Communications, and Warner Cable are considered sophisticated marketers. Unlike Tele-Communications, Warner has historically invested in sophisticated cable operations like pay-per-view programming, the business of delivering individual events like boxing matches to homes for a fixed fee. Time, for its part, is expert at selling media, particularly its magazines, to people in their homes. Those skills together are likely to make them better marketers of cable programming to their 5.5 million subscribers. **********In addition, Geoffrey Holmes, a senior vice president at Warner Communications, said yesterday that Warner Brothers could begin producing more original programming for Home Box Office, knowing also that Warner could distribute it overseas. Home Box Office and Cinemax, Time's two pay-television services, reach a total of 23 million homes. **********As cable becomes a more international business, HBO could play a role abroad too. A World Market **********The incentives of reaching a world market could also encourage Time Warner to create new cable channels. To the extent that those companies can do more to stimulate audiences in cable, which competes with the television networks, the merger could weaken the hold of the networks. **********In addition Time has a mail-order business that distributes the Book-of-the-Month Club and the Time-Life series of books. Now Warner could distribute more records and home videos through that outlet. **********But there is no agreement on the merger's impact on other entertainment companies. After the merger, Time Warner would become an umbrella company that represents some of the best-known talent in the country. Warner Brothers has longstanding relationships with Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Barbra Streisand and Chevy Chase; singers like Anita Baker, Debbie Gibson and Tracy Chapman, and writers like Sidney Sheldon. 'Enormous Leverage' **********Mr. Leibowitz argued that artists might prefer to work at Warner than at another studio because of the knowledge that their works would have sophisticated worldwide distribution in many media. ''It gives them enormous leverage in attracting talent,'' he said. **********What is more, the artists' names could be further promoted in the company's magazines and books. **********Moreover, other entertainment companies might not be as sure that they could sell their programming to a Time Warner service like HBO. **********The evidence seems fairly strong that mergers will continue. The Walt Disney Company has forged into the distribution business with the Disney Channel and two television stations. MCA Inc. has bought a television station and owns an interest in USA Network. Twentieth Century-Fox is part of the News Corporation, owned by Rupert Murdoch, and owns the Fox Broadcasting Company, which is carried by Fox's independent television stations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/25/world/pronouncing-the-names.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pronouncing the Names", "print_headline": "Pronouncing the Names", "body_text": " **********Col.

Sullivan, today announced a program of expanded inspections and administrative reforms. **********Dr. Sullivan also said he would ask Congress for authority to impose much tougher penalties on drug companies that engage in fraudulent practices. **********''I emphasize that we have found no evidence that the safety or effectiveness of generic drugs has been compromised,'' Dr. Sullivan said in a statement issued late this afternoon. But, he added, the new plan is necessary to ''deal decisively with corrupt and fraudulent practices such as those that have recently come to public attention.'' **********Generic drugs are copies of higher-priced brand-name drugs on which the patents have expired. **********The plan comes after three former employees of the F.D.A.'s generic drug division pleaded guilty to accepting thousands of dollars in illegal payments from generic drug manufacturers in exchange for speedier treatment of their drug applications. The speed of F.D.A. approval is important to the makers of generic drugs, because the first companies to market a low-cost alternative to a brand-name drug usually obtain large shares of the market. **********In recent months, two generic manufacturers have also admitted supplying the F.D.A. with false information. One company, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens, in Queens, admitted submitting the original brand-name version of a popular blood pressure drug, rather than its own chemical copy, for lab testing. **********The plan also calls for putting more money and personnel into the field offices and laboratories that monitor the activities of drug makers. The agency said it did not have the money but would try to raise it by imposing new, unspecified fees on drug companies. In addition, Dr. Sullivan said the number of people assigned to review new applications for generic drugs would be significantly increased. **********In addition, Dr. Sullivan and Frank E. Young, commissioner of the F.D.A., announced that the agency was developing new procedures to make sure that drug applications submitted by manufacturers would be treated without favoritism. The agency will also establish an ombudsman for industry to receive complaints from companies that believe they have been unfairly treated. Dr. Sullivan did not say how much the new efforts would cost, but Congressional officials said the agency was discussing a figure of $18 million. **********The disclosures of abuses in the generic approval process embarrassed the F.D.A., which until recently has relied on what it calls an honor system that drug companies will submit legitimate clinical data. The move was cautiously greeted by members of Congress who have been leading investigations. Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the actions were ''substantive but overdue.'' He added that the inquiries into the possibility of more wrongdoing should continue. **********The F.D.A. had previously announced that it was analyzing samples of the 30 top-selling prescription generic drugs, to make sure they were in fact meeting all Federal standards. In addition, the agency is completing special inspections of 11 manufacturers. The new plan would expand those activities. Inspectors are analyzing 800 drug samples that generic-drug companies originally submitted for laboratory testing to demonstrate the chemical equivalance of their products compared with the brand-name drugs they were supposed to imitate. **********On the legislative front, health officials are seeking authority to impose heavier penalties on companies that engage in wrongdoing. **********F.D.A. officials say they do not currently have the authority to stop companies that bribe Federal officials from marketing their products unless the Government can find specific irregularities in those products. But Mr. Sullivan stopped short of proposing a specific legislative remedy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/business/the-executive-computer-networking-without-the-wires.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Networking Without the Wires", "print_headline": "THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; Networking Without the Wires", "body_text": " **********PERHAPS the worst thing about computer networking is the actual physical wiring. Whether the computers are connected with coaxial cables, twisted pair cables, fiber-optic cables or jumper cables, the cabling itself is usually a logistical, physical and financial nightmare. Adding a computer to the network, or even just moving someone's desk, is a major ordeal. **********Imagine, then, the wonder of seeing an office full of computers sharing data and resources without any obtrusive wiring. The Photonics Corporation of Campbell, Calif., (408-370-3033) demonstrated such a system at the Macworld Exposition in Boston earlier this month. Although the privately held company did not have a formal exhibition at the Macworld trade show, which attracted an estimated 30,000 Apple Macintosh users, the Photonics Photolink system was the most impressive technical achievement of any of the hundreds of companies demonstrating products. And Photonics was the only company showing its product on the ceiling. **********The Photonics system uses infrared light, basically the same technology used to send remote control signals to a television set. Infrared light has been used in computers before without much success (I.B.M.'s PCjr used it to link the keyboard and the computer). The communicating devices - whether two computers or a computer and its remote keyboard - had to be in direct line of sight. The drawbacks to that are obvious: only two devices could be connected, and anyone walking in front of the beam could disrupt the link. That made it unacceptable for office environments. **********The Photonics system appears to eliminate those hindrances, at least for offices with large, open rooms. An executive at Apple Computer Inc., which is a financial backer of Photonics, said the system was being used within Apple and that enthusiasm was high. The system works like this: **********As many as four Macintosh computers can share a Photonics transceiver, a $995 device that resembles a short periscope or one of the closed-circuit television scanners one often sees near office entryways. The Photolink transceiver can be mounted on a desk or atop the common wall partitions that many offices use to divide clusters of desks. **********The only wiring the system needs is a connection between the transceiver and a power outlet, and cables between the transceiver and one to four Macintosh computers (if four Macs are connected, the cost is less than $250 a machine). If there are RS232 hookups, one of the common cable attachments for personal computers, a $995 ''concentrator'' is also required. **********The system also requires a target site visible from each transceiver. This might be a spot on the ceiling in the center of the room, or on a wall. The recommended target size is roughly 7 feet across, and the developers say such obstacles as exposed pipes or light fixtures are not a hindrance. The transceiver is aimed at the target area as one would aim a flashlight beam, and data are exchanged where the beams intersect. **********Each transceiver, as the name suggests, can transmit and receive computer information by converting it to and from infrared pulses. The infrared signals are silent and have not been implicated as health hazards. A microprocessor in each transceiver converts the signals and regulates traffic. THERE is also an advanced error correction system that filters out extranous light pollution, like that from fluorescent lights, and insures that a data transfer is not interrupted by someone or something momentarily passing through the signal. **********In a demonstration, Don Casey, an Apple Computer Inc. vice president for networking products, tried to disrupt a file transfer by walking back and forth in front of a transceiver. The files were transferred without error, including one called ''September Surprise,'' which many people in the audience assumed referred to the expected announcement of a portable Macintosh. (Mr. Casey declined to open the file.) Walking in front of a transceiver is one thing; shutting the door to a private office is another. In most companies executives have private offices away from the common mouse-pushers. Such an arrangement provides seclusion but also eliminates an unobstructed sightline to the most probable Photolink target sites. **********The easy solution is to mount a Photolink outside the office door, connected to the executive's Macintosh by a cable. But if the executive's Macintosh is already wired into an AppleTalk network, it can still communicate with other Macs, laser printers, file servers, facsimile modems or other peripherals on the Photolink net, as long as at least one machine acts as a bridge between the wired and nonwired systems. The AppleTalk net views a device connected to Photolink as indistinguishable from one that is hard-wired. **********This plays into the beauty of Macintosh networking. It takes an advanced degree in the occult sciences to string two or more I.B.M. PC's or compatible computers together. On the other hand, every Macintosh ever shipped has had AppleTalk networking connections built in, so even casual users can set up simple networks of Macs in minutes, using standard cables. **********In reality, of course, most offices have Macs and PC's, which have to co-exist, and minicomputers and mainframes, which communicate with one another using arcane networking protocols, plug-in network cards and a bit of voodoo. Photonics plans to expand its system to support two of the most popular local area networks, I.B.M.'s Token Ring network and Ethernet. Richard C. Allen, Photonics's president and inventor of the Photolink technology, said he hoped to provide the Token Ring technology next year and Ethernet the year after. **********For the time being, however, the Photonics system takes advantage of the AppleTalk simplicity. In his demonstration, Mr. Casey of Apple took a Macintosh out of a carrying case, plugged it in, attached the short Photolink cable and aimed the transceiver at the target point on some drapes at the back of a stage. A green indicator light signaled that the ''connection'' to the existing AppleTalk network had been made. If someone accidentally knocked the transceiver out of alignment, the light would have changed to red. **********Red light, green light - as a tool for network troubleshooting, that sure beats crawling around behind walls or in floor troughs sorting through what in some buildings can amount to literally millions of feet of wiring."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/07/world/amid-frenzy-iranians-bury-the-ayatollah.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1989-06-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 990, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Amid Frenzy, Iranians Bury The Ayatollah", "print_headline": "Amid Frenzy, Iranians Bury The Ayatollah", "body_text": " **********Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolutionary cleric who dominated Iran for a decade, was buried today after hours of frenzied mourning that at one point saw his body torn from its coffin and carried off by a hysterical crowd. **********So huge and so emotional were the crowds, estimated at three million, that there was doubt whether the authorities would be able to push through them to bury the Shiite Muslim patriarch. At one point the state television announced that the burial of the Ayatollah, who died on Saturday, would be postponed until Wednesday. **********Vast rivers of humanity clad almost entirely in black, the women wrapped in chadors, clogged the city's streets and the highways throughout the day, walking to Behesht-e-Zahara cemetery on the southern outskirts. There, the Ayatollah was buried near the graves of more than a million ''martyrs,'' as the Shiites say, of the revolution and the eight-year war with Iraq. Day of Pandemonium **********Over and over, all day long, the mourners beat themselves on the head and chest in the Shiite ritual of mourning and martyrdom. **********The funeral mirrored, as grief mirrors triumph, Ayatollah Khomeini's return from exile after toppling Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in February 1979. On that day there was a vast processional to the ''martyrs' cemetery'' to hear the Ayatollah's exalted speech calling on the nation to ''cut off the hands'' of its enemies. **********Once again, it was a day of pandemonium for the Ayatollah: masses of people, almost numbing in their sheer size; choking dust, confusion and macabre sights as the Ayatollah's body was borne from the refrigerated box where it had been displayed, his black turban resting on his chest. Mourners Are Overcome **********Fire hoses played over the crowds to cool them. In chaotic scenes, overcome mourners, possibly dead themselves, were pushed into ambulances. **********Ritual chants of ''Death to America,'' set off by every appearance of a television camera, were oddly mixed with greetings of warmth for the scores of American journalists who rushed here to record the death of the man who infuriated Americans during the 444-day seizure of the United States Embassy hostages from 1979 to 1981. **********Above all, it was a day of anguish for Ayatollah Khomeini's people, the poor of the slums of south Teheran and the countryside he called ''the deprived.'' **********''We have lost our father!'' the mourners chanted, and, later, ''This nation, what will it do without you?'' **********As the Ayatollah's body, transferred to an army helicopter when the refrigerated truck carrying it was unable to get through the crowds, first arrived at the burial site at about 11 this morning, a shrieking crowd fell on the coffin. **********The crowd, much of it made up of Revolutionary Guards detailed to maintain order, pulled the coffin from the helicopter and began parading it around the makeshift compound surrounding the gravesite. **********As the excitement grew, the body of the Ayatollah, wrapped in a white burial shroud, fell out of the flimsy wooden coffin, and in a mad scene people in the crowd reached to touch the shroud. The soldiers pushed and wrestled, finally firing warning shots, to get the body back. Ayatollah Khomeini's son, Ahmed, was knocked from his feet. **********But even as the soldiers pushed the body back into the helicopter, the crowd swarmed over the craft, dragging it back down as it tried to take off.

Brindisi has been trying to make corporate executives think like corporate raiders. Mr. Brindisi, a senior partner with a newly formed firm called Strategic Compensation Associates, a joint venture between Korn/Ferry International and the Management Compensation Group, argues that a ''raider mentality'' - a strong concern about the company's stock price -can help executives make their businesses more productive and profitable. **********A former senior partner with Booz Allen, Mr. Brindisi spoke recently about why he thinks companies should develop ways to reward executives through more generous use of stock options.  Q. You have been promoting the concept of paying executives to think like corporate raiders. How should this be done?  A. It can be accomplished in two ways: through restricted stock, meaning that you give executives of companies shares subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. Also, you can set that in terms of stock price or in terms of cash-flow levels or return on equity. The second way is to give them large stock-option grants. The management group in a leveraged buyout group might have 10 to 15 percent of the stock. But in most public companies, the management might have 1 percent. That's where some of the problem lies.  Q. This idea goes against most companies' long-term practices. Are many companies beginning to develop such programs?  A. Yes, but still too few. Of the Fortune 500 companies, maybe 10 percent are paying their top executives to think like raiders. Also, I find that companies that are in turnaround situations are doing this more and more. One problem with stock options is that typically they have gone to people in the middle management level. The strategy is to concentrate the stock ownership and opportunity in the hands of the top management of the company. They can really drive the stock price.  Q. When you talk to groups and boards, there must be some resistance to this idea, some feeling that executives are paid quite handsomely now and that there is little wrong with the way they are compensated. How do you respond?  A. Well, there must be something wrong if raiders can find targets every day of the week and there are huge takeover funds being created. If the stock price is high, if it's at a multiple of four times book value, it becomes attractive. If you try to raid the company under those circumstances, you don't make your money. Companies improving their performance under this method are the least vulnerable to raids.  Q. Is this strategy one that is likely to be applied to American industry across the board or are there certain industries less likely to employ these methods?  A. Certainly, Rust Belt companies are less likely to consider this type of executive compensation because they have become more and more pure play companies, meaning they concentrate only on, say, steel, machine tools or whatever. As a result, they have already gone through a process of restructuring and they have been through the process of rationalizing their operations.  Q. Given the benefits you cite, why don't more companies change their compensation practices?  A. Because they are so vastly different from the typical executive compensation practices. And since they are so different, boards of directors tend to be uncomfortable about them. In terms of executive compensation, the numbers might run into several millions of dollars for an executive, for example. If a company drives its stock price two to three times higher, the absolute numbers in executive compensation make directors uncomfortable. Their discomfort comes in part because they are worried about criticism from the press and from public interest groups, who find the level of compensation to be extremely high. But they tend to look at the absolute level of compensation, as opposed to looking at the level of compensation as a percentage of the shareholder value that has been created.  Q. If indeed the resistance typically comes from boards of companies, what causes some to accept the idea?  A. Those boards who understand the marketplace imperatives understand that this is a necessary strategy. Companies are vulnerable to raids and many are going out of existence. Those who understand this react very favorably to this. And they feel that the rewards to the executives are a reasonable percentage of the value being created.  Q. What kind of compensation are we talking about generally?  A. Usually 3 to 5 percent of the company's stock is to be shared by senior management. Now, that strikes people as high. You could wind up with a chief executive officer making $15 to $20 million over three years or so. But it's a relatively small percentage compared with the value he has created."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/08/business/prospects-the-superconductor-race.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kurtzman", "pub_date": "1989-01-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 643, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prospects; The Superconductor Race", "print_headline": "Prospects; The Superconductor Race", "body_text": " **********Last week a Presidential panel released a report calling for a more vigorous national effort to develop superconducting materials. The report said the United States was falling behind Japan in commercializing this new technology. It recommended increased Government funding for research and establishing research consortia comprised of Government laboratories, industry and university researchers. Four experts explain the significance of this report.  Robert Dynes  Director of the chemical physics research laboratory, A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories. **********Setting up research consortia is an excellent idea. It takes aim right at the problem - how to get industry, Government and academia together. Each of these groups has a different agenda, and to put together regional consortia so that the participants have to agree on a distribution of labor and resources will be very fruitful. **********The real issue is why did the Japanese take off so fast in their superconductivity work, especially when we have such a large stable of good scientists. The reason is that Japanese companies are looking long term. They work on projects with 5- to 10-year time horizons. We do that here at Bell Labs, and so does I.B.M., but we are the only two laboratories, while the Japanese have at least 10.  David Grumpert  Editor, Cambridge Superconductivity Report. **********Japan is excelling in the basic research as well as the applied research. The Japanese are testing a superconducting train -which I have ridden on - that travels at 300 miles per hour. One area of concern is that Japan is testing a superconducting ship named after the World War II battleship Yamamoto. This ship is propelled by superconductivity alone. If this form of propulsion is used in a submarine, it will be absolutely silent. And the Japanese are also talking about rockets that are propelled by superconductivity. This concerns the Defense Science Board because we may be dependent upon Japan for this technology.  Marvin L. Cohen  Professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley and principal scientist, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. **********I don't think that these reports have a great deal of influence on scientists. Scientists go in their own directions. But they do have an influence on the people who hold the purse. **********In the area of basic research, we are still trying to explain what is going on in high-temperature superconductivity so you would think that an increase in funding for basic research would be in order. But the money hasn't increased; it's gone down. **********We have just opened a new field of science and must now explore it. It doesn't mean there shouldn't be research money on the applications side, but Government support of universities ought to be emphasized.  John A. Alic  Senior Fellow, John F. Kennedy School of Government and project director, ''Commercializing High Temperature Superconductivity.'' **********The proposals made by the panel can make a difference. They call for increasing Government spending by $35 million. In 1988 spending was $95 million and in 1989 it will be $135 million plus the increase. This could make a real difference. But superconductivity is still a relatively small-scale effort, worldwide, and there is only so much you can do in a field so young. **********Japanese business outspent American business on research by 50 percent. But there is still no hard evidence that the Japanese have pulled ahead. In the research conducted so far the Japanese get high marks for their science. But in the end it will turn into a commercial race and that's where Japan may pull ahead."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/03/business/new-disney-attraction.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Disney Attraction", "print_headline": "New Disney Attraction", "body_text": " **********A new health and fitness pavilion opened this week at Disney World's Epcot Center, featuring a ''thrill ride'' through the human body and gadgets that tell visitors how healthy they are.

Gorbachev, including a bitterness among Kremlin conservatives over the collapse of Soviet power. But they say the prevailing view here is that the partial liberation of Eastern Europe is a boon for the Soviet leader. **********According to that view, the opening of the Berlin wall and the promise of greater democracy in East Germany have increased the West's stake in Mr. Gorbachev's political survival. Those developments are also seen as diminishing the danger of instability or anti-Soviet sentiment in Eastern Europe and as bringing new credibility to the Soviet leader's program at home. **********''It is not accidental that Eastern Europe will be one of the major topics at the coming summit,'' said Oleg G. Peresypkin, rector of the Diplomatic Academy of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. ''I think the interests of East and West have come into balance in Eastern Europe.'' **********Vladimir N. Chernega, vice rector of the academy and a specialist on Eastern Europe, said that a sense of relief was widespread among Soviet specialists, who felt that the recently ousted East German leader, Erich Honecker, had let frustrations build to a dangerous level.

''We did not know how it would go in detail. We did not know it would begin with East Germans emigrating through Hungary and Czechoslovakia. **********''But we knew what the predominant mood was,'' he said, ''and we knew it would lead to an explosion.'' **********Some Soviet analysts say the splintering of the Soviet bloc, which strikes many in the West as a stunning setback, is in fact a victory for Moscow, since it clears the way for the end of the cold war and allows the Soviet Union to focus money and attention on a more critical obsession: economic survival. **********The analysts contend that it is better to have stable and relatively prosperous neighbors than restive and impoverished satellites, even if that means admitting the failure of the Communist system. Gorbachev's Impetus Is Unclear **********Although Soviet specialists interviewed today had no first-hand knowledge of Mr. Gorbachev's role in recent East German events, they agreed that the opening of borders and replacement of the Communist Party leadership were certainly done with Moscow's strong endorsement. **********Shortly after taking power on Oct. 18, Egon Krenz, the new East German party leader, visited Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow. **********Whether Mr. Gorbachev planned the developments that followed, or is simply amazingly adept at making victory out of retreat, his supporters say he now has much of the world working with him rather than against him. **********One result of the rapid chain of events - the Solidarity victory in Poland, the disintegration of Hungary's Communist Party, and now East Germany's enlistment in the perestroika campaign - is that the sense of confrontation in Europe has given way to a shared feeling that everyone should move carefully. **********In the United States, the Bush Administration now seems to be taking its signals from Mr. Gorbachev. In West Germany, the Government is coordinating its diplomatic moves with East Berlin, and Soviet analysts sense that talk about reunification with East Germany has been muted. Fear of Change in Leadership **********In Poland and Hungary, the ascendant, westward-leaning political leaders are careful to stress their continued allegiance to the Warsaw Pact. No one wants to jeopardize Mr. Gorbachev's position. **********''Everything depends on the situation in Moscow,'' said Andranik Migranyan, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of World Socialist Systems, one of the most influential Government think tanks. ''If the situation in Moscow changes, if the conservatives take power, everything in the world could change.'' **********''These events have brought a coincidence of Soviet and Western interests,'' Mr. Migranyan added. ''It seems to me that this could be the guarantee of a normal, stable development of Eastern Europe.'' **********The dramatic display of Soviet willingness to let its Communist neighbors go their own way, Soviet analysts say, increases the willingness of Western governments and businesses to help shore up Eastern Europe's shaky economies. **********That relieves Moscow of a burden, and could indirectly help the Soviet economy by creating a kind of economic bridge between the Soviet Union and the West. **********Soviet specialists say that the changes in Eastern Europe also make it harder to reverse the changes under way here. Perestroika Profits **********''Psychologically, the events in East Germany are very, very useful for perestroika here in the Soviet Union,'' said Mr. Migranyan. ''The conservatives have pointed to East Germany as a model of a stable regime sticking to the old Socialist model, proof that reform was not necessary. This is an explosion of the myth.'' **********While many in the West assume that the opening of the Berlin wall will bleed East Germany of its best people and lead to German reunification, Soviet analysts predict that the situation will stabilize and that East Germany will endure, at least for the near future. **********Many East Germans will leave, the Soviets say, but many others, knowing they can go any time, will stay to see what the new regime in East Germany can offer. **********Mr. Migranyan and others contend that if the new East German leadership offers real liberty and political pluralism, the hemorrhage of East Germans will slow, and be offset by West German financial and technical aid.''This will not be only a one-way brain drain,'' he said. **********But like much of what Mr. Gorbachev has undertaken, the relaxation of Moscow's thrall over Eastern Europe is a gamble. Economic Dangers Ahead **********One danger, some Soviet analysts say, is that one of the semi-liberated satellites, such as Poland or Hungary, might suffer a major economic collapse leading to the rise of an anti-Soviet right wing. **********''The most dangerous period for Poland is still ahead,'' Mr. Migranyan said. ''If the Solidarity Government will fail to cope with the economic crisis, there could be a sharp division, clashes, and I would not exclude an authoritarian dictatorship.'' **********This would cause anxiety in Moscow, and could create pressure for the Kremlin to use its political, economic or even military leverage. **********On the other hand, every liberating move by the Kremlin raises Mr. Gorbachev's prestige in Poland and Hungary, and helps erase the grievances that built up under previous Soviet regimes. **********Another risk is that Poland or Hungary might bolt from the Warsaw Pact. Soviet and Western officials agree that this is unlikely, especially since Moscow appears ready to go along with internal changes in the alliance to protect the members from each other. Soviet Old-Timers Frightened **********Yet another risk is that the dissolution of the Soviet bloc might alarm conservatives in the Communist Party, the army or K.G.B. to the point where they decide that Mr. Gorbachev has to go. Soviet analysts say that conservatives are clearly uneasy, but the rumbles have not become ominous. **********''The career diplomats, especially the older generation, are frightened,'' said Mr. Migranyna, who meets regularly with diplomats and party officials. **********He said that mid-level Foreign Ministry officials have even asked research institutes to draw up guidelines so they can tell when one of the satellites has strayed beyond the boundaries of Socialism, and should be brought to heel, a task the researchers declined. **********''I think the top leadership - the ministers, deputy ministers and top party officials - agree that we must accept whatever happens in Eastern Europe as long as it does not directly threaten our geopolitical and geostrategic interests,'' he said. **********Mr. Chernega agreed that the dominant mood here is calm at the arrival of something long overdue. **********''These events seem sensational after a very long period of stability and quiet,'' he said. ''We forget that it's just a normal reaction to an overtightening of the bolts.

''There can be no repetition of the situation where a very small group of leaders take a decision that is not endorsed by the legislative authorities,'' he said. **********Mr. Primakov, who is visiting the United States at the invitation of Congressional leaders, said the Supreme Soviet was trying to clarify legislative and executive powers, including the power to use force and make war. Under the War Powers Act, he noted, the President of the United States can send troops to a war zone, but must withdraw them if Congress does not authorize their use. 'A More Democratic Spirit' **********''We would act in a more democratic spirit,'' requiring the Soviet President to consult the legislature in advance, Mr. Primakov said. He reported that the Supreme Soviet was drafting legislation to establish such a requirement. **********Mr. Primakov met Thursday with President Bush and gave him a letter from Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Primakov said the letter included a ''very positive'' assessment of Soviet-American relations. **********Mr. Primakov, an economist, is chairman of the Council of the Union, the upper chamber of the Soviet Parliament. He is also a nonvoting member of the Politburo, a post to which he was appointed in Mr. Gorbachev's recent shake-up of the Kremlin leadership. **********Speaking today at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Primakov presented himself as a champion of legislative authority. He said members of the Supreme Soviet delegation uttered ''a cry of indignation'' when Senator Bob Dole told them that he ranks lower than his wife in the American system of protocol. The Senate Republican leader's wife is Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole. **********''The Supreme Soviet may tend to be a little overly chauvinistic in its relationship to the executive branch,'' Mr. Primakov said. ''Maybe that's an infant disease, but we have it.'' **********Mr. Primakov also made these points: *********** Soviet politics have become more open and competitive because ''we wanted to show that we stand close to civilized behavior and that everything was being done on the basis of law.'' The Supreme Soviet no longer rubber-stamps legislation drafted by the Politburo, but writes laws on the basis of its own hearings and investigations. *********** The Supreme Soviet has demonstrated its new vigor by rejecting some of the people nominated for positions in Soviet ministries. *********** The Soviet Union sees ''no formidable obstacle'' to the eventual unification of Germany if the people of West and East Germany make that choice. But ''stability in Europe would not gain if one of those German states were to consume the other.'' *********** Despite an acute shortage of consumer goods, the Soviet Government will continue its program of economic restructuring. It will not go back to a system in which all major economic decisions are made by the Government, nor will it move immediately to a free-market system. Mr. Primakov said leaders of the Communist Party reserved the right to criticize or dismiss editors and journalists who were party members. The chief editor of Pravda was removed from his job last week, and the party ideology chief asked for the resignation of Vladislav A.

It expects to reach $1 billion in revenues and be profitable within five years, said the company's president, Sanford L. Kane, a former I.B.M. executive. **********Attaining such targets would be a stunning success for an enterprise that today exists largely on paper. The new company has yet to sign agreements with I.B.M. to make its first products, choose a site for manufacturing, raise a needed $1 billion or more, or even win assurance from the Government that its very existence does not violate antitrust laws. Another Uncertainty **********But even if everthing falls into place, it is not clear whether the 5 percent to 8 percent of the world memory-chip market that the company is seeking will be enough to achieve its backers' goals. **********''The Japanese are still going to have substantial market power,'' said Charles H. Ferguson, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But he added that the startup of U.S. Memories is a step in the right direction. **********The companies backing U.S. Memories want it to provide a domestic source for dynamic random access memory chips, or D-RAM's, the main type of chip used to store information in computers. Few if any of them are likely to get as much as 10 percent of their chip needs from the new company. Their goal is to reduce the ability of Japanese chip companies to act in a cartel-like fashion to keep supply tight and prices high. **********''It's like North Slope oil,'' said David Angel, a semiconductor analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market-research company. ''By being a viable alternative source it should keep the rest of the suppliers in check.'' **********Most American chip makers abandoned the D-RAM market several years ago in the face of stiff competition from the Japanese. **********Lower D-RAM prices could make a substantial difference for the large computer companies. Many leading computer makers are expected to spend billions of dollars annually on memory chips by the time U.S. Memories enters the market. **********Given such conditions, some analysts have said that a U.S. Memories large enough to force prices down could be a wise investment for the computer companies backing it, whether or not it ever makes a profit. **********They say, however, that U.S. Memories will more likely be only a small factor in the market. As a result, the company itself might thrive under the price umbrella set by the dominant Japanese companies - but it would have failed in its grander strategic mission. **********Mr. Kane is aiming to achieve both goals. He expects the company to be profitable by 1993 and to remain so as long as the Japanese do not drop their prices below the cost of production, an illegal trade practice known as dumping. He also expects the company to become a significant supplier of D-RAM chips within a few years. Next Generation of Chips **********U.S. Memories, which will eventually employ as many as 2,000 people, is going after 5 percent to 8 percent of the market for the next generation of memory chips, the four-megabit D-RAM, which stores four million bits of information. That would about double the United States market share in the early 1990's, assuming American suppliers have the same market share then as they do now of the one-megabit market. **********''It's as much as you could expect to accomplish in a limited amount of time,'' Mr. Kane said. **********He and other industry executives say the situation will be better than it looks at first glance. For one thing, a 15 percent share of the world D-RAM market translates into a healthier 30 percent of domestic needs, assuming no chips are exported. **********In addition, executives say, U.S. Memories would not be the only effort aimed at reducing dependence on Japan. Motorola Inc., which recently entered the semiconductor market with the help of the Toshiba Corporation of Japan, will be producing in larger volumes by then, as will Siemens A.G. of West Germany and perhaps some South Korean companies. Plenty of Hurdles **********U.S. Memories has plenty of hurdles to surmount first, though. It has set an ambitious schedule to break ground on a new plant by the end of this year and begin producing chips licensed from I.B.M. by mid-1991. A second plant will be started before the first is completed and is expected to come on line in 1992, followed by a third in 1993. **********U.S. Memories expects to need from $1 billion to $1.2 billion for its startup costs, with half the money coming in equity investments from computer and semiconductor companies and half in debt. The Federal Government will not be asked to contribute directly, only to grant antitrust clearance and perhaps to guarantee some of the loans. The company, however, anticipates that state and local governments, eager to attract the new plant, will offer some money and other incentives. **********Companies that participate will be asked to buy from 1 percent to 10 percent of the equity, representing an investment of $5 million to $50 million. Seven companies have signed on as charter investors, including Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, National Semiconductor and LSI Logic, in addition to I.B.M. They have agreed to buy stakes that amount to less than 50 percent of the total needed. This implies that another 10 or more companies must be enticed to invest. Purchase Requirements **********Investors must buy a percentage of the chip production equal to half their equity stake. This provision will insure U.S. Memories will have customers for half its output. For instance, a company with 10 percent equity stake will be required to take 5 percent of the output, at prices that are guaranteed to be competitive. **********Another 25 percent or so of the chips will be set aside for the investors to buy, at their option. The remaining 25 percent of the chips will be sold on the open market. **********Makers of computers and other electronic equipment that are investors in U.S. Memories are expected to use its chips in their own equipment. Semiconductor companies that are investors, like Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductor, will be able to resell the D-RAM's, filling holes in their product lines. **********But U.S. Memories' output will be spread among so many investors that the company is destined to be a relatively minor supplier for any large chip user or distributor. Lever to Win Chip Business **********Still, every little bit may help. Industry officials say the Japanese companies have been using D-RAMs as a lever to win other chip business, especially during the severe shortage of D-RAM's last year. For instance, a Japanese company might offer to sell a computer company D-RAM's if the computer company would also buy semicustomized chips. In addition, having control of memory chips has helped the Japanese companies to gain market share in computers, a far larger business than the chips themselves. **********U.S. Memories expects to be a year to two years behind the Japanese in reaching markets with its four-megabit chip. The company, however, has already begun thinking about future generations of products. By the time U.S. Memories brings up its third production line for four-megabit chips in 1993, the industry will have started to shift to the next generation, the 16-megabit chip. **********Mr. Kane said the company was likely to license a 16-megabit design from I.B.M. because it was too late to start to design such a chip. For the generation after that, the 64-megabit chip, U.S. Memories must decide whether to remain dependent on I.B.M. or to do its own research and design. Even that decision must be made fairly soon, Mr. Kane said, because competitors are already starting their 64-megabit designs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/16/world/free-marketeer-is-ahead-in-brazil.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1989-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FREE-MARKETEER IS AHEAD IN BRAZIL", "print_headline": "FREE-MARKETEER IS AHEAD IN BRAZIL", "body_text": " **********Fernando Collor de Mello, a former state governor who advocates a free-market path for Latin America's largest economy, led today in voter polls after Brazilians cast their ballots in the first presidential election since 1960. **********The polls indicated that today's vote will set the stage for a left-right runoff on Dec. 17. **********Four voter polls gave Mr. Collor about 30 percent of the ballots cast. **********In three of the four polls, Luis Inacio da Silva, a left-wing labor leader, maintained a slight edge over his socialist rival, Leonel Brizola.

Not Just a Tax Issue **********''Most of the Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee favor capital gains reduction, but almost none of us agreed with the President to do it this year,'' said Senator Dave Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican on the panel. ''When the President was up here earlier this month, we told him, 'You're going to get capital gains, but you may not get it this year.' '' **********Mr. Durenberger said the White House response was that cutting the capital gains tax was not just a tax issue, but a political issue that could be used to make the Democrats a minority party by dividing them. **********''We're in two different ball games here,'' Senator Durenberger said. ''We're trying to make tax policy, and John Sununu is trying to make the Democrats a minority party.'' Mr. Durenberger was referring to the President's chief of staff, who along with the budget director, Richard G. Darman, and the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, have been involved in planning political strategy on the capital gains issue. Packwood's I.R.A. Plan **********Senator Packwood said he still favors an attempt to attach the proposal to the debt-limit bill, but said he was waiting for the President and the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, to make a decision. Mr. Packwood said he thought he would win a majority of Senate votes, and that such a vote would strengthen the Senate's bargaining hand with the House, which has approved a temporary reduction in the capital gains tax. **********The Packwood proposal includes a plan to permit tax-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts once their owners reach the age of 59 1/2. **********Senator David Boren of Oklahoma, the chief Democratic supporter of a capital gains tax cut, calculated the odds for passage this year as 1 in 3, with the odds improving next year to 2 in 3.

''It's a clear policy aimed at Nablus, intimidation by killing.'' **********The violence continued today, with two more Palestinians killed, raising the toll of the protests to at least 311 Palestinians. **********Much of the occupied West Bank and Gaza was shut by a strike called by the Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas. The army declared curfews in Gaza because of disturbances after the deaths of three Palestinians on Friday, confining about 400,000 of the 650,000 residents to their homes. **********In Mokassad Hospital in Jerusalem, Anwar Albahti, a 14-year-old Palestinian, died of gunshot wounds to his head during disturbances on Dec. 6. During funeral services at his village of Shuwaika, near Tulkarm on the West Bank, the army wounded about a dozen others with plastic bullets. **********An unidentified man was also killed during a clash with troops in the village of Biet Rima, near Ramallah. **********The army is bracing to prevent demonstrations on Sunday, the anniversary of the founding of Al Fatah, Mr. Arafat's organization in the P.L.O. All West Bank schools, which reopened several weeks ago after having been closed for five months, have been shut for a week. **********The army declared Nablus a ''closed military zone,'' and journalists were turned back. But the city proved accessible by taxis taking side streets to avoid the soldiers. A Quiet Day **********It was, as it turned out, a quiet day here. But the atmosphere was still electric as tense. One group of youths were sitting in mourning at the home of Samir Shehadeh. Among them was his younger brother, Amer, a 12-year-old with a picture of his brother pinned to the kaffiyeh over his heart. **********The dead youth's uncle, Abu Ali Shehadeh, 57, serving as host because the father was dead, said, ''The woman who gave birth tonight, her son has already joined the intifada.'' **********On a street corner, young men identified themselves as the Democratic Youth, meaning they were followers of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Although its leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, has been at odds with Mr. Arafat in the past, there was support among the youths for the new P.L.O. stand. **********''As a movement, as a people, we support the P.N.C. decision,'' said the group's leader, Yaya, 21. ''But as far as a truce in the intifada, no, we don't accept that.'' **********''The beginning of the second year of the intifada in Nablus has been stronger than the first year,'' the underground leader said in his workshop. **********Asked about the American decision to speak to the P.L.O., breaking a 13-year ban agreed upon with Israel, he said: ''It is a good move, but we should't be too overjoyed about it. If the Americans think that by starting a dialogue they can slow down the intifada, they are wrong. **********''In negotiations, the power of one party is as strong as its military power. For us, the intifada is our military power, and this we will not give up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/13/business/ex-congressman-to-head-amex.html": {"writer_name": "Kurt Eichenwald", "pub_date": "1989-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 942, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Congressman to Head Amex", "print_headline": "Ex-Congressman to Head Amex", "body_text": " **********In a surprise move outside Wall Street's inner circle, the American Stock Exchange announced yesterday that it had chosen as its new chairman a former Democratic Representative from Oklahoma, James R. Jones. **********Mr. Jones, who was on Lyndon B. Johnson's staff and who has served as an outside director of the Amex since 1987, will become the 15th chairman in the Amex's history, succeeding Arthur Levitt Jr., who has held the position for 11 years. Mr. Levitt, who presided over a revival of the exchange, announced earlier this year that he was resigning to devote himself full time to his own publishing business. **********By choosing Mr. Jones, 50 years old, the Amex will become the only leading American financial exchange headed by someone whose background is neither in the securities industry nor in business. Beneficial Experience Seen **********But officials at the Amex and on its directors' committee, which chose Mr. Jones, said they believed his experience in politics and world affairs would prove beneficial to the exchange. **********''We thought we had the securities operation well covered,'' said Jeffrey B. Lane, president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., who headed the selection committee. ''What we thought we needed was Washington experience and a global knowledge. We think Jim brings that to the table.'' **********Indeed, executives at the exchange said yesterday that they expected Washington to play an increasingly important role in the rapidly changing securities business. Because of his experience, Mr. Jones is expected to give the Amex a step up in dealing with Congress and the Administration. **********Mr. Jones said yesterday that he expected to work closely with Kenneth R. Leibler, president of the Amex. Mr. Leibler, who has been instrumental in the exchange's recent success, had been considered a possible successor for Mr. Levitt. **********Although Mr. Levitt has been less involved in exchange affairs since 1986, leaving that to the exchange president, Mr. Leibler is likely to become an even more important presence at the exchange as the highest-ranking official who has working knowledge of the securities business. **********''The strengths that I bring to this complement the many strengths that Ken brings to this,'' Mr. Jones said in an interview. ''I think we're going to make a good team.'' **********In an interview, Mr. Leibler said he believed the selection would be beneficial for the exchange. ''Jim brings an added dimension that I don't have,'' he said. ''And we do have a very capable and well-respected staff at this exchange that handles technical issues.'' **********Though Mr. Jones will not start until Nov. 10, he and Mr. Leibler began working together yesterday, with Mr. Leibler giving him a tour of the trading floor after the market closed. Healthier and Better Directed **********Mr. Levitt is leaving the exchange a much healthier and better-directed institution than it was when he arrived. The Amex remains a distant third in trading volume to the New York Stock Exchange and to the over-the-counter market. But through innovation and shrewd marketing in the United States and abroad, it has stanched a loss of listed companies, become a formidable player in stock options and jumped ahead of the competition with a variety of new products and services. **********As a result, the exchange in lower Manhattan, known until the 1920's as the Curb Exchange because it conducted trading outdoors, has swelled its trading to record levels. **********Mr. Jones has more than 25 years of Washington experience under his belt. In the 1960's, fresh out of the University of Oklahoma, he served as a Congressional aide as well as working in the Johnson Administration. In 1972, he was elected to Congress, one of the only Democrats elected from a predominantly Republican district in Tulsa, Okla. **********In his years in Congress, Mr. Jones won a reputation as an ally of business. In 1978, he pushed for a cut in the capital gains tax, a position championed by President Bush in the current legislative battle and strongly supported by the securities industry. **********Mr. Jones served on some of the most influential committees in the House, including the Ways and Means and Budget panels. In 1981, he became chairman of the Budget Committee, a post he won despite the misgivings of some of the House Democratic leadership, which at the time considered him too conservative. He also served as chairman of the United States-Japan Trade Task Force. Registered Lobbyist **********In 1986, Mr. Jones left Congress after an unsuccessful Senate bid, and joined the Washington law firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin. In his new job, Mr. Jones became a registered lobbyist for a number of companies, including Avondale Industries, the Bank of Oklahoma, Guess and J. P. Morgan Securities. **********Mr. Jones also registered with the Justice Department as an agent of a foreign company. For example, the Toshiba Corporation, stung by disclosures that a subsidiary sold sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, obtained the services of Mr. Jones. **********Exchange officials and Mr. Jones said yesterday that his experiences with the foreign countries and companies would provide beneficial to the exchange as globalization continued to grow in importance in the securities industry. **********''I would hope that the personal and professional relationships I have built up over the years with Japan and Europe will serve the exchange as we move more toward global markets,'' Mr. Jones said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/08/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; People", "body_text": " *********** Peter B.

Even many Japanese say they know little of the ''flower and willow world'' of the geisha. **********Skilled in the arts of music, dance, games and conversation, geishas serve as hostesses or companions to their customers in exclusive restaurants patronized by rich and powerful men. Not infrequently, the companionship leads to sex. And always the liaisons are marked by discretion. **********Now the tradition of discretion has been shattered, first by a woman identified as a geisha who described her brief sexual relationship with Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, for which she was reportedly paid $2,300 a month, and later by another geisha describing a 10-year relationship with Mr. Uno. 'Not an Ordinary Call Girl' **********These and other relationships reported or rumored in the press all supposedly occurred before Mr. Uno became Prime Minister in June. But they have devastated Mr. Uno's Government, all but wrecking its hopes of recovering from a bribery scandal that had brought the downfall of his predecessor. **********Mr. Uno has declined to comment on the stories about his involvement with various women, but their accounts have stirred a lively debate in Japan about the differences between a geisha and a prostitute, and about the reasons for the survival of the geisha system. **********''A geisha is not an ordinary call girl,'' said Kiharu Nakamura, a former geisha in the Shinbashi area. ''It takes years of study to be a geisha, to learn all the proper traditional arts.'' **********The geisha system is believed to have emerged in 17th-century Japan as a group of entertainers set apart from the ranks of courtesans and prostitutes working among the noble and warrior classes. Only later did geishas become involved in sexual liaisons themselves, developing into what today might be called mistresses or concubines. Historians say that in the 1920's perhaps 80,000 geishas operated in Japan, but today the number is believed to be only a couple of thousand, almost all in Tokyo and the old capital, Kyoto. **********Mrs. Nakamura said the Shinbashi Geisha Association today has only 100 members, compared with 1,300 when she was working there in the 1930's. **********The geisha system today may be small but the key to its survival is its central role in the system of power in Japan. It is in geisha houses that big business and political deals are believed to be made, in an atmosphere of extraordinary intimacy and trust, away from casual acquaintances, outsiders or wives. **********Many who know about such things agree that the first woman who came forward identifying Mr. Uno as her lover was probably not a true geisha, since she acknowledged she had had no training and decided to become a geisha only at about the age of 40. **********Geishas are supposed to start training in music and dance as young girls. Most geisha associations require their members to reach a high degree of proficiency in such arts as classical dancing, playing a stringed instrument known as the samisen and various styles of singing. Many geishas also are skilled at flower arranging, performing the tea ceremony and calligraphy. **********Other knowledgeable people say that a geisha would never have broken the taboo against speaking about one's customers, or about the deals discussed inside the ryotei, or geisha house. Still others say that the stipend claimed by the woman in the Uno case, 300,000 yen a month, or $2,300, seems low. A Kind of Courtship **********''It sounds very meager,'' said a prominent Japanese industrialist who has been to many geisha houses. ''Before the oil crisis of 1973, when these places were at their peak, the most popular young geisha - maybe 17 or 18 or 19 years old - would have cost about a million yen a month.'' **********Companionship with a geisha often does not lead to a sexual liaison. Moreover, it is considered improper to make a sexual advance with a geisha on the first encounter. Instead, the patron - most frequently a married man in his 50's or 60's - often goes through a kind of courtship. **********By most accounts, the geisha system has declined greatly over the decades because of the easier availability of more casual forms of sex in Japan. Sex for money is readily available in Japan at bars, cabarets, clubs and bathhouses. But geishas are generally seen as in a different class. **********''Japanese know the distinction at a glance,'' said a foreigner who has lived here for more than 20 years. ''Geishas are not necessarily beautiful women, but they have a certain air about them. If you go to a geisha house, you have to be with someone who is already accepted. You then build up a record by patronizing a place over a period of time.'' **********Different neighborhoods also specialize in different kinds of clientele. The Shinbashi area caters to wealthy businessmen, whereas the geishas in Akasaka and Kagurazaka, two districts near the Parliament building, are more popular with politicians. These are the districts of the two women who have been identified as involved with the Prime Minister. Wife May Be a Friend **********Many famous Japanese politicians and businessmen, including at least two recent Prime Ministers, are widely known to have been involved with mistresses or geishas. In addition, several prominent businessmen and officials today are known to have wives who were formerly geishas. **********In the cases of the two Prime Ministers, involvement with mistresses was never printed in the Japanese press even though one of the officials, Kakuei Tanaka, was asked about his mistress on the floor of Parliament. ''In those cases, the women were discreet,'' said the Japanese businessman. **********But Mrs. Nakamura, the former geisha, who has lived for many years in New York City, said during a visit to Tokyo that it was also common for geishas and wives to know and respect each other. She said she remembered that her own grandmother recommended that her grandfather establish a liaison with a geisha as she grew older and realized she could not meet all his needs. **********''When my grandfather died, guess who became the best friend of my grandmother?'' asked Mrs. Nakamura. ''The concubine! They had wonderful conversations, recalling how he liked to have his tea and things like that. It's a happy way to think about life, with no jealousy or hatred, don't you think?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/business/merger-of-first-federal-and-pittsburgh-national.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1989-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 589, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Merger of First Federal And Pittsburgh National", "print_headline": "Merger of First Federal And Pittsburgh National", "body_text": " **********The push by Pennsylvania banks to combine and increase their share of local markets continued yesterday, as Pittsburgh's largest bank and largest savings and loan agreed to merge. **********The merger of Pittsburgh National Bank with First Federal of Pittsburgh is the third move in recent months by big Pennsylvania banking companies to increase significantly their presence in the state's major markets. **********The merger with First Federal was the largest involving a healthy savings and loan since such combinations were allowed by Federal legislation earlier this year to rescue the savings industry. Although First Federal has operated profitably for 55 years and expects to earn about $4 million in 1989, a lack of capital has dimmed its growth prospects, and encouraged it to find a merger partner. 24% of Pittsburgh's Deposits After adding First Federal's 64 branches, Pittsburgh National will have about 24 percent of the Pittsburgh area's deposits, up from 19 percent and just behind Mellon National Bank, the market leader. **********Last week, Mellon Bank (East), Mellon's Philadelphia affiliate, bought 54 branches in the Philadelphia area from the Meritor Financial Group, to create a much larger bank to be operated as Mellon PSFS. The initials are derived from the old Philadelphia Saving Fund Society, the nation's oldest savings bank and now a unit of Meritor. The merger raised Mellon's share of that market to 14.3 percent from 5.4 percent. **********And earlier this fall, the Corestates Financial Corporation, parent of Philadelphia National Bank, agreed to acquire First Pennsylvania Bank, raising its share of the Philadelphia market to 15.3 percent from 9.2 percent. Hoping to Spread Costs **********By increasing market share, bankers expect to operate more profitably, spreading the costs of advertising, product development and other expenses over a larger customer base. **********Pittsburgh National's parent, the PNC Financial Corporation, is combining with First Federal without any cash payment or issuing stock, and without any Federal assistance. **********First Federal's capital problems stem from a series of purchases of troubled savings institutions earlier in the decade. Those acquisitions left First Federal with about $200 million of good will on its books, which represents the amount it paid for those institutions over the value of their assets. The need to reduce that good will by more than $10 million annually has severely cut First Federal's profits. **********Although First Federal does not meet the Federal standard for tangible capital equal to 1.5 percent of assets, it is not among the troubled institutions due to be closed by Federal regulators. First Federal's participation in risky lending for construction projects or commercial real estate has been small. Ending Duplicate Expenses **********Thomas O'Brien, chairman of PNC, said First Federal will increase PNC's profits beginning in 1990, but he declined to estimate the amount. Bankers involved in the merger said two-thirds of the benefit should come from elimination of duplicate expenses for advertising and lawyers, with the remaining third to come from profit growth as Pittsburgh National's products are introduced to customers of First Federal. **********There will be no layoffs as a result of the merger, the bankers said, although they added that there would be some shrinking of the combined work forces through attrition.

The ball meets less resistance and Mr. Hale looks like Mickey Mantle. **********The bad news is that there is also less air to breathe. So running the bases or even walking briskly leaves most people panting. **********La Paz, a city of angular office towers and adobe huts where Indian women in bowler hats share sidewalks with people in the latest European fashions, is higher above sea level, by far, than any other national capital or major city. Quito, Ecuador, for example, stands at 9,350 feet, and Bogota, Colombia is at 8,660. Mexico City is at 7,347 and Denver, the highest major city in the United States, is at 5,280 feet. The Elite Seek Denser Air **********Life at high altitude is different. Planes take longer to take off and land. Food cooks slower and recipes have to be doctored. Fires have to be coaxed into flame and cars have less power. Digestion is slower and cocktails have more kick. Toothpaste packed at sea level squirts out of the tube. **********Many people find they have less appetite and that, to their delight, they begin shedding flab. Though there is not much documentation, doctors say babies are generally born smaller at high altitude and tend to grow more slowly. When La Paz athletes travel to games in the lowlands they take along an extra pair of oversized shoes because their feet often swell. **********In most cities in the world, the rich occupy the heights. In La Paz, however, the most expensive residential neighborhoods are down the mountainside a few hundred yards where the air is denser and warmer. Bolivia's one ski slope, at 17,000 feet, is billed as the highest in the world. Its season is not winter, but summer, because in the coldest part of the year the slope becomes a sheet of ice. **********Travelers feel a little short of breath when they step off a plane at the La Paz airport, which lies on a plateau about 2,000 feet higher than the capital. Sometimes newcomers also suffer headaches and insomnia for a few days or even weeks. For some, the reaction is sudden and dramatic. Some hyperventilate and black out. Others become nauseated. A few never adjust and have to leave. Each year, a handful of people die. In 2 Cities, 2 Fires in 6 Months It is not uncommon for Bolivians and foreign residents to go to the airport to greet visitors with a wheelchair and an oxygen bottle. The major hotels routinely provide guests with oxygen bottles in their rooms. Doctors advise those with heart and lung ailments to stay away. **********For all of La Paz, with 800,000 people, and the neighboring city of El Alto, with about 300,000, there is one fire station. In the last six months there have been two fires. **********''It is hard for fires to start and they don't expand very quickly,'' said Capt. Justo Herrera Gutierrez. **********Eastern Airlines, the only American carrier that serves La Paz, gives its pilots a special training course in operating here. and they are accompanied on their first flight by a colleague with La Paz experience. Adjustments for Cars **********''The airplane is a little less responsive,'' said John McCarthy, a senior Eastern pilot, as he was preparing for takeoff here recently in a 727. **********At sea level, the 727 is airborne in about 30 seconds. But here it often takes twice that long to develop lift in the thin air, with the cockpit gauges registering 175 knots instead of the standard 130 for airports in, say, New York or Washington. Most international airport runways are about 10,000 feet long. Here the length is 13,000 feet. **********To get up and down the hills of La Paz, cars have to have a special low-ratio gear installed. Carburetors and ignition systems have to be adjusted. **********Carolina Zumaran won a small Polish car in a raffle. But she was unable to get the special gear and the car would not climb. For a while, like a soapbox derby racer, she tried to find downhill slopes that would give her the momentum to reach the next summit. Finally, she put the car up for sale. No one in La Paz wanted it. But she found a happy buyer in the city of Cochabamba, which is at 8,389 feet. Home Remedy: Coca-Leaf Tea **********Doctors advise those headed for La Paz to eat lightly and to avoid alcoholic drinks. But they say the effects of altitude on people are unpredictable. The other day, two Chilean printers, who had each had a beer with their airline lunch, stepped off a plane here together. One was hit with altitude sickness. He became dizzy and began feeling nauseated. Dr. Daniel Mosqueira, a Government doctor stationed at a small clinic in the airport, administered oxygen and the printer soon recovered. **********Everyone recommends that new arrivals drink plenty of tea brewed from the same leaves from which cocaine is extracted. As an infusion, coca leaves have none of the qualities of cocaine. Some doctors say they also have little medicinal value. Nevertheless, many people say they feel better after a few cups. **********''I think the major effect is psychological,'' said Dr. Enrique Vargas, director of a high-altitude medical institute in La Paz that has confirmed that living this high intensifies some heart and lung disorders. **********People who grow up in La Paz develop larger-than-normal lungs, doctors say, and some foreign athletes believe that training here helps to build stamina. **********La Paz soccer teams are virtually invincible on their home turf, said Alfonso Arevalo, one of the capital's leading television sports commentators. Mr. Arevalo said the local teams not only have the altitude working for them, but also a ''high dose of psychological pressure.'' Some teams, he said, begin explaining their defeat before they arrive. But the same psychological pressure seems to work in reverse for the La Paz teams when they visit other countries at sea level. They have lots of experience playing on sea-level fields within the country, Mr. Arevalo said, but when they leave Bolivia, their game seems to fall apart."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/world/bonn-s-politicians-appear-dismayed-by-cost-of-influx.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1989-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 991, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BONN'S POLITICIANS APPEAR DISMAYED BY COST OF INFLUX", "print_headline": "BONN'S POLITICIANS APPEAR DISMAYED BY COST OF INFLUX", "body_text": " **********The morning after the weekend surge of tens of thousands of people fleeing East Germany, many West German politicians are beginning to wonder about the cost of absorbing Germans from all over Eastern Europe. **********Weekend television news broadcasts showed long lines of East German cars and special trains crossing the Czech border, in scenes that looked much like those shown in the last major exodus a month ago. But the mood then - of champagne and instant job offers -seemed more like a hangover this time. Democracy as a Practical Matter **********''Unless we can somehow get the people there to stop seeing their future so pessimistically, we'll have millions of them coming,'' said Andreas von Bulow, a Social Democratic member of the West German Parliament. ''I think we have to insist that they have free elections over there, put together a reform government and organize a stay-put policy in the German Democratic Republic.''  [ East Berlin on Monday published the draft of a law that would give people the right to travel abroad or to emigrate. But as the exodus continued, the proposal generated little excitement. Page A14. ]  Here in Bonn, a West German Government spokesman restated official policy, saying that every East German citizen ''who comes here has the unconditional and indisputable right to be accepted as a German in the Federal Republic of Germany,'' which grants citizenship to anyone who can prove ethnic German origin. Stay Home and Make Changes **********The statement by the spokesman, Dieter Vogel, also contained a subtle plea for East Germans to remain at home. ''An East Germany with fewer people changing the situation there will only find it more difficult to build a better future,'' he said, referring to the country by the initials of the German Democratic Republic, its official name. **********Making the situation concrete, the social services minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia said that it would require the postponement of tax cuts for three years, or a reduction in the national military budget, to pay for the resettlement of the 150,000 immigrants expected there this year. **********Nationwide, the number of newly arriving Germans this year will be close to 600,000, said Herbert Schmalstieg, the mayor of Hanover, who said today that local governments had run out of both permanent and temporary housing for the 170,000 East Germans who have already arrived in 1989. **********Emergency housing was ''hopelessly overcrowded,'' he said, and plans by the West German Government to provide more than $1 billion this year to help solve the problem were ''inadequate from top to bottom.'' Jobs and Housing **********Overcoming the housing shortage for immigrants over the next decade would require at least $5.3 billion a year for the next 10 years, he said, and more if social benefits like unemployment payments were included. **********Last month, 176,800 recently arrived ethnic Germans were unemployed, according to the federal Labor Office in Nuremberg. While the news reports were full of heartwarming stories of young East German mechanics and plumbers being snapped up at reception centers by eager West German employers, official statistics indicated that more resettled East Germans may have joined the unemployment rolls than the number who found jobs. **********Of the 57,000 immigrants from East Germany who arrived in October, the labor office said, 11,000 found jobs through official channels, with others taking up direct offers from employers. But 16,400 more than in September registered as unemployed, according to the Labor Office, which put the total of recently arrived East German jobless at 61,700. **********In addition, 115,000 ethnic German immigrants from elsewhere in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union were also unemployed at the end of October. **********So recent immigrants now make up 9.4 percent of the total number of West German unemployed, which fell slightly last month to 1,873,000, or 7.3 percent of the labor force, according to official statistics. **********''I think a big element in the support the radical right-wing Republican Party has gained in the last year is due to resentment about the money we spend on these people from other countries,'' Mr. Bulow said. **********Franz Schonhuber, the head of the Republican Party, said, ''I have the feeling that these pictures of thousands and thousands of refugees coming in their little cars creates an anxiety in many minds: Where will they find apartments? What about us? **********''I do see a positive effect for us in the next elections,'' he said. Those will be held next fall, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the Social Democratic opposition alike have their eyes on them already. **********Those on the lower end of the prosperous West German economic ladder are not the only ones who are pointing out that the money being used to resettle immigrants might better be spent helping East European countries raise their standards of living and keep people at home. 'Some Other Way' to Help **********The historian Golo Mann, in an interview in today's Die Welt newspaper, said of the resettlement of tens of thousands of ethnic Germans from the Volga River valley in the Soviet Union: ''The fact that families that went to Russia under Czar Alexander II, whose older members cannot speak German at all and whose younger members barely speak any, can all now come here - I really can't view as very sensible. We could have really helped better some other way.'' **********A study made by the North Rhine-Westphalia state government recently found that about 10 percent of the ethnic German immigrants from the Soviet Union spoke no German, and that 60 percent of those from Poland could not speak German, either."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/world/camor-east-berlin-wall-monument-cold-war-triumphs-tragedies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-11-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1300, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Camor in the East; The Berlin Wall: A Monument to the Cold War, Triumphs and Tragedies", "print_headline": "Camor in the East; The Berlin Wall: A Monument to the Cold War, Triumphs and Tragedies", "body_text": " **********It was a monument to political control, a scene of gunfire and drama and tragedy, the stuff of spy novels and a physical and psychic barrier that divided Berlin, Germany and Europe. For 28 years, the Berlin wall has been the foremost symbol of cold war and East-West confrontation. **********Yesterday, the barrier still stood, but its meaning began to crumble like old mortar when embattled East German leaders announced that they would soon throw open their western border and allow citizens to travel freely beyond the wall where at least 191 people have died in bloody, sometimes bizarre, attempts to escape. **********Even when it first went up on Aug. 13, 1961, to halt an exodus of East Germans to the West, the Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, called it an ugly thing. But ugly hardly captured the horrifying sense of a structure that overnight sundered a great city and its people. **********At first a crude 29-mile expanse of cinder blocks and barbed wire that split the city, the wall in time became a 103-mile stretch of fortified concrete and steel that encircled and imprisoned West Berlin. It is 13 to 15 feet high, topped with barbed and razor wire, and set with hundreds of watchtowers, gun emplacements and explosive mines. Kennedy's Decision on the Wall **********The East Germans asserted that the wall was intended as protection, to prevent an attack from the West and to preserve the peace. But the West condemned it as a cause for shame and mourning, a symbol of moral differences between Democratic freedoms and totalitarian Communism. **********The wall's construction was supervised by Erich Honecker, who was then a member of the East German Politburo. It divided friends, families and neighborhoods. Thousands of commuters lost their jobs. But in a country from which 2.5 million people had fled from 1949 to 1961, the wall also stemmed a flight of 3,000 people a day to the West and briefly generated another crisis over Berlin. **********President John F. Kennedy decided against dismantling the wall, believing that the East Germans would just re-erect it and that a confrontation with the Soviet Union over the wall was not warranted. Some historians have linked Mr. Kennedy's inaction in Berlin to Mr. Khrushchev's decision to test American firmness by putting offensive missiles in Cuba in 1962. **********In one of history's twists, the 77-year-old Mr. Honecker has been swept out amid rising demands for change in East Germany, and a new flight to freedom by thousands of East Germans has forced the Communist Government to declare free travel, removing the wall's meaning as a political barrier. Pact on Access to West Berlin **********Over the years, visiting presidents, prime ministers and other Western dignitaries have made what became almost obligatory visits to the wall, calling ritually for its removal and denouncing the system of government that needed walls and wire to control people. **********In the best known of those visits, President Kennedy went to Berlin on June 26, 1963, and declared: ''Two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was 'civis Romanus sum.' Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is, 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' '' **********Tourists, too, went to see the jagged, gray-concrete structure - in some places a double wall with a no-man's land between - where hundreds of East Germans risked their lives to escape and where by West Germany estimate 191 died in gunfire or in the explosion of mines, and 5,000 more were captured and dragged back within yards of freedom. **********In 1970, the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union - the victorious World War II powers that occupied the city - reached an agreement aimed at easing tensions, allowing the west easier access to West Berlin, 110 miles inside East Germany, and visits beyond the wall for West Berliners. Pardons for Captured Escapees **********While East Berliners were forbidden to travel to the west, West Berliners and non-Germans gained access to East Berlin through a series of checkpoints, including Checkpoint Charlie, the famed spot where spies were exchanged. West Berliners also rode in aboard an elevated train from the Zoo in West Berlin to Friedrichstrasse in East Berlin. **********Despite those concessions, many found it hard to forget the grim images of 19-year-old Peter Fechter, who was shot in 1962 after getting past Communist border guards at Checkpoint Charlie. He died in no-man's land in full view of scores of helpless West Berliners, foreign correspondents and security officials. **********While most escapes took place along less-fortified sections of the 860-mile border between East and West Germany, the Berlin wall was the scene of thousands of attempts. West German estimates say 5,000 people have made it over, under and through the wall since 1961. **********A total of 4,000 people whose escape attempts failed are believed to be held in East German jails and prisons. As part of its current program of political change, the East German Government has pardoned those prisoners and has said they are to be released at the end of November. **********In scenes of triumph and tragedy, escapees in the early years of the wall sometimes leaped from windows on the Bernauerstrasse, buildings that once made up part of the wall, into a western street. But the East Berlin authorities dynamited buildings nearest the wall and eventually established a free-fire zone where anything that moved was shot. **********Swept by searchlights at night and watchtower binoculars by day, the zone brought new perils to the business of escape. Guards with machine guns and police dogs patrolled it; explosive mines were planted. Sand was laid down and raked daily to reveal footprints. **********For years, border guards on the lookout for escapees had orders to shoot to kill. But earlier this year, those orders were rescinded. Still, the order to halt and capture escapees remained in force. **********There were fascinating stories of bravery and bizarre tales of ingenuity in the attempts to flee, the results of despair, frustration, anger, envy, and even idealism that were was hard for Westerners to understand. One East German engineer piloted a glider over the wall; another made a hot-air balloon of patched-together bedsheets and shower curtains. **********In 1983, two young men used an archery bow to fire a cable over the wall from an attic to an accomplice on a rooftop in West Berlin. They attached pulleys to the cable and rode in the dark over the heads of the border guards. **********There were people who hid in drums used for storing telephone cable. Two medical students who had a friend make up East German border-patrol uniforms and who painted a car to look like an army vehicle drove unchallenged to the West. **********At least 14 trucks rammed through the wall. In 1964, nine people escaped by hiding in a car so small that guards did not consider it worth searching. In September 1962, 147 people tunneled under it, and others have tunneled their way out over the years. **********The exchange of espionage agents at the wall and the need for Berlin's many spies to penetrate the wall on missions to the other side and the division of families and friends gave rise to much fiction, notably John Le Carre's early success, ''The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' which ended with death at the wall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/24/business/phoenix-offers-refunding-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Phoenix Offers Refunding Bonds", "print_headline": "Phoenix Offers Refunding Bonds", "body_text": " **********Phoenix is tentatively offering $61.5 million of general obligation refunding bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. **********Yields on the bonds, which are in serial form, range from 6.10 percent for an issue due this year to 6.45 percent in 1994, 6.70 percent in 1999, 7 percent in 2004 and 7.20 percent in 2009. **********Underwriters expect the issue to be rated Aa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA+ by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. **********The bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city; their proceeds will be used to refund in advance various securities that were sold when interest rates were higher."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/05/business/the-media-business-advertising-pro-bono.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 66, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pro Bono", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Pro Bono", "body_text": " *********** DDB Needham Retail, San Francisco, a unit of the Omnicom Group, will promote participation in the 1990 United States Census through a print, broadcast and in-store campaign involving national and regional retailers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/10/world/anti-sandinistas-predict-coalition.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1989-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 919, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANTI-SANDINISTAS PREDICT COALITION", "print_headline": "ANTI-SANDINISTAS PREDICT COALITION", "body_text": " **********Opposition leaders in Managua say they believe that the next Nicaraguan Government will be a coalition between themselves and the Sandinistas, regardless of who wins the presidential elections scheduled for Feb. 25. **********''Even if the opposition wins, we are going to have to negotiate with the Sandinistas,'' said Dr. Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, who for years has been a close adviser to the newly nominated opposition candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. ''The Sandinistas control the army, and that is a reality we are going to have to deal with.'' **********Some diplomats in Managua have said they believe that the opposition has little prospect of winning the February election. Several opposition figures, however, said this week that they felt victory was possible. Against the Odds **********Opposition leaders did not immediately comment on reports that the Bush Administration planned to openly use the National Endowment for Democracy, which is federally financed, to send $3 million to Mrs. Chamorro. In the past, the opposition leaders have been split on whether such aid would be worth the criticism it would draw from the Sandinistas, who have asserted that opposition politicians were puppets of Washington. **********Roger Guevara Mena, a prominent Nicaraguan opposition figure, said he believed that the opposition ticket faced formidable obstacles, but that it could win at the polls. **********''If we stay united, and if we are able to capitalize on the discontent that is out there, we can win,'' he said. ''What happens if we do win, whether the Sandinistas would actually surrender power, is another question. But we can't worry about that now.'' **********Another opposition figure, Luis Humberto Guzman, who is running for re-election to the National Assembly, said he also believes that the opposition has a real chance to win the presidency. But he predicted that whoever wins, the next government will be a coalition. **********''The country can no longer survive with all political power concentrated in one party,'' Mr. Guzman said in a telephone interview. ''Apparently even the Sandinistas now accept this. Once the election is over, what will probably emerge is a government of national unity.'' **********For years, Sandinista leaders have vowed never to surrender political power. President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, who is expected to be a candidate for re-election, has pledged to permit a free election in February. What the Sandinistas will do if they lose, however, is still highly uncertain. Under Foreign Scrutiny **********The campaign and voting are to be monitored by an unusually large number of foreigners, including former President Jimmy Carter. Former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson has been named to head the United Nations observer mission. **********Nicaragua's last presidential election was marred by bitter debate over restrictions imposed by the Sandinistas. The principal opposition candidate, Arturo Cruz, refused to register his candidacy to protest the restrictions. **********''If I had to bet on the outcome of this coming election, I would say that some kind of coalition government will be the final result,'' Mr. Cruz said in a telephone interview this week. ''The Sandinistas are totally repulsed by the idea of giving up power. If they lose control over the national budget, they lose the ability to punish and reward, and if they lose that, they risk becoming a miniparty within four or five years.'' **********''What I see in the future is some kind of understanding between the Sandinistas and the opposition. The country is in a disastrous state, and it needs a government that represents all social and political groups.'' Rifts Within the Opposition **********The newly nominated Mrs. Chamorro has been seeking to unify opposition groups behind her candidacy. Some hard-liners in the opposition were angered by the selection of Liberal leader Virgilio Godoy Reyes as her running mate, and were threatening to sit out the campaign. But at a meeting Thursday, all factions of the United Nicaraguan Opposition signed a document pledging full support for the ticket. **********The nomination of Mr. Godoy over the more militantly anti-Sandinista businessman Enrique Bolanos Geyer marked a sharp loss in political influence for the Superior Council of Private Enterprise, which Mr. Bolanos headed for much of the 1980's. Mr. Godoy presented himself as more ideologically progressive than Mr. Bolanos, and his presence on the ticket suggests an openness to future talks. **********Mr. Godoy served as Minister of Labor in the Sandinista Government from 1979 to 1984, before breaking with the regime. **********''Godoy knows the Sandinistas from inside,'' Mr. Guevara said. ''He is one of the few politicians in Nicaragua who has the qualities of a statesman. If there is any kind of negotiation after the election, he would be an ideal negotiator.'' **********Opposition leaders said they would spend much of this month shaping lists of candidates for the 90 elected seats in the National Assembly. They hope to agree on a single 90-name list that would represent all opposition parties, but drawing up such a list will likely take time and involve delicate negotiations. Business Influence Declining **********Another question is the role that Mr. Bolanos, the country's most prominent business leader, will play in the campaign. His influence, and that of the organized business community, appears to be declining in the opposition, while that of political party leaders is increasing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/04/world/the-malta-sumit-reporter-s-notebook-instead-of-a-cold-war-an-exchange-of-gibes.html": {"writer_name": "Maureen Dowd", "pub_date": "1989-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Malta Sumit: Reporter's Notebook; Instead of a Cold War, An Exchange of Gibes", "print_headline": "The Malta Sumit: Reporter's Notebook; Instead of a Cold War, An Exchange of Gibes", "body_text": " **********President Bush tried to put his feet up, but President Gorbachev didn't join him. They never even took their coats off. Their cozy Saturday dinner and their Sunday stroll on deck were called because of rain. **********Mr. Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev came out of their waterlogged and businesslike summit sounding appropriately warm and fuzzy. But great rivalries do not become great alliances overnight. **********The angle may have been more oblique, but the darts continued to fly today between East and West. **********Perhaps White House officials were fed up with a year's worth of descriptions of Mr. Bush as cautious and Mr. Gorbachev as bold. **********Or maybe they were worried that their forced confinement overnight on the American cruiser Belknap, disrupting Saturday evening's schedule, had made them look foolish. **********Whatever the reason, the taunts from the White House began early. **********When Mr. Gorbachev refused to attend the session scheduled today on the American warship, advised by an admiral on the Soviet cruiser Slava that the waves in Marsaxlokk Bay were still too choppy to be safe, the Americans suggested that the Soviets were scaredy-cats. **********Asked if the White House was embarrassed that the truncated summit had been held only on the more stable liner Maxim Gorky, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, shot back, ''The only embarrassing part is that they don't want to come out to their own ship or our ship.'' **********For good measure, Mr. Fitzwater issued a press release painting his boss as the Captain Ahab of the Maltese storm: ''He loves the sea. The President made a final visit to the bridge and the aft deck of the ship about 10 last night. The President seemed energized by the intensity of the storm.''  Taunts and a Catch-22 **********The Soviet side taunted back. **********Told by a United States official of Mr. Bush's three attempts during Saturday's storm to board the Belknap from a barge, an operation in which a starboard ladder broke, Mr. Gorbachev remarked testily, ''Better teach your Navy how to repair.'' **********Mr. Bush wanted to visit the Slava today for a courtesy call, but Mr. Gorbachev refused. The Soviet leader offered a convoluted explanation, saying he did not want Mr. Bush to go to the Slava without full military honors and there could not be full military honors unless he was present, and he was not present because he was on the Maxim Gorky. **********Gennadi Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, told reporters on the Gorky that he was displeased by the American quarantine that had forced cancellation of his joint press briefing with Mr. Fitzwater on Saturday night. **********This meant that, for the first time, most of the press covering a summit failed to see even the two spokesmen. **********''I had a very big temptation to go into the press center to brief alone and get all of the publicity,'' Mr. Gerasimov. He said that after pressure from the Americans, ''I refrained.'' **********Perhaps the Soviet spokesman was angry that the Bush officials stuck on the ship, who prevailed on him not to brief, then sneakily dispatched their deputies on land to give background briefings in the press room. **********Mr. Gerasimov also took a shot at former President Reagan. Asked to compare the talks between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev with those between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, the Soviet said that Mr. Bush had left his ''thick reference book somewhere else, I guess on another ship.'' He was implying, as Bush officials have, that the current President is less tied to scripts than the last.  Waiting for George **********By all accounts, Mr. Gorbachev was also irritated by Mr. Bush's inability to get off his own vessel to come to dinner Saturday night. Before he learned of it, he was seen pacing the Maxim Gorky while waiting very impatiently for the President. **********In a scene reminiscent of ''Nighthawks,'' Edward Hopper's stark diner painting, Mr. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, sat in the luxury liner's gray lounge bar, the style of which was decribed by one member of the Soviet entourage as ''Socialist Deco.'' Mr. Gorbachev, who had decided to join the working dinner of diplomats, was elegantly dressed. The couple sipped coffee and waited for the President who would never come. **********When they learned that Mr. Bush was not coming, Mr. Gorbachev said impatiently in Russian, ''So what are we going to do now?'' Calming down, he joked to two correspondents of the British newspaper The Guardian, ''I guess I could swim over if I had to.''  Seasickness Prevention **********Despite talk that the sea had an energizing effect on the President, Mr. Bush emerged this morning from his captivity afloat wearing a small green patch behind each ear. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who had a virtually sleepless night, also wore one of the dime-sized patches. The medicated patches release scopalamine, a medication designed to prevent seasickness by stabilizing the liquid in the inner ear that controls balance. **********The Belknap's crewmen said that the storm had made for a rough night on board, with the cruiser swinging all night on its forward anchor and the crew working to prevent too much strain on the anchor.  'Mwarrrrrr,' Says Baker **********Secretary of State Baker is considered a master of press relations. **********At the first summit session, Mr. Baker displayed his confidence in his ability to ride herd on the press corps. **********As the security guards ushered out the pool of news reporters, Mr. Baker turned to the Soviet officials and did a perfect imitation of a herd of longhorn cattle from his native Texas. **********''Mwarrrrrr,'' he said, cocking his head at the departing journalists and cameramen, and laughing at his own wit. ''Mwarrrrrr.''  At Least Not 'Comrade' **********The President has often baffled reporters with his creative use of foreign names and titles, insisting on referring to ''the Lebanon'' and the Polish Solidarity leader as ''Lock'' Walesa. He did it again in Malta, referring to Mr. Gorbachev as ''Chairman.'' **********The more commonly used title is President, to indicate that Mr. Gorbachev is head of state. **********His formal title is ''Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,'' and ''Chairman'' is what the White House says Mr. Gorbachev wants to be called. Kremlinologists, less busy in these days of glasnost, can puzzle this out.  Yes, It Matters **********A final word on the cosmic meaning of the summit to the President of the United States: **********Reporter: ''We're glad it went well.'' The President: ''I think it did.''

Officials already are bracing themselves. **********The National People's Congress remains largely a rubber-stamp legislature, but in the last few years it has raised embarrassing questions and revealed disagreements before adding its rubber stamp. Dwindling public confidence in the Communist Party and in the economy are likely to provoke more questions than ever this year. **********''This is very natural,'' Li Yining, a prominent economist and delegate to the congress, said in an interview. ''It means China is opening up. People can say what they want.'' **********This year, however, the trends seem to be running in opposite directions. On the one hand, people seem increasingly willing to criticize the Government openly. On the other, the Government seems apprehensive that democracy will get out of hand, and its willingness to be criticized appears to be waning. **********Some Chinese officials say procedures at the Congress have been changed to make it more difficult for delegates to offer criticisms. Yang Zicai, a spokesman for the Congress, denied that any significant change in the procedures had been instituted so far, but he acknowledged that officials had not yet decided whether to allow open discussion of Government plans during full sessions. Last year such discussions were allowed and livened up the Congress considerably. **********''If a delegate has objections, he can always raise them through other channels,'' Mr. Yang said. Alternative channels include small group discussions and meetings of delegations, he said. **********Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist who is China's best-known dissident, said in an interview that ''this would be very bad'' for the development of democracy in China. ''This time the Congress is more strictly controlled than last year,'' he said. **********The official press has also published criticisms of a dissident call for amnesty of political prisoners, perhaps for fear that the topic will come up at the Congress. At least three delegates are among the 110 intellectuals who have publicly called for the amnesty, although it is not clear if they will try to raise the matter for discussion, or if they would be allowed to do so. **********In perhaps the harshest criticism of the calls for an amnesty, the official New China News Agency today implied that its proponents were unpatriotically trying to use foreign pressure to change Chinese policies. **********''The Chinese people suffered enough from foreign invasions,'' the article said. ''No foreigners are entitled to interfere with China's internal affairs.'' **********The nearly 3,000 delegates to the Congress range from top political leaders to peasants to opera singers. Most were elected by lower-level people's congresses under a system established and monitored by the Communist Party. While the Congress is nominally the highest governing body in China, in fact its power lies principally in the ability to raise questions and make proposals. **********Last year, for example, delegates presented 3,847 motions, all of which were referred to various departments in the Government. The delegates also made more than 100 revisions in the ''work report'' presented by Prime Minister Li Peng, including additions stressing the importance of education and agriculture. **********Many of the topics are mundane, but in a country where the political and economic agenda is set by top political leaders and then allowed to trickle down, the Congress is a rare opportunity for ideas to bubble up. Equally important, the delegates have the satisfaction of a significant audience: Not only are the nation's top leaders on the rostrum, but 166 foreign journalists and 450 mainland Chinese journalists have registered to cover the proceedings. **********A new element this year is that 13 of the journalists are from Taiwan. Because China deeply wants to impress Taiwan with its democratic spirit, their presence will add to the ambivalence among officials here: Should they tolerate criticism and show their commitment to democracy, or should they curtail debate and suggest that everyone is united behind the Government?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/10/world/5-latin-lands-end-talks-still-divided-over-rights.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 801, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5 Latin Lands End Talks Still Divided Over Rights", "print_headline": "5 Latin Lands End Talks Still Divided Over Rights", "body_text": " **********Officials from five Central American countries ended two days of talks here today still divided over steps to insure greater respect for democracy and human rights throughout the region. **********But the officials, who were preparing an agenda for a summit meeting of regional leaders next week in El Salvador, managed to resolve their differences over verifying the military aspects of a regional peace plan. **********While not disguising their disagreement over human rights, officials of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador called the meeting a success in a communique issued at the end of the talks. **********''We all have the same aim, which is to keep the peace process going forward,'' Guatemala's Deputy Foreign Minister, Ariel Rivera Irias, said at a news conference after the meeting.

Armacost, gave his first speech here, a toughly worded warning that Japan ''can no longer plead that the world should give it time to adjust'' in opening its markets to foreign goods. **********The speech marked a sharp contrast to the usually conciliatory comments offered by Mike Mansfield, who retired recently after serving as ambassador for 11 years. Mr. Mansfield regularly treated trade tensions as a side issue in the Japanese-American alliance. But Mr. Armacost -perhaps reflecting a new mood in Congress - balanced his praise of Japanese-American relations with warnings that trade disputes could overwhelm them. Economy Still Booming **********Both the discount-rate increase and Mr. Armacost's comments came amid new evidence that Japan's economic engine, which has been pumping out exports at record levels, is still in overdrive. The Government reported today that industrial production in the first quarter rose 3.1 percent, which was more than expected, and that the economy was nearing its peak productive capacity. **********Meanwhile, unemployment was reported at only 2.3 percent, reinforcing the Government's fear that a labor shortage could rekindle inflation in a country that has been basically inflation-free for much of the decade. **********Adding to Japan's political problems with the United States, the Finance Ministry reported that direct investment abroad by Japanese businesses rose 40.9 percent last year, to $47.02 billion, with the biggest increase - more than 45 percent -posted in North America. Direct investment in Japan by foreign corporations also surged last year by 47 percent, but amounted to only $3.2 billion. Many in Congress have been critical of Japan's investment patterns, maintaining that Japan is not as open to American investors. **********The announcement of the discount-rate increase appeared to be rife with contradictions about what prompted it. Japanese officials said they were worred about inflation, but added that domestic prices are stable. Satoshi Sumita, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said the increase was a ''precautionary measure.'' **********But analysts say the inflation fear is real. ''Most imports here are dollar-denominated,'' said Kenneth S. Courtis of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Ltd. ''So any increase in the dollar gets passed along quickly to consumers.'' **********Similarly, Japanese officials portrayed the increase as part of a coordinated plan by the Group of Seven, the industrialized countries that cooperate on financial policy. But Mr. Sumita and his aides would not say what, if anything, the other Group of Seven countries would do to act in unison. **********The Group of Seven consists of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Canada and Italy, as well as Japan. No Immediate Effect **********Business executives said the rate increase would have no immediate effect. Many companies arranged to borrow money in recent months at lower rates, and are holding cash for use later in the year. **********A big question now facing monetary officials is whether the United States and West Germany will also raise their rates. Officials of the West German Bundesbank are scheduled to meet on Thursday and may consider a change in its discount rate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-federal-express-picks-bbdo.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 611, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Federal Express Picks BBDO", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Federal Express Picks BBDO", "body_text": " **********THE Federal Express Corporation yesterday named BBDO, New York, to do the advertising for its new international air-express service, putting in place a major component in its effort to become a dominant force in that business. **********Neither the company nor the agency would discuss the advertising budget, but some industry executive expect Federal Express to spend $15 million to $25 million a year promoting the service. The Memphis-based company currently spends about $30 million a year advertising its domestic air-express service. Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis is Federal Express's domestic advertising agency. **********BBDO won the hotly contested account over six other ad agencies: Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos/Boston; N.W. Ayer; Backer Spielvogel Bates; Hal Riney & Partners; Warwick Advertising, and HDM/Los Angeles. Leo Burnett had earlier been involved in the account review, but removed itself from consideration because of a conflict with its other airline clients. **********''We saw creative presentations from half a dozen agencies and thought BBDO's was the best,'' said Carole A. Presley, the senior vice president of marketing and corporate communications at Federal Express. **********In May, Federal Express completed its $880 million acquisition of Tiger International, the parent company of the Flying Tiger Line, the world's largest air cargo carrier. It hopes that Flying Tiger's 39 planes and 6,500 employees will help it establish itself in the global overnight air delivery business. **********While Federal Express owns more than half the $10 billion domestic air courier market, the $5 billion to $6 billion international overnight market is dominated by DHL Worldwide Express. The desire of Federal Express to expand overseas is based in part on the slowing growth in the domestic air-express market, because facsimile machines have removed much of the air couriers' appeal to companies. **********Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman and chief executive of BBDO, New York, said the new advertising campaign would focus on Federal Express's ability ''to send a package from New York to Paris or anywhere else in the world,'' as well as on the importance of the Flying Tiger acquisition. **********He said the advertising would primarily be directed at corporate shipping managers. **********Because Fallon McElligott was not included in Federal Express's international account review, agency watchers have speculated that the company intends to consolidate all its work in the new agency. **********Ms. Presley, who refused to discuss any other aspects of Federal Express's advertising, dismissed the rumors. ''The fact is that the assignment we have given to BBDO is to generate U.S. export volume,'' she said. ''Fallon has our domestic business. No changes are contemplated.'' **********Steven A. Sjoblad, the president of Fallon McElligott, said Federal Express did not include his agency in the account review because ''we are chest-deep in producing a domestic corporate campaign for them.'' **********''The Flying Tiger acquisition cut into that, and they didn't want us to take our eyes off the ball,'' he added. **********''It's not unusual for a large company to have more than one agency,'' Mr. Sjoblad said. ''And these are large and complex pieces of business.'' **********Mr. Dusenberry said the issue of Federal Express's domestic business never arose in any of his discussions with the company. Nevertheless, he freely admitted his desire for it. **********''It was in the back of our minds,'' he said.

The company says it may have to file for protection under Federal bankruptcy laws because it does not have enough cash flow to service the bonds. **********Ezra Harel, 39 years old, the chairman and chief executive, was paid $1.2 million last year. Most of that came from a bonus for helping to arrange the sale of the AP Auto Parts chain, the foundation of the company and the only operation with significant profits. **********Money from that sale was spread around to numerous managers and directors, which is one reason the company has now run out of cash and failed to make the latest interest payment on the bond issue. **********All told, fees and bonuses to insiders from the sale of the auto parts operations ate up $5.2 million of the $37 million in cash received. AP also got some securities, which it is now trying to sell to raise cash. **********Mr. Harel, the sole shareholder, plans to move to Israel, while keeping his jobs, so the company is looking for a chief operating officer. **********The bonds, which sold at just above par in June 1986, last traded on the American Stock Exchange a few weeks ago at 23 percent of par value. The company wants bondholders to accept an offer of $79.55 in cash for each $1,000 bond, plus some stock in the company and a bond that will not pay cash interest. The package appears to be worth roughly $200 to $250. Hillel Peled, the company's treasurer, says talks were under way with bondholder representatives but would not give details. Representatives of the bondholders could not be reached for comment. **********Even including the interest they did receive, at 12.375 percent per year, bondholders seem likely to lose about half their original investment. That helps to explain why ''junk bond'' may be a more accurate term than ''high yield bond.'' **********''For horror stories about how lousy things can get for a bondholder, this is about as bad as you can get outside of bankruptcy,'' said John C. Boland, the publisher of Bankruptcy Values, a Baltimore-based newsletter for institutional investors. **********Others involved with the company did a lot better than the bondholders. Bear, Stearns & Company, as the bond underwriter, picked up $3 million in fees when the bonds were issued. It gathered $1.8 million more after the bonds were issued for its work in arranging takeovers and the divestiture of the auto parts operation. Uzi Zucker, a managing director of Bear, Stearns, served on AP's board until he quit in November. **********Mr. Zucker is on vacation and cannot be reached, a Bear, Stearns spokeswoman said. Mr. Peled, asked about the resignation, responded, ''The formal explanation was that he was very busy and had other obligations.'' He referred further inquiries on the subject to Mr. Zucker. **********When the auto parts operation was sold, to a leveraged buyout group organized by the Charterhouse Group, the British merchant banking firm, another director, Elie Housman, was part of the buying group and also received a $1 million brokerage fee from the company. **********Mr. Peled, in discussing the fees, said the company's financial problems were not so bad last August, when the auto parts operation was sold. ''The business plan called for a much earlier turnaround,'' he explained. **********Now, while the company could come up with more cash for its bondholders, Mr. Peled said, he thought the money was needed to help turn around operations. An electronics and metal components subsidiary, Nytronics, has been losing money at a rapid rate. Its franchise operations, Lee Myles transmission shops and Tuffy muffler and brake shops, are also in the red. Its Burruss hardwood floor and furniture subsidiary is profitable but not nearly enough to offset the others. **********All told, AP spent $81.6 million on buying subsidiaries, and so far has lost $43.8 million on them. What is more, each subsidiary has its own debts, with covenants that prevent any substantial amount of cash from being paid to the parent. **********AP says it has two options if the bondholders do not agree to the swap. The first, unsurprisingly, is to file for bankruptcy. But it is the other that is indicative of the era: it would gamble with the money it does have left, spending the cash and taking on new debt, to buy another company or two. The new debt would have first call on AP's assets, ahead of the current bondholders. **********With his record, could Mr. Harel really pull that off, even with aid from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the firm's new investment banker? Probably not. But a decade ago, no one would have thought to suggest it as an option. The fact it is considered now is one more piece of evidence of just how speculative the investment world has become."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/02/world/from-the-germans-50-years-later-cautious-remorse-and-an-old-rift.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1989-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 917, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "From the Germans 50 Years Later, Cautious Remorse and an Old Rift", "print_headline": "From the Germans 50 Years Later, Cautious Remorse and an Old Rift", "body_text": " **********West German leaders marked the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II today with the cautious blend of penitence and politics that has been a fixture in this period of Nazi-era anniversaries, and with a flare-up of the dispute over German-Polish relations. **********In a keynote address to a commemorative session of Parliament, Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed remorse for the vast destruction inflicted ''by Germans in the name of Germany'' and declared that the time had come for a ''lasting reconciliation'' with Poland, ''the first victim of the National Socialist war of racism and annihilation.'' **********But missing from Mr. Kohl's speech was an overt renunciation of territorial claims on Poland, a point that had prevented West German politicians from agreeing on a joint declaration. And balanced against the acceptance of German responsibility was a defense of Germans in the Nazi time as ''people of good will'' entangled in a ''diabolical net.'' No 'Hasty Judgments' **********The address illustrated the sensitive politics still inherent in any attempt by a German leader to examine the past. **********''Hitler had wanted, planned and unleashed the war,'' he declared. ''There was not and cannot be any doubt about that.'' **********But then he also said: ''We should beware of making hasty judgments from today's vantage point. Who among us can say with a good conscience that confronted with such evil, he would have summoned the strength to be a martyr?'' Still, the Polish Issue **********Mr. Kohl's handling of the Polish issue was viewed as the most troublesome by German commentators. West German-Polish relations have been the subject of summerlong debate, ranging from the scope of assistance Bonn should give Warsaw to the continuing bitterness among Germans from territories ceded to Poland at the end of the war. **********One focus of the debate has been the legal status of the German-Polish border, an arcane point of international law revived by right-wing politicians last spring. The conservatives have argued that the border is not final until a formal peace treaty is signed. Liberal politicians have retorted that acceptance of the border was implicit in the 1970 treaty reviving relations between Bonn and Warsaw. **********Behind the issue is the broader dispute over the conditions of a reconciliation between the West Germans and the Poles, both of whom have continued to nurture old resentments and prejudices, and the scope of financial assistance Bonn should extend to the fledgling democracy in Warsaw. Warsaw Trip Postponed **********The unresolved debate compelled Mr. Kohl to postpone a conciliatory trip he had hoped to make to Warsaw in July, and President Richard von Weizsacker abandoned efforts to attend ceremonies in Poland today marking the anniversary of the German attack that began the most destructive war in history. Mr. von Weizsacker was a soldier in the invading army, and one of his brothers was killed on the second day of hostilities. **********Mr. von Weizsacker fanned the dispute this week by declaring in a letter to Poland's President, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, that West Germany had renounced all its territorial claims on former German lands ceded to Poland after the war. **********The left-wing opposition in Parliament tried to include the formula in a joint anniversary declaration. But a motion to that effect was defeated by Mr. Kohl's center-right coalition today, and instead, Parliament passed the Chancellor's weaker pledge to follow the ''letter and spirit'' of the 1970 treaty establishing relations with Poland. **********Mr. Kohl also tried to strike a balance in his plea for reconciliation, acknowledging the horrors inflicted on the Poles, but adding that another ''part of the truth is the fact that over two million Germans perished as refugees or the expelled.'' Nazi Past Still an Issue **********The argument over Poland reflected both the continuing difficulties facing relations between Germans and Poles and, more broadly, the profound degree to which its Nazi past still figures in West German politics. **********Thus speeches by Mr. Kohl and other politicians, while adopting the penitent tone mandatory for such anniversary addresses, were also rich in the subtexts of ongoing political disputes. **********Willy Brandt, the former Chancellor and longtime Socialist, took aim in his address at conservatives who have sought to water down the Germans' repsonsibility for the war. **********''The war was not begun 'somehow' and by 'somebody,' not even only in the misused 'German name,' '' he declared, mimicking explanations sometimes heard on the right. ''Much can be said about shortsightedness after 1918, but the Hitler-German guilt stands without a doubt.'' East Germany Critical **********In East Germany, both the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland and Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer used the anniversary to lash out at West Germany for ''addiction to military profits and greed for social revanchism.'' East German denunciations of West Germany have increased over the flight of East Germans to the West through Hungary. **********In his address, Mr. Kohl declared that the anniversary of the war marked the emergence of Europe from the East-West conflict and that it revived hopes for German reunification. ''The disintegration of decades-old ossified structures in Europe prompts fresh hope of the unification of our fatherland,'' he declared."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-sara-lee-agrees-to-change-dessert-ads.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-09-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 195, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Sara Lee Agrees To Change Dessert Ads", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Sara Lee Agrees To Change Dessert Ads", "body_text": " **********The Sara Lee Corporation agreed yesterday to change the advertising for its ''light'' desserts to reflect the fact that their calorie content is not substantially lower than that of Sara Lee's regular desserts, the New York State Attorney General's office said. **********Attorney General Robert Abrams said the company, which is based in Chicago, had agreed to drop the use of the phrase ''light classics'' in the ads for the desserts and would not use the word light to describe a product unless it had two-thirds fewer calories than the regular product with which it is being compared. **********Sara Lee also agreed to reimburse eight of the nine states that filed the complaint $80,000 to cover the costs of their investigation.

And with appearance in mind, an increasing number of structures that went up in the real estate boom along Third Avenue in midtown in the 1950's and 1960's are being spruced up with new lobbies, facades, windows and other esthetic features. **********The 30-year-old office building at 750 Third Avenue, at 46th Street, for example, is undergoing a $7 million face lift in which a 48-foot-high glass atrium decorated with cascading plants and supported by granite columns has been carved out of parts of the second, third and fourth floors. The project, which started 18 months ago, is under the direction of the Manhattan architectural firm of Haines, Lundberg & Waehler. **********In addition to new sidewalks and the planting of new honey maple trees in front of the 34-story building, due for next spring, the owners have installed new security monitors, modernized the air-conditioning system and elevators and caulked and scrubbed the exterior. **********The building has 15 tenants occupying its 672,000 square feet of office space, with McCann-Erickson Worldwide, the advertising agency, as the main tenant. **********The building is one of five midtown properties owned by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, which with its companion organization, the College Retirement Equities Fund, has $3.7 billion of its $80 billion in assets invested in 281 separate properties around the country. The two groups have about a million members in the nation's educational institutions. **********''The renovation of 750 Third Avenue reflects T.I.A.A.'s commitment to provide quality space to our office tenants,'' said Stan Sledz, senior vice president of the organization, which has its national headquarters in the neighboring building at 730 Third Avenue, one block south. **********Yet some leasing experts say the big reason for such renovations is competition for tenants in a sour market, a situation compounded not only by a tender local economy but also by a slew of new midtown office buildings offering more amenities than many older structures. **********Indeed, said one expert, Benjamin Fox, many buildings that went up in the East Side boom 30 years ago ''were paste-up jobs made from flimsy materials, and architecturally dreary as well.'' **********''At that time it was considered utilitarian architecture, which might have been all right then,'' Mr. Fox said, ''but today it is the sort of style that many corporate clients find not particularly pleasing esthetically, and thus unsuitable.'' Mr. Fox is executive vice president of New Spectrum Realty Services Inc., a leasing agency for midtown office space. **********''Increasingly, tenants choose buildings for appearance because they want their clients thinking positively when they walk in - esthetics helps business - and only then do they consider location and the state of the mechanical systems such as the air-conditioning and the windows,'' he added. **********His comments were echoed by Faith Consolo, senior vice president of Garrick Aug Associates, another East Side agency, who asserted pointedly: ''Let's face it: In order to stay competitive in a bad market the owners have to spruce up their properties. The owners of a lot of older buildings with leases running out are suddenly finding themselves competing with schmaltzy new buildings such as Trump Plaza so they have to call in the architects and renovate.'' **********One Manhattan architect who specializes in the renovation of commercial properties is Der Scutt, who said he has undertaken seven such projects in the last two years. **********''Right now we are renovating the ugliest building in America, 575 Lexington Avenue,'' Mr. Scutt said, reprising remarks often made about the 36-story structure that went up in 1958 at the corner of 51st Street. **********The building has been regarded by many as an East Side eyesore, mainly because the original gold-colored aluminum cladding unexpectedly weathered to a bilious shade of yellow that blotched in places. The owners, Koeppel & Koeppel, a New York real estate investment firm, are spending $18 million to dress the structure with a new bronze cladding, while upgrading the elevators and storefronts and rebuilding the lobby. **********''We also found that many of the original windows leaked badly because their gaskets were loose, which made them energy-inefficient and let in street noise as well as rain,'' Mr. Scutt said. ''So they too are being replaced.'' **********He added, however, that some of his renovations had been for the purpose of restoring facades because current owners now realize that the original, esthetically pleasing appearance of their buildings, changed for the worse over the years, is becoming more attractive to potential tenants."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/09/world/bush-urged-to-find-a-middle-course-on-soviet-changes.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1989-04-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1546, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSH URGED TO FIND A MIDDLE COURSE ON SOVIET CHANGES", "print_headline": "BUSH URGED TO FIND A MIDDLE COURSE ON SOVIET CHANGES", "body_text": " **********Administration experts have advised President Bush to steer a middle course between a skeptical approach to the policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and some bold initiatives of his own, Administration officials said today. **********The recommended approach, called ''status-quo plus'' by Government specialists, is outlined in a classified analysis commissioned by President Bush as part of the Administration's broad review of American-Soviet policy. **********The analysis - prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Pentagon and the staff of the National Security Council - concludes that the process of change in the Soviet Union is likely to continue throughout the Bush Administration even if Mikhail S. Gorbachev is replaced by another Soviet leader, officials said. High-Level Skepticism **********Mr. Bush, Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, and Robert M. Gates, the deputy security adviser, have tended to take a skeptical stance toward Moscow. At the same time, some experts have complained that this approach is too cautious at a time of momentous change in the Soviet Union and could cost the Administration what they see as a critical opportunity to transform American-Soviet relations. **********''The real debate in the Administration will be between the two centrist positions - the stand-pat school and the seize-the-opportunity school,'' said Representative Les Aspin, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. **********Administration specialists say the classified analysis submitted to the White House tries to strike a balance between these two approaches. Anti-Terrorism Stressed **********The analysis advises the President to take advantage of the changes in Soviet domestic and foreign policy by carefully seeking to broaden the dialogue between the superpowers on regional issues to include such regions as the Horn of Africa. It also recommends giving more prominence to joint efforts to combat terrorism and the spread of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles, among other initiatives. **********Administration specialists define the approach as an ''evolution'' of the current United States policy toward Moscow, which they say has been successful. But the analysis is likely to disappoint critics who favor more dramatic moves to improve relations. **********It is not known what Mr. Bush thinks of the study, which is about 30 pages long. **********One senior Administration official who supports the review said it was unclear how influential the study would be, adding that policy decisions were more likely to be thrashed out among Mr. Bush and a small circle of high-level advisers. **********''The analysis presented to the N.S.C. could be a valuable tool,'' another official said. ''But the vision in there is not articulated very strongly, and there are plenty of caveats and what-ifs in there. Until that vision is there and somebody is pushing from the top very strongly, it is not clear whether we will really take advantage of the opportunities.'' **********Final decisions on what policies to adopt on American-Soviet relations will be made by Mr. Bush and his top aides. But some initiatives discussed in the study have already been taken up by the Administration. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, for instance, broached the idea of American-Soviet cooperation on terrorism in his meeting last month in Vienna with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. **********Mr. Baker also announced in Vienna that the United States would explore the idea of speeding up the withdrawal of chemical weapons from West Germany, a idea developed during the review. **********In addition, the Administration has pressed Moscow to cut off arms deliveries to Nicaragua, which is discussed in the classified review. **********Administration officials involved in the analysis said Soviet willingess to cut arms supplies to Managua represented an opportunity to test Moscow's intention to cooperate in regional settlements in the third world. **********The study of Soviet policy, known as National Security Review 3, is but one of several policy reviews ordered by Mr. Bush as soon as he took office to ''insure compatibility among our commitments, strategies, capabilities and resources.'' Complaints About Pace **********Soviet officials have complained about the slow pace of the Administration's review, which has delayed a resumption of the talks to cut long-range nuclear arms. But Mr. Bush has defended the need for a careful review as a foundation for policy decisions. **********While the review of Soviet policy is well advanced, other assessments are proceeding slowly. **********Senior Administration officials reviewing arms control policy met for the first time on Wednesday - one month before Mr. Baker is to go to Moscow to discuss the resumption of the strategic arms talks. **********The arms control review, formally called National Security Review 14, focuses on strategic arms questions. Issues to be considered in the review include whether to modify or abandon the proposed limit on nuclear delivery systems, whether to ban mobile missiles with multiple warheads and whether to adjust the American proposal for counting cruise missiles launched by airplanes. **********A parallel review on military issues known as National Security Review 12 is being overseen by Paul D. Wolfowitz, Mr. Bush's choice to be Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. But Administration officals report that the review is proceeding slowly. Analysis in Two Parts **********The classified analysis submitted to the White House consists of two main parts: an analysis of trends in the Soviet Union and a section on American policy toward Moscow. The first draft of the section on Soviet trends was prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency while the first draft on American policy toward Moscow was prepared by the State Department. Comments were solicited by other agencies and the report was completed last month. **********The analysis of Soviet trends asserts that there is a better than even chance that Mr. Gorbachev will endure as the Soviet leader. It acknowledges that the political and economic changes made since he took office are substantial but notes that it will take decades to carry out some important changes, particularly in the economy. **********The study argues that Moscow's preoccupation with political and economic change will probably continue through Mr. Bush's term in office, even if Mr. Gorbachev is replaced as Soviet leader. But officials concede that Mr. Gorbachev's departure could affect the pace and scope of change. **********The study says there is broad support for the view that change is needed to help the Soviet Union modernize its economy and society. Even if Mr. Gorbachev is replaced, Moscow will face pressures to divert resources to civilian needs from military activities. Soviet Intentions Unknown **********The analysis sidesteps the question of what Moscow's ultimate intentions may be, suggesting that they cannot be known now. **********It says the changes may be carried out for tactical reasons to gain a ''breathing space'' to strengthen the Soviet system and thus prepare for further competition with the West. Or it may represent more fundamental political and economic changes in the direction of a pluralistic society. **********Critics of the ''status-quo plus'' approach say that it underestimates the importance of Mr. Gorbachev role, is too sanguine about the inevitabilty of change in Mr. Gorbachev's absence and is too cautious in advocating moves to take advantage of immediate opportunities to improve American-Soviet relations. **********But defenders of the approach argue that it provides a basis for undertaking initiatives, albeit cautiously, in the face of uncertainties as to Mr. Gorbachev's future. **********''Our argument is that we should not base policy on whether Gorbachev will survive or not,'' an Administration official said. ''We should base it on U.S. interests. Since we don't have to be too worried about Gorbachev's survivability, we do not have to shrink from putting forth initiatives.'' **********Some Administration officials, such as Mr. Gates, the deputy security adviser, have publicly presented a somewhat different analysis that questions the breadth of support in the Soviet Union for far-reaching change. Horn of Africa Cited **********The ''status-quo plus'' approach says that the United States should seek to broaden the agenda of regional issues to include such disputes as the fighting between Ethiopia and Somalia in the Horn of Africa. **********It recommends that the United States give more prominence to joint efforts to combat terrorism by sharing information and asking Moscow to put pressure on client states to stop supporting terrorist groups and to combat the spread of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. **********The report notes that strong differences remain to be resolved within the Administration on trade. Some Commerce Department officials favor a more liberal trade policy, but the Pentagon strongly opposes increased trade. Officials say the predominant view in the Administration favors a gradual liberalization in trade. **********Washington should continue to press for human rights improvement in the Soviet Union, the report says. **********The analysis, though advocating a cautious process of advancing initiatives, projects a long-term goal in which there would be a truce in the military competition between the superpowers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/16/world/a-latin-peace-plan-not-so-broad-ball-in-nicaragua-s-court.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1989-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1330, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "An Analysis; News Analysis", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Latin Peace Plan Not So Broad: Ball in Nicaragua's Court", "print_headline": "A Latin Peace Plan Not So Broad: Ball in Nicaragua's Court", "body_text": " **********By forcing anti-Sandinista rebels out of their Honduran base camps in return for free elections in Nicaragua, a meeting of Central American presidents has brought the focus of the region's peace process back where it started: the battle over the future of Nicaragua. **********In two days of intense, sometimes bitter meetings, the five Presidents largely gave up the idea that a broad framework for peace could be stretched to fit their contrasting political conflicts. Instead, they settled for a far more specific, less idealistic accord: the ratification of what is essentially a bilateral agreement aimed directly at Nicaragua and the web of political and military complexities that surround it. **********Not only was the final agreement unsuitable as a broader formula for regional peace on the model of the so-called Arias peace plan of 1987, but it also took shape along the most traditional lines of self-interest - as a hard-headed deal between two nations seeking to rid themselves of a common problem, in this case the contras. The plan was named for the President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez. **********Although the accord contains no direct mechanism for dismantling the contra camps, it commits the five Presidents to formulate a plan within 90 days that would accomplish that. 'Problem for Everybody' **********''With military aid gone, the contras have become a problem for everybody,'' said one diplomat who was involved in the talks. ''The Hondurans want them out as badly as the Sandinistas do.'' **********As preparations for the summit were being made, the issue of contras was out of direct view. Instead, diplomats couched their strategies in terms of a universal effort to police the Arias plan - which calls for guarantees of noninterference among regional states, talks between opposing parties, and respect for free elections and human rights, in the belief that peace will follow the growth of democracy. **********And foreign ministers who met to prepare the way for the summit talks reached agreement last week on a plan to use ''mobile units'' of United Nations observers from Spain, Canada and West Germany to enforce the so-called security provisions of the Arias plan. Those provisions prohibit the signers from supporting insurgent groups in other Central American countries, or allowing their territory to be used for that purpose by outside powers. **********But the summit meeting ran aground in the far rougher waters of the Arias plan's political provisions, where the Presidents failed to a find a general plan for verification and enforcement that would be intrusive enough to force democratic change in Nicaragua without making life intolerable for the powerful military and right-wing interests in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Accepted by All Parties **********If that uneven objective smacks of a double standard, it was nevertheless understood and accepted by all parties to the summit - including Sandinista leaders themselves, who acquiesced and even led the way toward the agreement that emerged. **********The emphasis on Nicaragua's compliance with democratic goals was, in part, a result of its isolation among Central American states. As the odd man out in regional politics, the Nicaraguan Government was simply outnumbered - with little ability to keep its internal politics out of the general debate, or to force others to accept the same scrutiny that it endured. **********But also evident was the enormous power of American policy to set the terms of Central American debate. Although the Reagan Administration was not able, in eight years of political and military conflict, to unseat the Sandinistas, it nevertheless succeeded in making democratic changes inside Nicaragua the litmus test of any Central American peace plan - whether or not the same standard was applied throughout the region. **********That political reality was abundantly apparent to otherwise neutral parties like Mr. Arias, who came to the meeting seeking changes inside Nicaragua to save the peace plan that bears his name. Complaint of Sandinistas **********But it was also recognized by the Sandinistas, who have long complained that American conservatives are so implacably hostile to them that steps they make toward democracy and human rights will always be misinterpreted or diminished. By the time the meeting was held, the burden of proof on the Sandinistas was so high that, ironically, they themselves became the most ardent advocates of tough verification of the Arias plan's political provisions. **********Faced with a worsening economy, the Nicaraguan Government began an all-out campaign to win what Sandinista officials have openly referred to as a ''seal of approval'' that would disarm their critics and, they hope, open the way to renewed economic and commercial ties with the United States, including the lifting of the American trade embargo. **********The sincerity of the Sandinistas' turn toward political pluralism - which they defend as a long-standing goal made impossible during the war - remains a subject of considerable skepticism among the regional diplomats. But the force of their diplomatic proposals was never in doubt. **********In a verification scheme drafted by Miguel D'escoto Brockmann, the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister, the Sandinista Government proposed an elaborate set of measures, including the use of international human rights observers and official reports every three months as a way of verifying the political provisions. A Concession From Nicaragua **********When countries like El Salvador, where the Government had little to gain from such a cold shower of enforced democracy, refused to go along, the Sandinistas agreed to allow the pretense of a multilateral pact to drop altogether, accepting intrusive political demands that are directed at them alone. **********The concession was less dramatic than it might once have been because many Sandinista officials believe they would have been forced to take such measures in any event in order to produce the national consensus necessary to repair their shattered economy. And the deal was clenched when the political steps were paired with agreement on the dismantling of the contra bases in Honduras - something the Sandinistas had proposed to Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo in Caracas at the inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela earlier this month. **********Although most analysts in Central America and in the United States believe that the contras were largely a dead issue any way, the final act of disbanding their remaining troops in Honduras has been a near obsession for Sandinista leaders, and it also loomed as a crucial issue for President Azcona of Honduras, who reportedly had been waiting in vain for a clear signal of intent from Washington about the disposition of its former clients. **********While the practical value of the resulting agreement has yet to be proved, either in Honduras or Nicaragua, its political logic is so powerful that even those who came up with the short end of the stick are proclaiming victory. **********The Sandinistas were able to trumpet, in a banner headline in their official newspaper, that they administered a ''Coup de Grace to the War.'' Honduras can claim to have pried loose the free Nicaraguan elections, and President Arias's reputation as a peacemaker will remain intact. Even some contra leaders claimed victory, asserting that theirs was a voluntary withdrawal, made in triumph after forcing the Sandinista regime to submit. **********But in a region that remains torn with violence and conflict far removed from the waning contra war, such an efficient diplomatic achievement also highlights the lack of a similar agreement on region-wide mechanisms of peace. And with the broader means for verifying Central American democracy as far from reach as ever, the deeper legacy of the El Salvador meeting may not be what it accomplished, but what it left undone."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/27/world/after-noriega-united-nations-cuba-asks-council-for-action-on-us.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1989-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 611, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After Noriega: United Nations; CUBA ASKS COUNCIL FOR ACTION ON U.S.", "print_headline": "After Noriega: United Nations; CUBA ASKS COUNCIL FOR ACTION ON U.S.", "body_text": " **********Cuba called today for an urgent meeting of the Security Council to hear its complaint that American forces in Panama have surrounded the ambassador's residence there and are harassing its diplomats. **********In a letter to the President of the council, Cuba complained that the officer commanding the American forces surrounding the residence this morning contradicted assurances given earlier by State Department officials in Washington and said he still has orders to arrest any Cuban diplomat trying to leave and prevent anyone from entering. **********The letter said American combat vehicles and troops moved into place around the ambassador's residence early on Sunday morning, blocking the movement of Cuban diplomatic staff and carrying out ''various acts of harassment and psychological warfare.''

No special message, except to pray.

But he said nothing, but dealt only with pastoral concerns. **********These are bitter times here in what Zambians call the copper belt near the Zaire border. Copper accounts for nearly all of the country's exports, but as supplies shrink fast, mines are closing and unemployment is reaching 70 percent in places. **********With export earnings roughly half what they were 15 years ago, Zambia's foreign exchange is scarce, and so is the money available for necessary imports of food, clothing and medicine.

Joseph Chalwe, said people take heart from such messages. ''There is very little that is being done to help,'' Father Chalwe said. ''For young people coming out of school to find employment is quite difficult. But the Pope's visit creates hope that in the future to come we may overcome this.'' **********Mr. Phiri agreed, although he said he knew nothing about economics.

Goldin, the Comptroller of New York City, who is the trustee of the city pension funds and a spokesman for a group of institutional investors, Exxon's president, Lee R. Howard, also said the board would establish a special committee on environmental matters that would review corporate activities, ''including their effects on the environment and worker safety and health.'' **********The Exxon board has 14 members, 5 of them Exxon executives. The special committee would be drawn from the other 9. Aftermath of the Spill **********The actions represent Exxon's first concessions to environmentalists not directly involved in the cleanup of a huge oil spill that occurred after an Exxon tanker, the Exxon Valdez, ran aground in Prince William Sound off the coast of Alaska March 24. The ruptured tanker released more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into the sound. **********The Bush Administration took its own steps yesterday in reaction to the Alaska oil spill, proposing legislation that would establish a Federal fund to pay for cleaning up spills.  [ Page D2. ]  The Exxon move is also a significant development in a trend in which institutional investors like pension funds and foundations are taking a more active role in governing the corporations whose stock they hold. Previously such investors tended to simply sell their holdings when they were displeased with a company's management. **********The pension fund investors also asked that the company spend more on environmental research and the prevention of spills, and that it consult with employees before drug and alcohol policies were changed. Exxon said in its letter that it was already doing such things and would continue to do so. **********Mr. Goldin, who is a candidate for Mayor of New York, said of Exxon's action yesterday: ''This is a rather extraordinary development. It represents a company response to shareholders that is salutary, in the public interest and in the enlightened self-interest of the company.'' **********Several corporate governance experts said the decision to appoint someone with an environmental background was an especially significant step. **********''It's pretty big,'' said Peg O'Hara, director of the corporate governance service at the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group financed by institutional investors. ''Companies always say that shareholders can make recommendations, but institutional investors say that the recommendations disappear into a hole.'' **********It was known that Exxon had met twice with the big investors but their demands had not been made public. Exxon's decision to make concessions, especially coming after its meetings with institutional investors became known, ''is fairly unusual,'' Ms. O'Hara said. **********Another corporate governance expert, Ira M. Millstein, agreed that the Exxon decision was significant. ''Many American corporations are beginning to recognize that responsiveness to major institutional shareholders is something that may be coming in the future,'' said Mr. Millstein, a lawyer, who is the chairman of the board of advisers of the Institutional Investor Project at Columbia University. The project tries to promote communication between executives and investors. **********Mr. Millstein said the Exxon announcement was ''a major example of that kind of dialogue.'' The Texaco Case **********The group that helped arrange the meetings with Exxon, the Council of Institutional Investors, had previously negotiated an agreement with Texaco Inc. that put a council representative on Texaco's board. The investors submitted a list of candidates to Texaco's management, which chose one to nominate. The investors also persuaded Texaco management to agree to weaken anti-takeover defenses. **********The Texaco action came when the company was under bankruptcy protection and in a battle for corporate control with Carl C. Icahn, the takeover specialist and chairman of Trans World Airlines. The institutional investors were concerned about the effect that Texaco's actions in the takeover fight might have on the value of their stock. **********In the Exxon case, however, no fight over corporate control was involved. Sarah Teslik, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said, ''Although these institutional investors were large, their combined holdings were not such that they could talk rudely to Exxon.'' **********The investors held 22 million shares, or about 1.7 percent of the 1.3 billion shares outstanding. They were not in a position to prevent the election of Exxon directors, all of whom are up for election, or deny the corporation a quorum at its annual meeting, which is scheduled for next Thursday in Parsippany, N.J. Investors Are Organized **********Mr. Goldin, a co-founder of the Council of Institutional Investors, wrote to Exxon shortly after the Valdez spill to request a meeting. At the time, he was one of three co-chairmen of the group, with Ray Sweeney, of the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association, and Gray Davis, the State Comptroller in California and trustee of the California Public Employees Retirement System. **********In a telephone interview last night, Mr. Davis said that Mr. Goldin ''deserves the lion's share of the credit'' for leading the investors and persuading Exxon to make concessions. ''He was clearly the point person,'' Mr. Davis said. **********He characterized the Exxon agreement as a major development in the process of institutional investors becoming more active. **********Mr. Davis said his $46 billion fund, which owns 7.8 million shares of Exxon, might still withhold its votes from management. ''Exxon should not profit from its own gross negligence,'' said Mr. Davis, who contended that the increases in gasoline prices on the West Coast after the spill would bring Exxon more money than it is spending to clean up the spill. **********Other pension funds represented in the Exxon meetings were the New Jersey Division of Investments and the Massachusetts retirement fund. Criteria for a Board Member **********Under the Exxon agreement, the management will select a candidate for the board ''with a background in environmental matters who also meets the longstanding criteria for election to the board.'' **********Those criteria include a provision that the candidate ''be, or have been, the manager of a relatively complex organization: e.g., a company, university, foundation, or a unit of government; or, in a professional or scientific capacity, be accustomed to dealing with complex problems.'' **********Exxon said that, with the accord announced yesterday, only one major stockholder, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, still plans to deny its votes to Exxon management."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/13/business/company-news-transamerica-to-buy-criterion.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 194, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Transamerica To Buy Criterion", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Transamerica To Buy Criterion", "body_text": " **********The Transamerica Corporation, the San Francisco-based financial services company, has agreed to buy the Criterion Group Inc., an investment management company in Houston, for $13 a share, or $94.3 million, in cash.

''A younger generation should take charge, so that people cannot say that it is I who decides everything. If they come to me and ask for advice, then I will give it, but this should not be a common occurrence.'' **********Mr. Deng did not say when he would retire, however, and one of the officials was skeptical that he would really leave his only remaining formal position, the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission of both the Government and the Communist Party. **********Moreover, even if Mr. Deng does resign from that position, he could still control important decisions by virtue of his status as the dominant personality in both the military and in civilian affairs. It was Mr. Deng and elderly colleagues, for example, who arranged the military crackdown last month, even though they now no longer serve on either the Central Committee or in the Politburo. Still the Central Figure **********In past years Mr. Deng from time to time indicated that he would withdraw from the ruling circle, but in the end he was persuaded by others or by himself that he was still needed. Almost all Chinese and foreign analysts think that so long as Mr. Deng is alive and alert he will be the ultimate arbiter of China's political process. **********Full retirement by Mr. Deng might prove an important step toward a transition to younger leaders, those who won their reputations after the Communists took power in 1949 rather than before. **********For most of the last decade, Mr. Deng has seemed to be struggling between his desire to achieve that transition and his tendency to intervene whenever those whom he has installed as his successors do things that irritate him. Zhao Ziyang, who was dismissed as Communist Party General Secretary last month, was the latest heir-apparent to be ousted. Disclosure Made in June **********Mr. Deng made the announcement that he would resign in a talk on June 13, and it was circulated among high-level officials this month. All three officials interviewed had independent and first-hand knowledge of the speech, but they were recalling the wording from memory and acknowledged that it might not be exactly correct. **********They said that the fundamental reason for Mr. Deng's announcement was to separate himself from policy-making and show the world that China did not depend on his presence. **********''Foreigners pay a great deal of attention to the question of whether I live or die,'' two of the officials quoted Mr. Deng as saying. ''This is not a good situation.'' **********Many party officials had thought Mr. Deng would retire after his talks with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in April, in the first Sino-Soviet summit meeting in 30 years. But during the meeting Mr. Zhao's differences with Mr. Deng and other leaders came into the open, beginning the political crisis that led to the purge of Mr. Zhao and the use of military force to crush the democracy movement. Possible Retirement Dates **********There are several occasions Mr. Deng might use to make his retirement effective. One would be the commemoration on Oct. 1 of 40 years of Communist rule in China, and another might be the National People's Congress session in March and April next year. A third would be the next meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee, probably later this year. **********However, one official said the Central Military Commission would probably elect a new chairman by itself. There appear to be two candidates to succeed Mr. Deng as chairman of the Central Military Commission: President Yang Shangkun, who is also vice chairman of the commission, and Jiang Zemin, who was appointed last month to succeed Mr. Zhao as party general secretary. **********While Mr. Deng still seems to make the most important decisions in China, he is said to work only about two hours each day, in his large courtyard home in the Di'anmen District of Beijing. Much of the rest of his time is spent playing with his grandchildren or indulging in his passion for playing bridge. **********Mr. Zhao is still living in his home in the park-like Zhongnanhai Compound, where most Chinese Government leaders live and work, in what seems to be a relatively lenient form of house arrest. He is allowed to receive guests, and reportedly has received many, but he is followed when he leaves the house and would presumably be stopped if he attempted to leave Zhongnanhai without permission. **********Mr. Zhao was allowed to speak in his own defense at the Central Committee meeting called last month to oust him, and he has not written a self-criticism. His rivals would like a self-criticism or other formal judgment against Mr. Zhao, to reduce the risk that he will return to power. **********Hu Qili, the other ousted Politburo member, and Yan Mingfu, another top Party official who had been sympathetic to student demonstrators and suffered demotion because of it, both wrote self-criticisms that have been circulated in high party circles, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/30/business/treasury-official-seen-as-choice-for-fed-seat.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1989-11-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Official Seen As Choice for Fed Seat", "print_headline": "Treasury Official Seen As Choice for Fed Seat", "body_text": " **********David W.

As a result, he might be expected to concentrate on the Fed's regulatory responsibilities.

[ Obituary, Page B11. ]  Ayatollah Khomeini had long been ill, and the political struggle to succeed him had been under way for months. His death, which was announced early this morning in Iran, further weakened the leadership of one of the Middle East's largest and most populous nations and left much of the world uncertain about Iran's domestic and foreign policies. Hostages' Fate Involved **********Such questions as to whether Iran will seek to restore its former close ties to the West are crucial, but the answers that will emerge from the coming debate are far from clear. The fate of the American and other hostages being held in Lebanon by supporters of Iran may also hinge on the outcome of the debate, experts said. **********The 89-year-old Ayatollah Khomeini was a larger-than-life figure in the Iranian political scene and among Shiite adherents in Lebanon. It will be very difficult - if not impossible - for lesser political clergymen to attain his kind of pre-eminence. **********Neither President Khamenei - who has firmly allied himself with the wing of the clergy that favors less ideologically extreme policies - nor any of the other principal contenders for power possess the high religious distinction acquired by Ayatollah Khomeini over 60 years of political struggle. **********The Ayatollah is referred to as a Marjeh, or authority in Islamic affairs, a status that no one who is active on the Iranian political scene can claim today. **********The other leading figures in Iranian politics - the Speaker of Parliament, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and the Ayatollah's son, Ahmad Khomeini -like President Khamenei, are clerics of a lower religious rank, that of hojatolislam. As such they have modest, splintered followings among the faithful. 'Looking at End of Era' **********''We are looking at the end of an era with the successors jockeying for power until they consolidate themselves and are sure they will survive,'' said Baqer Moin, a London-based Iranian author of a coming biography of the Ayatollah. **********One clear danger facing Iran is that the Ayatollah's authority acted as cement for various factions of the clergy that have been alllowed to advocate clashing political objectives beneath his watchful gaze. He acted as final arbitrer, favoring hard-liners at some times and pragmatists at others. **********All accepted his judgment, an authority that President Khamenei is unlikely to have soon. Furthermore, the Ayatollah's death came a few weeks before a crucial referendum that will significantly change the country's Constitution. **********As they stand now, these changes, which include the institution of a strong executive presidency and the abolition of the prime minister's position, may dilute the deeply fundamentalist nature of government that Ayatollah Khomeini imposed on the country. **********''The Iranian revolution is at a stage where the role of the clergy will become increasingly marginal in the sense that they will be politicians wearing turbans rather than clergymen conducting politics,'' said Fahmy Howeidi, a prominent syndicated writer and expert in Islamic and Iranian affairs who is based in Cairo. Recent Policies Gyrated **********The legacy of Ayatollah Khomeini is more complicated by the fact that just before his death, his policies gyrated wildly from the hard line he had advocated against the West, Iraq and whatever he perceived as an enemy of Islam or a threat to Iranian independence. **********After accepting a cease-fire with Iraq last year, helping in the release of Western hostages held in Beirut and making tentative openings to the West, the Ayatollah authorized advocates of sterner anti-Western policies to return to the fore. **********Senior aides reverted to death calls against those seen as Western enemies of Muslims and Islam ranging from the British writer Salman Rushdie to nations that support Israel's armed supression of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********Pushing the hard line further, the Ayatollah and senior aides, led by his son Ahmad, forced out his designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, in March. **********The result has been to create divisions between advocates of relatively more liberal domestic and foreign policies and those who call for more militancy. Rafsanjani's Chances Favored **********Iran's Oil Minister, Gholamreza Agazadeh, appeared today to endorse the view that from this coming struggle, Parliament Speaker Rafsanjani is likely to come out ahead. **********Hojatolislam Rafsanjani has been the prime candidate to be elected president in August, and Mr. Agazadeh said at an OPEC meeting here that since the post of prime minister will be abolished, Hojatolislam Rafsanjani would be given wide latitude as chief executive. **********''Mr. Rafsanjani as a person with great popularity will be most suitable for candidate for the post of president,'' Mr. Agazadeh said. ''There may be other candidates, but none will approach Mr. Rafsanjani in stature.'' **********Critics of the Teheran ruling clergy however, said that despite his ouster, Ayatollah Montazeri remains a potent, if now silent, figure in Iranian politics, especially as he has emerged in the guise of a champion of civil liberties. **********''He certainly still has a role to play,'' said Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, a former Iranian President, said in an interview today. Need for Moderate Course Seen **********Other experts on Iranian affairs said that after a time, elements in the regime like President Khamenei and the assembly of 83 experts that picked him, as well as his ally Hojatolislam Rafsanjani, may have to steer the country toward more mainstream policies again, if for no other reasons than dire economic need and the sheer exhaustion of the population from 10 years of war, revolution and struggle. **********Seasoned students of Middle East revolutions cautioned, however, that before getting there Iran will drift further toward hostile policies. **********''It is in the nature of revolutions at such early stages to head for more closure, more militancy,'' said Mohammed Hassanein Heikal, a prominent author and historian who has visited Iran and is one of a handful of writers who held long meetings with Ayatollah Khomeini. **********Iranian experts like former President Bani-Sadr said that while this is so, ultimately the ruling clergy in Iran will simply fail to deliver any coherent system of government. **********''The only thing they can deliver is a total impasse,'' he said today. ''A no-war, no-peace situation with Iraq, a paralysed economy and laws that are not there. In the end, I think it will all lead to the death of dictatorship.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/08/business/company-news-german-company-may-seek-scherer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-02-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 133, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "German Company May Seek Scherer", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; German Company May Seek Scherer", "body_text": " **********A West German concern that holds a 6.8 percent stake in the R.

Voell, Rockefeller's president and chief executive, said Mitsubishi would pay $846 million in cash for a 51 percent interest. The proceeds will go into the family trusts established by John D. Rockefeller Jr. in 1934 and be used to diversify the family's holdings. **********The deal, which comes almost exactly 50 years after Rockefeller Center opened on Nov. 1, 1939, is only the latest instance of the Japanese buying a vital piece of the American landscape, from Hollywood to Wall Street. In September, the Sony Corporation bought Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion. **********David Rockefeller, the company's chairman, said in a statement that the agreement ''preserves the abiding commitment to Rockefeller Center and New York City which my father made more than 50 years ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel.'' There has been talk that the 88 Rockefeller descendants, all beneficiaries of the 1934 trusts, had wanted to take advantage of high Manhattan property values and turn their stakes into cash. 'Nobody's Cashing Out' **********Asked in a telephone interview yesterday afternoon whether the Rockefeller Group was selling because some of the family might want cash, Mr. Rockefeller replied, ''Nobody's cashing out.'' **********The sale to the Japanese came as no surprise in real estate circles. People close to the deal said in mid-September that to give the Rockefellers more ready cash, the family was trying to raise as much as $1 billion. **********Jotaro Takagi, president of Mitsubishi Estate, said: ''There is no business address in the world that has the same cachet as Rockefeller Center. It is synonymous with excellence. We are making this investment with the objective of continuing this tradition into the 21st century, sharing with the Rockefeller family the vision of the center as a very special place in New York City, and of the city itself as a world capital of business and culture.'' **********Since the 1930's, Columbia University had owned the land under the original Rockefeller Center running down the east side of the Avenue of Americas to Fifth Avenue and from 48th Street to 51st Street. But the Rockefeller Group bought it in 1985 for $400 million. **********Mr. Rockefeller, who is 74 years old, is one of two surviving children of John D. Rockefeller Jr., who had five sons and one daughter. The other is Laurance S. Rockefeller, 79, owner of the Woodstock Inn in Woodstock, Vt., and former chairman of Rock Resorts. **********Mitsubishi, a name closely linked to everything from banking and trading to shipbuilding and automobiles, joins three other business leaders that already have a big stake in the Rockefeller properties. Owners of About 6.5 Percent **********The Agnelli family of Italy, headed by Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of the Fiat automotive group; Belton Kleberg Johnson of the family that owns the enormous King Ranch in Texas, and Patricia and William Hewitt of Moline, Ill., own a total of about 6.5 percent of the company. Mr. Hewitt is a former chairman of Deere & Company, the farm machinery manufacturer. **********Mr. Voell said in September that the Rockefeller company was exploring several possibilities, including a sale or a joint venture with what he called ''selected investors who share the long-term interests of the Rockefeller Group.'' **********The search, begun in the summer, had been expected to take far longer, but even then had been centered on Japan and other Asian points. When Mitsubishi Estate was approached in the late summer, it agreed almost immediately to make a pre-emptive bid, ending any further discussions with other Japanese companies. **********Initially, the Rockefeller company said, Mitsubishi would own some 627,000 shares, or 51 percent, but in a sign that both sides expect the percentage to rise, the formal announcement said the Rockefellers would be able to transfer more stock to Mitsubishi or to others acceptable to both parties. **********In Japan this morning, people close to the deal said Mitsubishi would increase its stake to 80 percent in two to three years. Decision by Family Trust **********David Rockefeller stressed in the interview, however, that the Rockefeller family would have no control over the decision, which would be made by the family trusts. The trusts are controlled by an independent committee headed by William G. Bowen. **********He explained that the trust committee invested funds for the six Rockefeller children and their descendants and that the Rockefeller Group investment ''had done extremely well and had grown significantly faster than other assets in the trust.'' **********Mr. Rockefeller maintained that it was now ''a matter of prudent management to diversify'' into other areas. ''The proceeds of the sale will be used to purchase other investments,'' he said. **********Dr. Bowen, a former president of Princeton University and now president of the Mellon Foundation, stressed that ''none of the proceeds go to the beneficiaries,'' meaning the Rockefellers. ''They remain in the trust,'' he said. Largest Single Investment **********He said that the Rockefeller Group would continue to be the largest single investment the Rockefellers have through their trusts and that the trusts planned to keep at least 20 percent of the company for itself. **********''One of the first things we hope to do with Mitsubishi,'' Mr. Voell said in a telephone interview, ''is to put up a signature building behind the Exxon Building on Seventh Avenue between 49th and 50th and revitalize the character of that street.'' **********In addition to Mitsubishi and the three investors who bought 6.5 percent in 1984, the Rockefellers, including two grandchildren of the late Mrs. Abby Rockefeller Mauze, David Rockefeller's sister, own about 8.5 percent. The trusts currently own the remaining 34 percent. Consequently, the trusts still have 14 percent that it could sell to Mitsubishi or others. 'Same as It Has Been' **********Asked if there would be any change in management style under Mitsubishi, Mr. Voell replied, ''It's going to be the same as it has been. David's staying as chairman and I'm staying as chief executive and president.'' **********''The reason why they're investing,'' he said, ''is they like the management style.'' **********As for objections that anyone might have raised about the change in control, Mr. Voell, seemingly surprised by the question, replied that ''nobody that I know of'' had voiced any opposition. **********Mitsubishi Estate, a member of Japan's Mitsubishi trading group, is by its own reckoning either the biggest or the second-biggest real estate company in Japan, with 92 prime office buildings in Tokyo alone. Many are concentrated in the prestigious Marunouchi business district of Tokyo. Property in Los Angeles **********One of its largest American properties is the $500 million Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles, which it developed with the Prudential Insurance Company of America. Mitsubishi put up most of the $150 million investment. **********In Rockefeller Center, Mitsubishi will become the landlord of some of the biggest names in the country: General Electric, NBC, Time Warner, Price Waterhouse and Morgan Stanley. **********The Exxon Building, mostly occupied by other important companies, including Price Waterhouse and Morgan Stanley, may be renamed eventually - after Exxon moves its last remaining employees to Dallas. **********The building, originally owned equally by the Rockefeller Group and Exxon, was sold about three years ago to the Mitsui Real Estate Development Company of Tokyo for $620 million. **********McGraw-Hill and the Rockefeller Group jointly own the McGraw-Hill Building while the Celanese Building, sold in the 1970's to a Dutch pension fund, was bought last year by JMB Realty of Chicago. Real Estate Trust Created **********In a complex transaction three years ago, the Rockefellers also created Rockefeller Center Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust that owns a $1.3 billion mortgage loan on Rockefeller Center. The loan is convertible in the year 2000 into 71.5 percent of the center. If the mortgage owners converted the loan they would then own 71.5 percent of the center, while Mitsubishi, the Rockefellers and other investors would own the balance. **********The center itself consists of 19 buildings covering 22 acres. Not part of the real estate trust are the Time & Life Building, the Celanese Building, the Exxon Building and the McGraw-Hill Building, The Rockefeller Group also owns largely vacant land at Seventh Avenue and 50th Street, behind the Exxon Building in mid-Manhattan, 600 acres in a foreign trade zone in Morristown, N.J., plus a telecommunications services company and Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate broker. **********''This transaction,'' Mr. Voell said, ''enhances the financial strength of the Rockefeller Group. It insures the company's ability to continue to invest in Rockefeller Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and prestigious commercial complex.'' Objectives Seen as Satisfied **********Calling the deal a partnership, Dr. Bowen, chairman of the trust committee, said it satisfied several objectives of the 1934 trusts, providing first ''exceptionally strong assurances that Rockefeller Center will continue to represent the standard of quality, the traditions and the values associated with the Rockefeller family.'' **********In an invitation to look upon Rockefeller Center as the showplace it truly is, he added, ''The center is the family's unique contribution to the architecture and character of New York City, and Mitsubishi has the same long-term investment philosophy as the family and the willingness to join the family in committing the resources required to sustain and enhance the value of the center.'' **********Explaining where the money from Mitsubishi would go, Dr. Bowen said that as a fidiciary for the Rockefellers, the trust committee wanted the company to grow but avoid ''over-concentration of assets in a single investment'' **********He said that the shares of the privately held company had nearly tripled in value in the last few years and that the sale of a big block to Mitsubishi ''offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the long-term prospects of the Rockefeller Group and Rockefeller Center while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolios.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/business/company-news-inter-city-in-deal-to-sell-divisions.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inter-City in Deal To Sell Divisions", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Inter-City in Deal To Sell Divisions", "body_text": " **********Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia, agreed to acquire the gas utility and propane businesses of the Inter-City Gas Corporation of Winnipeg, Manitoba, for $727 million (Canadian), or about $626 million in United States currency.

Lawrence Eckenfelder, who follows financial services companies for Prudential-Bache Securities, said: ''Goldman, Sachs is solid as a rock and always has been, but what intrigues me is what's in it for the insurance companies. Sumitomo bought a slug of the firm, but in this case it doesn't sound like that.'' **********The insurers, according to sources close to Goldman, Sachs, will collect a return for the length of the investment, which is ''not short,'' and get their money back at maturity. **********Asked how it would use the money, a Goldman, Sachs partner, who did not want to be identified, said, ''There's no specific use; it just gets added to our equity and presents a more conservative balance sheet.'' **********Goldman, Sachs declined to say how much interest the insurers would collect, although others said they were buying a ''senior limited partnership interest,'' similar to preferred stock. Insurance industry sources said the interest rate would be ''decent but not too high.'' Sources close to Goldman, Sachs said the rate for the privately placed securities was established a few months ago ''before rates went up.'' Conservative Firms Sought **********Analysts said that with the volatility of the securities markets today, corporations gravitate to the conservative investment firms and Goldman, Sachs is regarded as one of the more conservatively capitalized in the industry. **********Wall Street sources said Goldman, Sachs sounded out investors a year or more ago, looking for people to buy preferred stock or similar securities. **********One analyst speculated that perhaps the company was raising funds to replace capital that could be withdrawn by partners retiring from the firm. But sources close to Goldman, Sachs maintained that this was not the case, that the partners had just committed their capital for at least the next two years and that after that partners could only withdraw their capital over time. **********Goldman, Sachs's assets now stand at $51 billion, with partners' capital -including the $500 million of Sumitomo's passive limited partnership -amounting to $1.88 billion, the highest in its 120-year history. **********With the $225 million in additional passive limited partnerships, Goldman, Sachs's capital will climb to $2.1 billion. Its net capital requirement, as set by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is $55 million, making its excess capital one of the strongest on Wall Street. **********Bringing the firm's structure more in line with others in the industry, Goldman, Sachs said that it had formed Goldman, Sachs Group, L.P., with the partners of Goldman, Sachs & Company joining with the new investment group in the new holding company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/13/business/c-correction-231989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Correction", "print_headline": "Correction", "body_text": " **********Because of a production error, the mutual funds table last Sunday carried incomplete figures.

Sam Nakagama  Chairman and chief economist, Nakagama and Wallace Inc. **********I don't believe in the productivity numbers. I have a lot of questions about the way productivity is measured and so, in the main, I ignore the numbers. There are a lot of debates and quarrels about what the real numbers have been and it becomes a technical argument among specialists. I have long ago lost interest in that debate. Of course, we ought to do our best to measure productivity, and I'm not sure it can't be done. But the quarterly numbers are meaningless. On the other hand, there is not much argument over the long-term trend - 15 to 25 years - and those numbers have shown a sharp fall-off in productivity growth.

One of the many problems of the Reagan years was the damage done to data collection. Our overall economic data has deteriorated. We now have estimated numbers instead of survey numbers, and the survey numbers we do have come from smaller samples. For instance, the Federal Reserve gets its capacity utilization figures by making estimates of overall capacity and then making further estimates based on these numbers to arrive at a figure for utilization. **********We don't even know how big the manufacturing sector is anymore.

What I do is look back at the statistics for the last 12 months, add the numbers and then divide them by four to get my own rough indicator of quarterly performance. What this shows is a general flatness in productivity over the last 12 months. Behind that is the real story.

Farmers was the first big automobile insurer in California to seek a rate increase since the passage of the initiative 11 months ago. **********Ms. Gillespie said the freeze would protect consumers while the California Department of Insurance sorted out the confusion surrounding the initiative, which mandates a 20 percent rollback in auto and other property and casualty insurance premiums in California. A number of legal issues are blocking the rollbacks. **********The initiative has been closely watched by insurance companies and consumer advocates nationwide, who say it is spurring rate-cutting movements in other states with high insurance premiums. Fair Rate of Return **********After a legal challenge by several insurance companies, the California Supreme Court upheld the initiative in May, but at the same time said insurers should be exempted from the rollback if it denied them a fair rate of return. The court did not define what constituted a fair return, and much of the legal maneuvering since then has centered on that question. **********Ms. Gillespie said at a news conference in San Francisco today that a final definition of a fair return would be formulated in public hearings that begin Oct. 30. **********Ms. Gillespie has been harshly criticized by supporters of the initiative as being overly sympathetic to the insurance industry and insufficiently aggressive in enforcing the new law. In August, Ms. Gillespie infuriated the initiative's backers when she said that the majority of insurance companies would be exempted from rollbacks on automobile insurance and that most rollbacks would be far less than 20 percent. **********But Ms. Gillespie said today that all insurers seeking exemptions from the rate rollbacks would now face additional scrutiny. ''Farmers Insurance, and every other company looking for an exemption from the Proposition 103 rollback provision, must open their books to scrutiny by the public, consumer organizations and the insurance department,'' she said.

Voter Revolt and other consumer groups said that number allowed insurers too much profit. **********Ms. Gillespie said the hearings would also decide on how to enforce provisions eliminating variations in rates based on place of residence and providing additional rollbacks to drivers with good records. **********Ms. Gillespie said she opposed eliminating rate-setting based on place of residence because it could result in higher rates for 70 percent of drivers, mostly those in sururban and rural areas, and lower rates only for those in big cities. **********Edward Levy, a senior vice president of the Association of California Insurance Companies, a lobbying group for the industry, said Ms. Gillespie's action ''still leaves unresolved the problem of what rating criteria an insurer can use after Nov. 8,'' when the initiative becomes effective."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/23/business/the-media-business-advertising-nbc-cable-tv-work-shifted-to-lord-einstein.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1989-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 125, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NBC Cable TV Work Shifted to Lord Einstein", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; NBC Cable TV Work Shifted to Lord Einstein", "body_text": " **********''It was a quick marriage and a speedy divorce,'' Arthur Selkowitz said about Penchina, Selkowitz's loss yesterday of the CNBC account to Lord Einstein O'Neill & Partners. **********The cable television business-and-consumer news network, a venture of NBC television, brought out its first ads through Penchina only three months ago.

They recommended that oversight of Lincoln be handed either to the bank board's Washington, D.C., office or to examiners from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle. **********Indeed, a month later, the bank board voted 2 to 1 to remove the San Francisco officials and have its Washington office conduct a new review of Lincoln's financial condition. That move was met with a storm of criticism from top banking regulators and members of Congress, who complained that the move was virtually without precedent and could undermine the authority of regional bank examiners. **********In May, more than a year later, the bank board took over Lincoln, with $5.5 billion in assets, saying it posed a threat to the banking system. Losses at the institution, which has vast holdings of undeveloped land in Arizona, are expected to exceed $2 billion. **********The document including the recommendation of the bank board's Enforcement Review Committee was released late last week by M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Mr. Wall has come under intense criticism for his handling of the Lincoln case, particularly because he gave in to the association's demands for relief from oversight by the examiners in San Francisco. Some regulators feel that Mr. Wall was intimidated by threats from Lincoln that it would sue the bank board for leaking confidential information. **********The bank board's handling of Lincoln Savings is likely to be a focus of scrutiny this week when Senate and House conferees meet to reconcile differences between versions of the Bush Administration bailout plan that have been passed in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. The Senate bill would guarantee that Mr. Wall remains in office, while the House bill would require that he be renominated by the President, setting up a second confirmation process for Mr. Wall. Committee's Unanimous Vote **********Mr. Wall said at a press luncheon that since the Lincoln situation had caused such controversy he wanted to get the document into the public record to enable critics to assess more accurately the bank board's actions. **********Some bank board officials argued that it also appeared to be an attempt by Mr. Wall to spread the blame, since the document reveals that the committee members unanimously recommended that Lincoln should be relieved, at least temporarily, of oversight by examiners in San Francisco. **********In May 1987, those examiners had concluded that Lincoln was engaged in such high-risk investments and was losing money at such a rate that regulatory sanctions should be imposed, including a cease-and-desist order and, later, a conservatorship. Opposition by Lincoln Savings **********Lincoln and its chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr., vigorously opposed such actions. Lincoln threatened lawsuits against the agency, charging that San Francisco regulators had intentionally leaked to the press negative confidential information and that they were carrying out a vendetta against Lincoln because it was not a traditional savings institution that invested in home mortgages. **********Mr. Keating was thus asking the bank board to enable his institution to switch districts, from San Francisco to Seattle, to come under examiners that he felt would be more favorable. **********When Mr. Wall assumed the chairmanship of the bank board, instead of following the recommendations of the examiners, he appointed the five-member review committee, headed by Darrel Dochow, executive director of what was then the Office of Regulatory Policy, Oversight and Supervision. The group outlined three options for the bank board to consider. Committee Recommendations **********Mr. Dochow and George Barclay, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, recommended that Lincoln be granted a new review, to be conducted under the supervision of Mr. Dochow's office with no San Francisco personnel involved. **********Jordan Luke, bank board general counsel, recommended that Lincoln be permitted to transfer its headquarters immediately to the Seattle district from San Francisco and that it be subject to a cease-and-desist order against lending and investment violations. **********And Rosemary Stewart, head of enforcement at the bank board, and Karl Hoyle, director of public affairs, recommended that Lincoln be given a choice of the two options. **********None of the members recommended a third option, to keep Lincoln under the supervision of San Francisco regulators. Report Noted 'a Bad Signal' **********But the report repeatedly warned that taking any step other than keeping Lincoln under the purview of San Francisco examiners would send ''a bad signal that unhappy institutions may shop for their supervisors'' and that the bank board does not stand behind its front-line examiners. **********The report also warned that giving Lincoln an opportunity to switch might demonstrate that the bank board would tolerate institutions that insist on not cooperating in examinations. **********On May 5, 1988, Mr. Wall and a board member, Roger F. Martin, voted to support Mr. Dochow's recommendation to grant a review by the Washington office. Another board member, Lawrence J. White, dissented, saying he felt the San Francisco examiners had made an adequate case that Lincoln was approaching insolvency and should be taken over.American Continentald (Lincoln Savings and Loan Association)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/02/world/the-plo-s-many-voices-differ-about-its-commitments-to-the-us.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1989-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The P.L.O.'s Many Voices Differ About Its Commitments to the U.S.", "print_headline": "The P.L.O.'s Many Voices Differ About Its Commitments to the U.S.", "body_text": " **********Since Yasir Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist in December, he and other Palestinian leaders have spoken in a multitude of voices, sometimes affirming but more often contradicting those original commitments. **********The inconsistencies have caused concern among Bush Administration officials and some members of Congress. The contradictions were a major topic of discussion when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d met here last week with Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., the American Ambassador to Tunisia, who is conducting the dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The House of Representatives recently approved a bill that would require the State Department to catalogue, compare and analyze statements by P.L.O. officials. The Senate seems likely to pass a similar measure. Guerrilla Raids Cited **********While the P.L.O. statements are important, American officials said they also want to determine who was responsible for sporadic guerrilla attacks on Israel. The United States says attacks against Israeli civilian or military targets are ''contrary to the peaceful objectives of the dialogue'' with the P.L.O. **********A systematic review of Palestinian statements - in newspaper interviews and radio and television broadcasts around the world - suggests that Palestinian leaders speak to Arab audiences in different terms than they use in speaking to the United States. **********American officials say that they are not sure which is the authentic voice of the P.L.O., but that they will use the dialogue to test and strengthen the P.L.O.'s commitment to political moderation. Declaration in Geneva **********In Geneva in December, Mr. Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., said, ''We totally and absolutely renounce all forms of terrorism, including individual, group and state terrorism.'' He also said he accepted ''the right of all parties concerned in the Middle East conflict,'' including Israel, to exist in peace and security. **********But he and his lieutenants in the mainstream of the organization have subsequently joined P.L.O. hard-liners in telling Arab audiences that they would continue ''armed struggle'' against the ''Zionist entity.'' **********In a typical comment, Mr. Arafat's top deputy, Saleh Khalef, also known as Abu Iyad, said in February that the P.L.O.'s recognition of Israel was contingent on Israel's recognition of the P.L.O. 'We Have Not Recognized Israel' **********Neither a set of resolutions adopted by the Palestine National Council in November nor Mr. Arafat's speech in Geneva ''featured recognition of Israel,'' Mr. Khalef said in an interview published in a Kuwaiti newspaper, Al Watan. ''We have not recognized Israel. We will do so when they recognize us.'' **********Mr. Khalef took a different position in a videotape smuggled into Israel and played on Feb. 22 at a symposium on Middle East peace. He said the P.L.O. wanted direct talks with Israel and it accepted the need for co-existence between Israel and a Palestinian state. **********Nabil Shaath, a senior political adviser to Mr. Arafat, and other Palestinians say Israelis have taken their remarks out of context and focused on semantic discrepancies as an excuse to avoid direct talks with the P.L.O. 'Our Little Linguistic Flaps' **********''If we continue to regurgitate fear and if we continue just to look at our differences, just to spot our semantics, just to spot our little linguistic flaps, we are never going to build peace,'' Mr. Shaath said. **********He said Israeli leaders like Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also spoke in different voices and often sounded more intransigent when addressing Israeli audiences than when speaking to American officials in Washington. **********The United States encouraged linguistic analysis of P.L.O. statements last year. American officials, working through Swedish diplomats, coached Mr. Arafat into saying the words needed to satisfy longstanding American conditions for a dialogue. Deep Internal Disagreements **********Rarely does Mr. Arafat or any other Palestinian leader repeat those words exactly. Experts on the P.L.O. say the ambiguities and inconsistencies in its public statements reflect deep internal disagreements. **********Asher Susser, an expert on the P.L.O. at Tel Aviv University, said the inconsistencies in P.L.O. statements ''derive from different perceptions of time.'' **********On the one hand, he said, P.L.O. officials feel pressure to show moderation so they can bring about immediate political gains for residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. On the other hand, he said, the 17-month uprising in the occupied territories has increased the confidence of P.L.O. officials. **********''In the long term,'' he said, ''many P.L.O. officials feel they can achieve victory over Israel, so they are reluctant to categorically renounce the goal of liberating all of Palestine, and they hope ultimately to include the present State of Israel in a future Palestinian state.'' Reporting Requirements **********The bill passed last month by the House would require the President to report to Congress twice a year on the statements and actions of P.L.O. officials. In each report, the President would have to compare those statements and actions with the declarations Mr. Arafat made in Geneva. **********A State Department official objected to the bill, saying, it was ''just another onerous reporting requirement imposed on us by Congress.'' He said the Administration had persuaded lawmakers to delete a list of criteria for judging P.L.O. conduct and statements. Those criteria may be reinserted by the Senate, where a Florida Republican, Connie Mack, has introduced a similar bill, known as the P.L.O. Commitments Compliance Act.It has 25 co-sponsors, including Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the Senate minority leader. Israeli Compilations **********Members of Congress have received compilations of P.L.O. statements from various sources including the Israeli Embassy and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the pro-Israel lobby. In one such statement verified by the United States Government, Farouk Kaddoumi, the provisional foreign minister of the newly proclaimed state of Palestine, said in January that ''we pursue a policy of stages in our political struggle.'' **********The policy of stages, as explained in P.L.O. statements since the mid-1970's, calls for establishing a Palestinian state in the occupied territories or other ''liberated land'' as a first step toward capturing all of Palestine. **********In the last four months, P.L.O. leaders have repeatedly vowed to continue their armed struggle against Israel. In a radio interview in March, Mr. Khalef said, ''We have never interpreted terror as meaning a suspension of military operations.'' **********Mr. Arafat told the West German magazine Der Spiegel in late December, ''You have to distinguish between terrorism as a crime and the just national struggle against occupation, which is completely legitimate.'' **********Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a hard-line faction that is one of the three major components of the P.L.O., said in March, ''The P.L.O. organizations in which we participate have never made any decision to halt armed struggle against the enemy.'' **********''Arafat's remarks represent his own opinions, not P.L.O. policy,'' Mr. Hawatmeh said in an interview with a Beirut newspaper. A member of his faction led the P.L.O. delegation at the two formal meetings with the United States, in December and March. Crucial U.N. Resolutions **********Before opening a dialogue with the P.L.O., the United States insisted that Mr. Arafat accept United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Resolution 242 guarantees the right of every state in the Middle East to ''live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.'' President Reagan concluded on Dec. 14 that Mr. Arafat had met this condition. **********But one month later, in an interview with an Arabic-language newspaper published in London, Abdel Hamid al-Sayeh was asked how he would reply to those who criticized the P.L.O. for recognizing Israel. He said the Palestine National Council, of which he is the speaker, had not accepted those resolutions. ''What some term recognition of the Security Council's resolutions and consequently recognition of the Zionist entity is untrue,'' he said. **********Secretary of State Baker said Palestinian statements contradicting Mr. Arafat ''are not helpful.'' By way of explanation, he noted that ''the P.L.O. has many dissident elements'' and that ''some are frankly opposed to the idea of any dialogue with the United States.'' **********''Some have not, in fact, renounced terrorism, some of these dissident elements,'' Mr. Baker said. ''And we cannot, of course, expect the Arafat element of the P.L.O. to control every dissident group out there.'' **********Mr. Baker's statement, in testimony to the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 13, differs from the position articulated by the State Department as recently as Feb. 27. Charles E. Redman, the department spokesman at the time, said, ''The P.L.O. cannot escape responsibility for the actions of its constituent elements.'' **********Mr. Bush expressed a similar position as President-elect on Dec. 19. But Mr. Kaddoumi, the provisional foreign minister for a Palestinian state, said in February, ''The P.L.O. is not prepared to condemn operations which any Palestinian organization or faction undertakes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/31/business/credit-markets-treasury-securities-inch-higher.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1989-10-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Securities Inch Higher", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Treasury Securities Inch Higher", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in very slow trading yesterday, as dealers awaited reports on economic activity in October. **********Market participants said the survey due tomorrow from the nation's purchasing managers and a report on employment conditions scheduled for release on Friday will be focal points for trading. **********Treasury market participants centered their attention yesterday on auctions of $2 billion worth of 51-day cash management bills and $15.6 billion of three- and six-month bills. **********The short-term offerings were announced by the Treasury last week in order to raise cash to pay Social Security beneficiaries before the nation's debt ceiling of $2.87 trillion expires at midnight. **********Proceeds from the auctions will raise enough revenue for the Government so that it will remain solvent until Nov. 9.

''As a result, we saw a good bit of cross-over buying by accounts that were getting out of other securities and into municipals.'' **********For the second time this year, the New York City issue included an offering of taxable bonds. **********Yields on the $55.9 million worth of taxable bonds range from 9 1/8 percent on issues that mature in 1994 to 9.90 percent on bonds maturing in 2010. **********Yields on the $757.44 million of tax-exempt serial bonds sold yesterday range from 6.50 percent on bonds that mature Aug. 1, 1990, to 7.78 percent on bonds that mature in 2008. **********The issue, which carries an A rating from Moody's Investors Service and an expected rating of A-minus from the Standard & Poor's Corporation, is to refinance bonds that mature over the next several years. The prospectus states that many of the issues to be refinanced mature in 1990 and 1991. Budget Savings Claimed **********City officials claim the refinancing will result in savings of $162 million in interest payments during the 1990 fiscal year and an additional $100 million in 1991. **********After examining the contents of the refinancing package, however, some critics claimed yesterday that the savings would be far smaller than that. **********''There is a modicum of real 'refunding' going on that may save the City $1 million or $2 million,'' said Robert C. Apfel, president of Robert C. Apfel & Company Inc., a capital markets consulting firm. ''All they are really doing is rolling debt that would mature over the next 12 months to 18 months over into the next 20 to 30 years.'' **********Steven J. Matthews, New York's assistant comptroller, said the issue ''is a restructuring of debt that produces both present value savings and budgetary savings and will allow the City to more accurately reflect the life of the asset that is being financed. This is not fiscal gimmickry.'' The successful New York City offering helped to push prices of outstanding City issues up by half a point, dealers said. Many City issues have been under pressure in recent sessions. **********Participants in the secondary market for municipal bonds said prices of most other issues rose by 1/4 of a point to 3/8 of a point yesterday. **********Acitivity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was very sluggish, dealers said, with little or no change in prices. **********The following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)          Average Price   98.885          Discounted Rate   7.87%          Coupon Yield   8.07%          High Price   98.888          Discounted Rate   7.85%          Coupon Yield   8.05%          Low Price   98.881          Discounted Rate   7.90%          Coupon Yield   8.10%          Accepted at low price   2%          Total applied for   $15,725,000          Accepted   $1,880,400          N.Y. applied for   $17,674,000          N.Y. accepted   $2,005,400       The cash management bills mature Dec. 21, 1989. **********(000 omitted in dollar figures)      $   3-Mo.

Fixer for Both Sides **********Nearly a quarter of a century later, he was involved in the 1986 exchange, across the same Glienecke Bridge in the north of Berlin, that freed Natan Sharansky, then known as Anatoly B. Shcharansky, from a Soviet prison camp where he had been jailed for his human rights activities. **********And for nearly as long as the 28 years the Berlin wall divided East from West, Mr. Vogel negotiated the release of thousands of East German political prisoners, their release paid for in hard cash by the West German Government at rates that have risen from $10,000 to $50,000 a head since 1964, according to German officials. **********East German officials do not publicly acknowledge this shadowy business at all. West German officials do not like to talk about it, but it began under the auspices of the West German Lutheran Church, which like so many German institutions had more links under and around the wall all these years than it let on. Old Ties to the West **********In a way Mr. Vogel, an East German who drives a yellow West German Mercedes, personifies them. His wife, Helga, is from West Germany, and he could travel freely between East and West long before last Thursday, when the new Communist Party leadership under Egon Krenz gave the same right to all 16 million East German citizens. **********Mr. Vogel was in West Berlin when that announcement, in effect making the wall porous while leaving it standing, was made. ''I was in West Berlin on the night it went up, the 13th of August 1961, too,'' he said. **********For years, East German leaders thought the end of the wall would mean the end of German Democratic Republic. Whether that judgment was right or wrong is not yet something Mr. Vogel is prepared to talk about, nor are his close ties with the deposed Communist leader whose judgment it was, Erich Honecker, now believed to be ill and in a hospital suffering from cancer. A Voice for Honecker **********Mr. Honecker called in the lawyer last summer, after the Soviet bloc began to come apart, to try to persuade hundreds of East Germans who had sought asylum in West German embassies in East Berlin, Budapest, Prague and Warsaw that they would be allowed to leave for West Germany if they would first return home. **********A few hundred did from Prague, after Mr. Vogel was able to show the Government's good faith by getting it to let two small children whose relatives had simply handed them over the fence to strangers in the West German Embassy grounds, out of the country to rejoin their parents, who had reached West Berlin. **********But by last month, tens of thousands of people were flocking to the West German Embassy grounds in Prague. Mr. Honecker, anxious not to spoil the Oct. 7 celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary, consented to let some go west, but the authorities were taking reprisals against their relatives back at home. The Final Straw **********And the case that finally drove Mr. Vogel to speak was a family that tried to cross the Neisse River into Poland illegally. The father made it and got out to West Germany, the mother was caught and sent to prison in East Germany and the two small children were put into an orphanage. **********''It is impermissible, on the one hand, to allow special exit to West Germany and, on the other hand, to impose prison terms for similar conduct,'' he said then. ''The criminal prosecutions against demonstrators who have committed no acts of violence are also legally questionable.'' **********Shortly afterward, Mr. Honecker was ousted by the Communist Party Politburo, and last week Mr. Krenz declared the entire East German border with West Germany open for the first time since 1961. Act of Desperation **********The sudden decision surprised Mr. Vogel no less than other East Germans, who saw in it an act not so much of calculation as of desperation. **********He is as skeptical now of people who say they have always been reformers as of those who lay all the blame for what went wrong on Mr. Honecker's shoulders. ''Everybody has to ask themselves now what they did or failed to do that led to this pass,'' he said. **********The new leadership has announced plans for a new law permitting travel abroad without any bureaucratic restrictions. It has said that there will be a new law spelling out the right to assemble freely and petition the Government for grievances, and that the criminal law will be reviewed. **********This may quickly lead to a reduction in the number of political crimes, including ''flight from the republic,'' which have kept Mr. Vogel in business over the years. **********''Maybe I can even think of enjoying retirement,'' he said, as the telephone rang incessantly with calls from clients and West Germans asking him to go over there for meetings and parties to celebrate his role in bringing about the end of the wall."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/08/business/business-digest-251989.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1989-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 612, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********INTERNATIONAL  Western European governments are expected to create an enlarged European common market of 18 nations, not just the 12 in the European Community.

Yet, as the recent experience of Avis Europe P.L.C. shows, acquisitions in Europe can present a dizzying array of problems and challenges that can have large effects on a deal's ultimate cost. **********Until recently, Avis Europe was an independent company that had been spun off from its parent in 1986, when the rental-car concern underwent a leveraged buyout. This summer, a consortium of Avis Inc., the General Motors Corporation and Lease International, a Belgian company, decided to acquire the company in a $1.6 billion transaction. As a result, Avis now owns about 9 percent, G.M. 26 percent and their Belgian partner 65 percent. **********To acquire the company, and allow for a healthy increase in working capital, the consortium intends to arrange a permanent loan of about $2.5 billion, and therein lies the problem. The consortium's headquarters, and therefore the logical source of the debt, are in London. Yet British interest rates are around 14 percent, five percentage points higher than those in France and seven percentage points higher than those in West Germany, to name but two of the many other countries where Avis operates and where much of the income to service the debt will be generated. **********There were other reasons to get the debt out of Britain. Among them was that if the debt was more equally distributed across the Continent and serviced with local currency, the consortium could minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations. ''There was a substantial benefit to getting the debt down to the operating entities,'' said Louis Perlmutter, a senior partner at Lazard Freres & Company, which structured the transaction. But that was no simple matter. Each of the more than 11 other countries has a different set of laws governing how much money can be transferred out of the country, how much debt can be assumed by a local subsidiary, and how much interest they will allow to be deducted from corporate taxes. **********To be sure, as 1992 approaches, many of these corporate and accounting conventions are likely to become more standardized, and recent discussions about a common currency and central bank could ultimately lead to a far simpler deal-making environment. In addition, few European companies have the breadth of operations that Avis has. **********Nevertheless, the acquisition of a company that operates in even two or three European countries will result in many of these same considerations, and in the interim period when many highly leveraged transactions are likely to be consummated, issues like those that Avis faced are likely to be similar for many other potential acquirers. ''These kinds of transactions will have increasing applicability in the future,'' said Charles E. Golden, the treasurer of General Motors. To facilitate the Avis transaction, Lazard designed a computer model to figure out the optimal placement of debt to minimize taxes, maximize the effect of lower interest rates and avoid running afoul of corporate laws on currency and dividend outflows. **********To help unravel the puzzle, Lazard worked with its London cousin, Lazard Brothers, and the Paris office of the law firm Debevoise Plimpton. In addition, local tax and legal consultants were hired in many of the countries where Avis operates. The solution arrived at, after nearly 10 weeks of analysis, was the equivalent of 10 leveraged buyouts. **********Of the $2.5 billion permanent financing that the consortium is in the process of arranging, about 80 percent will be placed outside Britain. Besides the high interest rates there, the low corporate tax rate in Britain limited the amount of interest that could be deducted. In Britain, the corporate tax rate is 35 percent, compared with 42 percent in France and Portugal, 46 percent in Italy and 50 percent in West Germany. **********On the other hand, there are laws in West Germany, for instance, that limit how much a local company can borrow in relation to its own earning power. Similarly, when Lazard tried to plan for a subsidiary to send dividends or earnings back to the British parent, it faced a host of different withholding tax levels. In Spain the tax is 20 percent, but in Portugal and Belgium it is only 15 percent. **********''Every time we solved one problem, four others arose in other jurisdictions,'' Mr. Perlmutter said. He would not put a figure on how much Avis ultimately saved by spreading its debt across Europe, nor was he willing to divulge how much Lazard charged for providing this service. **********Europe may indeed be the land of opportunity to American corporations and Wall Street deal makers. But if the experience of Avis Europe is an example, aspirin would seem to be one necessary ingredient for a successful deal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/23/business/2d-mistrial-declared-in-gaf-case.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1989-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1462, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2d Mistrial Declared in GAF Case", "print_headline": "2d Mistrial Declared in GAF Case", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge declared a mistrial yesterday in the GAF stock manipulation case after the jury said it remained deadlocked in its 12th day of deliberations. **********The decision, by Judge Mary Johnson Lowe of Federal District Court in Manhattan, completed for the first time a criminal trial developed from evidence that prosecutors obtained from the insider-trading scandals on Wall Street in 1986. **********It was the second time Judge Lowe had ordered a mistrial in the case. In January, she dismissed the jurors in mid-trial and began anew after ruling that a prosecutor had unintentionally withheld a Government report that a signficant piece of evidence had been altered. Giuliani Began Case **********The latest mistrial was a setback for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney who initiated the case. If Judge Lowe decides not to permit another trial, it would mark the end of the prosecution of GAF and will signal difficulties ahead for the prosecutors in Mr. Giuliani's former office. They plan to use the same principal witness in the GAF case, Boyd L. Jefferies, in other cases involving accusations of improper trading. **********The jurors' failure to reach a verdict apparently showed that Mr. Jefferies's effectiveness in the witness box had been limited. **********Mr. Jefferies, the former head of the large West Coast brokerage that bears his name, said in several dramatic moments in the courtroom that he had helped James T. Sherwin, GAF's vice chairman, manipulate the price of Union Carbide stock. The accusation was denied by lawyers for the company and Mr. Sherwin, who called Mr. Jefferies a crook and a liar. Manipulation Is Denied **********During the six-week trial, GAF and Mr. Sherwin denied that they had sought to manipulate the price of Union Carbide stock in the fall of 1986. After an unsuccessful takeover attempt, GAF held 10 million shares of Union Carbide stock. **********GAF's chairman and chief executive, Samuel J. Heyman, was named as a co-conspirator. He was not indicted. **********Benito Romano, the Acting United States Attorney in Manhattan, said another trial of the defendants would be sought. **********''I have a great deal of faith in our evidence in the case and we believe, after viewing the evidence and even taking into consideration the deliberation of the jury, it's appropriate to try the case again,'' he said. **********Defense lawyers said the case should not go to trial a third time. **********''After two lengthy and costly trials and 12 days of jury deliberations, we would hope that the court's action today would now put an end to this case,'' a GAF spokesman said. 'A Sense of Fatigue' **********After the mistrial was declared, GAF's main trial lawyer, Arthur L. Liman, commented: ''You feel a sense of fatigue. You feel a sense of incompleteness.'' **********Mr. Sherwin, a slight, intense 55-year-old lawyer who was once the nation's third-ranking chess player, barely moved as Judge Lowe declared the mistrial. He then hugged his lawyers and his wife, Hiroko. **********''I'm just exhausted, that's all,'' Mr. Sherwin repeated twice as he left the courtroom. **********The judge's decision came after she received a note from the jurors that they were deadlocked among three groups; those who thought the defendants guilty, those who thought they were not guilty and those who were undecided. **********She then sent a note to the jury asking whether further deliberations would be helpful. Seven responded no and five yes, she said. Shift Since Saturday **********''That seems like a shift from Saturday evening, when the jury told the judge that it was divided, 11 to 1,'' said Alan Levine, a defense lawyer. Which way the jurors were leaning then, or at the end, was not known. **********Several jurors declined last night to comment about the deliberations. **********Over the weekend, Judge Lowe asked the lawyers in the case whether she should order the jurors not to talk after the trial ended. None of the lawyers requested such a gag order. **********After declaring the mistrial yesterday, the judge met with the jurors. In an unusual step, an hour later, they sent her a note saying they had agreed not to respond to inquiries by reporters. It was unclear whether the judge had asked for such an agreement. **********The GAF case was developed from the insider trading investigation in 1986 that involved Ivan F. Boesky and other Wall Street figures. Unlike previous cases, in which the defendants either pleaded guilty or the prosecutors dropped the charges, this went to the jury. **********Today marks Mr. Boesky's first year of a three-year sentence in a minimum-security prison in California, after pleading guilty to filing a false statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 1986, in the largest enforcement action ever initiated against a Wall Street figure, he settled insider trading charges by paying $100 million in fines and restitution. Boesky Under Cover **********As part of his plea-bargaining settlement, Mr. Boesky agreed to tape-record illegal dealings with Mr. Jefferies, an obsessive stock trader who, by his own account, often got less than four hours' sleep so that he could trade stocks around the globe. **********He built one of the nation's most important brokerage houses, Jefferies & Company, from scratch. Based in Los Angeles, the brokerage has become a significant player in takeovers in the 1980's because of its ability to trade huge blocks of shares after the markets are closed. **********In 1987, Mr. Jefferies agreed to plead guilty to two felonies and to be barred from the securities industry for at least five years. He faces a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and does not expect to be sentenced until he testifies in two other big criminal securities cases. Defendants Deny Crimes **********The defendants in those cases, who have denied wrongdoing, are Paul A. Bilzerian, chairman of the Singer Companies, and Salim B. Lewis, a stockbroker. **********The GAF case had its roots in the summer of 1985, when Mr. Heyman, the company's chairman and chief executive, began an attempt to acquire Union Carbide. **********GAF has been used as a financial vehicle for Mr. Heyman to attempt corporate takeovers. Based in Wayne, N.J., the company is a leading maker of chemicals and building materials and owns WNCN-FM in New York. In 1988 it had earnings of $100 million on sales of $961 million. **********On March 2, GAF shareholders approved a $1.47 billion leveraged buyout of the company by a management group led by him. **********In the fall of 1986, Mr. Heyman decided that he could not win Union Carbide. The two companies signed a standstill agreement that forbade GAF to acquire Union Carbide stock for 10 years. **********By that time, GAF had acquired 10 million Union Carbide shares. Prosecutors told the jurors that the price of the stock had been declining in 1986 when Mr. Sherwin asked Mr. Jefferies to execute trades that could keep the price at $22 a share. **********Mr. Jefferies and the head trader at his firm, James T. Melton, testified that Mr. Melton bought 190,100 Union Carbide shares for more than $4 million on the New York and Pacific stock exchanges on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30. That helped raise the price 12.5 cents, to $22.

Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has called on Israel to ''stop settlement activity'' in the West Bank, which it has occupied since 1967. The future status of the territory is an important issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. **********An Administration official said today that he knew of Israel's desire for housing loan guarantees, but that the Administration had not formally reviewed the proposal or taken a position on it. #100,000 Emigres Expected Israel says it expects to receive 100,000 Soviet Jews in the next three years, in part because the United States has adopted new procedures restricting their admission to this country. For years, Israel has pressed Washington to encourage Soviet Jewish emigres to go to Israel rather than to the United States. **********Israel estimates that it will need $3 billion to provide housing, jobs, education and other services for the Soviet Jews. The cost for housing alone is estimated at $2 billion. **********Federal loan guarantees, under a program to finance housing projects in developing countries, would allow Israel to borrow money from commercial banks at low interest rates. But Congress would need to expand the program to accommodate Israel's needs because the worldwide total of loan guarantees under the program is $125 million in the coming year, and under current law no country can get more than $25 million a year. **********On a visit to Washington last week, Finance Minister Shimon Peres asked for American help. In a meeting with members of the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for foreign aid, Mr. Peres acknowledged, in response to a question, that the current Israeli Government would probably build some of the housing in the West Bank. The United States has said for years that the establishment of additional settlements posed ''an obstacle to peace.'' Supporters of such settlements say they enhance Israel's security and fulfill a mission to live in all the biblical land of Israel. **********Arab countries have expressed alarm at the prospect that significant numbers of Soviet Jews might settle in the West Bank. Clovis F. Maksoud, the Arab League representative in the United States, said such migration would contribute to a ''creeping annexation'' of the occupied territories by Israel, undermining prospects for peace in the Middle East. Mr. Baker has called on Israel to ''forswear annexation'' of the territories. **********Israel estimates that it will need to build 30,000 housing units for the 100,000 Soviet Jews, at an average cost of $65,000 a unit. Israeli officials said Soviet emigres would decide where to live based on such factors as where they could find jobs and where their relatives lived. Inevitably, the officials said, some emigres would want to live in the West Bank. **********''Should we bar them from the West Bank?'' one official asked. ''I cannot imagine the Government of Israel, as it's constituted today, accepting such a restriction.'' A Promise to Repay **********Congressional aides said that lawmakers might seek assurances that Israel would not use the money to build housing in the occupied territories. **********In a summary of its proposal, Israel said the loan guarantees would not increase the budget deficit of the United States Government because Israel would repay the money it intends to borrow from private American banks. **********Israel said it could not afford to borrow the money from commercial banks without Federal loan guarantees. The Israeli Government said it ''contacted several American financial institutions and learned that the most favorable conditions we could expect'' on such loans ''would make the program unfeasible.'' **********Until September 1988, the United States assumed that Jews leaving the Soviet Union had ''a well-founded fear of persecution'' and were eligible for admission to this country as refugees. However, since then, the United States has closely examined each applicant and has denied refugee status to 5,884 Soviet Jews, or 19 percent of those who applied in the last year. **********Starting today, Jews leaving the Soviet Union on Israeli visas will no longer be able to change their destination and apply for visas to the United States in Vienna or Rome, as thousands have done in the last decade. Soviet citizens wishing to come to this country will have to apply at the American Embassy in Moscow, rather than in Vienna or Rome. Israeli officials say they hope this will end the phenomenon of Soviet Jews' not going to Israel after they leave Moscow. **********Last week, Mr. Peres said he hoped the new housing would be ready when Soviet Jews arrive in Israel, and he added, ''I don't think there is anything more important in our own life than to have the Russian Jews come to Israel.'' **********Israeli officials said their Government would pay $2 billion of the resettlement costs with its own resources. They said they hoped the United Jewish Appeal and other private organizations would raise $600 million. This is in addition to the $400 million they hope to borrow with the help of loan guarantees from the United States.  4 Palestinians Killed **********JERUSALEM, Oct. 1 (AP) - Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Palestinians in clashes in the occupied lands today, and Palestinian militants stabbed to death a man they accused of collaborating with Israel, the army and Arab hospital workers said. **********Arab residents of the Gaza Strip were banned from entering Israel for a third day as Israelis celebrated Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New Year.
