Others are doing away with incentives like free telephones or calculators, used extensively in the past to lure subscribers - although some, like Time Warner, still offer them for magazines like Sports Illustrated. **********The latest figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulation showed that for the first six months of this year the average circulation of many consumer magazines has slipped. At Time, TV Guide, McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens, total circulation fell by about 3 percent. The picture was worse for other publications: People magazine had a 5 percent drop and Sports Illustrated was down 7 percent. **********''It is an immediate signal to advertisers of the real vitality of magazines if subscribers are paying the full rate,'' said Paul DuCharme, the director of print media at Grey Advertising. **********Michael Clinton, the publisher of GQ magazine, said that almost every copy of the monthly men's magazine was sold for the full cover price of $3 and that that gave GQ a competitive edge. ''It is a very strong selling point with advertisers,'' he said. **********Publishers are also making these changes to improve their profits. By eliminating expensive premiums and charging subscribers the full price, publishers hope to compensate for revenue lost through steep declines in advertising pages this year. **********''A lot more publishers are concerned about the bottom line,'' said Donald Kummerfeld, the president of the Magazine Publishers of America, a trade group. ''It doesn't make any sense to pump up circulation during tough economic times.'' **********Newsstand sales for many of the biggest magazines were down by 10 percent or more. Elle was down 18 percent, Glamour was off 14 perent and McCall's 30 percent. **********Newsstand sales are important because publishers reap the full cover price. These sales are also a critical indication to advertisers of how much consumers value a publication. The theory is that readers who travel to a newsstand and pay full price are far more interested than those who get a magazine in the mail. **********Analysts and publishers said consumers were buying fewer magazines mainly because prices had escalated - many cost $3 or more - in the last few years. **********Even though circulation is declining at many magazines, publishers are expected to raise advertising rates from 5 percent to 10 percent or even more in 1991, primarily to offset increasing costs for paper and postage - and revenues lost through declines in ad pages. **********But publishers may find it hard to persuade advertisers to pay more, analysts said. Ad pages have been steadily falling this year. In July, ad pages as measured by the Publisher's Information Bureau were down 5.7 percent, and ad pages are off 3.6 percent so far this year. **********Most analysts said that the rise in rates was merely a bargaining ploy and that most publishers were willing to negotiate. Many magazines are already offering discounts of 30 percent or more on ad pages for the fourth quarter. **********Dan Capell, a magazine consultant and the publisher of Capell's Circulation Report, said he expected newsstand circulation to continue to decline for many magazines. Some magazines like Family Circle and Woman's Day are cutting back on their newsstand sales and hoping to attract more subscribers. **********Some publishers are abandoning newsstands because the competition has become fierce. Not only are there more titles fighting for the consumer's attention, but the owners of newsstands are alloting space that used to go to magazines to items like candy and razor blades, which have higher profit margins. **********Still, newsstand sales are still important to some publishers. ''We are more committed than ever,'' said Mark Miller, executive vice president and general manager at the Hearst Corporation, which publishes Cosmopolitan, Redbook, Good Housekeeping and other magazines that rely heavily on newsstand sales. To bolster its position at newsstands, Hearst recently struck a deal with the field sales force of National Enquirer to place Hearst magazines in racks at supermarkets, Mr. Miller said. **********Perhaps the most revolutionary change being contemplated by some publishers is a switch, in part, from paid circulation to ''qualified controlled circulation,'' in which the reader gets it free. **********Avenue magazine, for example, operates on a controlled circulation. Avenue asks a group of selected readers whether they would like to receive the magazine, and those who say yes get a free copy. Controlled circulation has become more attractive because the Audit Bureau of Circulation recently said it would include controlled subscribers in its figures. Although publishers would lose some revenue, controlled subscribers are far less expensive to obtain than paid subscribers. **********But there are risks. ''Publishers will have to be very careful in choosing the kind of people who get free copies,'' Mr. Capell said. ''Otherwise it will mean nothing to advertisers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/10/business/real-estate-teleport-ii-offers-lures-at-si-site.html": {"writer_name": "Rachelle Garbarine", "pub_date": "1990-10-10", "snippet": "LEAD: IT started as a novel project in an out-of-the way location, but in the five years since construction began, the 250-acre Teleport Complex on Staten Island, one of the nation's first high-tech office and satellite communiciations centers, ha...", "word_count": 837, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate;\n\nTeleport II Offers Lures At S.I.

The latest evidence is the dedication and opening last week of Teleport II, a 166,000-square-foot speculative office building on nine acres. With its completion, the Teleport complex now consists of five buildings with a total of 700,000 square feet out of a potential of 1.1 million square feet. **********The complex, just 11 miles from Manhattan, is a joint project of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the city of New York and Merrill Lynch & Company. It sits in the northwestern corner of Staten Island at the intersection of the Staten Island and West Shore Expressways. **********Already, 800 new jobs have been created at the complex, helping Staten Island's economy as well its image as a corporate address. Among the tenants are Allstate Insurance, Dun & Bradstreet, the capital markets division of Merrill Lynch and Teleport Communications Group, a subsidiary of Merrill Lynch. **********Teleport II was developed by Teleport Associates, a joint venture of Silverstein Properties of New York City and the Murray Construction Company of Springfield, N.J. The three-story concrete building was financed by the Manhattan branch of the Saitama Bank of Japan and cost $16 million. **********The partners, who developed Teleport I, the 112,000-square-foot building next door, are also planning Teleport III, a sister structure of 155,000 square feet on an adjoining site. Construction, however, will not begin until half the space in Teleport II is rented. Only 3,300 square feet has been taken so far. Teleport I is fully rented. **********Opening a speculative office building, no matter the size, at a time when the commercial marketplace has a surfeit of space, looks like a risky venture. In Manhattan alone there is more than 59 million square feet of prime and secondary space available and tenants are not shy about shopping around for a good deal, said Franklin C. Speyer, a vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, the national real estate brokerage firm. **********But Mr. Speyer said the Teleport complex had several advantages that might lure expanding companies as well as those relocating from Manhattan. Prime among them, he said, is the center's access to Staten Island's large and qualified labor force. **********For one tenant, the Teleport Communications Group, being able to retain employees and attract new ones played a role in the decision to move to Staten Island. The company two years ago traded the space it had outgrown at the World Trade Center in Manhattan for 40,000 feet on two floors at the Teleport. **********John J. Reiser Jr, the company's vice president for administration and human resources, said that while he was able to take to Staten Island 60 of the 80 employees, he had no trouble attracting an additional 75 people. ''Half of our employees,'' he said, ''are borough residents.'' **********Further tempering the vagaries of the market is the package of state- and city-sponsored incentives offered to tenants moving into the complex. The incentives, initiated to draw companies to the outer boroughs, and indeed to keep them from leaving the city, are savings on real estate taxes, on commercial occupancy taxes and on sales taxes for any interior construction work. There are also savings on electricity, which is supplied at low rates by the Power Authority of the State of New York. **********Mr. Reiser said that relocating to the Teleport had saved his company 40 to 50 percent on maintenance and operating expenses alone. **********Another factor is Teleport's unusual position as a high-tech office park. The centerpieces of the development are an 11-acre satellite station for national and international telecommunications and a regional fiber-optic network for data transmission throughout the metropolitan region. Teleport's 24-hour security and communications management on-site also helps, Mr. Speyer said. **********Jeffrey C. Siegel, a senior vice president at Murray Construction, said he was ''guardedly optimistic'' about leasing Teleport II. The tenant for the space already leased is Teleport Management division, which is responsible for operating the communications services at the complex. It is moving from Teleport I, where Allstate will take the space it is vacating there. **********Asking rents at Teleport II are $28 a square foot. The rent at Teleport I averages $26 a square foot. **********Another developer, Lehrer McGovern Bovis of Manhattan, is planning a 120,000-square-foot building on 10 acres at the complex, but it will be a build-to-suit structure for a tenant still to be found. Peter Lehrer, the company's chairman, said he hopes this project will be completed by 1991. In addition to that, a final 6.9-acre site remains open for development."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/13/business/executive-changes-454290.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Bertelsmann Music Group, the music and video subsidiary of the West German media company Bertelsmann A.G., named Lou Maglia president of its new music label, still unnamed, which will be based in Los Angeles. *********** Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., New York, announced the resignation of Ronald A.

What was notable was that the fight involved only one side: bickering leaders of the main anti-Government coalition. **********The scuffle, over who should lead a local march, was overshadowed by an outpouring of support for the coalition's presidential candidate, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who was greeted by the largest crowd of her campaign when she arrived at the rally. Although estimates of the crowd vary, Mrs. Chamorro has routinely begun to draw 10,000 to 15,000 people at her rallies. **********But to the opposition's friends and enemies, the quarrel was a reminder of the precarious foundation of what has become the most important political challenge to the decade-old Sandinista revolution. With less than three weeks left before election day, Feb. 25, the 14-party National Opposition Union is being carried forward by a surge of support, grounded in unhappiness with economic conditions under the Sandinista Government, largely brought about by United States sanctions. **********Riven at All Levels **********There is little solid polling data on whether the opposition has a chance to defeat the Government, which musters huge crowds for its own rallies. Even with recently released American funds to help it along, the Chamorro group is considered an underdog. **********But even at its highest levels, the group remains riven by personal and political divisions that have undercut its campaign and raised doubts about its ability to govern if elected. **********''When you talk about the opposition, you're talking about the people, not the leaders,'' said a diplomat with long experience here. ''If there is a groundswell against the Government, it will come from the bottom up.'' **********Among the underlying weaknesses of UNO, as the opposition coalition is known, is the extraordinary diversity of its parties, which range from conservatives to Communists. Those differences have led to tensions in the coalition's 14-member executive council, and are compounded because the relative strength of many parties has never been proven in a big election. **********It was largely to overcome those disagreements that party leaders reached outside their own ranks for a presidential candidate. Mrs. Chamorro, the widow of the most respected victim of the struggle against Anastasio Somoza Debayle, the deposed dictator, was seen as an ideal, apolitical compromise among the competing parties. ''Violeta Chamorro doesn't have any political identity,'' a Western ambassador in Managua said. ''So every group could project its views within her silhouette.'' **********Though she has bridged the ideological differences of her alliance, Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of Nicaragua's main opposition newspaper, La Prensa, has introduced new frictions of her own, largely by ignoring party leaders in favor of her close advisers, most of whom are tied to her family. **********Tight Circle of Advisers **********Mrs. Chamorro's adviser for political affairs is her eldest son, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro Barrios. Her campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo Oyanguren, is her son-in-law. And the head of her advisers, Alfredo Cesar Aguirre, is Mr. Lacayo's brother-in-law. **********Although technically responsible to the 14-member political council of party leaders, Mrs. Chamorro has relied almost exclusively on her family advisers for campaign strategy. Opposition officials say that the result has been a sharp growth in suspicion and mistrust on both sides. **********Tension has focused particularly on Mr. Cesar, a former contra leader and respected political tactician whose personal ambitions are the subject of deep distrust among traditional party leaders. Resentments among Mrs. Chamorro's circle have in turn centered on Virgilio Godoy Reyes, the veteran Liberal Party leader who is Mrs. Chamorro's vice-presidential running mate. He is seen by many of her supporters as maneuvering to serve as a shadow president if she were to win. **********''Most of the friction has been due not so much to political differences but to the lack of political experience among all Nicaraguans,'' Mr. Lacayo said in an interview at the coalition headquarters. ''Until now, nobody here knew what a campaign was.'' But tensions broke into conflict in November when party leaders voted to expel Mr. Cesar from a post on the political council. **********The problem reached a point of crisis early this year when Mrs. Chamorro was forced to leave the country for treatment of a broken knee. Delays in financing and bureaucratic infighting left the UNO campaign almost invisible for one of its most critical months. **********The situation was saved, diplomats and opposition members say, not by reconciliation in the leadership but by an unexpected outpouring of support on Mrs. Chamorro's return in January. **********On three successive weekends, UNO rallies came alive with an enthusiasm that opposition leaders are at a loss to explain. That surge has been consolidated by the partial release of long-awaited election funds from the United States and other sources, leading to the first noticeable burst of UNO street signs and posters. And it has reassured some restive party leaders that the alliance is worth the effort. **********Gains Miskito Ally **********In an extraordinary step to head off new differences, Mrs. Chamorro and party leaders last week signed an accord, negotiated by Mr. Cesar, reaffirming her allegiance to the 14-party coalition and promising to take their views into account. And the alliance has grown larger, gaining the support of a Miskito Indian group whose leader, Brooklyn Rivera, was today named to Mrs. Chamorro's advisory group. **********Those changes have helped repair the damage from incidents like last Sunday's onstage scuffle, when Mr. Lacayo and a chief aide to Mr. Godoy squared off over the conduct of an opposition march in the town of Posoltega, 50 miles north of Managua. **********With little time left before election day, diplomats and politicians agree that UNO's health is likely to depend not on strategy from its leaders but on the support it receives from the streets. And opposition leaders are betting that the object of their quarreling will also be its cure. ''Most of these problems will be solved,'' predicted Mr. Lacayo, ''when we see the results.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/28/world/strong-drug-foe-wins-in-colombia-by-a-wide-margin.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1990-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1009, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STRONG DRUG FOE WINS IN COLOMBIA BY A WIDE MARGIN", "print_headline": "STRONG DRUG FOE WINS IN COLOMBIA BY A WIDE MARGIN", "body_text": " **********Ignoring terrorist threats by cocaine traffickers, millions of Colombians voted for president today and elected Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, the candidate who advocated the toughest line on the traffickers. **********''This vote is a triumph of democracy over violence,'' said the outgoing President, Virgilio Barco Vargas. **********Voting was largely peaceful and, in many places, festive - a sharp departure from the tense and bloody campaign that claimed the lives of three presidential candidates in nine months. **********''Although we are all afraid, we are ready to fight for peace,'' Arturo Romero, a 23-year-old university student, said as he waited to cast his ballot for Mr. Gaviria at a polling booth here.

''Everyone who wanted to threaten our democracy, listen to us: The people spoke today with courage and clarity. We will overcome,'' he said. He also chastised the industrial countries who ''are doing little to confront the drug consumption problem,'' and appealed for help in fighting arms trafficking and money laundering. **********Mr. Gomez, Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lloreda conceded tonight that Mr. Gaviria had won the race, but Mr. Navarro expressed satisfaction with his showing. **********''We are new political phenomenon of the 1990's in Colombia,'' said Mr. Navarro, whose party, the M-19, abandoned guerrilla warfare in March for a political role. **********The candidate with the most votes wins the election, even if he falls short of 50 percent. **********The early returns were no surprise, since they were predicted in a series of polls conducted in recent weeks. **********A 30-city survey of 15,000 voters conducted by Caracol, a private radio network, predicted that Mr. Gaviria would win 50 percent of the vote, with Mr. Gomez running second with 23 percent. **********Mr. Gaviria said on television after the polls closed at 5 P.M., ''I am supremely optimistic, tranquil and satisfied.'' **********A 43-year-old economist, Mr. Gaviria will be Colombia's youngest President in this century when he takes office on Aug. 7, succeeding Mr. Barco, 68, who cannot constitutionally succeed himself at the end of his four-year term. **********Mr. Barco began a crackdown on the cocaine traffickers last August after Luis Carlos Galan, a popular reform politician who was also a presidential candidate, was fatally dead on the orders of the Medellin cartel. **********With the death of Mr. Galan, Mr. Gaviria, a former Finance Minister, took up his banners of fighting the cocaine processing and exporting business, an industry believed to earn billions of dollars a year for traffickers here. Mr. Gaviria's campaign against the dealers became more vocal as they turned to terrorism, trying to force Colombia to abandon its policies of seizing laboratories and extraditing Colombian suspects to the United States for trial. **********''We have to break terrorism, we have to defeat terrorism,'' the candidate said in an interview on Friday in his heavily fortified camapaign headquarters here. **********''We don't have many alternatives,'' said Mr. Gaviria, who was better known here in the 1980's as a conservative tax reformer than as a crime buster. ''We can't allow those practicing terrorism to believe that they can change government policies by placing bombs.'' **********Reflecting the pervasiveness of political violence in Colombia, today's presidential race brought together kidnapper, kidnap victim and negotiator. **********Constitutional Revision Endorsed **********In 1988, Mr. Gomez was kidnapped by the M-19 guerrilla movement, whose second in command was Mr. Navarro. At the time of the kidnapping, Mr. Barco was out of the country. The job of negotiating Mr. Gomez's freedom fell to the President's designated replacement and Minister of Government, Mr. Gaviria. **********Official returns showed that 89 percent of the voters were in favor of a calling for a convention to revise Colombia's 104-year-old Constitution. **********In 1988, Mr. Gaviria's successful negotiation of the M-19 kidnapping was a key factor in elevating the young Cabinet minister in the public eye. **********Besides the three presidential candidates, 262 policemen, 93 soldiers, 3 judges, 15 press employees and about 1,700 other people were slain during the nine-month campaign. But today, the only major violence reported appeared to have been caused by the National Liberation Army, a Marxist guerrilla group that urged an electoral boycott. **********The Defense Ministry reported six attacks today by the guerrilla group, with no casualties. The police reported that four Liberation Army guerrillas were killed today in an operation that freed unharmed a kidnapped petroleum engineer in Bogota. **********As of nightfall, the traffickers had not carried out any major attacks. **********In a nationally broadcast television address, President Barco said he had no doubt that the traffickers' assassinations and bombings or recent months ''were undertaken to intimidate the popular will.'' **********The police announced on Saturday the dismantling of a traffickers' bomb factory in a suburb here and the capture of six members of the ring."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/13/world/management-woes-hobble-us-air-fleet-in-drug-war.html": {"writer_name": "Jeff Gerth", "pub_date": "1990-06-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1722, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Management Woes Hobble U.S. Air Fleet in Drug War", "print_headline": "Management Woes Hobble U.S. Air Fleet in Drug War", "body_text": " **********A private air force organized by the State Department to support United States paramilitary operations against the illicit drug industry in Latin America has developed an array of management problems, officials involved in the program say. **********The program uses private pilots to fly United States Government helicopter gunships, transport planes and crop-dusters used by American drug agents and foreign police officers in operations barred to United States military personnel, like raids on cocaine laboratories. Many of the pilots are veterans of the Vietnam War or of service with the Central Intelligence Agency. **********Tangled Lines of Authority **********The program, begun in 1987, before the Pentagon became active in antidrug efforts, has many problems stemming from the State Department's inexperience in paramilitary and law enforcement activities, documents and officials involved indicate. **********Two outside consulting companies help manage the operations of the private aviation company that runs the program, creating tangled lines of authority. Some of the pilots, who earn up to $150,000 a year, went on strike for higher pay. More than a quarter of the force has been laid off because of cost overruns and 5 of the fleet's 53 planes have been destroyed, resulting in the loss of 10 lives. **********In addition, some personnel were caught pilfering from the Government and a chief operations officer was indicted for conspiring to smuggle drugs from Mexico before taking the State Department job. **********Concern over the program's management has mounted in Congress as the United States has stepped up its anti-drug activities in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, where the line between fighting drugs and fighting insurgencies is becoming increasingly blurred. **********The pilots played a crucial role in the firefight two months ago at an anti-drug base in Santa Lucia, Peru, piloting a helicopter gunship that repelled an attack by the Shining Path guerrillas, who protect the cocaine barons, and helping kill a number of rebels. **********Military Increases Its Role **********The United States military, now committed to broadening its role in anti-drug efforts but barred from direct participation because of the sensitivity of foreign governments, is providing aid in areas like intelligence-gathering and training. All the activities are coordinated by the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, which has been headed since last year by Assistant Secretary of State Melvyn Levitsky. **********In an interview, Mr. Levitsky said that ''while everybody beats up on this air wing,'' the department's management of the operation had improved. He said the program had been successful in building up the ability of other countries to fight drug production and trafficking and in reducing marijuana production in Colombia, Guatemala and Jamaica. **********He added that his bureau was borrowing 30 military officials from the Pentagon to help manage what he called ''an enterprise that is more or less foreign to the culture of the institution in which it is functioning.'' **********The enterprise revolves around a Pennsylvania-based aviation services company, Corporate Jets. Some 150 employees fly and maintain the State Department's fleet of UH-1H and Bell 212 helicopters, T-65 Turbothrush spray planes and various transport aircraft that make up the aerial support program. Based in Opa-Locka, Fla., and operating for security reasons under the name National Air Transport Inc., the enterprise is the linchpin for some of the Government's most sensitive operations. **********The air wing operators use the Florida headquarters for logistical support, but most of the planes are based in Latin America, where they are used in remote areas by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration and foreign police officers to spray crops, supply food and equipment to base camps, make aerial surveys, transport personnel and help interdict drug supply lines. **********The logistical operation includes the maintenance of the air fleet, the supply of fuel and spare parts, and the training of foreign pilots. The work rules for the contract employees are not clearly defined. They are not provided with weapons, though they often carry them, and are not required to be trained in combat operations, although they find themselves in combat situations. **********The State Department's aerial support role stems from a decision by Congress in 1986 that the United States must retain title to aircraft used in anti-drug operations abroad. As the Pentagon was reluctant at the time to become involved, the State Department, which is responsible for anti-drug operations abroad, turned to an outside contractor. The arrangement, officials said, permits the Government to deny the involvement of Federal officials but leaves the United States with less control over the contract employees' actions. **********In the 1960's and 1970's the C.I.A. operated a secret air force in Southeast Asia and elsewhere, including an air charter company, Air America. The company was liquidated in the 1970's, although some of the people who worked for Air America were hired by Corporate Jets and were involved in operations like the firefight in Peru. **********The State Department program has attracted little public attention, though Congress has provided funds for its expansion and reviewed questions about the program raised by department investigators. **********The State Department's Inspector General, Sherman M. Funk, said last year that Corporate Jets had been allowed to operate ''virtually carte blanche.'' And in January the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency found that the company was not complying with numerous parts of its contract. **********Mr. Funk also cited as inappropriate the use of an outside consulting company to prepare the air wing's budget. That company helps oversee Corporate Jets, creating yet another tier of supervision and further blurring the management of the program. **********This same consulting company helped design the 1988 bidding process that was won by Corporate Jets. The contract is now being rebid, again with the consulting company's help, because the earlier contest was flawed, according to public documents. **********Memos Are Unanswered **********State Department investigators praised Mr. Levitsky's recent efforts to improve the bureau's management, but problems remain. The narcotics bureau, which told Congress last year that it provided direction over Corporate Jets on a ''daily basis,'' has not responded in recent months to dozens of memos from the aviation company on all facets of the operation. **********Company officials said they had provided safe and efficient services and charged the State Department with poor management. **********William Smith, a vice president, said in an interview that the department had modified the contract 17 times, had ignored monthly reports and had not responded to 34 memos written between March and May involving issues like export licenses, Pentagon contact, inspections, computer systems, night vision goggle training, and parts and inventory control. **********Andrew Thoms, the narcotics bureau's director of transnational issues, said the memos and reports would be dealt with once an appropriate management information system had been completed by still another consulting company. But department investigators and company employees said the issues raised in the memos required a quicker response. **********Pilots Strike Over Pay **********The issue of combat-related training, including the use of night vision goggles, arose after the Shining Path attack on the Santa Lucia base in Peru, in which at least one pilot, despite rules to the contrary, used night goggles to operate his helicopter. The State Department contract has no provision for such training, Mr. Thoms and Corporate Jets officials said. **********The risky nature of the work led some of Corporate Jets' pilots, who earn $120,000 to $150,000 a year, to strike for higher pay in April. About the same time the company, at the insistence of the State Department, laid off about a quarter of its personnel, including 6 of 14 spray pilots, Mr. Thoms and Mr. Smith said. Budget constraints necessitate a further 10 percent reduction by August. **********Mr. Levitsky said that a 10 percent overrun on spending, one of the causes for the layoffs, was now under control. **********A series of legal problems has also affected the program in the last few months. The company's chief aircraft operations officer in the program was indicted in February for conspiring to smuggle drugs from Mexico before working for the State Department, according to officials and documents. **********And in recent months, according to investigators and documents, a senior company pilot pleaded guilty to theft from the Government and a supervisor pleaded guilty to stealing $150,000 worth of State Department helicopter parts. Other cases involving possible criminal misuse of the program are pending, including an allegation that the former program manager improperly refurbished his own plane with State Department property. **********Last year officials involved in the program told Mr. Funk's auditors that the $64 million cost of aquiring and managing the spare parts inventory could be reduced by a third through better management and procurement practices. **********Mr. Levitsky took issue with that estimate but in the interview referred questions about the department's inventory to Mr. Thoms. Mr. Thoms said he could not provide firm numbers until the Army completed a survey for the State Department. **********Some Planes Are Grounded **********On the loss of the five planes, Mr. Levitsky said that concern about safety had led to the recent grounding of some spray planes. The planes were lost because of mechanical problems, pilot error and sabotage, he said. **********The program's $28 million budget for this year was increased by $4.7 million last month when funds were shifted from other accounts in the narcotics bureau. The bureau, in a shift still under review by Congress, wants to increase its own $113 million budget this year by transferring $16.5 million in military aid for law enforcement efforts in Colombia and Bolivia. **********The Pentagon, which has given its approval to the transfer, is increasingly involved in the air-support program, providing airfields, aircraft, spare parts, investigators and managers, according to documents and officials. **********A new supervisor brought in from the Pentagon, Col. David Rankin, was a military attache in El Salvador during the height of efforts to help the Nicaraguan contras and repel Salvadoran guerrillas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/19/business/new-president-of-macy-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 218, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New President of Macy Unit", "print_headline": "New President of Macy Unit", "body_text": " **********Mark S.

''That is most important. **********''We are making the deepest kind of changes. We are simultaneously making a transformation in politics and in the economy, in the development of democracy and the development of a free market.'' **********Mr. Mazowiecki, a Roman Catholic intellectual and Solidarity supporter, said that perhaps the greatest challenge was what he called his Government's ''courageous'' program of drastic free-market shock therapy, intended to transform Poland's laggard Communist economy into capitalism. **********Dangers of Transformation **********''The very basic issue is the problem of how much the society can withstand,'' he said, referring to the dangers of high prices, production cutbacks and unemployment that could result during the transformation. **********One immediate accomplishment, the Prime Minister said, was Poland's inclusion in border discussions during talks on German reunification involving the two Germanys and the four Allies. ''This insures there will be nothing about us without us.'' **********As Eastern European nations once under Soviet dominance hold elections that will reshape the political map of Europe, Poland remains in the forefront of change. **********When Solidarity was born in the Gdansk shipyards in 1980, Mr. Mazowiecki, along with Bronislaw Geremek, a medieval historian, were among the first intellectuals to support the fledgling trade union. Mr. Geremek now leads the Solidarity bloc in Parliament. **********Eyes Have Haunted Look **********Mr. Mazowiecki, a gray-haired man whose lined, craggy face and deep-set eyes sometimes have a haunted look, was interned for a year after the martial law crackdown in December 1981. Now he is working closely with his old jailers, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, now the President, and Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs. **********Mr. Mazowiecki is capable of a certain dry wit. When he suffered a dizzy spell from overwork when his Cabinet was sworn in last September, he told Parliament: ''I have reached the same state as the Polish economy.'' **********Mr. Mazowiecki played a critical role in the talks last year that led to the legalization of Solidarity and free elections. His prominence as a Catholic intellectual and editor is testimony to the political importance of the Roman Catholic Church here. **********From Conspirator to Governor **********But the transition from conspirator to governor is unlikely to be easy. While there has been wave after wave of workers' protests against Communism for the last four decades, the biggest problem now, he said, is transforming the economy. **********''The society is convinced the economic system has to be changed,'' the Prime Minister said. ''It is convinced the existing system is outdated and a new one creates hope. People are somehow determined that we should go in that direction.'' **********But, he added, ''the situation in which prices are free and wages, practically speaking, frozen is certainly a difficult one. **********''I think we have gone through the most difficult period on the beginning,'' he said. ''The second very hard problem is the drop in production. The third likely problem is the problem of unemployment, which does not exceed 1 percent of the work force. These are very new and quite difficult problems for Polish society.'' **********Production to Drop Further **********Prices skyrocketed when the new economic plan was introduced in January but have begun to fall sharply in recent weeks when consumers stopped buying. This was according to the plan, but future steps are to include a drop in production - already off 20 percent -the closing of inefficient factories and unemployment. **********Opinion polls show Mr. Mazowiecki's Government enjoying widespread support among a population viewing the Government, for the first time, as largely their own. One simple measure is that there have been no strikes despite the economic hardships. **********But there are the beginnings of signs of impatience. **********The most immediate threat is in the field of agriculture, with increasing grumbling, and some protest demonstrations, among private farmers. **********'Wave of Unrest' Among Farmers **********''A wave of unrest is mounting in the countryside,'' a Rural Solidarity spokesman, Piotr Dabrowski, said this week. ''This stems from a lack of a clear, understandable and acceptable agrarian policy of the state and the fact that the program is exceptionally tough on farmers and poses a threat of a fall in farming production.'' **********Mr. Mazowiecki, who recently met with angry farmers, acknowledged that ''dissatisfaction is beginning to manifest itself in agriculture.'' **********One long-term problem of Polish agriculture has been a system of inheritance that has left small strips of farms that cannot be effectively worked, but that farmers cling to. **********'There Should Be Larger Farms' **********''This is one of the problems that we note. There should be larger farms,'' Mr. Mazowiecki said. ''But this can only be changed if you create in the countryside conditions for different types of employment. We need the development of services and a processing industry and private investment. This cannot be done fast. This is only six months of this Government and three months of the reform,'' he said. **********In his inaugural speech last September, in which he emphasized he was taking office as a ''man of Solidarity,'' Mr. Mazowiecki pledged that he would overhaul the army and the police so that Poles would learn ''to treat the state as their own.'' **********Earlier this month, in his most significant appointment thus far, he named an outsider, a Catholic intellectual like himself from the former opposition, as Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, the agency that runs the police, including the old secret security apparatus. The new Minister is Krzysztof Kozlowski, the deputy editor of Tygodnik Powszechny, the respected Catholic weekly that had been the only legal opposition publication under martial law. **********''You might say this is a personnel change, but it is a structural change as well,'' the Prime Minister said. **********''Some people think things are not going fast enough,'' he said. ''But as far as I am concerned, the changes are deep and they require stable conditions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/07/world/fugitive-german-spy-planning-to-surrender-after-elections.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1990-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 940, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fugitive German Spy Planning to Surrender After Elections", "print_headline": "Fugitive German Spy Planning to Surrender After Elections", "body_text": " **********East Germany's former master spy, Markus Wolf, who is in hiding, said today that he intended to return to Germany and hand himself over to the justice authorities after the reunited country holds elections in December. **********As a measure of his influence in formerly Communist East Germany, Mr. Wolf's retirement from the notorious Ministry for State Security in September 1986 was kept secret for six months, apparently not to diminish respect in the West for the foreign intelligence operation he built up over 33 years. **********Mr. Wolf, 67 years old, was interviewed by reporters from the weekly Stern, but the magazine abided by his wish not to disclose his location. \"Among your readers there is also the general prosecutor for the state,\" he said. Since early October, when the two Germanys united, the Bonn Government has made it known that it is seeking Mr. Wolf on espionage charges. **********Puzzlement over the whereabouts of Mr. Wolf has been a major topic of speculation since he disappeared from his East Berlin apartment shortly after the Government said it would seek to arrest him. **********Alluding to that announcement, Mr. Wolf told his interviewers that the publicity surrounding his case prompted him to flee Germany. Reported in Hungary **********Though Mr. Wolf has remained in hiding, the Bild newspaper, a sensational daily that has nonetheless obtained reliable information on espionage and security issues, said it would report in its Wednesday edition that Mr. Wolf escaped Germany through Prague, Vienna and Switzerland to Hungary, where it said he has been receiving treatment for a disk ailment. **********It said he intends to travel shortly to Moscow to present the Russian-language edition of his best-selling book, \"Troika.\" The book describes the lives of three families who lived together in Moscow and followed separate paths during World War II. **********After retiring from the Ministry for State Security, Mr. Wolf became a leading public proponent of change in East Germany. In the interview he described a meeting early in 1989 with the East German Communist leader, Erich Honecker, that Mr. Wolf said he sought to protest censorship of parts of a film about his father, Friedrich Wolf, a prominent doctor and early Communist in prewar Germany. **********But Mr. Wolf said the \"main topic of the conversation was the increasing rejection of the Gorbachev course by the party leadership\" and the persecution of Communist Party members who promoted change. **********\"The G.D.R. was on the way to becoming a second Albania,\" he said, referring to East Germany by the initials of its formal name. Impression of Thoughtfulness **********Throughout the interview, Mr. Wolf appeared to be at pains to project an image of himself as a reform-minded Communist, and to emphasize the role of Communists, and even officials in the state security service, in promoting change in East Germany. As in past interviews, he projected an image of himself as a man whose access to information and license to ponder the growing problems of his homeland galvanized his oppostion to the status quo. **********In a kind of confession, he said, \"Everyone who had a high function in a socialist country in the last decades bears responsiblity, if not in a legal then in a moral sense.\" **********But he insisted that he remains a Communist, \"at least in the sense of the ideals,\" and a member of the Party of Democratic Socialism, the much-weakened successor to the East German Communist Party. **********Mr. Honecker's steadfast resistance to the changes promoted by the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, long after they had been adopted in other East European countries was among the factors that accelerated his fall and speeded the collapse of Communism in East Germany. **********Mr. Wolf, a large, dapper man who in his heyday sported well-tailored suits, described how officers of the state security, known as the Stasi, posted notices at their headquarters in the waning months of Communist rule calling for change. Rumblings at the Stasi **********In the courtyard of the huge Stasi complex, in a residential area of East Berlin, \"there was a demonstration in which demands were raised for changes in the leadership, for changes in activity,\" he said. **********Criticizing management of the Stasi, Mr. Wolf suggested in the interview that the mountains of information it gathered on people in all walks of life ultimately worked to its undoing. \"In this mass of information you could lose sight of that which the security organ of a state is actually supposed to be doing,\" he said. **********Mr. Wolf said the course of events in Eastern Europe had forced him to re-evalute his work. **********\"We know the horrible and tragic example of how Stalin handled the information about the coming war,\" he said, alluding to the view that the wartime Soviet leader had obtained advance information of the impending invasion of Russia in 1941 by Nazi forces, but had refused to act on it on political grounds. **********Mr. Wolf confessed that until about November 1989, he had been convinced that the suppression of freedom under Communism had been \"deformations\" in need of correction, but that he had gradually come to the conviction that \"this entire system, from the beginning, was incapable of functioning.\" **********\"That is naturally a bitter conviction,\" he went on, \"because one must naturally then pose the question whether one has lived in vain.\" **********But he said he remained convinced that \"certain values\"of Communism persisted, \"even if for the time being they have been buried over for the long term.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/30/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;   People", "body_text": " *********** Daniel H.

It is left to the journalists themselves to decide whether to show their reports to censors, and most never do. **********Request From Immigration **********An official in the Prime Minister's office explained that the new order was issued at the request of the immigration authorities because of Arab opposition to the wave of new immigrants and because of the possibility that some Soviet immigrants might be attacked on their way here. **********But the order was not limited to information about how the Soviet Jews arrive. It was sweeping. The army communique, issued to everyone in the domestic and foreign press, read, ''The army censor announces that all material pertaining to the immigration of Soviet Jews must be submitted to the censor prior to publication.'' **********The Association of Foreign Correspondents in Israel issued a protest today. And recognizing that the order was likely to cause criticism and debate, the official in the Prime Minister's office said the question of whether the censorship requirement would be kept in place will be put before the Cabinet, which is to meet on Sunday. **********It was Mr. Shamir himself who drew Arab attention to Soviet Jewish immigration and the possibility that some of the immigrants might move to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. **********''Shamir's talk of a big Israel can't be forgiven,'' said the Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres. ''It caused damage that can't be fixed.'' **********Mr. Shamir's ''big Israel'' speech, as it has come to be known, has set off almost two months of extraordinary and continuous complaint from all quarters, and especially from the Arab world. Last month, the Soviet Union retracted a commercial agreement to begin direct flights between Israel and the Soviet Union for Soviet immigrants because of Arab protests over Mr. Shamir's remark. **********Now most immigrants fly to Budapest or Bucharest, Romania, where they transfer to El Al charter flights -a cumbersome and not always reliable process that cannot accommodate the numbers of Soviet Jews who want to leave. Direct flights were badly needed, and Mr. Shamir's political opponents blame him for the Soviet refusal. **********But Avi Pazner, a close aide to the Prime Minister, said it was unfair to attribute all that to Mr. Shamir. **********''That's a mistake,'' he said. ''The Arabs were already worried by the big numbers'' and would have protested to Moscow even without Mr. Shamir. **********Still, no one in the Arab world or anywhere else had openly complained about the huge wave of Soviet immigration before Mr. Shamir's speech -despite at least six months of intense press converage of the matter. **********About 10,300 Soviet Jews moved to Israel in the first two months of 1990, almost as many as arrived in all of 1989. The numbers grow larger every month, causing Israel to constantly enlarge its estimates. **********Last fall, when the state budget was drafted, officials were expecting 40,000 Soviet Jews to arrive in 1990. Money was allocated for settling that many. But by the time the budget was put into place at the start of the year, the estimate had risen to 100,000. Then last week, an immigration official said the latest estimate was that 230,000 Soviet immigrants would move here next year. **********Israel is requesting more than $1 billion in loans, gifts and donations from American Jews and from the United States Government to help pay for resettling the Soviet Jews. And paradoxically, Government officials have openly and repeatedly solicited American reporters to write articles on the size and scope of the immigration wave, in the hope that the news coverage would encourage donations. **********Reacting to the criticism this evening, a senior Government official noted that the subject of immigration is included on the Government's long list of possibly censorable topics, along with most everything else that could be the subject of news articles here. But most items on the long list are never actually subjected to censorship. **********The only recent time when censorship has been imposed on immigration articles was in 1985, when Israel was secretly airlifting thousands of Jews from Ethiopia. As the official noted, when someone broke the censorship and published an article about the airlift, the Ethiopians canceled it. **********U.S. GROUP DECLINES TO COMMENT **********The American Jewish organization that most closely monitors Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union said yesterday that it preferred ''not to comment at the moment'' on the Israeli Government's decision to censor news reports from there on the immigration of Soviet Jews into Israel. **********The remark, by Martin A. Wenick, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, was relayed to a reporter by Debra Strober, a spokeswoman for the organization. **********Ms. Strober said the Ministry of Absorption in Israel ''provides figures'' on immigration to the conference ''on a monthly basis and we've had no indication that this will cease.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/30/world/upheaval-in-the-east-rumania-to-an-old-party-chief-the-menace-is-familiar.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1990-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1084, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Upheaval in the East: Rumania;   To an Old Party Chief, The Menace Is Familiar", "print_headline": "Upheaval in the East: Rumania;   To an Old Party Chief, The Menace Is Familiar", "body_text": " **********In the early morning, before angry crowds began to surge against the gates of the headquarters of the Peasants' Party, the party's 74-year-old president, Corneliu Coposu, presided in his corner office, chain-smoking Kent cigarettes. **********Before the revolution, the 19th-century building at 34 Boulevard Republicii, with its high ceilings, antique furniture and lace curtains, was used by the Communist Party for special receptions. Today, the atmosphere inside seemed odd and quaint compared with the high-pitched political drama that soon enveloped the street below. **********By midmorning, the crowds outside had become vociferous and threatening, spreading across the street, stopping traffic. The chants took on an increasingly menacing tone. ''Traitors!'' the demonstrators shouted, jutting their fists into the air. ''Coposu, pack your bags and get out of the country!'' **********Inside, people stayed away from the windows, since each time the curtains parted the roar outside grew louder. **********Show of Support Asked **********The crowds were mobilized after an appeal by members of the ruling National Salvation Front on radio and television Sunday for a show of support against opposition groups that were represented as enemies of the revolution. **********As the day wore on, the drama intensified. Calls were made to the Prime Minister, Petre Roman, asking for police and army protection. A delegation of army officers soon arrived, offering to escort Mr. Coposu and other party leaders out of the besieged building. They refused at first, although Mr. Coposu eventually agreed to leave in an armored personnel carrier to make a statement at the television station. **********At about noon, a man in a fur hat with a matching collar burst into the office, announcing himself to be a lawyer ''with two licenses'' and a spokesman for the crowd. Standing back from Mr. Coposu's desk, he erupted into a finger-pointing lecture, warning the Peasants' Party president to leave the building by 1:30 P.M. and get on a plane out of the country. **********His sputtering speech was a litany of historical grievances against the Peasants' Party, ending with an accusation that had become a commonplace with the crowd. ''On Dec. 21 and 22, while we had a revolution in Rumania,'' he said, ''you were sitting in the warmth of Paris, getting fat on the Champs d'Elysees.'' **********The charge that the Peasants' Party is made up of returning emigres seems to stem from publicity about the decision by several former emigrants to rejoin the party. But Mr. Coposu has been in Rumania through the entire Communist era, a point on which he said he wanted to defend himself today on national television. **********No Calming the Crowd **********At 1:30 P.M., the Prime Minister, Mr. Roman, arrived with Cazimir Ionescu, another leader of the front. Going onto the balcony, Mr. Roman tried to calm the crowd, which by now had grown to several thousand. When they could not hear him, he clambered over the side to a soundtruck that had a megaphone. When that also failed, he climbed back into the building for more intense negotiations with Mr. Coposu. **********Through the day, messengers arrived with news from other parts of the country and the city. Party offices in Roman and other towns were reported under attack, he said. Windows had been broken in two other party offices in Bucharest. **********Mr. Coposu, calm and still except for the heavy smoking, never changed expression during the agitation. ''I am not shocked by this,'' he said. ''We are used to this because we have 45 years of Communist methods. They are using the same measures, and the same men.'' **********Since 1947, Mr. Coposu who had been a young leader in the Peasants' Party, has spent 17 years in prison, eight in solitary confinement. He was amnestied in 1965, and spent a year and a half in internal exile. His wife, tried as a French spy, died in prison. After his return to Bucharest, Mr. Coposu, a legal scholar, worked as a mechanic and was kept under close watch. By his reckoning, his house was searched 27 times and he was called in for questioning by the police 200 times. **********With him in the room today was some old comrades from Communist prisons. Like Mr. Coposu, Serban Ghica, 70 years old, had been arrested on July 14, 1947, with thousands of others from the Peasants Party as the Communist Party tightened its grip on the country. **********''After we were released, we kept in contact, although we never talked about politics,'' Mr. Ghica said. ''But we always knew that when they left, we could find each other.'' **********Seeking a Comeback **********The first gathering of about 50 former Peasants' Party leaders took place on Dec. 23, the day after the revolution that overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist leader. They issued a broadsheet that soon made its way around the city. **********Since then, the party has been seeking a comeback, although it is still a pale shadow of its prewar strength. On Jan. 11, it claimed 37,000 members in Bucharest and 148,000 in the rest of the country. **********On Sunday, the Peasants' Party was at the head of a demonstration of about 20,000 people that filed to the headquarters of the National Salvation Front, the ruling group that replaced Mr. Ceausescu. Among its members is Silviu Brucan, who Mr. Coposu today said had been chief of the Communist Party press in 1947 and who had called for the death penalty against Mr. Coposu then. **********Today, the Peasants' Party was hit by a backlash, unleashed by some of the people they had struggled against 42 years ago. **********When Mr. Coposu left his house this morning, he said, there were a dozen men - all drunk, he said - who hurled insults at him as he made his way to the headquarters.

Yet at the end of the chorus, Arab-American voices add one word: but. *********** But why are the American Government and American news organizations so ready to go beyond condemnation and demonize an Arab leader, evoking images of barbarism that Arab-Americans fear may be rooted as much in ethnic stereotypes as in Mr. Hussein's own history? *********** But why does Iraq's crossing of Kuwait's border lead to a rapid deployment of American troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia, when Israel's crossing into Lebanon in 1982 provoked no such action? *********** And always there, though often muted: But what will happen to us? **********''It's a serious emotional and political burden when your country is fighting your people,'' said Khalil Jahshan, a Palestinian who handles public relations for the National Association of Arab-Americans. **********A Concept of Nationhood **********Mr. Jahshan was one of a number of prominent Arab-Americans, interviewed in recent days, who responded to the crisis with both dispassionate analysis and emotional reflection on the history that unites and divides their people. **********Among Arab-Americans, as in the Arab world, the concept of Arab nationhood - of respect, power and influence for an entire people - exerts a powerful pull, Mr. Jahshan said. ''It's not a movement, not a political party,'' he went on. ''It's basically an emotional desire for Arabs to be one. It's based on the notion of a glorious Arab past, and it's reinforced by the failures of recent history.'' **********The drawing and redrawing of national boundaries in the Middle East over the last century have left the two and a half million Arab-Americans with emotional ties to both present and former lands - Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq - and to a larger concept of kinship. **********''When I was growing up in a Lebanese Maronite home in Utica, N.Y., and an Egyptian would come and visit, we kids would be in the kitchen wanting to get a peek at him because he was one of our guys,'' said James Zogby, the 44-year-old president of the Arab American Institute, a Washington lobbying group. ''There is a sense of commonness in culture, tradition and language.'' **********The ''serious emotional and political burden'' cited by Mr. Jahshan can result from a clash between that sense of unity and Arab-Americans' sense of loyalty to the United States. ''For Arab-Americans, this is their first country,'' said Osama Siblani, a native of Lebanon who is publisher of Sada al-Watan, a Detroit newspaper whose circulation of 20,000 makes it the largest Arab-American paper in the United States. ''America is where they chose to live. They fled persecution, oppression and poverty. And now they will try to prevent a catastrophe on both ends.'' **********Focus of Dialogue Changes **********The crisis in the Persian Gulf has wrenched the Arab-American dialogue away from its usual focus on Israel and the Palestinian question and into equally complex terrain involving the Arab states' relations with one another and the resentment of the impoverished Arab countries toward the sheikdoms enriched by oil. But Israel and the perceived inequities of American policy in the Middle East are never far beneath the surface. **********Mr. Zogby, Mr. Jahshan and others repeatedly invoke the comparison with Israel's 1982 invasion, although the comparison does not take into account a crucial difference: that Kuwait had not attacked Iraq, while southern Lebanon was home to Palestinian bases that had repeatedly shelled Israeli territory. Still, the distinction does little to eliminate the perception of Arab-Americans that United States policy in the Middle East has not been evenhanded. **********''Kuwait must be restored,'' said Mr. Zogby. ''Saudi Arabia must be defended. But it is incumbent on America, if we want to win the hearts and minds of the Arab people, to be consistent to principle.'' He said Arab-Americans were ''looking to see that this is more than just a defense of oil.'' **********Many Arab-Americans share another concern: that an American campaign against an Arab state, in this case Iraq, could lead to a backlash against Arabs at home. James G. Abourezk, a Lebanese-American who is a former Senator from South Dakota and now heads the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said a violent anti-Arab telephone message had recently been left on an answering machine at the group's Western regional headquarters. In 1985, at the time of the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro by a group of Palestinians, the Anti-Discrimination Committee's Western regional director, Alex Odeh, was killed by a bomb in his office. No one has been convicted or even indicted for the attack. **********Borders Are Colonial **********''By and large the Arab community supports the economic sanctions'' imposed against Iraq by the United Nations, Mr. Abourezk said, ''but I think they are very much opposed to U.S. troop intervention.'' If war breaks out between Arabs and Americans, he said, ''it's not going to be comfortable for people of Arab descent.'' **********Hisham Melhem, a Lebanese who was the Washington correspondent for al-Qabas, the leading Kuwaiti newspaper, said: ''Most Arabs, emotionally and intellectually, when they look at the map and see the borders among the gulf states or among Lebanon and Syria, Jordan and Iraq, they know that these were not historic national boundaries but boundaries drawn by colonial powers.'' **********People do not want to live in a country controlled by Mr. Hussein, Mr. Melhem went on, ''because they know how repressive he is.'' But he indicated that he was troubled by the reaction of Americans to the Iraqi President. Mr. Hussein has ''taken over Khomeini's position,'' he said. **********''It seems now, beyond Communism, you like to look for someone who is the embodiment of evil,'' he said. ''If it's not Arafat, it's Qaddafi. If not Qaddafi, Noriega. If not Noriega, then it's Saddam. Saddam obviously is a dictator and has his place in the hierarchy of dictatorship.

''I raised the curtain on something they did not want to see.'' True Marxism? **********From her little Khrushchev-era apartment in this former summering ground of the czarist nobility a few miles from Leningrad, she now watches the struggle for the soul of her party with a mix of bitterness and hope.

[In a telephone interview on Saturday, Mrs. Andreyeva also welcomed the victory of Ivan K. Polozkov, her favorite candidate to head the Russian party. ''This may lead to the departure from the Communist Party of the so-called democrats and social democrats, those who call for civil peace at the cost of betraying socialism,'' she said. ''It will promote the consolidation of the sincerely Bolshevik forces.'']  If Mrs. Andreyeva is slipping to the margins of history, as the polls and election results suggest, she is comforted by knowing she is not going alone. She is now the leader of an organization called Unity, for Leninism and Communist Ideals, whose strength she declines to estimate because the local cells in 38 cities and towns, in true Bolshevik fashion, send her no central list of their members. **********The group is waiting in the wings to reorganize itself as a neo-Bolshevik party, she said, if the new Russian party fails to arrest the Communists' slide toward capitalism. **********There are, moreover, the 15,000 letters - counted, sorted and filed on the bookshelves alongside the memoirs of every Soviet leader. Most, she says, vindicate her view that the ordinary people are not ready for ''bourgeois democracy'' and the marketplace. **********''There is nothing at all to buy this year,'' she says, apologizing for the modest offerings on her table and launching into her indictment of Mr. Gorbachev. **********''Every month it's getting worse. The explanation is that the state-run sector is falling apart, and the black-market speculation results in empty shelves in state stores.'' **********Mrs. Andreyeva's explanation for the chronic shortages, a view widely repeated in the shops of nearby Leningrad, is that greedy speculators stimulated by Mr. Gorbachev's policies are buying goods at subsidized prices and then retailing them at huge markups. **********This, she asserts, is aggravated by ''real sabotage.'' **********''There are warehouses full of goods being withheld by people who are waiting for the prices to go up,'' she adds. **********The object of all this is to foist free trade, private property, hired labor and other capitalist notions on a befuddled Soviet public. **********''The crisis we see today is specially planned and organized, and not the last violin in this orchestra is played by our democrats,'' she said.'' **********Mrs. Andreyeva thinks that state-run system has been sold short. She has never been to the West, but she doubts that it can match the cheap rail pass that takes her by electric train to her job at the Leningrad Chemical and Technical Institute, or the free hospital where her husband is convalescing from a heart attack. **********The heart attack, she adds, is on the heads of those who marked her as the Darth Vader of Soviet affairs and led to her husband's being driven from his job as chairman of the philosophy department at her institute. **********A Capitalist 'Betrayal' Seen **********When Mrs. Andreyeva first met a Western reporter 20 months ago, she was circumspect in assessing Mr. Gorbachev. Now she brands him the mastermind of a counterrevolution in three stages: the discrediting of Soviet history and ''anti-Stalinist hysteria,'' the creation of a presidency not beholden to the party - ''a betrayal of the working people,'' and now the introduction of private property. **********Mrs. Andreyeva prefers not to be described as a Stalinist, the dictator's name being redolent with unpleasant connotations, but she defends Stalin as a man misjudged. **********''Stalin was a wise statesman, an extraordinary personality who performed under extremely complicated historical conditions,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/13/business/company-news-lilly-ends-output-of-60-products.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 191, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Lilly Ends Output Of 60 Products", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Lilly Ends Output Of 60 Products", "body_text": " **********Eli Lilly & Company has discontinued manufacturing 60 products and versions of products, according to a notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around the country.

But if it can manage to sell the troubled institutions and their assets at prices more favorable than expected, the budgetary hit will be less. **********But few banking experts believe that will happen because of predictions that real estate markets are going to continue to soften and that in the end Resolution Trust, which has so far taken over 318 savings units, will have to take over many more than the 500 institutions initially projected. **********Troubles Far From Over **********In fact, figures released by the nation's chief savings regulators today indicated that the industry's difficulties are far from over. **********The Office of Thrift Supervision announced that in October the nation's 2,895 savings and loan associations lost $4.5 billion in deposits, only a moderate improvement from the $5.4 billion loss in September. **********The agency said that for the previous 12 months, the industry lost a total of $65 billion in deposits. **********The deposits have shrunk for a variety of reasons. Beginning late in 1988, nervousness about the financial condition of the industry, as well as much higher rates offered by money market mutual funds, prompted depositors to withdraw large sums. **********More Burden on Taxpayers **********That caused many financial experts to warn that because the President's bailout plan called for the industry to pay part of the cost through higher deposit insurance premiums, any loss of deposits would reduce that contribution, putting more financial burden on the taxpayer. **********The President's plan predicted that deposits would grow at about a 7 percent rate, or $70 billion a year. **********But later in the year, when rates began to fall and provisions of the bailout approved by Congress in August became effective, a different dynamic kicked in. The new law called for savings and loan owners to invest higher levels of their own cash in their institutions, or risk losing control. As a result, many institutions that could not raise new money began to sell assets and offer lower interest rates, letting deposits drain off. **********Bank board officials said today that that trend continued through October and was not likely to stop. **********Playing a key role in overseeing that shrinkage will be the Resolution Trust Corporation, which, along with the Oversight Board, was set up by the bailout plan. The agency is managed on a day-to-day basis by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********Four-Volume Listing **********The list released by the trust agency on Tuesday detailed the real estate for sale from the assets of 283 troubled institutions seized as of Sept. 30. **********Effectively putting for-sale signs on 30,123 properties, the agency sent the listing to Congress and began to make it available to the public. **********The agency divides the properties into two books of residential listings, a third book for commercial properties and one for undeveloped land that can be as small as a 2,048-square-foot lot on Frenchmen Street in New Orleans or as large as a 77,626-acre farm in Gilbert, Ariz. **********As expected, the largest number of properties are in the Southwest, where the energy collapse early in the 1980's created a major regional depression, causing both banks and savings institutions to fail. Texas has 15,750 properties listed; Oklahoma, 1,575; Louisiana, 2,434, and Arizona, 1,711. Maine, Vermont, West Virginia and North and South Dakota are the only states in which property is not listed. **********Updates Every 6 Months **********The inventory of properties will be updated every six months, with the next one scheduled for June 1. **********The guidelines under the Oversight Board's strategic plan said Resolution Trust could provide buyers with short-term options for returning to the Government those assets they find are more troubled than first realized. It also permits the agency to give buyers short-term financing in their purchase of ailing institutions to give them time to come up with longer financing. **********The strategic plan also instructs the trust agency to give preferential treatment to minorities in the sale of minority-held institutions. For example, Daniel P. Kearney, president of the Oversight Board, said that if a bid from a minority organization is less costly than a liquidation, ''the R.T.C. is not required to solicit other bids.'' **********It also set certain guidelines to avoid conflicts of interest in any of transaction, like requiring that ''all communications initiated by senior public officials or their staffs that are intended to influence a case are to be logged and the records made public,'' Mr. Kearney said. **********Fair Value Mandated **********But the Oversight Board officials said they did not expect that their mandate to the trust agency to sell assets quickly would result in dumping. They said that the bailout law, signed on Aug. 9, prohibits the agency from selling any asset at less than 95 percent of its current appraised value. **********Moreover, they said their primary concern would be if the trust agency withheld assets from the market in anticipation of an upturn in value; such vast amounts of unsold real estate might keep market prices depressed even longer. **********''The real danger is falling prices if you don't sell the real estate,'' said John Ross, an economist with the Oversight Board. **********One issue that the strategic plan did not address is the need by the trust corporation for vast amounts of interim borrowings so that it can finance the sales of troubled savings institutions. Although the total cleanup by the agency of about 500 institutions has been estimated to cost $50 billion, the actual amount of cash flow far exceeds that. **********Mr. Kearney said he had received estimates from L. William Seidman, chairman of the trust agency, that $50 billion to $100 billion in medium-term borrowings would be needed over the next three years in addition to the original $50 billion. That would eventually be paid back out of the proceeds from the asset sales. **********Basic Bidding Process **********The procedure for buying a troubled institution is primarily through the traditional bidding process set up by the F.D.I.C., in which investors are given basic information about an institution and invited to submit bids. **********Purchasing real estate will be done in a number of different ways. Many properties are listed with local real estate agents, while others will be given to local real estate specialists to market to investors. Resolution Trust itself will end up selling probably some of the largest assets to interested buyers. **********The listing can be ordered by calling 1-800-431-0600. The four books combined cost $50, the two residential volumes are $15 each and the commercial and land volumes are $10 each. The lists are also being distributed to 1.400 libraries across the country. **********Here is the list, by state, of the number of real estate properties for sale by the Resolution Trust Corporation: **********Alabama, 178; Alaska, 349; Arizona, 1,711; Arkansas, 340; California, 397; Colorado, 1,586; Connecticut, 2; Delaware, 2; District of Columbia, 1; Florida, 1,288; Georgia, 744; Hawaii, 5; Idaho, 11; Illinois, 207; Indiana, 27; Iowa, 19; Kansas, 332; Kentucky, 38; Louisiana, 2,434; Maine, 0; Maryland, 16; Massachusetts, 5; Michigan, 12; Minnesota, 113; Mississippi, 384; Missouri, 76. **********Montana, 43; Nebraska, 68; Nevada, 34; New Hampshire 1; New Jersey, 11; New Mexico, 637; New York, 12; North Carolina, 83; North Dakota, 0; Ohio, 115; Oklahoma, 1,575; Oregon, 102; Pennsylvania, 152; Rhode Island, 3; South Carolina, 78; South Dakota, 0; Tennessee, 344; Texas, 15,750; Utah, 629; Vermont, 0; Virginia, 103; Washington, 59; West Virginia, 0; Wisconsin, 36; Wyoming, 12."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/03/business/brazil-and-argentina-seeking-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1040, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazil and Argentina Seeking Aid", "print_headline": "Brazil and Argentina Seeking Aid", "body_text": " **********Despite a backlog of more than $11 billion in interest owed to commercial bankers, Brazil and Argentina will be negotiating for new official aid when the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meet in Washington next week. **********And both countries are likely to win approval of aid in the next several months, underscoring one of the major changes in third world debt policy since the announcement of the Bush Administration's new approach just over a year ago. **********The new strategy, in addition to calling for the voluntary reduction of debt, also allows for continuing negotiations and financial support from the international financial institutions, even when the countries are far behind in their commercial-loan payments. Bank loans make up the major portion of third world debt. **********Debate Over Policy Change **********There has been strong support for this change in policy within the I.M.F and the Bush Administration and among some experts on the debt crisis. But it also worries others, especially the bankers who are owed the interest. **********The Institute for International Finance, which was established by commercial banks, is expected to criticize the policy in a report to be released today. The report, which says the payment backlog now totals $18 billion, with more than half of it owed by Brazil and Argentina, will conclude that the policy is an incentive for countries to miss their loan payments. The practice, the report says, could become a habit and, even more importantly, spread to international institutions like the I.M.F. and the World Bank. **********Because of this policy, said one official familiar with the institute report, ''it seems that countries are using arrears'' as a way to ease pressure on their economies. **********No Other Option **********But in the case of Brazil, with arrears of $5.1 billion, and Argentina, with $6.1 billion, some officials and bankers see no way to deal with the problems before the countries get aid from the I.M.F., or before they begin debt-reduction negotiations with their commercial bankers. **********To refuse the aid, as long as the countries are taking approved steps to restructure their economies, would just aggravate the problems in each of the countries, officials said, and would favor the banks in debt negotiations. **********A precedent for this kind of negotiation - with countries still in arrears - has been established in some of the deals already reached under the debt strategy named for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. **********Venezuela was $600 million behind in loan payments while negotiating with its commercial bankers. As part of the agreement reached in March, Venezuela paid off these arrears. Costa Rica, which also negotiated while in arrears, agreed to pay off 20 percent of its backlog at the time of its agreement and the rest over several years. **********'Bankers Were Very Unhappy' **********''It is true that bankers were very unhappy with this change in policy,'' said one banker who will be involved in negotiations with Brazil. ''But it is also true that it is probably necessary for the I.M.F. to have negotiations with Brazil because the arrears are so large.'' **********If the I.M.F. refused aid outright to countries in arrears, added John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, ''the bargaining advantage is too heavily with the commercial banks. By standing pat they could bring all assistance to a country to a halt.'' **********But Mr. Williamson and the banker insisted that the policy would get out of hand if the I.M.F. didn't insist on strong economic reform programs and some prompt payments to the commerical banks. **********Argentina Exemplifies the Risks **********Argentina is an example of the risks of the arrears policy. Argentina won a standby agreement with the I.M.F. last September and received one payment of $240 million from its $1.4 billion allotment. This agreement came soon after the inauguration of Argentina's new President, Carlos Saul Menem, and amid hope that he would be able to make the changes necessary to bring down rampant inflation and open the economy to foreign investment. But the program has run into serious problems since then, and the I.M.F. has stopped any further aid. **********Argentine officials have submitted a new economic program to the I.M.F. and are hoping to get the standby loan reactivated. One official said that ''it's a strong possibility'' the request would be granted. **********Brazil can make a stronger case to the I.M.F. for aid. However, even if the I.M.F. approves a standby aid program for Brazil, the arrears problem could still make negotiations with its commerical bankers on debt reduction difficult. **********Brazil Seeking Debt Reductions **********Brazilian officials have said the country would not make payments of more than $5 billion a year on its foreign loans, including those from the international institutions and commerical banks. The Brazilian Ambassador in Washington, Marcilio Marques Moreira, said the Government had not yet decided on its strategy for debt negotiations, except that it will seek substantial debt reductions. **********He said that the Government wanted to work out a deal with I.M.F. first so that it could have a ''basic agreement'' before negotiating with the commerical lenders. Such an agreement, which would include I.M.F. approval of the Government's new economic policy, would give Brazil extra support in its negotiations with its bankers. **********Another banker who will be involved in negotiaitons with Brazil said he was not too concerned about the $5 billion limit on loan payments. He thinks it is a negotiating position. But, he added, ''No doubt it is going to be a tough negotiation.'' **********He said that Brazil had more economic potential than Mexico or Venezuela, which have already reached debt agreements under the Brady plan. But President Fernando Collor de Mello must prove that his radical economic program can halt hyper-inflation in Brazil, where prices rose 48-fold in the 12 months through March. The heart of the program is a freeze for 18 months on about 75 percent of the country's bank deposits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/29/business/ual-shares-jump-on-davis-s-offer.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UAL Shares Jump On Davis's Offer", "print_headline": "UAL Shares Jump On Davis's Offer", "body_text": " **********The UAL Corporation's stock price jumped $6.625 today, to $97.25, on the New York Stock Exchange after the investor Marvin Davis offered late Thursday to join an employee buyout of the company, which runs United Airlines. **********In a letter to Gerald Greenwald, head of the United Employee Acquisition Corporation, Mr. Davis indicated his proposal would give the employee group more time to arrange financing for its buyout. **********The UAL board has already accepted $201 a share, or $4 billion, for the company, but Wall Street has doubted whether the group can complete financing for the long-running deal.

But now, with the pace of corporate takeovers slowing and company profits declining, there are increasing signs that corporations will no longer purchase shares with abandon. **********This apparent retreat has worried Wall Street and has played a big role in the recent stock market fall. With the Dow Jones industrial average off 5.85 points yesterday, to 2,553.38, it is now down 9 percent from the peak of 2,810.15 it reached on Jan. 2. **********''The support that corporations provided in the past is no longer there,'' said Carmine Grigoli, chief portfolio strategist for First Boston. **********Concern Is Understandable **********The concern on Wall Street is understandable. Last year, for example, American corporations were the main force behind the 27 percent rise in share prices, purchasing over $100 billion worth of shares more than they sold, Goldman, Sachs estimates. By contrast, American financial institutions and individual investors sold more shares than they bought. **********Rising interest rates around the world, brought on by inflation fears in West Germany and Japan, have also been an important cause of the market's weakness. Those rates stabilized in recent days, helping to stem the decline on Wall Street at least temporarily. **********Other forces cited by analysts as contributing to the slippage include concerns about higher oil prices and falling corporate profits as the economy slows. **********Buyers Must Be Willing **********But in the end, share prices rise when buyers are willing to buy, and decline when they are not. And the prospect of corporations pulling back as a major buying force could well hurt prices considerably. **********Yet it could also help to slow, or perhaps reverse, the trend toward an ever-growing level of debt for American companies, because much of the corporate share-buying was financed with borrowed money. A lightened debt burden would give American companies a more sturdy financial foundation, making them better able to compete with foreign companies and more likely to survive a recession. **********For generations, it was taken for granted that corporations would normally be sellers of stock, as they issued shares to finance expansion and to pay for takeovers. But as debt-financed takeovers became much more common during the 1980's, many companies began to buy their own shares as an act of defense, hoping that by keeping share prices relatively high they would discourage raiders. **********In 1988, according to Federal Reserve figures, all corporations bought $118 billion more in stock than they issued. For the first nine months of last year, the annual rate was about $129 billion. But Mr. Grigoli said he believed that slowed in the final quarter, for which Government figures are not yet available. The pace of announced mergers, he estimated, was down 35 percent in the October-December period from the pace early in the year. **********In 1990, Mr. Grigoli forecasts, American corporations will be net buyers of only about $50 billion worth of shares, less than half last year's level. **********With the ''junk bond'' market all but closed to new issuers, many companies have less to fear from raiders, so they need not be eager to buy their own shares to increase their stock price. ''There will be less pressure on corporate managers to maximize shareholder value,'' said Leon G. Cooperman, chief executive of the asset management division at Goldman, Sachs. **********In addition, corporate profits have been declining since early last year, according to Commerce Department figures, reducing the available cash companies have on hand for buying their shares or for other purposes. **********It is not easy to trace corporate buybacks of shares. Some companies do not announce purchases, except after long delays, and some announce plans for purchases but do not follow through. But in January, Laszlo Birinyi, head of a market analysis firm that bears his name, said, ''There have been very few announcements.'' **********The trend toward corporate repurchases of shares began in the 1970's, when pioneers like Teledyne Inc. made major buybacks despite criticism that such purchases left the companies financially weaker and amounted to an admission by a management that it had no better investment available to it. **********But by the mid-1980's, those repurchases were much more fashionable. The culmination may have come last fall, when the International Business Machines Corporation announced two repurchase plans, totaling $5 billion, and the General Electric Company said it would buy back $10 billion worth of shares over five years. **********Some analysts say companies will keep buying shares even if the volume is reduced. ''There are still strategic takeovers,'' noted John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, pointing to the pending attempt by Georgia-Pacific to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa. He added that ''the market for new issues of corporate equity securities is not the best'' and concluded, ''We will see less supply of stock.'' Mr. Connolly said the recent retreat of stock prices has been overdone and created a buying opportunity. **********But there are signs that corporate America, which is more heavily indebted now than after any other economic expansion, may be forced to return to issuing shares even if the market is not receptive. Companies like Shearson Lehman Hutton and First Interstate Banks are now trying to sell stock because they need the extra capital. **********Over all, according to calculations by Merrill Lynch, interest payments ate up 25.2 percent of corporate cash flow in the third quarter of last year, a record level. Until last year, the record was 22.7 percent, set in the third quarter of 1974, when cash flow had been severely reduced by a recession. Just how high the figure would go in a new recession is not clear, but the fact that corporate balance sheets are so laden with debt is likely to restrain stock buybacks. **********No one knows the extent to which recent share repurchases have been motivated by fear of raiders, as opposed to a genuine management belief that the shares were a good investment. But it is clear that many raiders who could have obtained financing to go after a company six months ago could not raise the cash to do so now. That motivation is clearly reduced. **********In the long run, there is no need for companies to buy shares to have a bull market. Both individuals and institutional investors now have a smaller proportion of their assets in stocks than they did two decades ago. If they decide to return to those levels, that could more than offset the reduction of demand from corporations to buy stocks. But such a change is not likely to happen quickly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/10/business/bank-accounting-issue-is-dividing-regulators.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1990-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 872, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Accounting Issue Is Dividing Regulators", "print_headline": "Bank Accounting Issue Is Dividing Regulators", "body_text": " **********As Congress and the Bush Administration move toward overhauling the nation's banking system, a debate has begun among regulators over accounting standards that could have a profound effect on the health of the banking industry and on the Government's ability to clean up the savings and loan debacle. **********Regulators from three agencies are debating several proposed changes in how banks account for certain intangible assets and whether these assets should count in satisfying the capital requirements of banks. **********The standard selected by the Government, which could be disclosed as early as this week, could affect the willingness of banks to buy assets of failed savings and loans and the banking industry's ability to meet new capital requirements.  Tougher Standards Urged **********Intangible values result from an institution's paying more for an asset than its book value. Regulators are seeking to impose more stringent accounting standards on intangibles by excluding most of them from being counted toward capital requirements because little or none of their value can be recognized. Many intangibles cannot be sold separately from an institution's underlying assets. **********But industry officials and regulators at some agencies, notably the Resolution Trust Corporation, say that excluding the intangibles from capital requirements would strongly discourage banks from buying the assets of many savings and loans now under the control of the agency. Banks have an increasing pool of intangible assets because they are buying assets of failed savings institutions and are entering the mortgage business. **********\"It will certainly reduce the prices that Resolution Trust will be able to get,\" said John J. Oros, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Company who specializes in mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions.  Conflicting Issues **********The debate presents many of the issues, the politics and the tensions that are expected to emerge next year when Congress and the Administration consider how to reorganize the regulatory structure of banks. **********\"It illustrates the conflict between regulating these institutions and trying to dispose of the assets at the Resolution Trust Corporation,\" said L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which is seeking to encourage banks to increase their capital levels. He is also the chairman of Resolution Trust, which is desperately trying to sell a growing number of failed savings and loans that it has taken over. **********The disagreements between the regulators became apparent earlier this month when the F.D.I.C. board postponed discussion of the matter because of apparent disagreements among the regulators. Mr. Seidman said the board would consider the matter again by mid-December. Focus on Comptroller **********The immediate focus of the debate is at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates Federally chartered banks and has generally been strict about allowing intangibles to be counted as capital. The Comptroller's Office has been taking comments from the banking industry and others on what kinds of intangible assets should be used to satisfy capital standards. **********The standards being phased in would require all banks by 1992 to have capital equal to 8 percent of their assets, adjusted for the risk in the assets. Some analysts have predicted that capital requirements may be further increased in light of the financial difficulties confronting many banks across the nation. **********Some of the nation's largest banks, including Chase Manhattan, Citibank and Chemical, have quietly lobbied for allowing intangibles to be used as capital. They have maintained that the regulators, by excluding intangibles, are overreacting because of their experiences with the savings and loan industry.  View From a Law Firm **********\"There were true excesses in the thrift industry, and that's clearly what's motivating what's happening to treatment of intangibles for banks now,\" said H. Rodgin Cohen, a banking specialist at the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell. **********One group of assets whose treatment is being reconsidered is known as core deposit intangibles. It is the value associated with a financial institution's deposits, in effect, the value of its customer base. When an institution's core deposits are paying depositors a yield that is below the market yield for such deposits, many institutions also recognize an intangible asset from the spread between them. **********The Comptroller's existing standards do not permit core deposit intangibles to count for capital, while the Federal Reserve and the F.D.I.C. have considered them on a case-by-case basis. **********The other type of asset whose treatment is being reconsidered is mortgage-servicing rights. These are contracts bought or held by banks and savings associations under which the institution handles a portfolio of mortgages -- processing the monthly payment checks, distributing the proceeds among investors in the securities and handling foreclosures. **********The Comptroller permits up to 25 percent of a bank's capital to consist of the value of such rights. The F.D.I.C. and Fed have no set standard, although they have said that the rights should not represent a significantly large portion of an institution's capital. **********Together, core deposit intangibles and mortgage-servicing rights represent billions of dollars in assets.  An Argument for Stringency **********Regulators favoring more stringent treatment of intangible assets contend that their inclusion as capital would only make banks weaker and more susceptible to collapse. **********\"We're trying to make sure that we don't have capital made of air,\" said Robert L.

One of them is France, which is withdrawing a 207-member contingent of surgeons and other specialists. **********''When the authorities say they have too many doctors there, they are right,'' a French official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/13/world/south-africa-s-new-era-bush-says-he-ll-keep-sanctions-for-now.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1990-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Bush Says He'll Keep Sanctions for Now", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA;   Bush Says He'll Keep Sanctions for Now", "body_text": " **********President Bush said today that he was not willing to lift economic sanctions on South Africa at this time, but that he was prepared to take other steps to show support for President F. W. de Klerk. **********At a news conference, Mr. Bush hailed Mr. de Klerk as the exemplar of ''a new brand of leadership - a man who is making dramatic changes,'' moving South Africa ''down the road toward racial equity'' and away from apartheid. **********Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader, was freed on Sunday after more than 27 years in South African prisons. A senior Bush Administration official said today that the United States was considering ''gestures'' of support for South Africa that could be made before Pretoria meets the five statutory criteria for the lifting of sanctions. **********One such gesture is Mr. Bush's invitation to Mr. de Klerk to visit the United States. Mr. Bush said he expected the South African leader to accept. **********Landing Rights Weighed **********Another gesture under study is to grant landing rights in the United States for South African aircraft. But Congressional aides said that such a step could not be taken unless South Africa satisfied the conditions prescribed by Congress in 1986. **********Those conditions include the release of all political prisoners, repeal of the national state of emergency, an end to restrictions on political parties, a commitment to enter ''good-faith negotiations'' with spokesmen for the black majority and repeal of the Group Areas Act of 1949, the basic law requiring residential segregation. **********The 1986 law prohibits South African airlines and aircraft from flying to the United States. It also prohibits American air carriers from taking off or landing in South Africa. **********Asked if he would seek to lift the sanctions before all the statutory conditions have been met, Mr. Bush said: ''We can't do that. I'm bound by the law. And what I do want to do is discuss these with - these provisions -with Mr. Mandela and with Mr. de Klerk. And I've invited both of them to come here.'' **********Herman J. Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said Mr. Mandela's statements since his release from prison ''have been very responsible and very moderate.'' **********'We're for Privatization' **********''I hope that the rest of the anti-apartheid movement will take a signal from him and get into the negotiating process as soon as they can,'' Mr. Cohen said. **********Mr. Bush expressed some concern about Mr. Mandela's reaffirmation of support for the economic program of the African National Congress, particularly the goal of nationalizing mines. **********''We are not for nationalizing,'' Mr. Bush said. ''We're for privatization and we're for free markets.'' He said it would not make sense for South Africa to adopt socialist policies when ''socialism is folding, folding its hand and going over to the other side all across the world.'' **********Mr. Bush said that the nationalization of major industries would not be ''particularly helpful toward democracy.'' But he said he agreed with Mr. Mandela's efforts to create a society ''that is not a racist society.'' **********On a Mediating Role **********Mr. Bush was asked if he wanted the United States to become a mediator, trying to negotiate a political settlement between the South African Government and the opponents of apartheid. **********''If such a role would be productive, I certainly would,'' he said. ''But I have the feeling from the talks with both men - just short phone conversations with both Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela - that they feel they can talk to each other without the U.S. catalytic role.'' **********Mr. Cohen said he got the same impression when he visited South Africa last month. **********Mr. Bush has repeatedly said he would comply with the 1986 law that sets the conditions for lifting economic sanctions on South Africa. He has also promised to consult Congress before acting. The language of the law is ambiguous on some points, and there is sure to be debate about whether Pretoria has satisfied particular conditions. **********The 1986 law, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, bans the import and export of many products and prohibits new lending and investment. Bush Administration officials say they are looking for ways to help Mr. de Klerk and his Government while complying with the law. But they acknowledge that there are relatively few options. **********On the NBC program ''Today,'' Mr. Cohen said ''we're rapidly reaching that point'' where it would be appropriate to relax some of the sanctions on South Africa. **********Mr. Cohen said that South African leaders had ''made some very courageous and bold decisions, and I think they deserve to be recognized because they have political problems at home and need support from the outside world.'' Asked if such recognition should include the lifting of sanctions, Mr. Cohen said, ''That's one possibility, and certainly we're going to consider that very carefully.'' **********No Conditions on Invitation **********Mr. Bush said there were ''no conditions'' on his invitation to Mr. de Klerk. **********In a ceremony at the White House this morning, Mr. Bush said the release of Mr. Mandela was an ''important sign that South Africa may soon begin negotiating a democratic nonracial society and at last be on the way to ending apartheid once for all.'' The ceremony was held to welcome another visitor to the White House, President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo. **********At his news conference, Mr. Bush said he could not judge whether economic sanctions had been effective in forcing South Africa to abandon some elements of apartheid. He asserted that some of the sanctions were ''counterproductive.'' **********''What's really changed is the mindset of the South African leadership,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I think that we ought to give Mr. de Klerk certain credit for being able to look much more realistically about political change and hopefully more favorably about a society that eventually eliminates this racism that is equated with apartheid.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/23/business/company-news-rohr-gets-jet-job.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 138, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Rohr Gets Jet Job", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Rohr Gets Jet Job", "body_text": " **********Rohr Industries received a contract valued at about $1 billion from International Aero Engines to design and manufacture the nacelles - the aerodynamic structures that surround jet engines - for International Aero's V2500 engine for the MD-90 airliner built by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.

But for some Hungarians, they threaten to set a troublesome test for a society in which ethnic and religious divisions are still open and raw. **********Lively Issue in Hungary **********The question of the role of religion in society, and particularly in children's education, is becoming an issue in many former Communist countries of Eastern Europe. But nowhere is the debate more lively. **********''Those who don't participate in one or other religious class will be branded Jewish, papist or heretic,'' Peter Hanak, a noted historian, said during a recent debate on the church-state issue on a radio talk show. ''And then we will start scattering Hungarian society, which is divided enough as it is.'' **********The first spark in the debate was an attempt last spring by a group of militant Catholics to take over a public school in Budapest's 12th District. **********Done without the sanction of the church, the move by the Our Lady Society at the Arany Janos School ended in failure, but not before it upset and angered some parents and teachers. A Return of Ideology?  ''We expected that ideology was going to march out of the schools, just as it marched out of the workplace,'' said Janos Novak, an engineer with two children in the Arany Janos school, ''We saw this proposal and we were afraid it was marching back in.'' **********The Our Lady Society had wanted to create, within the walls of the Arany Janos school, separate classrooms adorned by Christian symbols but supported by public funds. **********To many, the case posed a gross violation of the doctrine of separation of church and state. But this was apparently not a concern for Bertalan Andrasfalvy, the new Minister of Culture, who has jurisdiction over education. **********Mr. Andrasfalvy, an anthropologist and newcomer to education, said in a statement to the parents that he thought the idea of Christian-type, state-run schools was worth exploring. **********Neglected for 40 Years **********''Religion has to become part of education work all over the country,'' explained Katalin Csonka, a senior official. ''The minister is taking a noble approach, which is based on the recognition that for more than 40 years, religion was neglected in the schools.'' **********Some here see the resurgence of religion in the schools as the start of a trend that could lead to a reconsideration of Hungary's liberal abortion laws and other concerns shared by conservative Catholics. **********In Poland, where Roman Catholicism is strongest in Eastern Europe, Polish bishops recently called for a reintroduction of mandatory religious education in the schools. That proposal was firmly rejected as ''profoundly inappropriate'' by a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education, who called it potentially divisive. **********Poland Shelves Abortion Issue **********The abortion issue has also been shelved by the Government of Prime Minster Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who is pledged to the creation of a ''nonidealogical and nondenominational state.'' **********In Czechoslovakia, churches have been given the right to teach religion in the schools on demand and to start their own private institutions. In Prague, a former convent school has been split, with one half returned to the nuns and the other remaining an ordinary state school. **********In Romania, where the Eastern Orthodox Church predominates, Archbishop Daniel Ciobotea of Jassy told the opposition newspaper Romania Libera on Wednesday that religious education should return to schools at all levels to broaden horizons. **********Hungarians are still groping for answers to basic questions, from control of schools to the nature of property. With old laws discredited and a newly elected Parliament off to a slow start, many find they must fend for themselves, defining their rights as they go. **********Such was the case at the Arany Janos school, once a convent of the French order of Notre Dame of Zion, expropriated by the Communists after World War II. **********In January, a law on freedom of religion was passed, inspiring local Catholics to go ahead and make a bid for the return of the school, considered an elite institution for 1,500 students. **********'Life Dictates Law Today' **********What the Our Lady Society wanted was a contract to run their own classes, at the state's expense. ''We told them there was no legal framework for this,'' said Maria Terestyenyi, who heads the education department in the 12th District. ''But they said life dictates law today.'' **********In Hungary's unruly transition period, Mrs. Terestyenyi said the tendency is to favor popular demands, no matter how they are made. ''Everybody is afraid to say something is legal or illegal,'' she said, ''because if they say anything, they are stamped a Stalinist. In this way, initiatives from below have the advantage.'' **********Many Hungarians, including nonbelievers, see the interest in religious education as a natural reaction to decades of Communist atheism. ''For the last 40 years, we have suffered a general moral crisis that has left a vacuum,'' said Lajos Elmer, a journalist for a Catholic weekly newspaper. ''The resurgency in Christianity is a search for values to fill up people's lives.'' **********Church Recovers School **********A few schools have already converted to their pre-Communist status. For instance, the venerable Barmadas school in Budapest has again become private and was recently returned to the Protestant Reformed Church, which will assume financial responsibility for the students' education. **********But so far, the Catholic Church has not made a formal bid to take back any schools. It is waiting for a bill in Parliament defining property rights. **********But at Arany Janos and elsewhere, grass-roots Catholic groups tried taking the matter into their own hands. **********Mr. Novak, a Catholic whose children are already receiving a religious education from their local parish priest, had initially supported the idea of returning the Arany Janos school to church control, believing as did some non-Catholic parents, that it would provide a superior education. **********''But we began to get the feeling that education was not a priority,'' he said. ''What the society wanted was to give the children a strict Christian upbringing. Even Catholic parents did not want their children to attend such a school, and it was a definite problem for children who were not Catholic.'' **********The fight reached a dead end at the local district council, which disapproved creating a school-within-a-school. In the meantime, the proposal had the effect of dividing parents and teachers, classmates and friends. **********Children in Conflict **********''Almost a religious war broke out,'' Mr. Novak said. ''The children were the real victims, pointing fingers at each other, calling each other fanatic Catholics or Jews. Our school is as heterogeneous as the rest of society, and it is not healthy to make these distinctions.'' **********Although not as strong as in Poland, Roman Catholicism in Hungary has traditionally been the dominant religion, followed by the Protestant Reformed Church, which has a large following, particularly in the south. But Hungary is also a composite of minority groups - including several evangelical Protestant sects, Romanians who belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church and more than 80,000 Jews, the largest community in Eastern Europe, second only to the Soviet Union. **********The controversy over the Arany Janos School had barely subsided when a debate sprang up around Mr. Andrasfalvi's agreement to offer voluntary religious instruction in the schools. **********The proposal calls for voluntary classes to be held one or twice a week in facilities provided by the school, taught by teachers on state salaries but trained according to their religion. **********Different religious classes will be offered depending on the demands of parents, but many people expect that as a practical matter, most will be Catholic. **********''Since most believers are Catholics,'' Mrs. Terestyenyi said, ''it means the others will be in the minority. Show me one small Hungarian village that will openly call itself Jewish.'' **********Under Mr. Andrasfalvy's proposal, chidren would receive a mark on their year's end report cards, indicting whether they attended the religious classes. Many Hungarians, made suspicious by years under Communist rule, regard this as an ominous start."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/07/business/patents-red-dye-is-produced-from-carrot-cultures.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;   Red Dye Is Produced From Carrot Cultures", "print_headline": "Patents;   Red Dye Is Produced From Carrot Cultures", "body_text": " **********Two Israeli researchers this week patented a method for producing an intense red dye for foods and cosmetics from carrot cells grown in petri dishes. **********In such cell cultures, plant cells are bred without growing the entire plant.

Baker 3d seemed to reflect this mood when he said, ''Today we engage in an act of reconciliation, of a people too long separated, of a Continent too long divided.'' **********Meetings Last Seven Hours **********The Secretary spoke as he gathered with the foreign ministers of the two Germanys, the Soviet Union, Britain and France for the first full ministerial meeting of what have been dubbed the ''two plus four'' talks. The meetings lasted seven hours and were held at the Foreign Ministry in Bonn. **********From the outset, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union signaled that Moscow, despite the disintegration of its Warsaw Pact and all its internal problems, would bargain hard for its views in the coming months. **********Using some of the most categorical language on the issue to date, Mr. Shevardnadze rejected the idea of a single Germany joining the North Atlantic alliance, and he said the full gamut of military and political issues involved in unification had to be resolved before Moscow would sign any agreement. **********Differences Played Down **********At the same time, he seemed to take pains to indicate that Moscow did not intend to hold up the talks or German unity. At the news conference held by the six ministers on the end of their talks, Mr. Shevardnadze acknowledged that some ''serious differences'' had been aired, but he emphasized that these ''need not be dramatized,'' that ''this is usual for the negotiating process.'' **********''Happily, we have no problem with any sort of allergy to the wishes of the German nation to unity,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said in his opening comments, indirectly scoffing at reports that the notion of German unification was painful to the Soviets. **********There was a sense among Western officials that some of Mr. Shevardnadze's tough talk may have been intended at least in part to assuage conservative critics in the Soviet Union, who have chafed at the idea of letting the Germanys unite and join the Western camp after the sacrifices made by the Soviet people in World War II. Mr. Shevardnadze explicitly noted the opposition in his opening statement, when he said German membership in NATO was also unacceptable for internal reasons. ''The population of our country, which sustained such frightening losses in the last war, cannot accept the idea of including Germany in NATO,'' he said. **********More broadly, he appealed to the West to understand the difficulty that Soviet politicians faced on an issue that carried an enormous emotional burden. ''We are dealing here with an issue of special importance to Soviet people, to our whole society,'' he said. ''If an attempt is made to push us into a corner on matters touching our security, it will lead to a situation - I will say it candidly -in which our political flexibility would be severely curtailed, because emotions would boil up inside the country, shades of the past would rise to the surface, national complexes with roots in the tragic pages of our history would be revived.'' **********Mr. Shevardnadze's position confirmed expectations that the negotiations could in effect prove to be ''one plus five,'' with the Soviet Union using one of its last remaining levers in Europe - its victor's rights in Germany - to preserve whatever it could by way of political, military and economic influence on a Continent increasingly facing westward. **********Balance of Power Stressed **********German membership in NATO, Mr. Shevardnadze declared, ''would very concretely affect our security interests, it would mean an acute violation of the balance of power in Europe, it would create for us a dangerous military-strategic situation.'' **********Moscow has in the past resisted the Western plan to incorporate Germany in NATO. The Western position, expressed in opening comments by Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, is that it is not for the wartime Allies to decree what alliance a sovereign, united Germany could or could not join. **********The broader disagreement between Moscow and the West that emerged from the opening statements was the scope of the ''two plus four'' talks. The Western position was that the allies were meeting only, as Mr. Baker put it, ''to arrive at a formula by which we will terminate and transfer all remaining four-power rights and responsibilities to a fully sovereign Germany.'' **********Other issues, such as the military and security structures in the Germany and the Europe of the future, could be discussed, but on these the ''two plus four'' should act only as a ''steering committee,'' channeling the various issues to appropriate forums or arms talks. **********'Package Approach' Sought **********The position staked out by Mr. Shevardnadze was that the ''two plus four'' must adopt what he described as a ''package approach.'' There would be no agreement, he said, until the participants had resolved all the ramifications of unification - including the military status and the military forces of the united Germany, the presence of foreign forces on German soil, German renunciation of atomic, bacteriological and chemical weapons and renunciation of fascist ideology. **********''We believe that it would be in the interests of Germany itself if the termination of four-power rights would be the culminating step in German unification,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. **********Mr. Shevardnadze reiterated the Soviet position that Europe has to move toward broad new European security structures to replace the military blocs. To this end, he proposed the immediate creation of a ''pan-European center for the elimination of the military threat'' in Berlin, based in part on existing Allied institutions. **********The center, he said, would serve as a control and observation post for all military activities on German soil, and the ''first block'' in the building of new security structures. **********The proposal echoed Mr. Baker's idea of setting up a center for conflict resolution under the auspices of all-European Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. But the Soviet idea of a pan-European agency controlling all troops in Germany was certain to be rejected by the Western powers and Germany as a revival of special treatment for Germany. **********Agenda Is Formulated **********These differences, however, had not been unexpected at the opening session. Officials from all sides stressed that the ministers had found no disagreement on the principle business of the day, the agenda for their talks. This included: *********** The borders of a future Germany, which all the participants agreed would be the territory of West Germany, East Germany and Berlin - ''no more, no less.'' *********** Political-military questions, an area likely to produce the most serious disagreements. *********** Ending four-power authority over Berlin. *********** Preparing a ''final settlement'' under international law under which the four Allied powers would terminate their rights and responsibilities for Germany. Moscow at one point had indicated it that might hold out for a formal peace treaty - which the Germans resist as a humiliating exercise that would have to involve the many other nations that formally declared war on the Third Reich - but Mr. Shevardnadze signaled that Moscow would settle for a less formal ''final settlement'' with the four allied powers. **********Poland to Join Later Talks **********The six ministers also agreed to allow Poland to take part in the third foreign ministers' meeting, scheduled for July in Paris, when its borders would be discussed. After initial resistance, Bonn agreed this year to let the Poles sit in on discussions of its western border. **********Reading a statement agreed to by the ministers, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Foreign Minister and the host of the first round of ministerial talks, said, ''I can state that the talks have been taking place in a reasonable, constructive and trustful atmosphere and that they were dominated by the will for understanding.'' **********In his opening comments, however, Mr. Genscher and the East German Foreign Minister, Markus Meckel, cautiously stayed clear of the disagreements between Moscow and the Western powers. **********Mr. Genscher did stress that relations with the Soviet Union ''will continue to be of primary importance,'' underscoring what has been an unstated theme of the talks. The sense in Bonn is that one of Moscow's aims in the unification process is to secure guarantees that a united Germany will honor all East German trade obligations, and that Germany will provide economic assistance to the Soviet Union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/22/business/foreign-stocks-and-us-rules.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 241, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foreign Stocks And U.S. Rules", "print_headline": "Foreign Stocks And U.S. Rules", "body_text": " **********The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's president, William Brodsky, says changes are needed on how foreign securities are listed on United States exchanges so that more Japanese companies may trade on the New York Stock Exchange. **********If the exchange listing requirements were changed, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could begin trading futures on the Japanese Nikkei stock index because investors would have easy access to the underlying stocks, Mr. Brodsky said. **********Speaking at a University of **********Chicago conference last week on Asian financial markets, Mr. Brodsky said only about a dozen of the 225 companies making up the Nikkei index are listed on the Big Board.

And this after 1989, a year it outperformed every other major market. **********Both markets are on the edge of an economic revolution and have been swept up in the whirlwind of change. While Austrian stocks have paid off as an entree to hoped-for profits from the Eastern bloc, the small Vienna market does pose some worries. **********Its size can make it volatile. It fell almost 7 percent from its mid-January high before rallying to four new highs last week, partly on the announcement of East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow's proposal for the reunification of the two Germanies. **********In addition, analysts say, far less information is available on stocks in the Austrian market than in larger markets. This makes it harder for an individual, or even fund managers, to follow the market. **********As in West Germany, the easiest access to the market is through a single-country fund traded in the United States. Like the two German funds, the Austria Fund, at about 77 percent, is trading at a high permium to the underlying value of the stocks it owns. **********The run-up in Austria means that the market may be close to overpriced, if it is not already. That could set it up for a big drop. **********Still, the Austrian gain is far ahead of West Germany's. The market is up 26.7 percent this year, according to the Financial Times World Indices, while West Germany has risen just 7.3 percent, even with large gains on Thursday and Friday that sent it to a record high. In the last 12 months, West Germany was up 51.5 percent, but the Austrian market rose 130.4 percent. Austrian stocks have benefited more than West Germany's from the moves toward economic reform in the Eastern bloc. That is because Austria has a long-time relationship with the East, and Austrians have had important roles in many joint ventures there. **********Some analysts also argue that the longer-term commitments some large investors make in the Austrian market means the Vienna Bourse is less volatile than other markets of a similar size. **********The market's boom has been built on its tiny size, - Vienna's market capitalization is 7 percent that of Frankfurt and 1 percent the size of the United States markets. Because the market is so small, purchases that would barely cause a ripple elsewhere, can send a stock soaring in Austria. Conversely, large sales can send prices falling, making investors reluctant to take their money out. This reduces some volatility. **********''This is not a trading market,'' said Marko Musulin, the head of the securities and investment banking division of Creditanstalt in Vienna, the country's largest bank. ''It is not easy to exit this market in large volumes.'' **********When these factors were added to the rising demand for Austrian stocks, the trend had to be up. Part of the demand came from the fact that Austria was so underrepresented in many international equity funds before the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9. After that, Morgan Stanley & Company recommended that the weighting given to Austrian shares be increased to 6 percent from 1 percent. In addition, several new closed-end mutual funds, including the Austria Fund, have added to the demand for stocks. **********David C. Roche, the international strategist for Morgan Stanley in London, said that in addition to the attraction of Eastern Europe, Austria is benefiting from the possibility that it now, finally, has a chance to join the European Economic Community. **********He also said that because Austrian accounting requirements with regard to disclosures are not too demanding, many companies and banks are loaded with hidden assets of land and stock that are just now being seen by many foreign investors. **********But the strong rise in the market has caused concerns. One analyst said shares in have become ''ridiculously overpriced.'' **********An Austrian analyst, who asked not to be named, said a good downward move right now would be nice. It would, he said, lower prices enough ''so we could make some more attractive sales to our customers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/20/world/evolution-in-europe-romanian-campaign-leaves-trail-of-violence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 363, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   Romanian Campaign Leaves Trail of Violence", "print_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   Romanian Campaign Leaves Trail of Violence", "body_text": " **********At the local headquarters of the ruling National Salvation Front, about 30 party workers watched intently today as a videotape of their campaign rally on Thursday was played and replayed.

The international editions of magazines like Time and Newsweek often feature covers or articles different from their United States versions. **********''I'm thrilled about it,'' said George J. Green, the president of Hearst Magazines International, a Conde Nast rival. ''This will be a wonderful test. It will enable us to see whether exporting magazine content works, and what elements of it will work.'' **********In recent years, magazine publishers, like the advertising agencies and consumer-product companies that support them, have increasingly been looking for growth overseas, especially in Western Europe. In an analysis late last year, The Financial Times predicted that North America's share of world advertising expenditures would drop to 43 percent in 1991, from 46 percent in 1988, while Europe's would grow to 31 percent, from 28 percent. **********In an attempt to reap some of the benefits of this expected growth, Conde Nast will introduce Vanity Fair to Britain in March 1991, in an edition that will be published simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic. By exporting an established brand intact, Conde Nast, like other global marketers, hopes to save the costs of creating a new brand name or refining an existing one for different tastes. **********S. I. Newhouse Jr., Conde Nast's chairman, said he believed that Vanity Fair, which has a circulation rate base of about 600,000, can achieve a circulation of 50,000 to 75,000 in Britain. He said his expectations were based on a three-month test his company started in April, in which it doubled the average monthly distribution of Vanity Fair in England to 20,000, and ''found the sales pattern was consistent with what it was before we doubled it.'' **********Through its subsidiary Conde Nast Publications Ltd., the company now publishes seven magazines in Britain. Four are versions of American titles with British content, and three are specific to Britain. **********Conde Nast executives deemed Vanity Fair to be the only magazine capable of exporting because its content, under the editorship of Tina Brown, a British native, has been international in scope. The publication, one of America's most influential feature magazines, has been a melange of celebrity profiles, gossipy tales of society intrigue, incisive reports on foreign political figures and pungent commentary on art and culture. **********Ms. Brown said she believed that the attitudes and interests held by the affluent and educated classes in Britain and the United States were similar enough to allow one version of Vanity Fair to be published in both countries. **********''American movies go to London with no content changes,' ' she said. ''In a funny way, Vanity Fair is the first magazine to open like a movie.'' **********Ms. Brown said there was no relationship between the creation of a British Vanity Fair and Conde Nast's dismissal last week of the editor of its British magazine Tatler. Ms. Brown edited Tatler - like Vanity Fair, a publication involved with the doings of the upper crust - before coming to Vanity Fair. **********Most publishers go to great lengths to tailor the content of their international editions to the tastes of the individual editions' readers. Reader's Digest, for example, publishes 39 editions in 15 languages. While each magazine can draw from the same pool of articles, most adapt the ideas for their own purposes, said Bruce S. Trachtenberg, a Reader's Digest spokesman. **********Playboy, which has 13 foreign editions, has an international edition that is exactly the same as its American edition, but with ads sold overseas. It is aimed primarily at Americans living abroad, said Lee B. Hall, a former Playboy executive who is now a consultant in Chicago specializing in international publishing. **********Mr. Hall was dubious about Vanity Fair's prospects in London. ''I think you have to adapt your magazine to the language and culture of the readers,'' he said. **********Mr. Newhouse said advertisers were not approached for their reaction to the venture. He also said no discounts would be offered to encourage marketers to purchase advertising packages in the two editions. **********''We expect to find in the U.K., as we have always found in the U.S., that if we publish a magazine that readers like, advertisers will follow,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/15/business/the-media-business-buchwald-ruling-film-writers-vs-star-power.html": {"writer_name": "Aljean Harmetz", "pub_date": "1990-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1027, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Buchwald Ruling: Film Writers vs. Star Power", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Buchwald Ruling: Film Writers vs. Star Power", "body_text": " **********Art Buchwald's victory in court against Paramount Pictures cheered writers, who frequently complain that they are not given proper credit for their part in a movie's success. **********But lawyers, studio executives and producers said last week's ruling was unlikely to change the way Hollywood did business, largely because of the industry's avid courtship of its expensive stars. **********''We haven't told our business affairs people they should be more diligent,'' said Robert Cort, a producer. **********''People are always careful,'' said James Brooks, the writer, director and producer. **********''We won't do anything differently,'' said Joe Roth, president of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation. **********Many Messages From Writers **********Nevertheless, writers are jubiliant. Alain Bernheim, Mr. Buchwald's co-plaintiff, returned from a trip last Thursday to find 76 messages on his answering machine. ''My machine was blown out,'' he said. ''The messages were mostly from writers, saying, 'well done!' I didn't even know a lot of them, except by reputation.'' **********Most people in the industry had expected the California Superior Court to rule that the blockbuster 1988 movie ''Coming to America'' was based on an idea that Paramount had optioned from Mr. Buchwald in 1982. After all, Paramount had spent $418,000 developing scripts for Eddie Murphy from the newspaper columnist's three-page story about an African king who comes to America, is deposed, goes to live in the ghetto and finds true love. The project was abandoned in 1985.  Studios and producers get nervous when courts uphold writers who have sent them an unsolicited script. But this situation was different. To almost everyone but Paramount, it seemed that Mr. Buchwald had an open-and-shut case. **********Plenty of Star Power **********The question being raised in Hollywood now is why Paramount did not simply pay Mr. Buchwald off. The answer, according to a dozen producers and executives, has a lot to do with star power. **********Mr. Murphy wanted story credit on ''Coming to America.'' He was the biggest star on the Paramount lot. Two of his movies, ''Beverly Hills Cop'' and ''Beverly Hills Cop II,'' had grossed more than $150 million apiece. ''The Golden Child'' had almost reached $100 million despite scathing reviews. And Mr. Murphy, whose contract with Paramount is coming to an end, was known to be unhappy with the studio. **********When he came up with the idea for ''Coming to America,'' Mr. Murphy may have long since forgotten the bits of Mr. Buchwald's story that he had been told. Judge Harvey A. Schneider went out of his way to make it clear that he did not think that Mr. Murphy stole Mr. Buchwald's idea. But the rules of the Writers Guild of America would not have allowed Mr. Murphy the story credit if ''Coming to America'' were based on an idea by Mr. Buchwald. **********Some Coincidences **********If Paramount had not had such obvious access to Mr. Buchwald's idea, the similarities between Mr. Buchwald's ''King For a Day'' and Mr. Murphy's ''Coming to America'' might have been considered a coincidence. As many recent films show, most movies are variations of other movies. **********''Ideas are in the air,'' a producer, Scott Rudin, said. ''How else do you explain five movies in one year about people swapping bodies and ages: 'Vice Versa,' 'Like Father, Like Son,' '18 Again,' 'Big,' and an Italian picture, 'Da Grande?' '' **********In August 1985, three movies about adolescents making strange science experiments were released: ''Weird Science,'' ''Real Genius'' and ''My Science Project.'' **********When Paramount finally made Mr. Buchwald an offer a few weeks before his breach-of-contract case was to go to trial, it was too little too late. ''When they're against the wall, they say they'll settle if you'll just shut up,'' Mr. Buchwald said in a telephone interview from Washington. Paramount agreed to settle for $250,000, exactly what he won in court. ''We agreed to settle if there was no gag order,'' he said. But the studio's condition was that Mr. Buchwald not talk about the settlement. Where Are the Net Profits?  In the next phase of the case, Mr. Buchwald and Mr. Bernheim, who share 19 percent of the net profits of ''Coming to America,'' must prove that there are profits to share. Paramount contends that the movie, which has sold more than $300 million worth of tickets, has no net profits. In the arcane world of studio bookkeeping, every time a gross profit participant like Mr. Murphy gets his profit, it puts the movie a little more in debt. This phenomenon is called a rolling break-even. **********Most industry experts expect that Paramount will settle with Mr. Buchwald rather than open its books to public scrutiny in court. **********There is also pressure on Mr. Buchwald to settle. His lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, took the case on a contingency basis. Since Judge Schneider did not require Paramount to pay punitive damages, the costs of fighting Paramount greatly exceed the money won by the lawyers so far. **********Action by the Writers Guild **********The Writers Guild has formed a committee to examine the entire issue of credits. Getting credit for work on a script is important to a writer because the public recognition often leads to higher status, more money and other job offers. **********''The most important power the guild has is the ability to arbitrate credits,'' said Naomi Fomer, the writer of ''Running on Empty'' and a committee member. ''I think this case will have a major effect on the committee.'' **********And Mr. Buchwald has received an unsettling taste of what it means to be a movie star. ''My life for 40 years has been that of an observer,'' he said. ''I got a standing ovation when I walked down Connecticut Avenue to my office. It's very frightening. I feel like a slight fraud. And I know I don't want to be at the center of the action for very long.'' **********Paramount Communications"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/12/business/polish-investors-angry.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Polish Investors Angry", "print_headline": "Polish Investors Angry", "body_text": " **********Dozens of angry investors besieged the office of a Polish financier today after it closed for lack of funds and a newspaper reported that the financier might have vanished abroad.

But at this year's gathering, most of the displays were unusually subdued. **********Gone were the caged animals, the hot-air balloons and the preoccupation with Hollywood stars. A few celebrities were on hand, but for most publishers it was back to basics. **********The reason for the low-keyed approach, some visitors assumed, was that the convention was being held in Las Vegas, Nev., where any attempt to get attention could only pale alongside the erupting volcanos, storybook castles and tropical rain forests at the city's hotels and casinos. **********That may indeed have inhibited some publishers at the event last week, but there seemed to have been something more fundamental at work, something that appears to augur well for book publishing: the understanding that smoke and mirrors, glitz and glitter are no substitutes for quality books. **********Most publishers have always known this, of course. But with the rise of the blockbuster book, they either lost sight of it or chose to ignore it. Nowhere was that more apparent than at previous booksellers' conventions, where the promotions and pronouncements of huge first printings were raised to a pitch that Barnum would have envied. **********This frenzy by itself was not too bad, because enthusiasm is essential to successful publishing and bookselling. What was bad was that publishers began to believe their own hyperbole and tried to persuade bookstores to believe it as well. So after paying unrealistic advances for many books, publishers leaned on booksellers to double and triple their orders. **********When the books were returned, sometimes in the hundreds of thousands, the publishers had to write off not just the unearned authors' royalties but also the cost of producing and warehousing the unsold books. **********At last week's convention, however, there were signs of change in the desert air. Despite what is generally regarded as one of the strongest fall book lists in years, few publishers were boasting about the size of their first printings. Instead, they were talking about ''the hand sell,'' industry jargon for selling books individually rather than like soap. And they were talking about writing quality - a departure from the recent past and a welcome recognition that books, after all, are to be read and savored. **********While both the new Jean Auel and Sidney Sheldon novels are likely to have first printings of a million or more, other books will start out much more cautiously - even books by best-selling authors. **********For example, in one case B. Dalton and Waldenbooks have already ordered more than 100,000 copies of a new book. Orders from the other chain stores and independent booksellers could eventually double that number. But instead of printing 350,000 to 400,000 copies, as many houses would do in similar circumstances, this house - whose executives did not want to be identified -plans to print an initial 250,000 copies to minimize the risk of heavy returns. **********''I don't care how many orders we get; I'm not going to be overruled on the initial printing,'' the publisher of that house said. ''If we see a gigantic runaway, I can reprint quickly.'' **********One thing in the publishers' favor is that reprinting is simpler than in the past. ''Paper is widely available and there are a lot of presses with big capacity,'' said Parker Ladd, a director of the Association of American Publishers. ''It used to take as much as three months to reprint; now it can be done in a few weeks.'' **********Moreover, computers allow publishers to keep closer track of their book sales. ''If they find they aren't selling in Colorado, for example,'' Mr. Ladd said, ''they can move them down to stores in Florida.'' **********When publishers have been cautious in previous years, their caution often reflected a sluggish economy. So it would be foolish to predict that the relative absence of glitter at last week's convention represented a permanent condition. But there are reasons to think that the caution may last a bit longer than usual. **********For one thing, the book chains are reducing the size of their orders. They will still place big orders for certain titles, but publishers say the chains are reluctant to fill their stores with stacks of the same titles. **********''They don't get hurt as much as we do if a book doesn't blow out of the store,'' one publisher said. ''But by cluttering stores with lots of copies of books that didn't move, they have missed sales on books that will sell.'' **********Finally, the new-found caution reflects corporate realities. **********''When publishing houses were privately owned, a big mistake was chalked up to experience,'' said the publisher of a quality house owned by a conglomerate. ''But when you're talking to absentee landlords, and they say, 'How come your revenues were up but profits were down,' they and their accountants don't want to hear about write-offs for unsold books - at least they don't want to hear about it two or three years in a row.'' **********So, at least for now, caution is the word."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/07/business/daimler-benz-and-mitsubishi-negotiating-cooperative-plan.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1990-03-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1570, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi Negotiating Cooperative Plan", "print_headline": "Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi Negotiating Cooperative Plan", "body_text": " **********In what may prove to be one of the most far-reaching industrial linkups, the largest business groups in Japan and West Germany, Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz, said today that they were negotiating a plan of ''intensive cooperation'' in automobile technology, aerospace, microelectronics and a number of service industries. **********If the agreement is completed, as executives on both sides said they anticipated, it will create a series of joint ventures that will give Daimler access to some of Japan's best technology and give the giant Mitsubishi empire a desperately needed foothold in Europe before that market is integrated in 1992. **********The arrangement could also pose an enormous competitive challenge for the United States, pitting its biggest businesses against the combined talents and marketing skills of the two most aggressive industrial groups in the booming German and Japanese economies. **********Areas of Interest **********Japan is particularly interested in Daimler's jet engines and the prospect of building cars with the world's leading maker of luxury cars, Mercedes-Benz; Germany's main interest is electronics, high-technology equipment and space technology, all areas in which Mitsubishi excels. **********In separate statements today, both companies said they would meet soon to work out specific accords, but Daimler said that they regarded the talks as ''promising of success.'' **********The announcement came after a secret meeting this weekend in Singapore involving the top executives of Daimler-Benz and the presidents or chairmen of the four biggest of the 29 Mitsubishi companies - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Electric and the Mitsubishi Corporation. The Mitsubishi Corporation, the leader of the group, is one of Japan's biggest trading companies. The meeting was apparently suggested by Edzard Reuter, the energetic chairman of Daimler's managing board. **********Neither side would say whether the two groups planned to take an equity interest in each other or whether the arrangement would go beyond cooperation in technology and marketing. But Daimler said, ''The independence of both groups will be respected.'' Daimler-Benz had sales of $37.3 billion in 1988, before its recent acquisition of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., the aerospace concern; the combined Mitsubishi companies had sales of about $82 billion. **********In an unusual statement, Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry appeared to give its blessing to the deal tonight, saying, ''We welcome the two groups entering into broad-ranging cooperation at a time when international cooperation is seen in so many areas.'' **********But a senior ministry official acknowledged that the proposed alliance was rife with political problems. Members of the European Community are deeply suspicious of Japan's rush to enter the European market before 1992. On Monday, amid renewed debates over restraints on Japanese ''transplant'' auto plants in Europe, Edith Cresson, France's Minister for European Affairs, said Japan's ''strategy is to set up plants in Japan, Europe and America wherever they can and switch production so they can destroy U.S. and European auto makers.'' **********Moreover, both companies are closely associated with the rise of the Axis powers 50 years ago, a history that, one Japanese official said recently, ''will never go away.'' Mitsubishi Heavy Industries built the Zero, the durable fighter that led Japan's invasion forces throughout Asia; Messerschmitt built much of the Luftwaffe. Even today, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is Japan's largest arms maker and Daimler is one of Europe's largest. **********Japan is barred from exporting arms or arms technology, except for special agreements with the United States. And a Mitsubishi spokesman, Masao Takemoto, said tonight that the exchange of ideas and technology would ''specifically exclude defense.'' It is unclear how the two companies would handle what the military terms ''dual use technologies'' that can be used for both commercial and military purposes, like electronics or high-temperature metals used in jet engines. **********The announcement of the agreement comes as a number of Japanese companies are scrambling to link up with European partners, or build their own operations in Europe. Most of Japan's leading car makers, for example, have announced plans to build plants within the European Community, except for Mitsubishi Motors, which has long been rumored to be negotiating with Mercedes for a production partnership. Mitsubishi helps market Mercedes in Japan. **********To Relax Frictions **********At a news conference today, attended only by Japanese reporters, Yoshio Taniguchi, vice president of Mitsubishi, reportedly said the company hoped the business alliance would relax trade frictions between Japan and the European Community. But he gave no specifics of the arrangements, saying only that the companies had scheduled further meetings. **********The Singapore meeting, he said, was attended by Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; Toyoo Tate, chairman of Mitsubishi Motors; Moriya Shiki, president of Mitsubishi Electric, and Shinroku Morohashi, president of the Mitsubishi Corporation. In addition to Mr. Reuter, Daimler was represented by its deputy chairman, Werner Niefer, who is also chairman of Mercedes-Benz. **********The Japanese executives negotiating with Daimler run one of the most powerful industrial groups in the world, made up of the remnants of one of Japan's leading zaibatsu, or interlocking business groups. It was broken up by Gen. Douglas McArthur when he headed the postwar occupation. **********Today the companies are perhaps more closely linked than at any time since the end of the war, sharing technology, holding one another's stock. The United States has protested that these ties give the Japanese companies an unfair advantage over American concerns trying to enter the market here. **********Internally, the Mitsubishi group calls itself the ''Kinyokai,'' which literally means ''Friday meeting,'' an outgrowth of end-of-the-week meetings of top leaders of each of the companies. **********Corporate Turnaround **********Over the last decade, that meeting has been the breeding ground of a sweeping corporate turnaround involving most, though not all, of the Mitsubishi members. Until the early 1980's the group was known for steady but plodding growth and little imagination. Today revenues and profits have soared, and the group has edged out its three main competitors among the conglomerates in Japan - Mitsui, which includes Toshiba); Sumitomo, which includes NEC, and Fuyo, which includes Nissan and Hitachi. Mitsubishi has also been involved in some of Japan's biggest and most controversial projects. **********Moreover, Mitsubishi's reach within Japan is unusually long, presumably the main reason Daimler sought it out in the German company's diversification plans. Its members make Nikon cameras, Kirin beer, steel, petrochemicals, rockets and luxury cruise ships, and they include the huge Mitsubishi Bank and the real estate group that bought a controlling interest in Rockefeller Center last fall. It also owns most of the central business district in Tokyo, purchased in 1890 by the company's second president, Yanosuke Iwasaki, when it was still covered with grass and bamboo. **********''To the Japanese consumer, we are like the air: invisible but pervasive, providing essential things to sustain life,'' Yohei Mimura, the company's chairman, said some time ago. **********Needed Technologies **********For all of its power, though, Mitsubishi is in great need of several technologies that it may gain from Daimler. Many are in aerospace. Although Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is building the FSX fighter jet with General Dynamics, and is one of three companies working with Boeing on a new aircraft, it has never been able to design its own aircraft engines or develop a successful commercial plane. Daimler owns an engine maker and, through Messerschmitt, owns West Germany's 37.9 percent stake in Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium. **********Mitsubishi Motors, meanwhile, is engaged in a big struggle at home to remain a main force in the Japanese auto market, where it is virtually tied for third place with Honda Motors. The company has had a long association with Chrysler, but the American car maker's recent troubles have sent company executives in search of a stronger partner. An alliance with Mercedes would be a coup, especially at a time that Mitsubishi Motors' two largest domestic rivals, Toyota Motors and Nissan Motors, are bringing out luxury cars directly aimed at the market dominated by Mercedes-Benz and BMW. **********More Pressure on U.S. **********American reaction to the announcement of talks between Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi suggested that an alliance between the foreign giants would intensify the pressures on American companies to become more competitive. **********''Certainly American industry is not in a position to criticize two private-sector companies getting closer together,'' said Howard Lewis, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''It goes on all the time. This is increasingly the way the global environment works. But to the extent that this cooperation makes a competitive world even more competitive, it is all the more incumbent on America to wake up and put our own economy in a more competitive posture. We better get our act together.'' **********And John Ettlie, an associate professor of operations management at the University of Michigan,, said: ''It's definitely an important event with important implications. Clearly this puts more pressure on the European agenda. Up to now, I think there has been a relaxed attitude among American companies that the West Germans were reluctant to do joint ventures with the Japanese. This signifies a softening of that position.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/05/business/the-media-business-many-authors-seek-to-be-heard-as-well-as-read.html": {"writer_name": "Edwin McDowell", "pub_date": "1990-02-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 862, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Many Authors Seek to Be Heard as Well as Read", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Many Authors Seek to Be Heard as Well as Read", "body_text": " **********Books on audio cassettes are becoming such an important source of income for authors that audio rights are increasingly being treated as valuable literary properties. **********According to Ed Victor, the literary agent for Jack Higgins, Douglas Adams and Erica Jong, ''I find myself saying, 'Tell me not only how much you will pay, but how many audios you will print, how will you advertise it, do you plan to release it at the same time as the book, and will the book make reference to the tape and the tape make reference to the book?' '' **********Advances for audio rights are still rather modest, averaging $5,000 to $10,000. ''I don't think anybody will pay a $1 million advance to us or to Judith Krantz for audio-tape rights to their next book,'' said Henry Morrison, the agent for Robert Ludlum, who has many books on tape. **********Still, Mr. Victor and others say they have sold audio rights to books for as much as $35,000. Moreover, a number of big-name authors, including James Michener and Tom Clancy, have earned six-figure royalties for audio books. **********Royalty rates for audio vary, but they are closer to the royalties for paperback books, which range from about 8 percent to 10 percent of the retail price, than they are to hardcover royalties, which start at 10 percent and rise to 15 percent. **********''For most authors it's not an enormous source of income, but it's an additional source, and for some it can be substantial,'' said Ann Rittenberg, a literary agent. ''Plus, unlike the payment of book royalties, the payment of audio royalties is usually very fast.'' **********Industry's Growth **********While the size of the audio book industry is sometimes estimated at about $250 million a year, industry officials say it is nearly impossible to determine - because most audio publishers do not disclose their sales figures and there are so many audio publishers, including a number that sell only via direct mail. **********''But this industry has really grown in the last few years,'' said Jane Friedman, the publisher of Random House Audio Publishing. ''It's now an accepted supplement to book publishing.'' **********Random House, Simon & Schuster, Bantam Books and Harper & Row have audio divisions, and other audio leaders include Dove Books on Tape of Studio City, Calif.; Nightingale-Conant of Chicago; Audio Renaissance Tapes of Los Angeles; TDM/McGraw-Hill of Fullerton, Calif., and Recorded Books of Charlotte Hall, Md. There is also a vigorous market for religious books on audio. A leader in that business is Word Inc. in Waco, Tex. **********Books on audio are typically published on two 90-minute cassettes and sell for about $15. Most audio books include only about 50 percent of the hardcover book's contents, although some companies publish only unabridged versions. One such company, Recorded Books, offers ''To Kill A Mockingbird'' by Harper Lee on nine cassettes totaling 14 hours. Who Reads the Books?  Most books are read by professional actors or broadcasters, but some are read by authors - as, for example, the audio version of ''Russia House'' by John le Carre, ''The Joy Luck Club'' by Amy Tan and ''Talking God'' by Tony Hillerman. **********John F. Kennedy's ''Profiles in Courage,'' recently released by Harper Audio, is narrated by John F. Kennedy Jr., the son of the late President. T. Coraghessan Boyle recently recorded an audio version of his collection of stories, ''If the River Was Whiskey,'' and he will soon record his latest novel, ''World's End.'' **********Georges Borchardt, Mr. Boyle's agent, said he often sold non-exclusive rights, meaning separate rights for both the abridged and the the unedited versions of the same book. Mr. Morrison not only sells rights for the unedited and abridged versions of Robert Ludlum's novels, he also apportions the abridged Ludlum audios between Random House, which publishes Mr. Ludlum in hardcover, and Bantam, which publishes him in paperback. **********Random House Audio publishes about 50 books a year, has some 250 titles in print and is trying to acquire rights to authors' previously publishing works. Its spring 1990 catalogue includes ''The Osterman Weekend'' by Mr. Ludlum, ''Masquerade'' by Janet Dailey, ''Friend of My Youth'' by Alice Munro, ''Hawaii'' by James Michener and ''Rising From the Plains'' by John McPhee. The catalogue also includes an assortment of self-help and how-to titles. **********Problem With Science Fiction **********''Every category of book is possble,'' Ms. Friedman said, ''but the only one that does not work well for us is science fiction. I think the reason might be that sci-fi readers are purists and want the entire book, not an abridgment.'' **********Initially, Random House hoped to sell an average of 5,000 audios per title, but today the average is closer to 10,000 or 15,000, and some big-name authors sell well over 25,000. The company recently issued ''Caribbean'' by James Michener. Ms. Friedman said it had already sold 40,000 copies and will probably sell twice that amount during the year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/10/business/business-people-merrill-banker-quitting-to-seek-a-faster-track.html": {"writer_name": "Anise Wallace", "pub_date": "1990-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 418, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Merrill Banker Quitting To Seek a Faster Track", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Merrill Banker Quitting To Seek a Faster Track", "body_text": " **********Not too long ago, a career in investment banking was considered the fast track. In the 1980's, eager executives flocked to Wall Street to reshape companies and to get rich. **********But, as Courtney F. Jones and others have recently discovered, things change. After working as an investment banker for nine months at Merrill Lynch & Company, Mr. Jones, once the treasurer of the General Motors Corporation and Merrill's chief financial officer, is leaving Wall Street, he said, because he wants a ''faster growth path.'' **********The current slow pace of investment banking does not provide him the excitement or satisfaction he enjoyed in his previous jobs. ''I need to reinvigorate that pace,'' he said. **********After serving as chief financial officer at Merrill for four years, Mr. Jones, 50, became a managing director in the company's investment banking group in August 1989. As chief financial officer, Mr. Jones developed a cost-analysis process to evaluate returns on Merrill's various divisions. **********His move into investment banking came shortly before the collapse of the Campeau Corporation, the large Canadian developer, and before the demise of the high-yield ''junk bond'' market drastically changed the climate for takeovers and similar deals. **********Recently, Mr. Jones said yesterday, he surveyed the deal-making scene, concluded that it was ''going south a bit'' and decided that better opportunities were probably available in the corporate world. **********''I've had a terrific career, and I'm anxious to maintain the kind of success I've had,'' he said. ''Rather than stay here a few more years, I thought I would return to corporate management.'' **********Merrill executives said they were sorry to see Mr. Jones leave. ''Courtney's association with Merrill Lynch over the past five years has been an extremely productive one,'' William A. Schreyer, the company's chairman, and Daniel P. Tully, its president, said in a joint statement. ''We wish him every success in his new endeavors.'' **********No successor has been named, the company said. **********Although he has not decided what he plans to do, Mr. Jones will leave Merrill by the end of the year, he said.

They said they had always been willing to take back rejects and that Davidoff's real motive in shifting production is to gain broader access to the United States market. **********Because of the American embargo on Cuban goods, Davidoff has not been able to sell its Cuban cigars in the United States since 1961. So the shift to the Dominican Republic will let the company sell luxury cigars in the American market. **********Davidoff began making cigars in Cuba just after World War II. In 1970, the company was sold to Oettinger Imex S.A., a marketing company also based in Basel, although Zino Davidoff, whose father founded the company, is involved in the company. **********Chris Kull, president of Davidoff of Geneva, which is based in Stamford, Conn., and is a subsidiary of Davidoff International, said Davidoff had a three-year supply of Cuban cigars in 1988 when it stopped buying them. **********Looking elsewhere in the Caribbean for a producer, it turned to Hendrik Kelner, who owns the Tobacos Dominicanos cigar plant on the outskirts of this mountain city. **********Mr. Kelner, who is 44 years old, said his family had been in the Latin American tobacco business since 1920. He said that his 59-acre farm and 150-worker factory produce about four million cigars yearly, and that half the production will be in various Davidoff shapes. **********His plant uses mostly Dominican tobacco. For the Davidoff cigars, he imports the cigar wrappers - the outer leaf - from Connecticut. **********Mr. Kelner said most of his cigars are made by hand. He pays workers $27 for each 1,000 cigars wrapped. The average worker, he said, can wrap around 1,250 cigars weekly, making average pay about $34 a week, high by Dominican standards. **********The Dominican Republic currently provides about 50 million premium-quality cigars annually to the United States. It is the largest supplier to the American market. **********In 1983, Davidoff, with an eye on the United States market, began producing in Honduras the Zino brand of cigars, which sell for $2.75 to $6. The company would not disclose how many Zinos were sold; one cigar expert, who asked not to be identified, said 800,000 to a million were sold in the United States last year. **********George Brightman, the manager of the Davidoff retail shop at 535 Madison Avenue in New York City, said said the Davidoffs coming to the United States would be aged six months, reinspected and repacked at Stamford and introduced in August. Most of the cigars will sell for $4 to $12, he said.

The carriers will offer a 10 percent discount from their regular calling-card rates, the same discount that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company provides for its Universal credit card. Review Sought by Banks **********The Universal card is a Mastercard or Visa card that is sponsored by A.T.&T. and combines the features of a general-purpose credit card and a telephone calling card. The nation's leading banks have asked regulators to review the legality of A.T.&T.'s sponsorship, have adopted rules to prevent any more non-banks from issuing Visa cards, have added long-distance calling features to their own cards and have even shifted a little of their own long-distance business away from A.T.&T. **********Yesterday's move by American Express came as A.T.&T. said its card business continued to grow faster than expected. A.T.&T. said that by last Thursday, it had issued 5.8 million cards, whereas analysts had predicted the company would only issue 5 million cards by the end of the year. A.T.&T. introduced the Universal card on March 26. **********Consumers have charged purchases and calls totaling $2.2 billion to the Universal card, and owe $1 billion, said Bruce E. Reid, a company spokesman.  Luxury Versus Thriftiness **********American Express has long cultivated an image of luxury and exclusivity for its card, while U S Sprint and particularly MCI heavily advertise themselves as low-cost alternatives to A.T.&T. But Norma J. Arnold, the senior vice president for membership marketing at American Express, said the contrasting strategies would not be a problem. **********\"We believe that MCI and Sprint are very viable and successful competitors, as is discernible from the shift of share in the long-distance market,\" she said. **********American Express cardholders will be able to charge calls to the card on U S Sprint's network beginning on Nov.1, and on MCI's network starting on Jan. 1. To do so, a cardholder must first call a toll-free number and obtain a four-digit personal identification number to use with the card number. **********Effective immediately, cardholders that use MCI or U S Sprint for their home telephone also can be charged for these calls on their American Express card bill rather than on their local phone company bill. Ms. Arnold said the feature would appeal to people who have a separate phone line at home for business calls that their employer pays. Fewer Cards, Fewer Bills **********Market research told American Express two years ago that consumers wanted fewer credit cards and fewer bills, and the company began working on billing procedures then, Ms. Arnold said. She added that American Express had not lost customers to the Universal card nor was the deal with MCI and U S Sprint influenced by Universal's success. **********\"The effect of the A.T.&T. card launch has been an internal cannibalization of the bank-card business,\" she said. **********Peter A. Gallagher, a senior vice president of A.T.&T.'s Universal card unit, said it was unclear whether customers were switching from the American Express card. **********Mr. Gallagher said A.T.&T. had an advantage because, unlike American Express, it had offered never to charge an annual fee to customers who take the card this year. \"The bottom line is, why pay up to $75 a year for something you can get free for life from A.T.&T.?\" he said. **********A.T.&T. has indicated that it will begin charging an annual fee to customers who sign up next year.

''They use right-wingers' names or titles to disguise themselves and give them some politically decent flavor.'' **********Others took a different view, saying the ultranationalist groups represented a dangerous trend in Japan toward a right-wing political mentality that glorifies the institution of the Emperor, makes no apologies for Japan's military expansion of the 1930's and has a low regard for dissent. **********The Asahi newspaper, for instance, labeled the assassination attempt ''a barbarous challenge to freedom of speech'' and said it ''reminds us that our society still remains vulnerable to a nightmare of terrorism against freedom of speech.'' **********Paper a Rightist Target **********Asahi has itself been a longtime target of rightist attacks, with ear-splitting sound trucks - a favorite tactic of right-wing groups - occasionally descending on its offices to protest editorials questioning right-wing ideals. **********Two and a half years ago, an Asahi reporter was killed and another was critically wounded by a masked attacker who opened fire with a shotgun in an incident that, until the attack on the Mayor on Thursday, was been the most prominent recent violent action by a right-wing group in Japan. **********Some of the news coverage focused today on another aspect of the political implications of the case. **********The recently retired senior official said there was some evidence that right-wing groups, with their sound trucks and protesters, were sometimes used by the members of governing Liberal Democratic Party, which has a strong conservative faction, to harass their political opponents. **********It was also pointed out in news analyses today that last year, conservative members of the Nagasaki legislature said that the large security detail protecting Mr. Motoshima was a waste of taxpayers' money, and that in response the Mayor asked that the police detail be cut back in December. **********After he made his comment in December 1988 about Emperor Hirohito, Mr. Motishima was ousted from his position as the head of the governing party's local branch. **********The shooting suspect, Mr. Tajiri, was apparently known by the police as a potential threat well before the episode on Thursday, and there was some question why the Mayor could not have been better protected. **********A Profession of Terrorism **********In May 1987, for example, Mr. Tajiri appeared on a morning television talk show about right-wing groups and was asked if he believed in the use of terrorism against those whose opinions differed from his. ''Yes, because for right-wingers, terrorism is the core,'' he said. **********News accounts said today that the Spiritual Justice School was established in 1981 with headquarters in Nagasaki and branches in other cities. Specialists in right-wing groups said it was a well-known group but not large, with perhaps only a dozen active members. **********One specialist on ultranationalist activities, Masayuki Takagi, an Asahi writer, said there were about 840 right-wing groups in Japan with a total of 125,000 members, with the number increasing each year. **********In an interview, Mr. Takagi said that the increasing numbers were considered part of the ''new right,'' but that these new groups engaged in noisy street demonstrations - with 810 sound trucks clogging downtown Tokyo in August 1988 - and disavowed violent activities. **********Mr. Takagi said that organized crime groups had spread through most of the right-wing groups, but that right-wing terrorism had generally been decreasing in Japan. **********Only about 50 of the right-wing groups, with a membership of 22,000, are said to be watched by the police, Mr. Takagi said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/27/business/why-world-shrugged-off-tokyo-s-stock-tumble.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1990-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 936, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Why World Shrugged Off Tokyo's Stock Tumble", "print_headline": "Why World Shrugged Off Tokyo's Stock Tumble", "body_text": " **********For some time, market watchers around the world have expressed concern that if the high-flying Tokyo stock market ever plunged, other markets would be carried down with it. But the Japanese stock market's 11 percent dive over the last week, a fairly big move by most standards, has not touched off sharp slides elsewhere, and analysts are scurrying to explain why. **********The most common explanation is that the Japanese market had moved up so much more sharply than other markets that some downward adjustment was due, both to bring it into line with the bond markets in Japan and with financial markets in other countries. Some movement, analysts argued, could be accommodated -even expected. **********''I don't see why this should become self-feeding, because there is no real talk of a worldwide recession and earnings are still reasonable,'' said David A. Robbins, head of the international securities department at UBS Securities. ''This should support equity markets.'' **********'Peculiarly Japanese' **********''So far investors look at the Tokyo market decline as a peculiarly Japanese situation, not a global situation,'' said Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York. **********This is not to say investors in other markets have not been worried about the 4,138.45-point decline in the Nikkei 225 index of leading stocks in the last six days. A sharp decline in a major market, even if easily explained, can be unsettling. The United States stock markets fell each day last week, although the Dow Jones industrial average shot up yesterday by 38.29 points, to 2,602.48. For the year, the United States is down about 5 percent, Britain has dropped close to 7 percent and France is off more than 10 percent. **********The relatively benign view of the decline in the Japanese stock market, which is now down 14.4 percent since the end of last year, rests on the fact that many analysts thought the rise to record levels at the end of December had taken the market too high. Because of this, it was expected that the Japanese market would fall, a move known in market jargon as a correction. **********'Its Own Correction' **********''A lot of stock markets I follow have already corrected,'' said Lawrence W. Harris 3d, manager of the Worldwide Value Fund. ''Japan seems to be having its own correction.'' **********In addition, the sharper rise in interest rates in Japan and the unusually public fight over interest-rate policy between the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, and the Finance Ministry have, for now, made this more a Japanese problem than a global one. **********While interest rates have risen around the world, the increase in Japan has been sharper than in many other countries. Rates on 10-year bonds in Japan are up about 19 percent this year, compared with 7 percent in the United States. This means earnings on bonds became far more attractive than those on stocks, drawing money out of the stock market into bonds. The divergence in Japan has been larger than in other countries, like the United States and Britain. That is one reason the stock markets in those countries have fared better, said Alistair Ross Goobey of James Capel Inc., a London brokerage firm. **********''The Japanese market, more than any other market, was extended in relation to its bond market,'' said Jeffrey M. Weingarten, director of international equity research at Goldman, Sachs in London. **********Fight Over Interest Rates **********Despite the fact that the Japanese wave has not yet swamped the rest of the world, many financial experts say the outlook is still uncertain. The fight in Japan over interest-rate policy could be unsettling. But Mr. Kohashi of Daiwa, for one, thinks Japan's desire to stabilize its market means interest rates will not be raised again soon. **********But not everyone agrees. Some analysts warn that Japan may have to raise interest rates further to prop up the yen, which leaves the door open to a continued decline in Japanese stocks. With higher interest rates and a further decline in stock prices - of perhaps an additional 2,000 to 3,000 points - analysts said Japan's market problems could be contagious. Higher rates in Japan could help push interest rates higher around the world, weakening equity prices everywhere. **********There are other pressures, too, that investors fear could push interest rates higher around the globe. Perhaps the most important is that the unification of Germany and development of Eastern Europe will push world interest rates higher by increasing the demand for credit. If that happens, that could force stock prices in Japan and other nations down further. **********Pressure on Institutions **********Another fear is that Japan's market weakness could spread if Japanese economic officials get so worried about the fall of their market that they put pressure on large institutional investors to bring some of their money back to Tokyo to support the market there. **********''It's not changing my view that the sidelines are the place to be,'' said Barton M. Biggs, director of worldwide strategy at Morgan Stanley, who said he was surprised by the rise in American stock prices yesterday. ''I think it is a silly reaction because the Japanese market is another cloud on the horizon.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/14/business/mixed-income-housing-in-new-jersey-big-hoboken-project-back-on-track.html": {"writer_name": "Rachelle Garbarine", "pub_date": "1990-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 853, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Hoboken Project Back on Track", "print_headline": "MIXED-INCOME HOUSING IN NEW JERSEY; Big Hoboken Project Back on Track", "body_text": " **********Four years after it was announced and then ran into a number of problems, an ambitious plan to construct more than 400 apartments here for families of varying incomes is back on track. But instead of building a single project on one site, as orginally conceived, the sponsor will deliver the housing in two developments on three parcels. **********In January, 115 of the apartments will be ready for occupancy in Observer Park. The 12-story tower is rising on the corner of Bloomfield Street and Observer Highway in the southern half of this mile-square port city on the Hudson River, opposite Manhattan. It will be followed by Hudson Square North, a 12-story, 150-unit building under construction on Third Street, between Hudson and River Streets. Twenty percent of the units in both buildings will be set aside for low-income households, with Hoboken families getting preference. **********The third project, called Hudson Square South and in the planning stage, will also contain 150 units. All three are being built by the Applied Companies, a local developer. The architect is Becher & Wolczynzki of East Hanover, N.J. **********The projects are welcomed by Hoboken, where housing development, rapid until a few years ago, has slowed considerably. \"They provide much-needed affordable housing and show that the city continues to hold appeal as a residential market,\" said Peggy E. Thomas, director of the Community Development Agency. **********Ms. Thomas was referring to the rejection by voters this summer of the 3.2-million-square-foot project planned by the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 32 acres of Hoboken's crumbling waterfront. It would have included offices, stores, a park and apartments. **********The housing developments will also bring revenue to the financially pressed city. Ms. Thomas said that when they were completed, the first two projects -- financed through state, Federal, county and private funds -- would generate taxes of $676,502 a year. **********Delivering the units, however, proved to be a formidable task. In 1986, Applied contracted with the city to transform a rundown site, made up of three major parcels along Observer Highway, into a mixed-income housing project. It was to contain 450 residences in five mid-rise and high-rise buildings, as well as a park. **********But homeowners in the neighborhood opposed the project, saying its height and density would destroy the character of the area. They sued the city, contending that its redevelopment plan was arbitrary and capricious. Ultimately the lawsuit, which was redirected to the scaled-down Observer Prk project, was decided in favor of the developer. **********A further problem was the finding of mercury and lead on the tract, rendering it too costly to develop, and the project was shelved. Only the site of the current Observer Park project was salvaged, said Joseph Barry, president of Applied, noting that it has been cleared of contaminants. He said the cleanup had cost $350,000. **********In addition, the company's joint- venture partner at the time -- Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus -- pulled out of the project. Nonetheless, Mr. Barry said he had renegotiated with the Hoboken City Council to redevelop for housing the current Observer Park site as well as two vacant parcels on River Street. **********Mr. Barry said he did so because he felt there was a strong need for such housing and that if priced correctly, the units could be easily rented. Applied paid the city $6.1 million for the three sites, which Mr. Barry described as prime because they are near PATH, train and bus depots. **********New Jersey is still saddled with a large stock of new and existing for-sale housing. But the rental market is brisk because an increasing number of people, concerned about the nation's uncertain economy, are choosing to rent rather than buy. **********\"Right now, there is a stronger rental than selling market in Hoboken,\" said Alice Galmann, a partner in Singleton/Galmann Real Estate, a local realty company. Monthly rents in Hoboken range from $800 to $1,000 for one-bedroom apartments and from slightly more than $1,000 to $1,300 for two-bedroom apartments, with some as high as $1,800, she said. **********Market-rate apartments at Observer Park will rent for $850 to $995 a month for a 625-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment, and for $1,400 to $1,600 a month for a 1,100-square-foot, three-bedroom unit. Mr. Barry said all but six units had been rented, most of them to people commuting to Manhattan. **********At Hudson Square North, where the one- to three-bedroom units will be larger, rents are expected to be slightly higher. Mr. Barry said completion of that project is set for next October. The apartments reserved for families with low incomes in both buildings will rent for $220 to $320 a month. **********Mr. Barry said the third project might be a luxury rental. But that decision, he added, hinges on the market and the availability of sewers. At present there is a state-imposed moratorium on sewer hookups until Hoboken expands its treatment plant. The two buildings under construction are exempt because they contain affordable units."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/14/business/company-news-introductory-fare-by-northwest-air.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Introductory Fare By Northwest Air", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Introductory Fare By Northwest Air", "body_text": " **********Northwest Airlines said it would offer low introductory fares for round-trip travel between San Jose and other points through June 15.

What I have heard can be summed up in a word: Dissatisfaction. **********People are dissatisfied with how the industry has performed -- and not just because the market has turned down.

As clients, they are not convinced that those activities are in their best interests. **********The message, I believe, is that they want the industry to get back to basics. **********Today, I find leaders of the corporate world are more disappointed and downright angry with this industry than I have ever seen them before. While there are notable exceptions, their perception is that there has been a gradual but accelerating shift in the industry from being primarily an advice giver to becoming a competitor. **********Among individual investors, if there isn't the same anger or frustration, there is at least a strong measure of dismay. **********Certainly, many things have improved during the 1980's. There is a lot more information available and the reaction time is quicker. Turnaround time for electronic orders at the New York Stock Exchange averages 28 seconds. Customer reporting is efficient and increasingly free of error. **********Despite these and many other advances, a large segment of the public believes Wall Street is increasingly designed to serve only the largest investors and that for whatever reason, the market has become too volatile. **********Institutional money managers are also, in many cases, not too happy with this industry. They also want to be certain that when they seek the service of the securities industry, they are provided with agents who put the customer first. **********The three groups of customers -- corporate, individual and institutional -- are doing more than just complaining. They are also taking a walk. Individuals, when they are not sitting on their hands, are fleeing in droves to professionally managed accounts. Institutions are talking about increasing trading directly with other institutions. Major corporations are bringing some investment banking activities in-house. **********Not all the reassessing that is needed, however, is by the industry.

After lending heavily to construct new condominiums and office buildings when real estate prices were rising rapidly, the bank has had trouble collecting on loans to developers now that real estate prices are weak and vacancies are rising. **********About three months ago, real estate problems caused the bank to set aside additional reserves, which resulted in a $125 million loss for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Boston banking company said it was adding $280 million to its reserve for loan losses, and would write off $300 million of loans. **********Real Estate Holdings Climb **********The banking company's holdings of real estate, mostly acquired through foreclosure on bad loans, rose to $600 million from $300 million, and $200 million more of loans became non-performing during the quarter. Non-performing loans, which are 90 days in arrears or whose prospects are poor, declined to $1.1 billion at the end of the year from $1.5 billion on Sept. 30 because of the $300 million charge-off and the increase in real estate holdings. **********To offset the losses from real estate, the Bank of Boston said yesterday that it had sold $645 million of credit card receivables to Chase, which has been a heavy buyer of credit card receivables this year. Chase paid a premium for the receivables, resulting in a pretax profit of about $145 million for the Bank of Boston. **********The Bank of Boston also added about $50 million to its fourth-quarter earnings by financing a part of its pension plan with annuity contracts purchased from insurance companies. The gain occurred because the pension plan held stocks, bonds and other assets whose value exceeded the cost of the annuity contracts. **********Stock Rises 75 Cents, to $19.75 **********Bank of Boston stock rose 75 cents yesterday, to $19.75. In addition to the stimulus from the large gain in broad stock market indexes, analysts said the rise in Bank of Boston stock reflected speculation by some buyers that the company was nearing the end of its problems. **********Thomas J. Tisch, who in combination with other members of his family has bought more than 6 percent of Bank of Boston's stock since late October, said last week that even if the company was to announce additional loan losses, he was convinced that it was a fundamentally sound company whose stock was ''over penalized'' by the troubles of the region's economy. **********Several analysts cautioned that problems in the New England economy were not diminishing and that banks in that region might find even more troubled loans in the future. **********Ira Stepanian, the chief executive at the Bank of Boston, said that the New England economy deteriorated in the fourth quarter and that there are ''continuing uncertain economic conditions for 1990.'' **********Virginia Adair, a banking analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said that ''I expect there will be at least two more quarters of continued problems at Bank of Boston, with increases in loan loss reserves and increases in nonperforming assets.'' **********For Chase, the purchase of Bank of Boston's credit card business was the fifth acquisition in the last 12 months. Including another small purchase at the end of 1988 from the Investors Savings Bank in Richmond, Chase has purchased about two million credit card accounts this year, while adding a million accounts through its own marketing efforts. **********David J. Cornell, a vice president at Chase, said that pretax profits of 4 to 4.5 percent on credit-card receivables made the business one where Chase expected to continue to expand through acquisition and growth of its existing business.

He said he had advised clients ''to cut cash levels to the minimum and invest in high-quality bonds and stocks.'' Beginning of the End? ''You're looking at a wounded bear,'' said Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers, Harriman. ''The beginning of the end of a bear market comes when bond prices perform better than stocks, as they have since Sept. 25.

''They have to step up to the plate and buy stock.'' **********He argued that continuing uncertainty about the budget and the Iraqi crisis ''are holding people back,'' but that ''if we get a positive resolution on those, it'll be much easier for people to come in and buy.'' **********Trading volume slumped to 149.6 million shares, from 165 million Monday, as 1,077 shares dropped in price and an unsettling 276 fell to new lows. Only five touched new highs and 487, or less a fourth of the total, rose in price. **********Near Certainty on Fed **********Mr. Bostian of Jesup, Josephthal argued that ''it's almost certain that the Fed is going to ease monetary policy in a matter of days because a budget accord is expected in a matter of days.'' **********A budget agreement seemed close indeed. After the market closed, the White House said President Bush had canceled a trip to Cincinnati, were he was to attend the second World Series game, so that he could monitor the budget talks in Washington. **********Mr. Bostian also said that ''the probabilities are fairly high that the Middle East crisis will be resolved in a month or so.'' **********''You can't be sure if it's war or peace,'' he said, ''but it's another positive because even if it's war, it could be decisive fairly quickly.'' **********As a result, he said, ''One should be focusing on the stock and bond market to rally in the near future.'' **********No 'Follow-Through' **********But Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures for Shearson, Lehman Brothers, said: ''In the last six weeks, there hasn't been a rally where the market's been up more than twice in a row.

Speculators who had sold short rushed to buy back stock before it rose further. When the rally faded, the short sellers sold stock short again, driving down the market. **********By the end of the session, crude rose 94 cents a barrel, to $38.89; bonds rose sharply, yields on 30-year bonds fell to 8.88 percent, and stocks stood 619 points, or 21 percent, away from their all-time high in mid-July. **********Amid concern about the state of many American banks, Citicorp, the biggest banking company, topped the Big Board active list falling 1 1/8, to 13, with 3.6 million shares changing hands. It said third-quarter earnings per share fell 43 percent largely because of provisions for poor real estate loans. **********Nynex, the phone company, fell 3 7/8, to 72 7/8, after administrative judges of the New York Public Service Commission recommended smaller rate increases than it had requested. **********General Electric reported a small rise in profits but the stock fell 2 7/8, to 51 1/2, on concern about future quarters.

Some of them, like Mark Mathabane, who came to the United States in 1978, have married in their new homelands.

But with growth in a number of its lines languishing, the company is forcing itself to look at old businesses in new ways. **********With knowledge obtained in building giant turbines for electric utilities, for example, Westinghouse has created a $1 billion business building and operating plants that burn garbage and use the resulting steam to generate electricity. And Westinghouse's electronic systems group has been focusing increasingly on work not for the Defense Department, which faces budget cuts, but for civilian uses like air-traffic control equipment and security systems for homes and offices. **********Those are but two of dozens of changes being directed from headquarters here as the company founded by George Westinghouse in the last century prepares to enter the next by looking for new applications for its expertise. **********''Even though the labels of the basic business sectors will likely remain unchanged, there will be fundamentally different businesses in them and different challenges,'' said Robert L. Slane, a Pittsburgh-based partner of McKinsey & Company, the management consultants. **********Until now, the company has dealt with the slowdown in its businesses partly by restructuring. Since 1983, it has sold more than 75 businesses it considered undesirable or poorly performing. Among them have been some of Westinghouse's best-known entities, including its light bulb business, its home-appliance unit and its elevator groups. **********The financial results of the restructuring have been striking. Operating margins, defined as operating income as a percentage of sales, nearly doubled in the six years ended last Dec. 31, to 10.7 percent from 6.5 percent. Return on equity has averaged a robust 20.1 percent over that period. **********Sales and net profits have risen steadily, too, reaching $12.8 billion and $922 million, respectively, in 1989, from $10.7 billion and $532.2 million in 1984. **********Now, with almost all of its laggards cut loose, with costs reduced and productivity increased, Westinghouse can turn its attention to realizing one of its main goals for the 1990's: continuing to report double-digit increases in earnings per share. Earnings per share rose from $3.02 in 1984 to $6.31 in 1989, an average of more than 20 percent a year. **********With strong presence in power-generation equipment, military electronics, broadcasting and financial services - even home building and land-development - Westinghouse's strategy is to use its existing knowledge to branch into areas with greater growth prospects than its current lines. **********Shift in Nuclear Plants **********When it became clear in the 1980's that the nuclear power-plant business would remain mired in controversy, for example, Westinghouse used its knowledge in that field to become the leading operator of waste storage operations in the Energy Department's nuclear weapons production program. **********Even Westinghouse's broadcasting group, a chain of 22 radio stations and five television stations, has realized that slowing population growth will limit its expansion to just a few percent annually. It is now attempting to become a leading provider of programming to cable television systems and independent television stations. **********Group W Productions, one of Westinghouse's programming organizations, sells advertising for and distributes the hit television show ''Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' and it is the distributor and advertising sales representative for reruns of the hugely successful television series ''The Cosby Show.'' **********If Westinghouse is successful in broadening its businesses, much of the credit will probably go to Paul E. Lego, a 60-year-old electrical engineer who will become the company's 13th chief executive on July 1. The only son of a Pennsylvania steel worker who rose through the ranks at Westinghouse to become president and chief operating officer, Mr. Lego will replace John C. Marous, another career Westinghouse man, who recently reached Westinghouse's mandatory retirement age of 65. Mr. Lego is expected to continue Mr. Marous's strategy of seeking fast-growing variations on the company's core businesses. **********Some Mature Industries **********He will have his hands full. Westinghouse's electronic systems group, a leading maker of weapons for the Pentagon, is already suffering from the slowdown in military spending. There is no sign of a resumption in new orders for nuclear power plants, which had been an important source of revenue for Westinghouse's energy and utility systems group. Westinghouse's Group W radio broadcasting network, one of the nation's largest, is suffering from the industrywide slump in advertising spending. Even Westinghouse's hugely successful financial-services operation, which finances commercial and residential projects and does business leasing and lending, has begun to show signs of weakness from a growing portfolio of troubled real estate loans. **********''When you review their remaining businesses, you conclude that the underlying growth potential is not all that great,'' said Russell L. Leavitt, the Westinghouse analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ''Many of the businesses are mature.'' **********Mr. Lego acknowledged the challenge in a recent interview here. **********''We have to show that we're still capable of growing the company in order to achieve an element of sustained value,'' he said, referring to Westinghouse's stock price, which has never commanded the same premium enjoyed by the shares of the General Electric Company, Westinghouse's leading rival. **********On the New York Stock exchange yesterday, Westinghouse shares closed down 62.5 cents, to $36.375 each. The stock carried a price/earnings ratio of 11, meaning its price was 11 times greater than per-share earnings. In contrast, General Electric shares closed down $1 yesterday, to $69.125 each, with a price/ earnings ratio of 15. **********But many of the new businesses Westinghouse is pursuing - television programming, for instance -are brutally competitive. Others, such as converting municipal garbage to energy through incineration, may get bogged down in the growing array of city ordinances limiting air pollution. **********Westinghouse's past corporate culture also stands in the way. As a 104-year-old company managed by and filled with engineers, Westinghouse prides itself on prudence and conservatism. Many of its top officers have spent their entire careers at Westinghouse, and the company rarely promotes from without. It also likes to stick with businesses: Westinghouse's broadcasting operation, for instance, is 71 years old; the electric-power generation business dates from the company's beginnings. **********''The hard part will be the people,'' said Robert H. Waterman, the co-author of ''In Search of Excellence,'' a best-selling book on management. ''How do you get people to embrace new ways of looking at old markets? It's very tough.'' **********Value in Conglomerates **********Whether being a conglomerate - a collection of separate companies involved in different businesses - is of value to shareholders remains the subject of debate. Many people think conglomerates do nothing for shareholders, arguing that investors can simulate a conglomerate themselves by buying a handful of stocks in different industries. But Westinghouse management remains committed to the concept, arguing that stand-alone companies are often run by outside directors who know little about the business, rather than by managers who grew up within the company. **********''The outside directors certainly would not spend the time managing the operation that is spent by the senior executives of Westinghouse,'' said Donald Povejsil, a retired strategic planner at Westinghouse. **********While Mr. Lego is following a tack similar to his predecessor's in focusing on growth areas related to the company's existing businesses, the men differ in their styles. **********A Chipper Salesman **********Mr. Marous spent many of his early years at Westinghouse in marketing posts. A chipper salesman-type who as chairman has been known for his energy, colorful speaking style and forthrightness, he seems to delight in telling visitors what a bright future he thinks Westinghouse has. **********''Today, our portfolio is stronger than it has ever been,'' he said in a recent interview. ''We don't have any losers.'' **********Mr. Lego, a workaholic who jogs five miles before arriving at his desk at 7:30 A.M., is the stereotypical engineer: soft-spoken, cerebral, highly quantitative and, some people say, a boring speaker. After Mr. Lego spoke recently to a group of securities analysts in Florida, Westinghouse's stock took a dive - a result, some analysts said, of Mr. Lego's low-key, understated speaking style. **********Others, however, come to his defense. ''Once you get to know Paul, you find that he is quite a dynamic person, no less motivated and anxious to put points on the scoreboard than John Marous,'' said Mr. Povejsil, the retired Westinghouse planner."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/25/business/challenge-to-pentagon.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Challenge to Pentagon", "print_headline": "Challenge to Pentagon", "body_text": " **********Eleven members of Congress today asked the Pentagon to reinstate Dr. Craig I.

He was responsible for bringing stars like Michael Jackson into Pepsi commercials \"to excite and entertain consumers,\" Mr. Ross said. **********Mr. Jordan, who is known in the industry as an incisive strategic thinker, has made his mark on the snack-food side of Pepsi and helped to turn Frito-Lay into a powerhouse. It is Pepsi's most profitable division. **********A beverage-industry analyst, Lawrence Adelman of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said Pepsi's ability to move its \"major players\" showed a strong depth of management. \"You don't normally see things like this in a major consumer products company,\" he said. **********Mr. Adelman said Mr. Enrico would be heading Frito-Lay at a time when competition was growing in the domestic snack-food business. Frito-Lay is expected to report an \"outstanding fourth quarter and year,\" Mr. Adelman said, with operating profits up 12 to 13 percent. **********Mr. Jordan's new post will put him in position to lead Pepsi's drive overseas in both drinks and snack foods. The overseas market is where Pepsi expects strong growth in the 1990's, the company said. **********\"A good growth company plans for the future, rather than have the future creep up on it,\" Mr. Adelman said, applauding the changes. **********Mr. Enrico will be returning to the place where he started, as a Frito-Lay brand manager in the early 1970's.

DAT machines cannot play the analog cassettes which consumers have bought by the millions for use as portable stereos and in home and automobile sound systems. **********But after making its announcement, Philips -- which is developing the new system with the Tandy Corporation -- has gone mum, shrouding in mystery how its machine works and sounds. Those details are crucial to determining whether the new machines, which are expected to reach the market in 1992, will be successful. **********Still, information about the design of the system can be pieced together from interviews with industry experts, from Philips's own disclosures to international standard-setting bodies, and from an interview a Philips executive gave in October to Audio Week, a New York industry newsletter. The key is the use of mathematical data compression technology, combined with advanced recording heads and sturdier cassette construction. **********The gist of the new technology is this: Analog cassette systems store the music on linear tracks that run along the length of the tape. The tape moves past a stationary head, which writes information onto the tape or reads information off it. **********The DAT players, by contrast, use a system, borrowed from video cassette recorders, in which both the tape and the heads move and in which data are written on the tape in a helical pattern, like the diagonal stripes on a candy cane. Thus, they are totally incompatible with analog cassettes. **********For the new system, Philips has developed a digital machine that uses a stationary head and linear tracks on a tape the same size as an analog cassette. Such a machine will also be able to play analog tapes. However, digital tapes made on the Philips machine would not be able to be played on analog-only machines. **********Analog systems, like records and cassette tapes, store music as an electromagnetic wave form that mimics the sound wave. Digital systems, like DAT and compact disks, store music as a series of numbers that are written in the zeros and ones of computer code. **********Digital music can be much crisper, free of the hisses and pops that mar analog recordings. The drawback is that it requires a lot more tape to store music digitally. **********In a DAT machine, for instance, the music is recorded by sampling it 48,000 times each second. Each of those samples is represented by a number that is written as a 16-digit string of zeros and ones. There are two such signals, one for each stereo channel, meaning that storing a single second of music requires 1.5 million zeros and ones. **********On top of that, extra bits are added to allow the system to mathematically correct errors and to store information that helps the machine automatically find a particular song on the tape. All together, a single second of music on a digital audio tape requires 2.8 million zeros and ones, or 2.8 megabits. The most powerful floppy disks now used in personal computers would be able to hold only four seconds of such music. **********Japanese consumer electronics companies that developed digital audio tape several years ago contemplated how they could pack that much information onto a tape. **********It would be best, they decided, if the tape moved slowly. Otherwise, an extremely long tape would be needed. But the tape would also have to move fairly quickly past the head, if the head was going to be able to read or write 2.8 million bits each second. **********Fortunately, the Japanese companies, in developing video cassette recorders, had already devised a way of making a tape that moves slowly yet can be read quickly and carries a lot of data. And that solution was adopted for digital audio tape. **********IN this system, known as helical scan, the tape moves slowly past a drum that contains two heads. The drum rotates rapidly in a direction at an angle to the moving tape; data is laid down in adjacent diagonal stripes on the tape. **********Philips, with the benefit of several years of advancing technology, uses mathematical techniques known as data compression to reduce the amount of zeros and ones needed to store digital music enough to be able to use linear tracks rather than helical scans. **********While Philips has not said much about the compression technique it will use in the digital compact cassette system, it is clearly similar to one the company has been promoting for use as a worldwide standard for digital radio broadcasts. **********The system takes advantage of the fact that certain sounds cannot be heard because they are too close in frequency to other, louder sounds, a phenomenon known as psycho-acoustic masking. By eliminating data corresponding to such inaudible sounds, Philips can reduce the number of digital bits needed to represent the music by a factor of four. **********Still, even with compression, cramming all the information onto linear tracks is not trivial. An analog tape has four tracks -- two stereo channels for each side of the tape. **********The Philips machine, using tape of the same width, is believed to have 18 tracks -- nine going in one direction for one side of the tape and nine going in reverse. Of each set of nine tracks, eight contain the musical information and the ninth contains control information. A sophisticated recording head reads all nine tracks in parallel, helping to speed the flow of information onto and off the tape. **********Existing analog tapes are too imprecise to handle so many closely spaced tracks. So the Philips system will use sturdier tapes that are encased in plastic. There will be covers over the part of the cassette where the tape is exposed and over the spindle holes that open only after the tape is in the machine. This is somewhat like the construction of video cassettes and 3.5-inch floppy disks. **********The tapes will have to be high quality, but will not be as high as the metal particle tape used for DAT systems. Hence, officials say, the blank digital compact cassettes will be more expensive than analog cassettes but less expensive than DAT cassettes. **********BECAUSE they will use linear tracks, the digital compact cassettes, like analog cassettes, can be duplicated at high speeds, making it less expensive for record companies to manufacture prerecorded cassettes. \"We can get into the business at reasonable cost,\" said Al Michaels, chief engineer for Warner Bros. Records in Burbank, Calif. **********Right now, record companies can duplicate an 80-minute analog cassette in one minute. But because the helical-scan technology is not amenable to high-speed duplication, copying an 80-minute digital audio tape requires 80 minutes. **********Some people contend that because it uses a stationary head, the digital compact cassette will use less power than the DAT machines and will thus be more suitable for use in battery-operated Walkman-style stereos. **********But DAT systems also have their advantages. The cassettes are smaller and can hold two hours of music, versus a 90-minute expected maximum for the Philips cassette. **********The biggest question regarding the Philips system is whether the compression will damage the music. A few people who have heard samples say the Philips system sounds as good as a compact disk, which uses no compression. \"It's quite comparable,\" said Ralph Cousino, vice president of technology development for Capitol-EMI Music Inc., a record company. More people will get to hear the system and see how it works next month at the Consumer Electronics Show , where Philips promises to take the wraps off its big secret."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/08/business/riklis-and-board-quit-e-ii-leaving-debt-of-1.2-billion.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1990-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 523, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Riklis and Board Quit E-II, Leaving Debt of $1.2 Billion", "print_headline": "Riklis and Board Quit E-II, Leaving Debt of $1.2 Billion", "body_text": " **********Meshulam Riklis, the financier who controls the corporate parent of the Samsonite luggage and Culligan water purification companies, said yesterday that he was stepping down from all executive positions with that company, the E-II Corporation. **********Mr. Riklis said the entire board of E-II was resigning along with him, leaving management up to Stephen J.

But perhaps even more startling are the conclusions about the future of the junk bond market one would reach if the study's logic is extended a few years into the future. The association, which is based in Miami Lakes, Fla., is supported by members and publishes a newsletter. **********Among the findings is that in the last decade 651 junk bond issues defaulted on more than $30.5 billion. The group calculated that the junk bond market comprises 3,500 issues with a value of more than $300 billion of debt, a figure up to $100 billion higher than some previous assessments. **********The study, which grouped defaults by the year of issue, demonstrated that for every year about 38 percent of the junk bond issues would eventually go into default. Based on that record of default, Mr. Lehmann predicted $40 billion in defaults in the next three years, with $15 billion of that this year. **********''The high incidence of default should keep junk bond yields at current levels,'' Mr. Lehmann said. ''This means that the new issue volume in 1990 will continue its sharp decline since fewer businesses can justify paying such rates.'' **********An even more important point that the study tries to make is that the rates are high because this is not a good time to be in the junk bond market. Mr. Lehmann regards the present rates as a sign of what is to come, not a buying opportunity. **********''The 5.3 percent premium that we came up with is interesting not only because that's where the market is now, but what it says is the differential doesn't represent a buying opportunity but indicates where the market is going to be in the future,'' he said. ''It's not going back to 2.6 percent premium that was adequate for the junk bond buyer.'' **********There is substantial evidence to support the contention that these kinds of differentials between Treasuries and junk are here to stay. **********First, as junk bonds grow more risky, the likelihood that these high yields will be maintained and that defaults will rise is strong. According to Moody's Investors Service, in December of 1981 $22.6 billion of bonds was graded as junk, or below investment grade. That accounted for 6.5 percent of all corporate bonds rated by Moody's. At that time, approximately 42 percent were assigned a Ba rating, that is, where the least risky junk bonds are. **********Today the amount of junk rated by Moody's has a face value of $226.2 billion, which accounts for 25.4 percent of all corporate bonds rated by Moody's. The least risky Ba-rated category accounts for only 25 percent of rated junk bonds. On the other hand, the B-rated and even lower-rated categories grew. **********''Between 1970 and 1988, the one-year default rate on average for a Ba-rated junk was 1.6 percent,'' said John Lonski, a senior economist with Moody's. ''For B-rated, junk it was 6.7 percent. If we continue to observe the downward shift toward B-rated, then the default rates, of course, will rise.'' **********Mr. Lonski emphasized that the buzzword now among many junk bond buyers is ''conservative.'' And with good reason. ''You have to keep in mind that the junk bond market has been skewed toward increased risk on average,'' he said. ''If I were putting together a junk bond portfolio now, I would skew my portfolio toward the upper echelon of the junk bond universe.'' **********If the picture of steady defaults in a junk bond universe that is more speculative and 10 times larger than it was in December 1981 does not paint a grim picture, the specter of a recession on top it all certainly finishes the job. **********''If we have a mild recession, we may find that banks and other sources will not be able to lend short-term money to make up for cash shortfalls of junk bond issuers,'' Mr. Lonski said, ''and a number of the more precarious issuers may not be able to procure short-term capital at favorable rates.'' **********This, of course, sharply increases the likelihood of a deluge of defaults. ''We've never had such a large and risky junk market come under the weight of a recession,'' Mr. Lonski said. **********But history is not necessarily the best indicator of where the fast-moving junk market will go. Given the variables, the rate of default in the near term may prove significantly higher than the pattern developed in the last decade. **********''If you extrapolate three years forward, you're looking at $40 billion in defaults,'' Mr. Lehmann estimated. ''We're looking for about $25 billion in new issues in 1990 and a 50 percent default rate in 1990 as a function of new issue volume.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/14/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** Grand Metropolitan Food Sector, Minneapolis, a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., London, a food and retailing conglomerate, appointed Chris J.

They say quick action is needed because four decades of unbridled industrial spewing and spilling in East Germany have created an acute crisis for man and nature. **********The enormous task ahead includes purging most of East Germany's rivers, tackling poisoned soil, rehabilitating sick and dying forests and bringing fresh air back to the suffocating industrial towns. Plans call for dismantling scores of obsolete, polluting factories and reviewing some 15,000, often illegal dumps of dangerous toxic waste. **********Like Chemical Warfare **********Some specialists debating the ecological disaster have compared the challenge ahead to restoring a country after chemical warfare. With financial and technical help from West Germany and to some degree from the European Community, it is expected to go on for most of this decade and cost billions of West German marks. **********''This is very ambitious, but in the year 2000 the two Governments want environmental standards for East and West Germany to be the same,'' said Wilhelm Steven, a liaison officer at the Bonn Ministry of Environment. **********The two Germanys have agreed that the environmental overhaul must begin even before a single German state is formed. **********To prevent East Germany from becoming a dumping ground for discarded or unsafe Western technology, officials here said, new rules effective July 1 require that any newly built industry, smokestack or engine in East Germany abide by West Germany's strict environmental regulations. The East's existing plants, vehicles and waste will be allowed a transition period to meet Bonn's standards. **********''If we applied West German law now, 70 percent of East German industry would have to shut immediately, which is not possible,'' Mr. Steven said. **********In conversations in West Germany, spokesmen take pains to stress that Bonn and Berlin are preparing every environmental project and target jointly. But by all appearances, the kitchen where the scrubbing and expunging is being organized is in Bonn. **********Emphasis Was on Production **********Consultants hired by Bonn in the last month have been probing through East Germany's contaminated cities and countryside, testing air, water and soil to establish a complete inventory of ills. In the rush to compete with the West, Communism's industrial drive had compelled managers only to meet production targets, regardless of the cost or hazards for people's health or the environment. **********Marlene Muhe, spokeswoman for the Environment Ministry, said that while the magnitude of the problems was evident, many precise data were still missing because East German specialists had lacked the measuring instruments. After the inventory is completed, she said, a full estimate of the costs can be made. **********But the bill for some vital environmental steps, officials said, is already painfully clear: providing East Germany with relatively clean energy is expected to cost $20 billion. That involves taking down all the large power stations driven by the country's highly polluting brown coal and replacing those and hundreds of other furnaces and plants that stoke this coal. The brown coal, the region's main source of energy, contains twice as much sulfur as that used in the West and, especially in winter, it poisons the air with sulfur dioxide, leaves everything covered in sticky soot and causes multiple health problems. **********Officials in East Berlin recently disclosed that their country was the biggest per capita producer of sulfur dioxide in the world. East Germany's 16 million people hurl 5.2 million tons of this pollutant into the air every year, compared with West Germany's 60 million people, who annually emit 3 million tons. **********Some Polluters to Be Closed **********Many factories have already been deemed to be too obsolete to merit installation of scrubbers, filters or other antipollution devices. In an initial study, the East German Government recently said it would need to close down at least 400 polluting and outdated plants. **********But the priority, strategists in Bonn said, is first of all to tackle the industries - like coking and chemical plants - that cause the most acute health hazards. Doctors in the industrial south of East Germany report a constant stream of afflictions of the skin, lungs, eyes and bones, and they complain that the growth of children is stunted. The heart of this, they argue, is that people breathe too many noxious gases and not enough oxygen. **********Some of the haste behind these plans is tangible at the new office of cooperation with East Germany in Bonn's Environment Ministry, where a special department was set up to expedite things. Staff members say that within a year they expect to transfer to Berlin. ''These projects are so urgent, we understand we will be first to move,'' said one official. **********The staff members here see it as an important achievement that while three months ago their ''standoffish'' East German counterparts insisted on calling this the office of Inter-German Cooperation, resistance to this cooperation in Berlin has broken down and the name has been switched to Inner-German Cooperation. **********'They Cannot Cope Alone' **********''They are not nervous or suspicious anymore,'' said one West German ecologist speaking of his East German counterparts. ''They have realized how terrible their problems are and that they cannot cope alone.'' **********The environmental planners say they have already been inundated with requests from East German townships asking for money and equipment. By the same token, companies from Europe, the United States and Canada have been lining up to sell antipollution devices and services. **********''Private industry will be indispensible in all this,'' said Mr. Steven, one of the coordinators, describing the crush of people lobbying for business. ''It seems that everyone wants to get cleaning up in East Germany on their curriculum.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/12/business/business-diary.html": {"writer_name": "Allen Myerson", "pub_date": "1990-08-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Diary", "print_headline": "Business Diary", "body_text": " **********OIL AND THE MIDDLE EAST **********Prices at the Pump **********Gas station owners seemed to react to the oil crisis with the quickened reflexes of commodities traders last week. Retail prices soared an average of 12 cents a gallon by Wednesday, with analysts blaming psychological factors, motorists blaming gas station owners, gas station owners blaming Arabs and oil companies. The oil companies fell all but mute. ''You don't see President Bush doing any talking either,'' said a Mobil Corporation representative at the beginning of last week. By Wednesday, the President was talking: ''I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share,'' he said. ''They should show restraint and not abuse today's uncertainties to raise prices.'' Suddenly, oil company executives recovered their voices, as several announced price cuts and several others defended their increases. **********Iran's Surplus Sales **********Iran, of all nations, to the rescue? Iran is said to have sold millions of barrels of oil from its storage tankers last week. After a long, punishing war with Iraq, Iran is apparently eager to profit from an embargo against its enemy. But oil company executives say that the boycott of Iraqi supplies has been almost completely effective. Western nations, they say, will have to draw from their strategic reserves. **********A Cold Winter? **********President Hussein might have picked the wrong season to start a fight. The world can more easily manage without his oil when it's warm. Oil finished on Friday at about $26.23, where some traders expect prices to settle. Analysts say that other producers can help compensate for a while for the cut-off in Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies. ''Right now you're in low-demand season,'' said Paul D. Mlotok, an energy analyst at Morgan Stanley. Getting along without Iraq's oil come winter is another matter. ''You're going to have to draw down inventory when people's tendency is to hoard it,'' he said. ''Prices could exceed $30.'' **********THE ECONOMY **********An Architect to Remember **********On Monday, at the age of 81, the architect who gave corporate America its modernist aspirations died. Beginning with Lever House - New York's first glass-walled office tower - in 1952, Gordon Bunshaft's example reverberated until all self-respecting corporations built with metal and glass instead of stone. His influence was amplified by his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whose huge New York office he headed. **********Lever House itself was an act of corporate philanthropy. It sacrificed much of its permissible size to create a glade in Park Avenue's high-rise forest. Other architects perverted his principals to give developers the most rentable square feet for the money in boxy buildings that mar many an American downtown. And since Mr. Bunshaft retired a decade ago, architects have rediscovered materials and details that he had consigned to history. But his best buildings remain to embody a timelessness and vision that seem to have passed from the corporate scene. **********Producer Prices Dip **********Producer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in July - before the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Some on Wall Street saw the decline was evidence of an economic slowdown. Steven Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities International, said that higher oil costs will hurt corporate profits, since demand is too weak for them to raise their prices. **********INTERNATIONAL **********Dual-Currency Soviet Economy? **********Attention Soviet shoppers: Reach into your mattresses, pull out your dollars and marks, and hurry over to the beriozka for all the goodies that hard currency can buy. The Soviet Union opened its hard-currency stores to its own citizens at the beginning of this month, without questioning how an estimated $2 billion in foreign money came into private hands. Most methods of obtaining it, like trading on the black market, remain illegal. A writer for the Soviet news agency, Tass, in an article headlined ''Epitaph for the Ruble?'', predicted the further emergence of a dual-currency economy, ''where a Soviet citizen will be asked to pay in hard currency not only for a packet of Marlboro cigarettes, but also for his airline ticket, a reservation in the restaurant and for mending his television set.'' Businesses, at least, might might soon find it much easier to acquire foreign currency. Moscow announced last week that it would open corporate money exchanges around the country next year. Only selected Soviet companies have been allowed to bid at the country's foreign-currency auctions so far. **********Japan Applies Oil-Shock Lessons **********The outlook for the Japanese economy is healthier than some fever charts indicate. Since the oil shocks of the 1970's - when idled taxi drivers, swept up in the panic, committed suicide - the Japanese have stockpiled oil, turned to nuclear power and made their cars and industries some of the most energy-efficient in the world. ''The Japanese have a great capacity to learn from trauma,'' said Susan J. Pharr, a Harvard professor of government. Japanese investors are not nearly so confident. The Nikkei stock average fell 7.4 percent for the week, to a low for the year. **********COMPANIES **********Lorenzo Bows Out **********After two corporate bankruptcies, three acquisitions and a raging strike, Frank Lorenzo is quitting the airline business. He announced his resignation as chairman of Continental Airline Holdings Inc., formerly Texas Air, on Thursday. The Scandinavian Airline System made his on-time departure a condition of buying his Continental stock, increasing its stake to 16.8 percent. His replacement is Hollis L. Harris, 58, who worked his way up from gate agent to president of Delta Airlines in 36 years. Mr. Harris pledged to transform Continental's image and service and restore its profitability. Investors, who have suffered from Continental's decline, celebrated the news by bidding up its stock 39 percent in a day. With the company doubled over by debt, ''Mr. Harris should be able to open more doors in the financial community,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. The agreement with S.A.S. bars Mr. Lorenzo from the airline industry for seven years. Mr. Lorenzo has even more reason than shareholders to celebrate, as he leaves with $30.5 million from a comfortable severance package and a premium price for his stock. **********Donaldson Heads Exchange **********William H. Donaldson, one of the founding partners of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., was named to head the world's largest stock exchange last week. He will succeed John J. Phelan Jr. as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange in January. Mr. Donaldson, who is 59 years old, faces the tasks of defending the exchange against challenges from overseas markets, regional exchanges and other new ways of trading stocks and betting on the market. **********The UAL Takeover Plan **********The board of directors gave employees of UAL Inc. a break last week, but the economy didn't. The board decided on Wednesday to give the employee unions two more months to arrange financing for their $4.38 billion, $201-a-share bid. But with fuel prices rising and the economy lurching towards recession, airlines look like the last companies to invest in. The unions have had trouble finding equity partners, and several banks have defected. One hopeful sign: Northwest's corporate parent, NWA, the only major airline to be taken private so far, is successfully paying its debts. **********Asbestos Cases Accelerated? **********Ten Federal District Court judges reached an agreement on Friday to consolidate tens of thousands of asbestos cases. The judges said their unusual agreement can bring about a quicker, less costly way of compensating more than 100,000 victims. As many as half a million more cases could be filed over the next decade as more workers who have inhaled asbestos fibers develop cancer. Some of the judges have estimated that about legal expenses have absorbed about two-thirds of the payments that would otherwise go to asbestos victims. But some companies and lawyers for the victims are likely to challenge the new arrangements. **********In Brief **********A Broadway show with record advance sales of $25 million was canceled after Actors' Equity refused to let an English actor play a Eurasian lead role. ''Miss Saigon'' had been scheduled to open in March 1991 with members of minority groups in 34 of 50 roles. **********The chairman of the world's largest accounting firm resigned after some of his partners objected to his choice of a vice chairman and possible successor.

One important tactic could be the installation of a new generation of more efficient pumps in their plants. **********Pump makers including Goulds Pumps Inc., Dresser Industries and the Ingersoll-Rand Company are selling or developing more efficient industrial pumps whose functions could include extracting waste water in chemical plants, washing pulp in a paper mill, pumping water through a boiler in a utility plant and extracting water after it has cooled hot slabs of steel. Executives say the pumps could cut manufacturers' energy costs for pumping by 20 to 30 percent, and by more than 40 percent in certain applications. **********Pumps are an important - and energy-intensive - component in the manufacturing process. Pump makers contend that if factories bought variable-speed motors, which consume less power when less work is needed, they could save dramatically on electricity. **********''The current oil situation presents us with some opportunities,'' said Stephen V. Ardia, president and chief executive of Goulds Pumps, based in Seneca Falls, N.Y. ''With customers' interest in energy efficiency being renewed, I would expect that there will be an increase in demand for new, more efficient pumps.'' **********Goulds, Dresser, Ingersoll Rand and other pump makers are now emphasizing variable-speed pumps. The motors of conventional industrial pumps operate at a single speed and the rate at which liquid flows is controlled by a valve. Rather than reduce the speed of the motor when a weaker flow is needed, saving fuel in the process, conventional pumps merely narrow the opening of the valve. The process of forcing the pump to strain against a valve is similar to operating a car's accelerator and brake at once. **********With a variable-speed pump, a sensor placed in front of the area where the valve would have been can measure the amount and pressure of the liquid flowing in. That information is passed along to a microchip that instructs the motor to increase or diminish its speed. **********Savings Called Significant **********''In restricting the flow of material through a pump, the control valve causes a substantial loss of energy,'' said Richard C. Steber, director of marketing for Goulds. ''Applying a variable-speed pump to the same application would allow the system to function far more efficiently without any valve.'' **********With the amount of energy saved with a variable-speed device, pump producers say, manufacturers can recover their costs within two years. **********''The savings in energy using a variable-speed pump can be significant,'' said Alexander Agostinelli, vice president of engineering for Dresser Industries' pump division. ''And these can be used by any manufacturer that uses pumps, whether in waste water treatment, refineries, chemical plants or utilities.'' **********All of the major pump makers have been manufacturing large, variable-speed pumps for utility boilers that are run by steam or gas turbines at rates of 10,000 horsepower or more. These manufacturers are developing electric-driven pumps with motors that operate at less than 200 horsepower - the staple of American manufacturing. Mr. Ardia said that Goulds was still developing such pumps and that they would be commercially available within a year. Ingersoll-Rand and Dresser said their versions would be available on a test basis within that time frame. **********Companies say their initial research into the variable-speed pump motors during the energy crisis in the 1970's indicated that they would be prohibitively expensive. But since then, the cost of the electrical material and the computer technology has declined, said Paul Cooper, director of research and development with Ingersoll-Rand's pump group. ''Also, there is now more competition between pump makers, which has helped to develop a more inexpensive product,'' he added. **********Mr. Cooper said the variable-speed pump Ingersoll-Rand was developing would probably cost $7,000 to $9,000, compared with $5,000 to $6,000 for a constant-speed pump. **********But not all manufacturers are reaching for variable-speed products. At a time when economic growth is nearly at a standstill and corporate profits have weakened, many executives are not eager to spend more on pumps. ''It is unusual to find a company that will spend a large amount of money to improve energy efficiency if it doesn't pay back in a short period of time,'' said Armond M. Cohen, senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, a Boston group that has negotiated efficiency programs with utilities. **********Mr. Ardia of Goulds said he had found resistance among some manufacturers. ''The technology is there, but I guess energy costs have not yet risen enough for manufacturers to come to us,'' he said. **********But he added that he expected more interest in variable-speed pumps as manufacturers modernize their plants. ''Our job is to let manufacturers know that this technology is available and that we can help them bring down their energy costs.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/07/business/waiting-eagerly-for-disaster-to-hit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1071, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Waiting, Eagerly, for Disaster to Hit", "print_headline": "Waiting, Eagerly, for Disaster to Hit", "body_text": " **********Disasters are Richard Zane's business, and business has been booming since a blackout on Wall Street in August caused palpitations or total arrest in 300 computer centers whose whirring hum is the modern company's heartbeat. **********\"It seems like everybody who hadn't realized how dependent they are on computers got a wake-up call on Aug. 13,\" said Mr. Zane, who is president of the North American division of Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services, which offers backup operations in the form of access to mainframe computers and personal terminals that are compatible with the client's office systems. Comdisco, which is in North Bergen, N.J. and is owned by the publicly traded Comdisco Inc., is the biggest company in this business, with 1989 revenues of $86.9 million. **********Mr. Zane said business has increased 50 to 75 percent since the power failure, the biggest computer crash in American history in terms of the number of computer centers affected. His major competitors, I.B.M. Business Recovery Services and Sungard Recovery Services, are reporting similar windfalls. **********Companies that had disaster plans in place, including Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Credit Lyonnais, are reassessing their lines of defense in the wake of the August failure, while businesses that were working without a net, like Fundamental Brokerage Inc. and the Continental Insurance Company, have been reviewing their options. **********While landmark catastrophes like the Wall Street failure, Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake produce surges in business, vendors of backup computer services have enjoyed tremendous growth in the last decade as businesses have increased their reliance on computers and recognized the inherent vulnerability. **********Today, 93 vendors make up an industry growing roughly by 40 percent a year. Just two years ago those companies generated $260 million in sales to 2,542 clients; as of last week revenues had increased to $400 million on sales to 4,600 clients, according to Tari Schreider, president of Contingency Planning Research, a consulting firm in Jericho, L.I. Half that business is controlled by Comdisco, Sungard and I.B.M. **********\"When the much larger blackout hit New York in 1977 most companies were largely unaffected because so few of their operations were done through computers that they could actually make up a lot of the work manually,\" Mr. Schreider said. \"Today many companies, especially financial firms on Wall Street, would be in serious trouble if they couldn't use a computer for even a few days.\"  The Cost of Insurance **********Disaster recovery firms sell subscriptions, generally five years in length, for monthly fees ranging from $200 to $100,000. As a rule, companies spend 1 to 2 percent of their data processing budget on this insurance, said John Nevola, manager of I.B.M.'s recovery service. **********For these fees, clients are allowed to transmit their data on a daily or even minute-by-minute basis to the backup computer centers, so that in the event of a failure their employees can pick up their work where they left off. **********\"During the blackout 12 of our customers declared disasters and sent more than 300 people every day for more than a week,\" Mr. Zane said. \"We fed their data into our mainframes, put their people on our terminals, and within a day their home offices couldn't tell that they were completing transactions through systems here, not in New York.\" **********While most companies with back-up plans for computer failures turn to commercial vendors for protection, others, including American Express and Liberty Brokerage, are more self-reliant. They count on computers at other regional offices or subsidiaries to back up many of their systems.  'Never Missed a Beat' **********Rather than finding an alternative computer site, Bankers Trust has backed up its power supply. During the Aug. 13 blackout \"our backup system worked flawlessly,\" said Alan Freedman, Bankers Trust's vice president for technology strategic planning. \"Within one millisecond of the outage our batteries kicked in; a few seconds later our generators went on so we never missed a beat.\" **********Commercial vendors argue that such internal solutions are unreliable. \"Unless you are drawing on reserved space, competing needs are involved,\" Mr. Zane said. He added that while Bankers Trust's generators worked perfectly during the blackout, Citicorp experienced major delays when its backup generators failed. In addition, generators, which can cost more than $1 million to buy and install in New York City, protect only against power failures, providing no relief in the event of fire or water damage, he said. **********Commercial vendors offer their clients \"hardened sites\" that are intended to be monuments to security and excess capacity. Comdisco's building is unmarked and surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. It is far from a water course that could flood, a fault line that could quake, or a chemical plant that could explode. Four redundant diesel generators guarantee continuous power.  'Every Precaution' **********To thwart human threats, 12 cameras scan the grounds outside while 50 ultraviolet sensors monitor movement within; computer cards, not keys, provide or deny access to its barren hallways. Although corporate espionage has never been a problem, Mr. Zane said his clients \"expect us to take every precaution, so we do.\" **********The focus of that attention is on three computer rooms or \"hot sites.\" The 9,000-square-foot rooms are actually quite cold from the air-conditioning units that cool the mainframes. A firehouse mentality pervades as tens of millions of dollars of equipment whirs, idling, waiting for a catastrophe; 368 I.B.M. terminals are dormant; 5,000 phone lines are untapped; 600 tables and 700 chairs are packed away. **********As the need for backup computer services becomes widely accepted, industry experts expect vendors to expand their offerings. Mr. Schreider noted that 59 percent of 1,830 companies he surveyed recently have a computer recovery plan but only 15 percent have an even broader plan including contingencies for office space and telecommunications. Developing evacuation plans, providing or arranging for alternative office space, and offering backup telecommunications systems are, therefore, three areas into which they will expand. \"The computer is not a company's only vital lifeline,\" Mr. Schreider said. \"As they become more aware of what they need to protect, vendors will be there to provide the service.\" **********Yet, as more companies seek greater protection, others are gambling. While his company has lost power twice in the last three years, Cleve Christy, office manager of the brokerage Weeden & Company in Manhattan, said: \"We're figuring the odds right now, but I personally doubt we'll do anything extensive. After all, what are the chances something like this will happen again?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/world/lebanon-s-cabinet-named-then-boycotted.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanon's Cabinet Named, Then Boycotted", "print_headline": "Lebanon's Cabinet Named, Then Boycotted", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Omar Karami today formed a 30-man Cabinet of pro-Syrian politicians and militia leaders to try to end Lebanon's 15-year civil war.

If the answer is no, he will face a decision about whether to use military force and if so, when, where, how much and to what end. **********At this point, much of the military advice the President is getting urges him to rely on air power and technological superiority and avoid a land war to the degree possible. **********Most analysts do not expect Mr. Hussein to force Mr. Bush's hand by launching an offensive of his own before mid-October. If the Iraqis did strike, American forces would lack a land force with heavy equipment sufficient to throw back an all-out assault by the 265,000 Iraqi troops based in the southern half of Iraq and in Kuwait. **********By some estimates, the United States, the Saudis and the rest of the international force would be hard pressed to prevent damage to the Saudis' main oilfields. But they are confident that an Iraqi offensive could eventually be stalled and contained, while air assaults on stategic targets in Iraq would eventually batter Iraq's military capacity and morale. **********The Potential Scenarios **********After mid-October, according to high-ranking Defense Department and White House officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, the President's options for offensive action would range from attacks on dams and roads as a way to step up economic pressure, through an attempt to kill or kidnap Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi leader, to an extensive military campaign to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait - and perhaps to continue to move into Iraq itself, perhaps all the way to Baghdad. **********Such a campaign might well involve a drive north by Army units on the left flank, marines on the right, and an amphibious assault, not unlike those at Anzio and Inchon, by other marine forces now held in floating reserve. **********Fighting could begin in one of three basic ways. Iraq could attack Saudi Arabia, which American experts, both inside and outside the Government, now consider extremely unlikely. President Bush could decide that the sanctions would not suffice, in a reasonable length of time, and order an offensive. Or a war could grow out of a small incident, like an inadvertent clash between American and Iraqi warplanes or some grievous mistreatment of hostages. **********The fabrication or exaggeration of a pretext for action by either side is not unthinkable, as the manipulation of the Gulf of Tonkin incident at a key moment in Vietnam shows. **********A Technological Edge **********If war began, American planners would seek to make the most of their technological capacity, which includes such elements as electronic deception to complicate Iraqi air defense, laser- and radar-guided missiles and, above all, an arsenal of weapons and devices that should enable American troops to fight effectively at night, something the Iraqis are not yet able to do. **********The planners would also seek to exploit vastly superior American air power to minimize the huge Iraqi superiority in troop and tank strength. Even when the United States deployment as now envisaged is complete, Baghdad is expected to have at least a two-to-one advantage in men and tanks, officers said. **********Even the battleship Wisconsin could come into play, launching its cruise missiles at important targets like command and control centers. **********By using missiles fired from afar, the Pentagon strategists would hope to limit American casualties and avoid the kind of ''Arab-Israeli desert blood bath,'' as one general put it, that took place in 1973. More than 20,000 soldiers were killed or wounded in the two-week war that year. **********''The numbers are scary, especially their infantry and artillery strength,'' said Bernard E. Trainor, a retired Marine general and former New York Times military correspondent who heads the national security program at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. ''But in the end, numbers don't count, if you have a concept that exploits your enemy's vulnerabilities. The Germans were outnumbered 10-to-1 in 1940, but they still overran France.'' **********The Need for Troop Strength **********Col. Harry Summers, a retired Army officer who writes and lectures on tactics, is much less sanguine. **********''You can certainly punish him with air power,'' Colonel Summers said of Mr. Hussein. ''You can destroy his air force. But that's not decisive if what you want to do is forcibly eject Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and make it hard for him to return. That takes troops on the ground, and I wouldn't want to try it with any less than 10 armored divisions, which you could only get by moving most of the Seventh Army down from Europe.'' **********A first step in any offensive operation would be the destruction of Iraqi fighters and bombers, either on the ground or in aerial combat, and the elimination of the 36 SCUD-B missile launchers. **********Anthony Cordesman, the author of ''The Lessons of Modern War,'' a history of the Iran-Iraq conflict, said that ''we have the ability to win air superiority very quickly.'' **********The Iraqi Air Force's planes - a few top-notch Soviet-built MIG-29's but mostly older MIG-23's and French-built Mirages - are considered inferior to the best American hardware. **********Available to American commanders would be Awacs radar planes to help fighter pilots spot enemy aircraft, EF-111 and EC-130 electronic jamming planes to confuse Iraqi electronic systems, and a huge arsenal of fighters, fighter-bombers, ground-attack planes and bombers - F-15's, F-16's, A-10's and Harriers in Saudi Arabia, F-111's and F-117's in Turkey, F-14's, F/A-18's and A-6's on board the carriers Independence, Saratoga and Eisenhower, and even B-52 bombers based on Diego Garcia island in the Indian Ocean. **********For Iraqi forces in the desert, there would be no jungle to provide cover, which greatly reduced the value of American air superiority in Vietnam. **********Talk of 'Surgical Strikes' **********In theory, the economic pressure could be tightened through the limited use of air power. Mr. Hussein's fragile domestic economy, strained by the embargo on food shipments, could be further disrupted through attacks on bridges, highways or even the two big dams just west of Baghdad and other hydroelectric plants. **********There is much talk in Washington of ''surgical strikes'' from the air, but the experience of the Vietnam War, when pilots found it tremendously difficult to hit even large targets like the Paul Doumer bridge in Hanoi, makes some observers skeptical. A former naval pilot who flew dozens of missions over Hanoi and Haiphong said recently, ''Surgical strikes exist only in think-tanks and mental institutions.'' **********In addition, the American military establishment, starting with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is firmly opposed to gradual escalation or limited offensives, having concluded that the Vietnam War was lost precisely because of a limited application of force. **********''Once you get air superiority, they will want to flatten Baghdad,'' Representative Aspin commented. **********Flattening Baghdad would inevitably entail thousands of civilian casualties - Muslims killed by Christians - and that might put intolerable pressure on the coalition of western and Arab countries lined up against Iraq. **********''We ought to play to our strength, which is air power,'' said Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. ''But if we use military force in a way that alienates a lot of our partners in this operation, we will lose the embargo, and we will have that erode very rapidly, in which case we will be counterproductive to our own aims.'' **********One Military Solution **********Finally, an extensive campaign of air bombardment would threaten the Western hostages who have reportedly been dispersed to strategic targets around Iraq to act as ''human shields.'' **********Asked what he would do if told that a military solution was needed, a leading Congressional expert on Mideast warfare commented: ''Establish air superiority, launch air attacks on civil and military targets away from population centers, especially in the southern desert, then try to push into and through Kuwait, stopping on a line curving northwest from Basra, where the fertile land ends and the major highways leading south from Baghdad peter out.'' **********Such a plan, which was mentioned in interviews with several other experts, would be dependent for its long-term success on either inducing the downfall of a humiliated Saddam Hussein or a continued program of air interdiction to prevent the effective resupply of Iraqi troops and thus to make a major counterattack impossible. **********''Even that,'' said the expert, who described himself as a hawk, ''would be quite a difficult proposition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/17/business/3-plead-guilty-in-stock-fraud.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 217, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3 Plead Guilty In Stock Fraud", "print_headline": "3 Plead Guilty In Stock Fraud", "body_text": " **********Three former officials of F.

Semach Kapach said as he sat in the emergency room at Josef Tal hospital in Eilat receiving treatment for light wounds. **********\"I saw the terrorist lying by the side of the road with his automatic rifle held out front,\" he said. \"He began to shoot, and I immediately ducked over my seat toward the passenger seat, and grabbed tight onto the steering wheel, praying I could still drive straight.\" **********A brigadier general who did not give his name said another noncommissioned officer drove past alone in a Peugeot. The Egyptian shot him as he passed, \"and he managed to go another few hundred meters and apparently died in his car,\" the general said.

An army bus was stopped across the way, and since the man was in uniform, we thought he must need help. But when we got close, he opened fire.\" **********The driver, 36-year-old Eliezer Wahabe, was fatally wounded. **********\"While the shooting was going on,\" said Yehud Nuriel, one of the passengers, \"I told the people to lie down on the floor.

At least one other soldier also fired at the gunman, who fled back toward the border. **********Of the bus passengers, 26 people were wounded, 5 of them seriously. **********Dan Ran Bahar, the driver of a bus that arrived on the scene immediately after the firing stopped, wept intermittently tonight as he described carrying the dead and wounded to the hospital. **********\"I travel that route a lot,\" he said. \"Sometimes the Egyptians at the border post say 'Shalom' to us. The truth is that there's an Egyptian outpost with two soldiers overlooking the spot where this happened. It occurred right under their eyes, and they perhaps could have done something.

The President, who has said he agonized over the decision, is calculating that Congress will not react with the outrage that greeted his overtures to China last year, officials said. **********The White House has spent weeks laying political groundwork for the decision, and officials said their soundings of Congress indicated opposition would not be strong, although George J. Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, condemned Mr. Bush's decision today as ''contrary to American interests and wrong.'' **********Emphasis on District Profits **********Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who led Congressional opposition to Mr. Bush's China policy last year, said today that a resolution opposing the extension of the trade benefits would be introduced. **********But other Democratic lawmakers and Congressional aides said they could not gather enough votes to block the move as long as Mr. Bush found a way to make it clear that the act did not represent approval of Beijing's policies and that Washington might reconsider the issue next year if the situation in China did not improve. **********Administration officials said Mr. Bush, whose decision was first reported in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, was prepared to offer such assurances when he sends his decision on trade with China to Congress. They said he would also point out that other sanctions against China, including suspension of World Bank loans and a ban on military sales, would remain in effect. **********Sanctions Seen as Ineffective **********Supported by intense lobbying from Hong Kong business interests and other groups promoting trade with China, the White House is also counting on its belief that any undecided lawmakers will be swayed by the profits that their home districts reap from $18 billion a year in trade with China. **********Under a Federal law known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, China and other countries with nonmarket economies cannot be granted most-favored-nation status, which gives them the lower tariff rates granted to most American trading partners, unless the White House certifies that they are permitting free emigration. **********That certification must be renewed each year and is due for China this year on June 3, the anniversary of the crackdown around Tiananmen Square. **********The Administration also made the decision with an eye to future debates over trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. By sticking to the letter of the Jackson-Vanik rules, which address only emigration, the Administration hopes to reduce the impact that other issues, like the conduct of political activity, will have on discussions of trade with Eastern Europe. **********Administration officials said that the White House and State Department were still completing formal documents on the trade issue for Mr. Bush to sign, but that the President had reached a decision to extend the trade benefits for another year. **********After meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House today, senior Republican lawmakers suggested that Mr. Bush was prepared to approve the extension and said he promised to send his ruling to Congress before it recesses on Friday for the Memorial Day holiday. **********Mr. Bush's decision follows an intense debate in the Administration over the political and diplomatic ramifications of extending the trade benefits. Some officials questioned whether the White House wanted to risk the harsh criticism that surfaced over Mr. Bush's decision to send two aides to Beijing on two secret missions last year. **********Other officials, especially career diplomats in the State Department who opposed the extension of the trade benefits, argued that canceling most-favored-nation status would send a clear signal of American disapproval of the Chinese human-rights record. **********To do otherwise, they said, would fly in the face of Mr. Bush's publicly expressed disappointment that his overtures to China have had little visible effect on Beijing's policies. **********In the end, officials said, Mr. Bush, a former envoy to Beijing who runs China policy personally from the Oval Office, followed his own inclination to keep diplomatic and economic channels open to Beijing. **********He also heeded arguments that canceling most-favored-nation status for China would cost $8 billion to $10 billion in the first year.

He noted that competitors like the mortgage unit of the General Motors Corporation often have lower costs. Chase would consider merging or creating joint ventures with such companies, he said. **********Analysts are confident that a large banking industry will remain in New York City, but the organizations and even the names of banks are in question. The answers depend on whether banks are allowed and have the inclination to merge with each other or industrial companies, to develop nationwide branches, or to expand into securities and insurance. **********New York City is likely to be headquarters for at least a few of the giant banks in the next generation, but many jobs will be elsewhere.

On that date, the Sandinista National Liberation Front is scheduled to hand power to Mrs. Chamorro's National Opposition Union. **********A Promise Stands **********In Honduras, contra spokesmen told reporters that the rebels would prefer to keep their army intact to insure that the Sandinista National Liberation Front abides by its promise to step down. But a contra military chief, Israel Galeano Cornejo, known as Commander Franklin, said in a statement that the guerrillas had formed a commission that was ready to discuss demobilization with Mrs. Chamorro or her delegates. **********Such a plan to disband was supported here today by former members of the contra directorate like Alfonso Robelo Callejas, who returned to take part in the electoral process.

''After the example that the people of Nicaragua gave during the elections, the contras are not a problem anymore. We have to integrate them into the country as soon as possible.'' **********Appeal on U.S. Aid **********Declaring the unilateral truce, Mr. Ortega said combat operations against the estimated 3,000 rebels still operating in Nicaragua would be ended at once.

Sandinista officials said that the Government was being represented by Humberto Ortega Saavedra, the Defense Minister who is the younger brother and principal adviser to President Ortega. **********The appointment of Mr. Lacayo, a trusted member of Mrs. Chamorro's inner circle whose business interests have involved extensive dealings with the Government, was expected by many diplomats to create a climate of confidence. **********But the choice was criticized by political leaders within her broad alliance, who said they were not consulted about the choice, and they expressed fear that Mr. Lacayo would accept terms on future relations with the Sandinista Front without first seeking a consensus among the 14-party leadership. **********'Does Whatever She Wants' **********''It's just another example of the way Dona Violeta deals with the coalition,'' an opposition party leader said. ''She just does whatever she wants.'' **********Mr. Ortega's appointment, by contrast, was widely seen as a reflection of Sandinista seriousness about the transition process, and the likely importance of military issues in the discussions that are pending. **********A member of the Sandinista Front's nine-member national directorate, Humberto Ortega Saavedra is regarded as the most important political strategist in the Sandinista leadership and its most powerful figure after his brother Daniel. **********In 1988, Humberto Ortega led the Sandinista delegation that negotiated a cease-fire with contra commanders. And he is believed to have had a principal role in the decision to end the 19-month-old truce early last November after the infiltration of thousands of rebel troops into Nicaragua during the election campaign. **********Fear of Violence **********Today's announcements about progress in the transition talks were tinged by apprehension about the violence that has continued in parts of the country since the announcement of Mrs. Chamorro's victory early Monday morning. **********In the northern towns of Esteli, Ocotal, Somoto and Pueblo Nuevo, large crowds of young Sandinista supporters, many among them armed with automatic weapons, have gathered each evening, often at Sandinista youth-organization headquarters, to hold rallies and march on the homes of coalition supporters to show their defiance of the electoral outcome. **********''I was watching TV with my children, and I am six months' pregnant,'' said an opposition supporter, Mailin Ortiz, whose house in Esteli was attacked on Tuesday night. **********''There were hundreds of Sandinistas out on the street, and they told us they would kill us.

The top painting, stretching for nearly 100 yards, is an effusion of acrylic spray, which its designer described as carrying only an implicit message, ''a little color is good for you.'' **********Beneath, in letters hard to read because of the burst of colors, a second frieze spells out a slogan that the leadership of Mr. Modrow and Gregor Gysi, the party chairman, have been conveying to the public since the discredited former leaders were ousted at the end of last year. The new slogan is, ''We are the new ones.'' **********Un-Communist Appearance **********Completing probably the most un-Communist appearance of any Eastern European party headquarters, large portraits of the two leaders, in modern technique and bright acrylic tints, are to flank the motto. By tonight, only Mr. Modrow's had taken its place. The West German artist, showing slight embarrassment, said his heart wasn't in the message. The job is a strictly commercial proposition for him. ''I can't identify with it,'' he said. **********A further block away, the vast, modern glass-and-concrete Palace of the Republic, which houses the Parliament, theaters, restaurants and large open spaces, has been converted into a flight of television studios from which most Western television companies will cover the tallying of the votes on Sunday. **********The palace, which under the old Government allowed journalists to enter only on rare occasions, appears to have been totally taken over, largely by West German networks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/01/business/french-bank-stock-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Bank Stock Inquiry", "print_headline": "French Bank Stock Inquiry", "body_text": " **********Jean-Charles Naouri, a senior adviser to the Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, from 1982 to 1986, was one of five people named on Wednesday in an investigation of a 1988 attempt to take control of the Societe Generale bank. **********Mr. Naouri is now chairman of an insurance company.

A barrel was at about $17 in early July. **********July producer prices were more restrained than economists had expected. Their forecasts had been for a rise of two-tenths of a percent, which would have matched June's rise. But prices at the producer level are expected to soar in August and September as the impact of higher energy costs hits. **********During the first seven months of the year, producer prices rose at a relatively modest annual rate of 3 percent, compared with a 4.8 percent rate of increase for all of 1989. **********Decline in 'Core Rate' **********Excluding the volatile food and energy components, producer prices still fell a tenth of a percent in July after a six-tenths rise in June. This is the ''core rate'' of inflation that is sometimes cited as a more reliable indicator of producer price trends. **********It was the first decline in a year for the core rate, but that was not seen positively by some economists. Richard Rahn, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said it was ''a clear sign of weakening demand'' for goods. That impression is bolstered by lower factory orders, declining consumer demand, higher unemployment and more unsold goods, he added. **********''The economy is virtually dead in its tracks,'' said Mr. Rahn, who expects a recession by the year's end. **********After the release of the report, Government bonds rose moderately, but they later fell, and the stock market was sharply lower as the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a drop of 42.33 points, to 2,716.58. Traders said the markets were more affected, however, by Mideast uncertainty than by the price report, which has largely been superseded by recent oil price rises. **********The price report showed that energy prices in July fell five-tenths of a percent after a nine-tenths drop in June. Gasoline prices were down 5.3 percent after a slight four-tenths rise in June. Crude petroleum prices fell 4 percent last month after an 11.9 percent June drop. **********Crude oil prices were 23 percent lower in July than they were a year earlier, while gasoline prices at the producer level were 1.3 percent lower. Wholesalers pushed gasoline prices up strongly in the days after Iraq's invasion, and prices at the pump have risen more than 15 cents a gallon on average. **********Consumer food prices were unchanged in July, after a drop of four-tenths of a percent in June. Tobacco and automobile prices fell, but prescription drugs cost more. **********Speculation has grown that the Federal Reserve Board might be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, although a Fed governor, John P. LaWare, said on Thursday that it was too early to say how hard the economy would be hit by the higher energy costs. **********Mitsubishi Bank economists estimate that each $1 rise in crude oil prices translates into a 4 percent increase in wholesale gasoline prices and a 2 percent rise in prices consumers pay at the pump. That, in turn, increases producer prices aboout two-tenths of a percent a month. **********The various changes in producer prices put the July index for all finished goods, not seasonally adjusted, at 118, which means that a hypothetical selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $118 last month, up from $114.10 a year earlier. **********In two companion reports covering earlier production stages, prices for intermediate goods were unchanged, while prices for crude goods rose six-tenths of a percent.

Others were numb, unable to absorb one more remarkable blow to Communism. Many were wary, waiting to see if Mikhail S. Gorbachev could ''stay one step ahead of the sheriff,'' as the conservative columnist Robert Novak put it. **********There was skepticism from the right, money-making schemes from the Fortune 500 crowd, and a reluctant and cautious response from the President, who always frets that any appearance of gloating on the part of America will tip the precarious balance in the Soviet Union away from Mr. Gorbachev. **********The political experts in Washington had felt it was inevitable that the power of the Soviet Communist Party would diminish ever since the Soviets did not roll into Eastern Europe with tanks to stop the rush of democracy this fall and winter. They were just watching to see, as the Democratic analyst Robert G. Beckel put it, ''if Gorbachev could pull off a six-cushion pool shot and survive.'' **********So today the reaction was mostly muted wonder at the events in Moscow, while everyone still kept watching to see what the Soviet leader's next shot would be. **********Just a Bystander **********''We may have exhausted our capacity for surprise and delight when we watched children in Tiananmen Square quoting Jefferson and children in East Germany taking pickaxes to the Berlin Wall as East German guards smiled for the camera,'' said Peggy Noonan, the speechwriter for Ronald Reagan who wrote many of the former President's most biting Evil Empire denunciations. **********The day symbolized, for many people in this self-absorbed capital, the sense that Washington is more and more a bystander to world events rather than a player. **********''We're not part of history in Washington,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat. ''We're just watching history.'' Mr. Novak noted that the events in the Soviet Union come ''at a critically dull time in Washington.'' **********''There's a great feeling of passivity associated with this President and the last year,'' he marveled. ''I've been in Washington 33 years and I've never seen a time where all the fascination was focused on something 8,000 miles away.'' **********'Perhaps It's Salutory' **********Ms. Noonan suggested that this might be a healthy turn of events. ''The imperial city of Washington has been taken aback by history because it thinks that it must help the world turn on its axis,'' she said. ''Perhaps it's salutory to know that the world can change without our permission or encouragement.'' **********A top Soviet analyst in the Government, who not long ago was predicting Mr. Gorbachev's removal and a police-state crackdown, echoed the sense that the world seemed to be spinning out of America's control. **********''The whole Soviet world is going down the drainpipe with astonishing speed,'' he said. ''There's very little we can do to affect it. The future will be determined largely by internal, domestic considerations. ''It's mind boggling.'' In political circles, where strategists are accustomed to promoting the notion of good versus evil, the news was discombobulating. The Soviets, the terrifying presence in all those James Bond films and Ronald Reagan speeches, seemed to be trying to kick the traces of their Evil Empire image. **********''It's disorientating,'' Ms. Noonan said, ''because it's hard to know who to assign the evil role to.'' **********In Washington, where everything is cast in terms of winning and losing, the debate was raging today over which party could get bragging rights to the end of the cold war. **********''We can't revel in the glory of what's going on,'' said John Buckley, a Republican consultant, ''because we're too busy trying to claim credit.'' **********The Democrats tried to take credit, pointing to the assessment of Strobe Talbot, a Time editor, that the crumbling of Communism proved that ''the doves in the Great Debate of the past 10 years were right all along.'' **********Weinberger 'Gratified' **********But Caspar W. Weinberger, the former Reagan Defense Secretary who pushed to build up American military forces to counteract the Soviet threat, said he felt personally gratified and was astonished that anyone would have the chance to say such things in Moscow ''without being shot.'' **********He cautioned against declaring democracy the champion this early, arguing that ''it's perfectly possible and within the capability of the Soviets militarily and morally to stop all this.'' **********President Bush took the low-key approach today. Originally, his advisers were going to insert a reaction to the Kremlin events in one of his California speeches promoting the ''Star Wars'' missile defense system and a strong defense. But that idea was canceled when the President decided he did not want to look like he was gloating. In a question and answer session after his speech at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, Mr Bush said he could best help the beleaguered Soviet leader by avoiding ''doing dumb things - and that's my cautious approach.'' **********The President reiterated his support for perestroika and praised Mr. Gorbachev for his ''restraint and finesse,'' adding that ''he's a man who you can talk to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/24/world/nato-struggling-to-redefine-itself.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1990-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 915, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATO STRUGGLING TO REDEFINE ITSELF", "print_headline": "NATO STRUGGLING TO REDEFINE ITSELF", "body_text": " **********Having concentrated entirely on deterring Soviet aggression over the past 40 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is now struggling to find a new role for itself after the collapse of Communism and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. **********For the moment, the 16-nation alliance seems caught in an identity crisis. The disintegration of the Warsaw Pact alliance has undermined NATO's very reason for existence. And in the Persian Gulf crisis, it has been largely a bystander because its charter forbids it from operating outside Europe and North America. **********''It will survive in the foreseeable future, but I can only see two years ahead,'' the director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, Sir James Eberle, said. ''The role of NATO will have to change, and unless it makes itself useful, it will wither and die.'' **********The public message from NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, is more upbeat. ''The cohesion of the alliance is the most important vehicle for change on the globe,'' he said this week at a conference on NATO's future here. ''It is a decisive factor of stability that will influence the future development of Europe.'' **********Ideas but No Consensus **********But inside NATO's sprawling headquarters, where officials are brainstorming to develop new military and political strategies, there is less confidence that the alliance can keep up with the changes sweeping Europe. **********''There are lots of ideas,'' one NATO official said, ''but there is no consensus about what it should do.'' **********With the shape of a post-cold-war Europe unsettled, the gulf crisis is raising new questions, including whether NATO should revise its charter so that it can deal with ''out of area'' regional conflicts. Officials also are wondering whether the 12-nation European Community will decide to build a defense mechanism of its own that might eventually compete with NATO. **********Criticized for their delay in sending military forces to the gulf, nine Governments in the European Community have revived a long moribund regional defense body called the Western European Union, which is now coordinating their naval activities. Italy has even proposed that the community formally absorb the Western European Union as a way of developing a regional defense policy. **********While seeking to maintain its long-dominant position in Europe, NATO is also facing other challenges. The Soviet Union and France, for example, believe that the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe should become the new umbrella organization for the region. Having acted quickly to pressure Iraq in the gulf crisis, even the United Nations is now viewed as a potential crisis manager in Europe and beyond. **********''We should not attend too closely to defining boundaries and functions among these institutions, which in these new times are in many ways untested,'' William H. Taft 4th, the chief American delegate at NATO, argued. ''Instead, we seek a rich, loosely connected connected, dynamic relationship,'' or ''a system that can absorb shocks.'' **********The United States, Britain and West Germany would like NATO to broaden its focus to include political and economic matters, but its efforts may well be duplicated by other European organizations. **********''Overlap can be handled through coordination,'' said Mr. Worner, an advocate of expanding NATO's role. **********Much of the disarray results from the sheer pace of events over the past 10 months. When the Berlin wall crumbled, NATO began talking about a new political role and reached out to the Warsaw Pact by inviting former Soviet-bloc Governments to name ambassadors to the alliance. **********As the Soviet threat diminished, NATO began preparing for the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers by revising its military strategy. Instead of relying on ''forward defense,'' it has moved toward ''flexible response'' involving smaller forces and fewer exercises. **********Gives Blessing to Conference **********At a summit meeting of leaders of NATO countries in London in July, the alliance gave its blessing to developing the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe as a forum ''for wider political dialogue in a more united Europe.'' It suggested that the conference establish a secretariat, a parliamentary assembly and mechanisms for preventing conflicts and monitoring elections. **********NATO's own role remains the topic of intense debate, with the United States seemingly anxious to prevent the strengthening of the European Community and the security conference from weakening the alliance. **********''Many people in Washington see NATO as essential to maintaining American clout in Europe,'' a former American diplomat said. ''But any attempt to preserve NATO on an artificial life system as an instrument for American influence will backfire.'' **********Despite the calls for NATO to break out of its military straitjacket and redefine its interests to include not only economic and political but environmental and ethnic problems, many European Governments doubt that it is equipped to deal with such issues. **********One problem is that NATO has shown no interest so far in opening its membership to the new democracies of Eastern Europe.

The bond market rallied in response. **********About half the October increase in prices reflected petroleum costs, which have flattened lately. **********The overall price rise, six-tenths of 1 percent, although large by most standards, was a bit better than had been expected and represented improvement from the increases of eight-tenths of 1 percent posted by the Consumer Price Index in both August and September. Prospect of Lower Rates **********Apparently convinced that the risks of serious economic deterioration now outweigh those of inflation, the Federal Reserve moved today to cut an important short-term interest rate by one-quarter point, to 7 1/2 percent. This could lead to eventual cuts in what banks charge for loans to invididuals and businesses, thereby spurring economic activity. **********The impact was felt immediately in the credit markets, as prices of long-term Treasury bonds moved higher and their yields fell. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 8.44 percent, from 8.52 percent the day before and 8.61 percent a week ago.

Jackman, chief of the Labor Department's consumer prices branch. He said today that current indications were that oil would exert little, if any, inflationary pressure in the November report. That would be a contrast to the three most recent months, when oil caused the inflation rate roughly to double. **********During the first 10 months of the year, the index covering all urban consumers has climbed at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, compared with a 4.7 percent pace during the comparable 1989 period. The difference is mainly attributable to oil-price increases that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August. **********The main impact has been in the transportation sector, where prices rose 2.1 percent last month, with 80 percent of the increase in motor fuels. Gasoline jumped 7.7 percent, compared with 9.5 percent in September and 7.6 percent in August. **********Prices of new cars rose five-tenths of 1 percent in October, only the second rise in nine months, but used cars continued to fall and now cost 1.4 percent less than they did in December 1989. A 2.7 percent jump in airline fares was mainly responsible for a 1.8 percent rise in the cost of public transportation. **********Housing, the most heavily weighted component, rose three-tenths of 1 percent as fuel oil was up sharply and local telephone service climbed. The cost of cable television fell for the second straight month but was still 12.1 percent higher than in October 1989.  Variations in Food **********Food in general rose the same three-tenths of 1 percent as in September, but dairy products and meats, fish and eggs advanced more sharply. **********Apparel prices fell two-tenths of 1 percent, a surprise result that was partly attributed to premature discounting in a sagging economy. **********Medical care, paced this time by a 1.3 percent advance in hospital costs, rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, bringing medical inflation for the latest 12 months to 9.4 percent. **********In a companion report today, the Labor Department said the real average weekly earnings of American workers fell 2.1 percent last month, the biggest decline since 1979. **********This figure was derived from a 1.4 percent decline in average hours worked and a seven-tenths of 1 percent rise in the price index that covers urban wage earners and clerical workers. **********Other data showed that commodities, about 45 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose 1 percent last month, mainly because of energy. Services, representing 55 percent of the index, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, down from four-tenths in September and seven-tenths in August. **********Before rounding, the index rose 0.60377, a rate that if maintained for 12 months and compounded would produce annual inflation of 7.5 percent.

That move seems bound to further isolate North Korea and its enigmatic leader, Kim Il Sung, high-ranking aides to Mr. Roh said today. **********But the initiative also places tremendous pressure on Japan, the region's economic giant, to abandon its continuing unwillingness to join the flow of newly warmed relations with the Soviets. Already Japanese business executives and politicians are speaking openly of their fear that the United States and South Korea will develop a tremendous head start in penetrating the Soviet market, and that Japan will lose a chance to become integrated into one of the world's largest economies. **********Two South Korean newspapers reported tonight that South Korea is considering a $4 billion low-interest loan to the Soviet Union and the establishment of direct telecommunications lines.

In restoring that relationship, Mr. Roh hopes to restore the prestige of his presidency, battered in recent months by a spring of violent strikes and a damaging economic slowdown. **********But it also vindicates a controversial policy, one that many of Mr. Roh's army colleagues viewed with suspicion. **********''We knew that we would have to pressure North Korea from three directions,'' said Lee Hong Koo, Mr. Roh's special assistant for political affairs and, until two months ago, the country's Minister for National Unification. ''The first was from our own talks with the North. The second is from the United States and other Western nations. But the third was to build pressure from North Korea's nominal allies. Now the United States, the Soviet Union and South Korea are joining forces to persuade the North to engaged in a new kind of constructive relationship.'' **********Relations May Sour **********Over the next few months, however, both sides seem to be bracing for that relationship to sour, perhaps dramatically.

Scrambling to retain customer loyalty in the highly competitive retail pharmacy business, many drugstores specialize in advice and services. Eighty-five percent have also purchased computer systems that cost $10,000 and up, and some even have satellite links to keep supplies and insurers' payments flowing. **********The McKesson Corporation's PCS pharmacy card unit, for example, operates a national electronic claims-processing network. An identification card with a magnetic stripe is passed like a credit card through a $200 device, which quickly tells the druggist what the customer's health plan pays for. The bill goes electronically to a data processing center in Scottsdale, Ariz., which pays the pharmacies every two weeks. **********Prompt payment is vital to the nation's 55,000 pharmacies, for their pretax profit margins have fallen to 3 percent from 5.5 percent in the 1960's.

And in the front of their stores, the druggists compete with the health and beauty aids sections of groceries, convenience stores, variety stores and specialty discount stores. **********But the pharmacy business can also be difficult for such competitors. Joseph Thomas 3d, an economist at Purdue University, said the expenses in operating a pharmacy \"are very different from operating a grocery.\" He added, \"You need pharmacists, people with knowledge and time, willing to answer questions about over-the-counter products.\" A sign in the West Main Pharmacy, an independent store in Penns Grove, N.J., says, \"Please ask our pharmacists questions before you purchase over-the-counter drugs.\" **********\"We foresee gross margins in the pharmacy business continuing to drop,\" said David D. Bernauer, vice president and treasurer of the Walgreen Company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill. \"The bottom line to the whole thing is: Who can most efficiently distribute that prescription to the customer?\" Walgreen stores, which deal with 800 insurance plans, are linked by satellite to a computer center in Mount Prospect, Ill. \"In five seconds, we check the patient's eligibility and other parameters like which drugs are covered, the number of days' supply, whether generics are mandatory,\" he said. \"The system greatly reduces the percentage of rejects and dishonored claims and the cost of shipping paperwork.\" Sales at Walgreen's 1,575 stores are growing by 20 percent annually, reflecting rising drug prices and the addition of 110 stores this year, Mr. Bernauer said. **********To compete with the chains, independents like the West Main Pharmacy work on customer service. \"We can't always match the dollar figure,\" said Louis A. Mitchell, the owner, who is in the store daily from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. \"My main concern is that the patient has to be satisfied that what they are doing is based on good sound advice.\" **********Don Moore, an independent pharmacist who is president of the Moore Drugstore in Kokomo, Ind., maintains a staff nurse for consultations. **********\"All retail drugstores, whether they are independent or chains, are being squeezed much more today,\" said David Malmberg, vice president for strategic planning with McKesson's wholesale unit, the nation's largest drug wholesaler. **********Insurers that pay most of the cost of drugs directly to the store may account for 75 percent of the prescription business by the end of the decade, said Robert J. Mandelbaum, a pharmacist who is a vice president of the 1,136-store Revco chain, based in Twinsburg, Ohio.

Moscow has told its former satellites that it wants to be paid for oil and gas in hard currency, rather than bartered goods, turning what had been an energy subsidy into a burden. Then last month, the Soviets unleashed their ''oil weapon'' in response to independence moves in the republic of Lithuania. **********A Reminder of Dependence **********The Russian strategy in Lithuania - sending out valve turners rather than tanks - has reminded the countries of Eastern Europe that they are also very dependent on the Soviet Union, which supplies 80 percent of the region's energy imports. Even though the dependence is to some degree mutual, since the Soviets need a market for their exports, Moscow already sells large amounts of oil and gas to the West for hard currency and could sell much more, experts say. **********Moscow's tough new approach to energy exports to Eastern Europe could also seriously hamper the region's efforts to clean up pollution. Since the Eastern European nations are short of hard currency, the new Soviet requirement that oil be paid for with cash may give the countries of the region no choice but to become even more dependent on brown coal, their main domestic fuel. **********Higher Fuel Prices **********Eastern Europe is at the end of a vast umbilical cord reaching from western Siberia and the Ural Mountains, feeding oil and gas, and sometimes electricity, to Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. **********Even the uranium for nuclear reactors in Eastern Europe comes from the Soviet Union. Moreover, officials in Eastern Europe say Moscow has told them it plans to raise fuel prices sharply in January and charge a portion of the cost in hard currencies, like United States dollars or West German marks, which can be readily exchanged on international markets. **********Soviet cutbacks in oil deliveries may drain Eastern Europe of its reserves of hard currencies by forcing the nations to buy OPEC oil on the open market, as some have already done. In addition, it may deprive them of an indirect source of hard-currency revenue; Christina House, an independent oil consultant, says some Eastern European countries have resold Soviet oil at market prices to Western countries, a practice that has annoyed Moscow. **********The energy changes in the East are important to the West, because for years the availability of oil - and hence its price - has been heavily affected by huge Soviet exports. The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, although its production is sharply dropping, partly because of continuing unrest in Baku, a petroleum center. Ms. House said that if the trend set in the first quarter of this year continues, the decline by the end of the year will be 500,000 barrels a day, to less than 12 million barrels a day. **********Suddenly, the new economic ministers of Eastern Europe are confronting a host of problems their Communist predecessors never had to face. They have to grapple not only with the uncertainties of dealing in the world energy market, but also with possibly seeking new buyers for a wide range of goods that had long been swapped with the Soviet Union for oil. **********''We knew this was coming, but we needed more time,'' a Czech official said, noting that much industry in Czechoslovakia and other nations was geared to supplying the Soviet Union goods in exchange for oil, rather than selling products on the world market. These outdated industries were also geared to using inordinately large quantities of cheap oil. **********''We are in the middle of very complicated negotiations with Moscow,'' said Laszlo Lang, deputy director of the Hungarian Institute for International Relations. But, he said, Hungary's dependence on the Soviet market for industrial exports was perhaps an even greater problem than the country's dependence on Soviet energy. **********In fact, the region's total energy needs are not large by the standards of Western industrial countries. Individually, the Eastern European countries are energy midgets, experts say, so even large-percentage changes in production and consumption will have a small global effect. Combined, the former satellites use only about as much oil and gas as does West Germany, and about one-seventh as much as the United States. Total energy consumption from all sources is about one-fourth that of the United States. **********Consumption Likely to Jump **********Clearly, the countries in revolution have grand energy plans. From Albania, which bans private ownership of cars, and Romania, where the deposed Ceausescu regime sharply reduced energy use to cut imports and raise exports, paying off foreign debt, Eastern Europeans aspire to use more. **********The region's dominant fuel, coal, is burned with virtually no environmental-control equipment, and sulfur and ash emissions are so high, especially in winter, that they cause widespread smog and chronic respiratory diseases. Soot and sulfur have already blackened cities and killed forests. **********Yet even environmentally conscious leaders, including President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, contend that for now coal remains indispensable not only as the cheapest form of heat and electricity, but also as a source of tens of thousands of jobs. **********Distrust of Nuclear Power **********Nuclear power once looked like a clean substitute, but it has been bitterly opposed since the Chernobyl accident in 1986. **********''Nuclear plants everywhere have become associated with centralized, secretive and even repressive power, and this feeling is very strong in Eastern Europe,'' said a Western expert who recently finished an energy fact-finding mission in the region's capitals. ''No politician here is willing to push hard for nuclear energy, even Western nuclear energy,'' the expert said. **********East Germany, in fact, has been pressed by Bonn into shutting down two nuclear reactors for safety repairs, and more may be closed when the West German inspection is completed. **********In a study presented last month at a seminar on Eastern Europe organized by the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development, at the University of Colorado, John Etling Treat, a vice president of Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., found that the energy supplied to the region by the Soviet Union accounts for 25 percent of its consumption. **********Possible Energy Sources **********The new governments of Eastern Europe would nonetheless like to move away from dependence on the Soviets. **********Poland is discussing with Algeria a proposal to import liquefied natural gas through the Baltic Sea. Afsaneh Mashayekhi, chief of Natural Gas Development at the World Bank, said the Poles would like to build the tankers for the Algerians in Gdansk. **********The Poles are also discussing the purchase of natural gas from Norway, which would require extending a pipeline from Denmark. **********Currently, Mr. Treat said, Poland imports all of its oil and half of its gas, and has pipeline links only to the east. Czechoslovakia has the same problem, he noted, and is also landlocked. **********Hungary, another landlocked country, has already begun to turn around the situation, quite literally. In January it reversed the flow in a pipeline that used to carry petroleum to tankers at Rijeka, Yugoslavia, on the Adriatic Sea. Now it carries products in the other direction. **********Hungary, which gets 28 percent of its electricity from the Soviet Union, is discussing linking its electric grid with France's. ''The Russian grid is not very stable,'' said one official in Hungary, ''and they can drain electricity off our net. We need a safeguard and linkup with the West.'' **********Western companies are lining up to sell generating equipment to the East, but this, too, will require capital. At present, the electrical grids of Eastern and Western Europe do not mesh because of technical differences, making power transfers cumbersome. **********Conservation and Efficiency **********Still, Eastern Europe's best chance of reducing energy dependence on the Soviet Union in the near future may be greater conservation and more efficient use of fuel. There is considerable room for improvement: Jochem H. Mohnfeld, head of the oil industry division of the Federal Economics Ministry in Bonn, says West Germany uses precisely half as much energy as East Germany for each $1,000 worth of goods and services produced. **********Mr. Treat's study showed that Romania uses more than one-third more energy per unit of production than does the United States, and more than double what Japan uses. Travelers to the region report that homes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union lack basic energy-saving devices like thermostats. **********But improving efficiency would not stop growth. West Germany uses 2.5 times more energy per capita than East Germany. Yet as the two Germanys are unified, the expected increase in East German economic activity and living standards is expected to raise energy consumption. And more advanced economies burn a higher proportion of oil and less coal. For example, West Germany's energy consumption is 42 percent oil, compared with 13 percent in East Germany. **********But another energy option is coming into focus: local production. Thomas O'Connor, senior petroleum engineer for the World Bank, said, ''The technology they've got access to is state-of-the-art for the 1950's, and they can't find all the subtle stuff.'' But with computers and seismic techniques, he said, several Eastern European nations could find enough small deposits of oil and gas to make a big difference in their level of self-sufficiency. **********Yet shopping abroad for that technology is difficult for the nations of Eastern Europe, and not just because they lack hard currency. For example, Ms. Mashayekhi said Poland was finding that after a half-century of energy policy made in Moscow, it had no legal framework for Western-style oil and gas exploration and production. There is no one, she said, who is familiar with negotiating energy deals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/16/business/australian-airbus-order.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Australian Airbus Order", "print_headline": "Australian Airbus Order", "body_text": " **********Ansett Airlines has ordered 10 Airbus Industrie A321 aircraft for delivery between 1995 and 1999, the General Electric Company said Wednesday.

Mr. Wimer's behavior helps to explain why single-family home construction across the nation plunged from January through May to an annual rate of only 900,000 building starts, down from one million in 1989. Not since the recessionary early 1980's has home building been so weak. **********Still, Mr. Wimer is luckier than many other builders. The nationwide surge in defaults on real estate loans has made lenders extra wary about financing anyone who is not a good credit risk. With 42 years as contractor, Mr. Wimer's two long-time lenders, the Landmark Savings and Loan Association and the Pittsburgh National Bank, continue to give him loans. But they charge him more. **********''We used to get construction loans without upfront fees, but now we have to pay 1.5 percentage points,'' he said. In addition, the interest rate that Mr. Wimer pays on loans has risen to an annual rate that is two percentage points above the prime rate, or a total of 13 percent. Until this year, Mr. Wimer paid only 1.5 percentage points over prime. **********The hard times did not pop up overnight. The construction of offices and other commercial buildings began to decline in 1988, and soon afterward apartment construction also shrank sharply. Both were victims of overbuilding in the 1980's and a backlog of unsold units. But the building of single-family homes remained robust, and this category is the industry's largest, representing 30 percent of all construction. **********Then last fall, single-family home construction began to collapse, with building starts declining by 10 percent since October. The Northeast and the South accounted for most of the fall. ''The only thing that had held the construction game together was single-family housing and now it, too, is in the junk pile,'' said George A. Christie, chief economist for the F. W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Inc., which collects industry data. **********Many explanations are offered for the hard times. The post ''baby boom'' generation is providing fewer home buyers. The sluggish economy has made people concerned about job security and therefore reluctant to go into debt for new homes. And the savings and loan crisis has been hugely destructive, on two counts. **********The main one is that savings institutions are a principal supplier of construction loans. Not only have 1,000 of these lenders failed and disappeared, but a law enacted by Congress in August greatly restricted the amount that a savings and loan can lend to a single developer. **********The builders could turn to other lenders, like insurance companies and pension funds. But Francis H. Schott, chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, notes that insurance companies seek longer lending periods than those provided by construction and mortgage financing. And pension funds often restrict construction and home loans to 5 percent of their portfolios. **********Aside from the credit crunch, the Federal Government is trying to sell tens of thousands of homes and other buildings, an effort that depresses already-weak real estate prices and helps to kill the demand for new construction. The Government acquired the property from failed savings and loan companies that had originally seized the buildings from borrowers who had defaulted. **********Inevitably, the construction industry's troubles will show up as weakness in the gross national product. The G.N.P. measures the national wealth that is created through the production of goods and services. The construction industry, with five million workers, accounts for 7.5 percent of this wealth creation, and as current construction is completed - without new building to replace it - construction's contribution to G.N.P. will shrink. **********Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, estimates that the construction slump will result in a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in the G.N.P. in the second half of the year, a not inconsiderable hit at a time when the G.N.P. is growing at an annual rate of less than 2 percent. **********Could the construction slump tilt the economy into recession? Most economists do not think so. But given the credit problems and the big supply of unsold homes (an eight-month backlog, according to a Goldman Sachs estimate), the construction industry is likely to remain a weak sister for months to come."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/business/a-corporate-doctor-is-getting-fewer-calls.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Cowan", "pub_date": "1990-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1582, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Corporate Doctor Is Getting Fewer Calls", "print_headline": "A Corporate Doctor Is Getting Fewer Calls", "body_text": " **********There was a time when Victor H. Palmieri was flying so high he would have balked if clients tried to call the shots. Now, he'd be grateful if they would simply call. **********At a time when businesses are failing by the dozens and the savings and loan industry is in desperate shape, the phones at the Palmieri Company, a 45-person turnaround boutique , should be buzzing. Mr. Palmieri, after all, is among America's best-known workout experts, having handled two of the six largest non-bank bankruptcies of record. **********He vaulted to prominence in the 1970's after nursing the non-railroad assets of the Penn Central Transportation Company back to health and led a daunting reorganization a decade later of the Baldwin-United Corporation. **********But his colleagues in the workout patch, who salvage financially troubled companies, say that Mr. Palmieri has been conspicuously absent from the scene. ''I haven't seen him on any major transactions recently and he should be,'' said Stan Ross, the managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm with expertise in real estate workouts. **********Mr. Palmieri says that he is simply between deals. ''This is a time in between big workouts,'' he said. ''It's not the most exciting time as far as I'm concerned.'' **********In a business where lenders and creditors can ill afford to bring in a savior with a mediocre record and where new stars are always rising, one bad deal can wipe out years of accomplishments. His workout colleagues say that Mr. Palmieri's undoing, was Crazy Eddie, a home electronics retailer that an investor group led by Mr. Palmieri won control of in late 1987. **********Within two years, the company had been liquidated, and the group's entire $13.5 million investment had been lost. Though Mr. Palmieri has sued the former management for looting the company of $65 million in inventory, the debacle has tarnished his reputation and caused his peers to re-evaluate some of his earlier triumphs. **********He is hardly the first company doctor to lose a patient. Sanford C. Sigoloff, his biggest competitor, stumbled in trying to rebuild the Wickes Companies, a retailer, while Q. T. Wiles, a fixer of high-tech companies, badly botched an attempted rescue of Miniscribe, a disk-drive maker. **********Mr. Sigoloff has been given a second chance with the United States department store operations of the Hooker Corporation, which until recently owned Bonwit Teller. But Mr. Wiles has gone into virtual seclusion. **********At age 60, Mr. Palmieri is eager to suit up again. Though Mr. Palmieri was mentioned recently as someone who might help untangle the affairs of Donald J. Trump, the New York developer who narrowly averted bankruptcy last month, advisers to Mr. Trump said that Mr. Palmieri was never in the running. **********Mr. Palmieri insists that Mr. Trump's lenders sought to involve him, but that the developer would not allow it because of past differences over the Penn Central deal. **********Clients Are Smaller **********In the meantime, the Palmieri Company, which has five offices besides its New York headquarters, has been accepting smaller clients. It advises Parelle Sportive, a Los Angeles maker of women's golf attire. Until last month, Mr. Palmieri was also the chief executive of the Chronar Corporation, a maker of solar energy panels whose stock fell to about 63 cents, from $6.25, in the 10 months that he served. **********But he resigned because Chronar's technology was not ready for mass-marketing and the company could no longer afford his $600,000 annual fee. ''I told the board I'm charging you half what I usually charge and twice what you can afford,'' he said. **********Mr. Palmieri's route to the workout business was circuitous. After completing Stanford University law school with top academic honors, Mr. Palmieri, the son of an Italian engineer who emigrated to this country in the 1920's, worked for five years in the Los Angeles office of O'Melveny & Myers. He brought in one of the law firm's largest clients by showing the same unabashed opportunism that would prove handy later in his career. When Mr. Palmieri learned that Edwin Janss Jr., a Los Angeles real estate investor whom he met at a party, had a tax problem, he quietly called his uncle, a real estate tax lawyer, for ideas. Mr. Palmieri wrote Mr. Janss what he calls ''a brilliant memo'' adding, ''I never told anyone who my collaborator was.'' **********In 1959, he joined the Janss Investment Corporation. He and his former client developed ski resorts in Colorado and Idaho as well as land in Southern California. It was at Janss where Mr. Palmieri made enough money to be able to quit and go into government. **********He served on the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission, , in 1967 with John V. Lindsay, but became disappointed when President Johnson ignored the group's findings, refusing to help fuel Mr. Lindsay's Presidential aspirations. **********Mr. Palmieri whisked his family abroad for a year of travel to sort out his options. On return in 1969, he cofounded the American Learning Corporation Inc., a company that aspired to teach Americans how to read. He created the Palmieri Company, the consulting boutique where he is still the chairman and sole owner, as a way to pay the bills until the Learning Corporation took off. **********As it turned out, Mr. Palmieri sold the reading centers to Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. in 1985. It was consulting that actually put his name on the map. **********Call That Changed His Life **********The phone call that changed his life came in 1970. The investment bankers advising the bankrupt Penn Central suggested he step in and run the Great Southwest Corporation, the real estate investment arm of the Pennsylvania Company, a Penn Central subsidiary. **********His mop-up at Great Southwestern was so impressive that the Penn Central board gave him the Pennsylvania Company to run and had him oversee the divestiture of Penn Central's non-rail holdings. Mr. Palmieri and his associates, who reportedly collected $55 million in monthly fees and performance bonuses from the job, won high praise for their work. But some bankers now say that it was real estate appreciation and tax-loss carry-forwards that carried the day. **********Mr. Palmieri lived for the big deals and his next one came in 1983, when he was hired to keep Baldwin-United, a piano maker that had plunged pell-mell into insurance and financial services, out of bankruptcy. Mr. Palmieri thought he could devise a restructuring that would preserve the company's core assets. **********But three months later, the $9 billion juggernaut became the largest non-bank bankruptcy ever, a title that it lost to Texaco Inc. in 1987. A much smaller Baldwin-United, stripped of its core assets, crawled out of bankruptcy in 1986. Mr. Palmieri earned his monthly fees, but his stock options looked as if they would expire worthless and he traded them in for a $5 million cash bonus. **********''People don't understand how complicated it was,'' Mr. Palmieri said, disputing the widespread assessment that his performance at Baldwin was only so-so. ''You were dealing with financial assets, and in Pennsy you were dealing with hard assets like real estate and amusement parks. So I think Baldwin was a good deal more of a miracle than Penn Central.'' **********Star Is Forgiven **********The market, however, seemed to forgive its star turnaround artist. Rather than coming in as a hired gun with little more than his fees and reputation at risk, Mr. Palmieri decided to alter his operating style, and raised $103 million in 1985 through Oppenheimer & Company, the Wall Street investment house, to invest in underperforming companies. **********In its four years of operation, the fund made three investments, including its ill-fated stake in Crazy Eddie . In late 1988, Mr. Palmieri disbanded the fund, citing a lack of investment opportunities. He returned $56 million of the seed capital that remained in the fund to his partners. **********Mr. Palmieri still contends that the workout fund was ahead of its time. But several investment bankers who recall bringing deals to the fund say that Mr. Palmieri was too picky. They also criticize him for amassing an unsolicited stake in Crazy Eddie instead of pursuing a deal in a company where he would have had an opportunity to review the books and conduct research before committing the fund's money. **********A Calm Period **********The last 10 months have been unusually calm for the Palmieri Company. Sporting a deep tan that has been burnished by twice-weekly tennis games, Mr. Palmieri explains that he wanted to put the Crazy Eddie episode behind him before taking another large case.''Now I'm in a position to take on a big project, and we're actively looking for one,'' he said. **********In the meantime, he spends his days sprucing up Sports Specialties, a maker of caps that the Oppenheimer fund bought for $19 million, and prospecting for work among the savings and loan rubble. **********Mr. Palmieri is also considering returning to teaching. ''I've been talking to a couple of institutions about doing another semester,'' he said. ''But it all depends on whether another big wounded corporate crisis comes along.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/10/business/to-start-with-zappa-zapped-as-trade-rep.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrence Joseph", "pub_date": "1990-06-10", "snippet": "LEAD: From the start, it sounded as surreal as a Kafka novel.

Zappa and his satiric, subversive recordings were a source of inspiration to Czechoslovakia's artistic and intellectual underground - which, from the Prague Spring of 1968 until the revolution last fall, had remained in a 60's time warp. **********In January Zappa was invited to a luncheon at Hradcany Castle with VaclavHavel, a playwright who counts the musician's 1967 ''Absolutely Free'' among his favorite rock albums. The 49-year-old Zappa, aside from his music, is a film maker, guest host on talk shows and outspoken opponent of the Parents' Music Resource Center, a group that advocates warning labels on rock-and-roll albums. He was in Eastern Europe to work on a Financial News Network documentary on Soviet-American business opportunities. **********The Havel-Zappa meeting included several of the president's economic ministers, who listened as the cult hero bubbled with suggestions about coal-burning technology and cellular telephone networks. That evening Minister of Culture Milan Lukes announced on television that Zappa would represent Czechoslovakia to the West on matters of trade, culture and tourism - an arrangement later confirmed in a letter to Zappa by Havel's vice-minister of finance. **********Off went Zappa, brimming with ideas and granting press interviews in which he spoke of possible deals with McDonnell-Douglas, a pet food manufacturer and an Australian tractor company. But within six weeks the Czech leadership reduced Zappa's role to an unofficial cultural emissary. **********Havel aides quietly concede they may have gotten carried away in the revolutionary zeal of the moment.

W. Clausen, former president of the World Bank and now chairman of BankAmerica, is ''like trying to extract a tooth slowly.'' **********Delegates to the conference, sponsored by the Stanford Research Institute, the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Deutsche Bank, got a dim view of the results of perestroika thus far. Vladimir A. Tikhonov, president of the U.S.S.R. Union of Cooperatives, said the Soviet economy was ''falling apart.'' **********When asked about charges of corruption at many cooperatives, which he described as the enterprises closest to the Western model, Mr. Tikhonov replied: ''When a society is sick, its institutions are sick. When a mother is sick, her child is likely to be sick.'' **********Further G.N.P. Drop Expected **********Anders Aslund, a Swedish economist who is director of the Stockholm Institute of Soviet and Eastern European economies, said that despite Soviet estimates of continued slow growth, the economy was in ''a very serious crisis.'' He estimated that real gross national product fell 4 to 5 percent in 1989 and would plummet 8 to 10 percent this year. **********There are severe technical problems in estimating real Soviet G.N.P., because of the suppression of inflation by controls, the paying of under-the-counter prices and bribes, and the disappearance of goods from state stores selling at official prices. Until recently, most American experts on Soviet data have not accepted declines in real output as steep as those offered by Professor Aslund. **********But Ed A. Hewett of the Brookings Institution, a leading American expert on Soviet data, said at the conference that the Soviet economy was ''deteriorating at an alarming pace.'' There is no sign of an improvement in the quality of goods and no gain in productivity; the money supply is out of control, and the Soviet credit rating is at its lowest ebb, he said. **********The ''reforms'' made thus far, he added, are ''half-hearted,'' and entrepreneurs have still not been given authority to run their enterprises efficiently. ''Prices remain fixed, and fixed wrong,'' he said. **********The Soviet economists here did not dispute such assessments.

Lautenberg of New Jersey and former Senators Edmund S. Muskie of Maine and Gary Hart of Colorado, both now practicing law. **********Mr. Clausen saw some positive factors in the Soviet situation, especially the increased stress placed by Mr. Gorbachev and his key supporters on the need for a ''market orientation'' and a ''pluralistic society,'' which, he said, held hope for the future. But he warned that these positive elements were in danger of being overwhelmed by some strongly negative forces. **********The G.N.P. ''has turned negative,'' he said, ''and will remain so for the next two years. Soviet policy with respect to attracting foreign investment, he said, was ''unsatisfactory to date,'' and policies to stimulate joint ventures were ''not yet in place.'' **********Mr. Clausen said the Soviets did not seem to realize that foreign investors had ''real alternatives'' to investing in the Soviet Union, and particularly in Eastern Europe. He told the conference that he had been visiting European countries and asking investors which countries hold the greatest promise for them. ''The Soviet Union does not get many votes,'' he said. **********He said it was of the greatest importance that the people trust their Government, and that ''one essential underlies all issues: transparency, gaining the support of the people.'' **********'Not Pessimistic' **********Insisting that he was ''not pessimistic about the future of the U.S.S.R.,'' Mr. Clausen urged the Soviet leaders to ''move faster,'' and to concern themselves more with the social welfare. ''There is no social infrastructure in place,'' he said, to protect those hurt by loss of jobs and loss of income that could be expected to result from a radical change toward a market economy. **********Fears of such disuption have been delaying the Soviet Government's movement toward a freer economy. Soviet economists have been talking in terms of making the changes in stages, starting with the reduction of the enormous budget deficit, which V. K. Senchagov, chairman of the state committee on prices, said amounts to 165 billion rubles. **********There were indications here from Soviet economists that Mr. Gorbachev had distanced himself from the gradualism in the plan for economic reform presented by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. They said that during the last few years Mr. Gorbachev had focused on political reforms and had left the economic task to Mr. Ryzhkov and others, but was now dissatisfied with the results. Indeed, there was talk here that Mr. Ryzhkov would be replaced. **********Abel Aganbegyan, a Soviet economist who is credited with being a leading pioneer of perestroika, said he welcomed the transition to an executive presidency, in which Mr. Gorbachev would have greater powers, ''especially if he will pay attention to the economy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/27/business/consumer-rates-fund-yields-are-mixed.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1990-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 364, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fund Yields Are Mixed", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Fund Yields Are Mixed", "body_text": " **********Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Market Fund Report were mixed for the fifth consecutive week ended yesterday, as tax-exempt funds rose and taxable funds held steady. **********Money fund managers said the year-end seasonal factors that normally affect short-term interest rates were dissipating, and that they expect the usual softening of short-term rates in January. **********Walter S.

Expects Profit Drop", "print_headline": "A.T.&T. Expects Profit Drop", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced yesterday that its second-quarter earnings were likely to be lower than last year's, and that the company might have difficulty meeting its own targets for earnings growth this year. **********A.T.&T. stock, which is more widely held than that of any other American company, dropped $2.125 a share, to close at $39.125, after trading as low as $37.625. Some 11.5 million shares changed hands in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, nearly six times the volume of the second most-active stock. **********The New York-based telecommunications giant said its earnings for the quarter that ends Saturday would be less than the $699 million, or 65 cents a share, it reported in last year's second quarter. **********The announcement yesterday was the first time since A.T.&T. divested itself of its local telephone operations in 1984 that the company had issued a statement about its earnings before the end of a quarter. Morris Tanenbaum, the chief financial officer and a vice chairman of A.T.&T., said the company felt obliged to make an announcement because its own profit forecasts were considerably lower than the estimates of Wall Street analysts. **********''We hope we don't have to do this again in the future,'' he said in a telephone interview. **********Sale of Equipment Lags **********A.T.&T. attributed the expected fall in second-quarter earnings to lagging sales of computer and telephone equipment and to the high cost of the company's entry into the credit card market. A sluggish economy and, to a lesser extent, conditions in the telephone equipment market were responsible for weak equipment sales, Mr. Tanenbaum said. **********Mr. Tanenbaum said A.T.&T.'s earnings this year should exceed last year's $2.7 billion, which came on sales of $36.1 billion. But problems in this quarter will make it difficult, he said, for A.T.&T. to meet its target this year of 10 to 12 percent annual earnings growth. **********''I don't think it's impossible, but it's going to be difficult. I wouldn't want anybody to count on it,'' Mr. Tanenbaum said. **********Analysts had expected an increase this quarter greater than the 65 cents a share A.T.&T. earned in the second quarter last year, but they quickly cut their earnings estimates after the announcement. Jack B. Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at Paine Webber, changed his recommendation on the stock from a ''buy'' to a ''hold'' and reduced his second-quarter profits estimate to 58 cents, from 72 cents; he also cut his estimate of 1990 profits to $2.65 a share, from $2.90. **********The company's troubles with equipment sales ''were even worse than I thought,'' Mr. Grubman said. A.T.&T.'s credit card introduction may cost as much as $200 million this year, he added, with most of the expense coming in the second quarter. **********Equipment sales accounted for two-fifths of A.T.&T.'s $36 billion revenue last year. Demand has been strong for consumer products, which include answering machines and telephone handsets, but has fallen for equipment typically sold to businesses and to local telephone companies, Mr. Tanenbaum said. A.T.&T. sells electronic switchboards and multiple-line telephones to businesses and sells telephone network switching and transmission equipment to telephone companies. **********Sales and profits from A.T.&T.'s long-distance services have not suffered in this quarter, said Richard A. Gray, a company spokesman. Prices rose yesterday for the stocks of A.T.&T.'s two biggest long-distance rivals, the MCI Communications Corporation and United Telecommunications, which owns 80 percent of US Sprint. **********Heavy Competition **********Demand has been weak and competition fierce for large, expensive telecommunications equipment, said Richard M. Wolf, a consultant in Ridgewood, N.J. The seven regional Bell operating companies created by the breakup of A.T.&T. in 1984 are cutting back, he said, after bolstering their investment programs during the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, when the economy did not slow as much as most had predicted. **********Foreign manufacturers are moving into the American equipment market and putting pressure on profit margins, said Frank J. Governali, a telecommunications analyst at First Boston. ''It's hard to find a shred of positive news in the industry,'' he said. **********According to the Gartner Group Inc., a large telecommunications consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., A.T.&T.'s share of the $27.5 billion telephone equipment industry has been slowly falling, to 40 percent in the first quarter of this year. **********Demand for the Universal credit card, which A.T.&T. introduced on March 26, has been twice as strong as expected but has resulted in high processing costs, the company said. A.T.&T. announced last week that customers had opened a million accounts for the card, which serves as both a telephone card and a credit card for general purchases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/business/business-people-new-assignments-at-general-dynamics.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-07-24", "snippet": "LEAD: A week after recording a heavy loss on its Navy fighter jet program, the General Dynamics Corporation said yesterday that it was dispatching the company's president to Texas to help resolve the problems in that program.", "word_count": 377, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;\n\nNew Assignments At General Dynamics", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;\n\nNew Assignments At General Dynamics", "body_text": " **********LEAD: A week after recording a heavy loss on its Navy fighter jet program, the General Dynamics Corporation said yesterday that it was dispatching the company's president to Texas to help resolve the problems in that program. **********A week after recording a heavy loss on its Navy fighter jet program, the General Dynamics Corporation said yesterday that it was dispatching the company's president to Texas to help resolve the problems in that program. **********General Dynamics, the big military contractor based in St. Louis, said Herbert F.

The developer said it was premature to make public statements about negotiations because no agreement had been signed with any large tenant. **********''We've been having discussions with a number of tenants, and we don't discuss specific tenants before there are agreements,'' he said. **********Real estate executives said that Sony, which is in the market for a large amount of office space in New York, was still actively talking to other possible owners and developers about leasing space for its numerous businesses in New York while its talks with Mr. Zuckerman progressed. Among the other parties Sony is negotiating with is the Kumagai Gumi Company, a large Tokyo building company whose subsidiary, KG Land New York, is developing a new office tower on Sixth Avenue. **********Mr. Zuckerman won approval from New York City more than a year ago to build a 59-story building on the Columbus Circle site, which is now occupied by the New York Coliseum and has been the center of much debate. He is expected to pay $337 million for the 4.5-acre plot. Much of the convention business formerly at the Coliseum has gone to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. **********The Coliseum site development has been the focus of a stormy civic controversy almost from its inception in the early 1980's. Mr. Zuckerman's first proposal for the development, two 68-story towers to be designed by Moshe Safdie, stirred such resistance that it became something of a cause celebre in New York. Opponents objected to the immense shadow the buildings would cast over Central Park and contended that it would increase congestion in the area. **********Some of those objections were dropped when Mr. Zuckerman agreed to scale down the project. **********Mr. Zuckerman said in the interview that the revised project would take several years before it could be completed. He added that even after he signed agreements with tenants allowing him to begin work on the existing building, the process of removing asbestos would take a substantial amount of time. **********''You have to take out the asbestos in the building before you demolish it,'' Mr. Zuckerman said. ''There is a chance that by next spring we might have a definitive timetable for going forward and could be removing the asbestos by then.'' **********In 1985, Boston Properties was selected to develop the site at the southwest corner of Central Park. Its proposal for a 2.7-million-square-foot complex of towers, one of them 925 feet tall, was approved by the Board of Estimate. But the Municipal Art Society and others, objecting to its size and bulk, defeated it in court."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/09/world/diplomats-see-barriers-to-a-trial-of-salvador-military.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1990-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Diplomats See Barriers to a Trial of Salvador Military", "print_headline": "Diplomats See Barriers to a Trial of Salvador Military", "body_text": " **********Despite President Alfredo Cristiani's announcement that an investigation has revealed Army involvement in the killing of eight people, including six outspoken Jesuit priests, there are major obstacles to a successful prosecution, diplomats and lawyers here said today. **********Officials close to the investigation said they expected completion of the first phase of the inquiry within a week, with several arrests. But the diplomats and lawyers noted that suspects in many other political killings have escaped prosecution. **********''A lot now depends on the judicial system and that's where, if past experience is a guide, problems arise,'' said Scott Greathead, a board member of Lawyers for Human Rights. He has participated in the case by representing Jesuits in the United States. **********Mr. Greathead and other critics of the Salvadoran Government said the announcement was nonetheless the first indication that Mr. Cristiani is seriously trying to bring the killers to justice. **********Rector Demands More Details **********The new rector of the Jose Simeon Canas University of Central America, where the Jesuits were killed, dismissed the announcement as insufficient and demanded that more details of the investigation be made public. **********''He only confirmed what we have said from the beginning,'' said the Rev. Francisco Estrada, who replaced one of the slain Jesuits at the university. ''We need something more complete.'' President Cristiani has been under extraordinarily tight security since a rebel offensive began last fall. He did not respond to requests to elaborate on his announcement that soldiers were responsible for the slaying of the six priests, their housekeeper and her daughter at the Jesuits' campus residence on Nov 16. **********''It has been determined there was involvement of some elements of the Armed Forces,'' the president said late Sunday in a nationally broadcast speech. He did not identify a specific military unit or the rank of any soldiers implicated in the killings. **********A Decade of Political Killings **********Military officials did not respond to messages left at their offices. But in interviews on Sunday night, the armed forces Chief of Staff, Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, said that 45 soldiers and two officers of the United States-trained Atlacatl battalion were being questioned in connection with the slayings. **********The six priests, among the most erudite and outspoken advocates of a negotiated end to the decade-old civil war, were killed by gunmen who apparently were able to move freely about the capital despite a curfew. **********Political killings have characterized El Salvador's civil war since 1980, when five leftist politicians were killed by the military, four American churchwomen were slain and Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of San Salvador was assassinated. Over the next few years, tens of thousands of Salvadorans were killed. Human rights groups say most of the slayings were the work of right-wing death squads with ties to the military. **********Charges That Failed to Stick **********Suspects were quickly identified in the killings of the politicians and church workers. Despite intense American pressure, however, it took more than three years to try and convict the five National Guardsmen accused of killing the American churchwomen. The other cases collapsed, even though senior Salvadoran and American officials said there was more than enough evidence to proceed with a trial. **********In another attack that attracted strong interest from the United States, the head of the country's land redistribution program and two American advisers were assassinated in a hotel coffee shop in San Salvador in 1981. Two enlisted men were imprisoned for carrying out the assassination. Although two army officers were accused of ordering the killings, they were not convicted. **********The Government's failure to successfully prosecute such cases has strengthened the cause of the leftist guerrillas. Many Salvadorans became convinced that their traditionally authoritarian society was unwilling to tolerate even nonviolent protest, and that justice could only be won by force. **********Many Salvadorans still doubt that the country's inefficient justice system is capable of prosecuting members of the army, which has long exercised a de facto veto over major Government decisions. **********No Officers Convicted **********Not a single military officer has been convicted of a politically motivated slaying since the beginning of the civil war, which so far has displaced one-tenth of the Salvadoran population and claimed more than 70,000 lives. **********President Cristiani is under immense pressure from Washington, which finances his all-but-bankrupt Government, to find and punish the Jesuits' killers. Many senior Congressional officials say that continuing support from the United States depends on the outcome of the case. **********Mr. Cristiani has offered a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killers. He has also appointed what he called a Special Commission of Honor, including high-ranking military officers and civilian lawyers, to investigate the slayings. **********The slayings of the priests has renewed doubts about assertions by the Bush and Reagan Administrations that they had succeeded in efforts to foster democracy in this country. **********Skepticism About Progress **********The killings also have stirred questions about President Cristiani's ability to control the more extreme elements in the armed forces and his rightist party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as Arena, which has been linked to Archbishop Romero's killing. **********Colleagues of the slain Jesuit priests originally said they had been tortured and that their brains had been scooped from their skulls. **********But autopsies performed with the help of independent forensic specialists found that the priests had been killed with high powered assault rifles and that bullets had shattered their skulls. **********Mr. Cristiani has vowed to do everything in his power to press the case. But the timing of the announcement Sunday night and the president's failure to furnish details raised questions about how much progress the investigators have made. **********Some diplomats suggested that the announcement was part of an effort to forestall pressure from senior United States Senators who are planning to visit El Salvador. **********''He now has to follow through,'' one diplomat said of Mr. Cristiani.

Butcher, chairman, would be replaced by Thomas G. Labrecque, president, and that Arthur F. Ryan would become the new president. **********The changes, which will be effective at the end of October, were not surprising but were announced sooner than planned. Mr. Labrecque, 51 years old, has been president and Mr. Butcher's heir apparent for nine years. Mr. Ryan's success at developing Chase's consumer banking businesses had made him a favorite for the No. 2 job. **********Mr. Butcher said the changes were announced several months earlier than expected in order to precede a major revamping and cost-cutting program in the bank's corporate finance businesses. ''We wanted to make the line of succession clear and avoid speculation,'' Mr. Butcher said. ''We now have a man of judgment in Labrecque and a great implementor in Ryan.'' **********Arthur P. Sotor, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said, ''The promotion of Art Ryan is a reminder of the fact that Chase and Citibank, two of the biggest wholesale banks in the country, are today making as much or more profit from their retail activities than from the traditional banking activities with corporations.'' **********Branch Network Improves **********Under Mr. Ryan, Chase improved its branch network in New York City and greatly expanded consumer financial businesses like credit cards, student and mortgage loans, and automobile leasing. During 1989 those activities and others included in the individual banking group earned more than $300 million, or about half the profit the company would have earned had it not taken special charges to cover things like troubled loans to less developed countries. **********''Nobody will ever mistake me for an expert in mergers and acquisitions or a credit officer,'' Mr. Ryan said. But he added that earlier in his career, when he was head of the data processing area, he became familiar with the basic operations of corporate lending and other areas of the bank. **********A quick-smiling, fast-talking executive who will admit to a more than occassional urge for a cigarette, Mr. Ryan, 47, was born in Brooklyn and has a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Providence College in Rhode Island. **********Mr. Labrecque, who many analysts credit as the executive most responsible for the decisions to expand retail banking activities and tighten expense controls, has been a prominent executive since the mid-1970's when he was involved in New York City's financial crisis. Tall and smooth talking, Mr. Labrecque has spoken frequently about the need for American banks to have broader powers in the securities and insurance businesses. **********Mr. Labrecque said that as chairman, ''My primary focus will be the strategic and competitive positioning of the bank, corporate financial management, and helping Art on the day to day issues.'' **********Mr. Butcher, 63, who succeeded David Rockefeller as chairman of Chase in 1981, led the bank during a decade when its traditional strength as a lender to businesses was hard hit by competition from foreign banks and the shift by large corporations to raising money in the securities markets rather than borrowing from banks. **********Besides reductions in personnel and other expenses in the corporate finance or wholesale lending part of the bank, Mr. Butcher said, ''We have to deal with some real estate things.'' As a major lender for commercial real estate projects, analysts expect that Chase has been hit in recent months with a large increase in problem loans, which will require it to set aside addtional reserves to cover losses. **********Pending Changes **********The three executives declined to comment on the reorganization at Chase, except to say that it is pending. Analysts say they expect the banking company to announce major cuts in employment, concentrating on its wholesale lending business in the United States and Europe. Chase, which is currently the second-largest banking company in the country behind Citicorp, may also announce the sale of some assets or even whole businesses. **********The retail banking business, which has been growing by more than 15 percent annually, is not expected to be much affected by the revamping. With profits of about $1 for every $100 of assets, the retail banking businesses managed by Mr. Ryan earn a return of about 20 percent on the equity capital needed to operate them. **********The star of the retail banking business is Chase's credit card business.

In addition, fees for plaintiffs' lawyers, which had consumed tens of millions of dollars, would be cut to a maximum of 25 percent of what their clients recover. **********The proposal would give priority to the more seriously ill people -- an estimated 23,000 who have cancer and other debilitating diseases -- over those with less severe asbestos-related ailments, who would get nothing in the first year. Up to 37,500 of the less severely ill could receive a maximum of $2,000 in the second year of the plan. **********If, as expected, the plan is approved by a Federal District Court, it would remove tens of thousands of cases from hundreds of state and Federal courts around the nation and slash the legal fees that have taken most of its available funds. This would be accomplished by combining all the cases against the trust into a single class action. **********The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust has become a symbol of the legal difficulties facing many former asbestos makers and their victims. Manville, for decades the nation's leading producer of asbestos products, set the trust up two years ago to enable the company to rise out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The corporation's legal liability was shifted to the Washington-based trust, with the intention of making timely settlements of claims and helping victims avoid costly litigation. **********The trust is now facing more than 90,000 lawsuits in hundreds of state and Federal courts, legal bills of tens of millions of dollars, and decades-long delays in compensating asbestos victims, many of whom have fatal illnesses and cancers. By some estimates, more than two-thirds of the resources available for victims have been going to legal and administrative costs. **********The announcement of the new plan follows an order by District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn to revamp the ailing trust, which he has said was unfairly denying relief to tens of thousands of asbestos victims. The plan was worked out after months of negotiations among the Manville Corporation, the trust, a committee of seven lawyers representing thousands of victims and Leon Silverman, a New York lawyer appointed by the judge to deal with the trust's problems. **********Experts said yesterday that the new plan marked a significant development in the law governing product liability and was likely to provide a new precedent for the handling of asbestos cases, which are now clogging many courts across the nation.   'Legislated Disability Program' **********\"It sounds like a legislated disability program,\" said Peter H. Schuck, a professor at the Yale Law School who has written a book about Agent Orange, one of the largest product liability cases and the role played by Judge Weinstein. \"It will treat the cases more categorically and less individually and set priorities based on the severity of the illnesses.\" **********Under the plan, it is estimated that an average of $146,000 would be paid for asbestos victims with mesothelioma, $120,000 for lung cancer victims who had not smoked, $70,000 for smokers who contracted lung cancer and $80,000 for other severe, but nonmalignant diseases. Among the less severe diseases, it is estimated that under the plan an average of between $12,000 and $35,000 would be paid. **********At present the trust gives priority to order of filing, rather than severity of cases. To tens of thousands of victims, many with fatal or severe cancers, the trust has handed out i.o.u.'s to be paid without interest, well into the 21st century.   Swamped by Lawsuits **********The trust was initially financed by Manville's contributions of cash and stock, the company's insurers and commitments to share in any future profits of the company. The Denver-based corporation, for decades the largest processor of asbestos, entered into bankruptcy proceedings in 1982, swamped by lawsuits charging that asbestos was killing and injuring thousands of workers and others who breathed its fibers. **********After paying fewer than 23,000 victims, the trust ran out of cash and proposed to give victims i.o.u.'s. **********Under the new plan, the Manville Corporation would contribute an additional $520 million over seven years to the trust through dividends paid on the stock. In addition, the trust's $1.8 billion bond would be modified so that the trust could break it up into smaller debentures and market them to raise cash. **********The payments to the more seriously ill under the plan are impossible to calculate with certainty because they will be based upon the number of claims and the size of the fund. The victims would receive up to 45 percent of their claims in the first year of the plan until all of the more seriously ill people receive compensation, and would then receive payments based on a pro rata share of what is left. By all accounts, most payments would be less than the original claims paid by the trust. **********The proposed resolution of the trust's difficulties is the first element of a broader effort by Judge Weinstein to resolve the predicament of both the asbestos makers that face insolvency from the stream of liability cases, and the victims, who have seen their cases go unresolved for years. **********His proposal is the creation of an enormous fund, financed by the companies. Victims could make claims from the fund, based on the severity of their illnesses and the amount of money available. A second company, Eagle-Picher Industries of Cincinnati, has already asked for similar treatment, and executives and lawyers at several other companies have said privately that they would contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to the fund, if they were assured it would end the costly lawsuits. **********The judge is expected to announce today the appointment of a lawyer to assemble a panel of experts to examine the plan. He also expects to hold hearings in New York, Chicago, New Orleans and San Francisco and could call for modifications of the plan.   Struck Down by Appeals Courts **********But the class action route is far from a certainty. Appeals courts in several jurisdictions have struck down class actions on the ground that there are too many legal and factual disparities among the victims and the causes of their illnesses. **********Nonetheless, there is also a growing concern among scholars, judges and lawyers that asbestos litigation, which is clogging the courts in many jurisdictions, has gotten out of hand. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist recently appointed a panel of judges to make recommendations for changing court procedures and law to resolve what by all accounts has become a crisis in the courts. A New System for Aiding Victims Proposed reorganization of the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, as recommended by the trust, Manville Corporation and a committee representing thousands of claimants. Manville Corporation's preferred stock held by the trust would be convertred so it would hold 80 percent of common stock. A dividend would be paid to holders of common stock, so that the trust would receive $520 million over seven years. A $1.8 billion bond by Manville would be changed so that the trust could break it up and market it to raise cash. Cases in Federal and state courts would be combined into a single class action, which would dramatically reduce legal fees of the trust and the claimants. Judge Jack B. Weinstein has estimated that the legal fees are consuming more than two-thirds of available resources. A cap of 25 percent would be put on the fees awarded to plaintiffs' lawyers. The fees have been as high as 40 percent of awards. The payout system would be changed so that the more seriously ill claimants would receive earlier payments, based on the number of claims and resources available. Payments are expected to be substantially less than comparable claimants received earlier. Those with less severe illnesses would receive nothing in the first year and as much as $2,000 in the second year.

The Solidarity labor leader, who himself rose to prominence by leading the strike at the Gdansk shipyard, begged the workers to call off the walkout. **********''Please do it for Poland,'' he said. ''We don't want a civil war now, and what's going on now is leading to it.'' **********The Solidarity-led Cabinet has refused to even discuss the strikers' pay demands.

The Solidarity railroad union urged members not to participate in the stoppage at midday Monday. The move is being spearheaded by a union that had been backed by the old Communist Government. **********The strike committee is also calling for a work stoppage on Tuesday night. **********Officials said thousands of the nation's 400,000 railroad workers were striking but could give no specific number.

As part of this evolving relationship, President F. W. de Klerk visited Madagascar on Aug. 15 to establish economic ties, and Zambia said this month that its businessmen could now use South African ports for their exports. **********After years of trying to destabilize the Mozambican Government and being the main provider of arms to the rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance, South Africa is now intent on trying to rebuild the country, said David Laubscher, the head of the South African trade mission here. **********Mr. Laubscher said he tells the 120 South African businessmen who visit his office per month that the ''war won't last forever.'' **********Pretoria's goal is to develop a southern African common market, of which South Africa would be the linchpin.

Now for the first time there appears to be proof of such illegal diversion, and a political scandal has been set off. **********Bank and court records show that more than $10 million in Government money was funneled to the PRI, as the ruling party is known, during the governor's race last year in the state of Baja California Norte. Several officials of the previous PRI administration in the state have been arrested and are awaiting trial, but officials of the new state government have said some important records are missing and may have been destroyed. **********Opposition Is Victorious **********The matter came to light after the right-of-center National Action Party won the gubernatorial election last July in Baja California Norte, which borders California and has a population of two million. The victory of Ernesto Ruffo Appel, who took office last November, marked the first and thus far only time since the Institutional Revolutionary Party first came to power in 1929 that an opposition party triumphed in a governor's race in one of Mexico's 31 states. **********The new administration says an examination of state documents and bank records found that 251 checks had been issued by the previous government to accounts held in seven names that turned out to be fictitious, as well as to Margarita Ortega Villa, the PRI candidate in the governor's race. Most of the accounts were in names that shared the initials of the Institutional Revolutionary Party or its state president at the time, though in a different order. Many of the checks were endorsed by party officials. **********As is the case whenever there is an accusation that taxpayer money has been used for partisan purposes, leaders of the Institutional Revolutionary Party here and in Baja California Norte deny that any government funds were illegally channeled to them. They say the party received only the small government subsidy that is normally made available to all registered political parties here under the terms of the Federal Electoral Code, and accuse the opposition of slander. **********'Eminently Political' **********''The government of the state of Baja California has neither supported nor presented the proof for the accusations it has made,'' Senator Luis Donaldo Colosio, the party's national president, said recently. ''So this is an accusation that we have described as eminently political.'' **********But Mr. Ruffo has said he is merely acting ''with objectivity and respect for the law, in no way motivated by political or electoral considerations.'' On a visit to the capital to discuss the case with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Interior Minister Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, he told reporters that both he and the federal Government were eager to avoid a ''vendetta.'' **********Mr. Salinas has had no direct public comment on the case, though last year he acknowledged the existence of ''pockets of corruption'' in the state after forcing Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, the Governor at the time, to resign. Mr. Salinas came to office in December 1988 saying that the ''era of virtually one party'' was over and he has promised ''clean and transparent elections.'' **********The Organization of American States recently warned the Mexican Government that ''it must comply exactly with the obligation to guarantee the free and full exercise of political rights.'' The admonition, in a report by the Inter-American Human Rights Commission of the O.A.S., came in response to formal complaints by the National Action Party that the Institutional Revolutionary Party and the Mexican Government had committed fraud in elections in the states of Chihuahua and Durango in 1985 and 1986. **********Mexican political analysts said Mr. Ruffo may be reluctant to pursue the Baja California Norte case aggressively for fear of offending the central authorities. Mexican states and municipalities depend on federal funds for most of their budgets, and administrations dominated by the Institutional Revolutionary Party have not hesitated in the past to cut back or delay allotments when opposition-run governments take actions that challenge the party's supremacy. **********In addition, Mayor Milton Castellanos of Mexicali, who was head of the party's state committee in Baja California Norte last year, admitted in an interview with a newspaper here last month that more than half of the $10 million ended up in his hands, but maintained no laws were broken. He described the money as ''coming from dues from party members working in the government, which were deducted and given to me,'' adding, ''It is a revolving fund.'' **********Where the Money Goes **********The ruling party is known throughout Mexico for its lavish campaigns, which usually involve bringing in scores of party workers from around the country, lodging them in expensive hotels and renting several buildings as campaign offices. Hundreds of thousands of election posters, fliers, calendars, key rings, T-shirts and banners are usually distributed, lavish picnics, barbecues and banquets are organized, and all available wall space is painted with the name of the candidate, his campaign slogan and the red, white and green colors of the party. **********Another common practice is to transport huge caravans of farm workers, labor union members and government employees to rallies of PRI candidates, to give the appearance of broad popular support and electoral invincibility. Those attending such campaign events are usually given a bag lunch and coupons redeemable later for cash at party offices or for tortillas, beans or rice at Government-owned grocery stores. **********Party officials say the PRI's large campaign expenditures are made possible by generous donations from party loyalists. But Mexico has no laws requiring the reporting of campaign expenditures, and PRI campaign managers consistently turn aside requests from reporters for an accounting of donations and spending. **********Nearly two years after the 1988 presidential campaign, for instance, the party says it still has no idea how much was spent to elect Mr. Salinas in the most hotly contested presidential vote in modern Mexican history. **********''We do not have the cost,'' Mr. Colosio, who was Mr. Salinas's campaign manager, said when asked last month how much had been spent on the campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/03/world/rebels-report-gain-in-ethiopia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rebels Report Gain in Ethiopia", "print_headline": "Rebels Report Gain in Ethiopia", "body_text": " **********Ethiopian rebels said today that they seized a third town in central Ethiopia in their drive southward toward Addis Ababa, the capital. **********The rebels have been fighting since 1974 to oust the Marxist Government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. **********The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front said in a radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi that its fighters captured the town of Jihur after mounting a ''fierce offensive'' on Sunday. **********In earlier combat, after fighting stepped up in mid-December, the rebels said they took the garrison town of Debra Tabor in northwestern Gondar Province and Mehal Meda and Rabel in Shoa, the province that includes the capital.

Instead, it would be ''a specific commitment, with a number or a percentage.'' **********The subtle but important shift being considered by NATO grew largely out of discussions between Bonn and Washington and was based on several considerations: that the Soviets simply will not withdraw from Germany unless this issue is addressed; that the Germans themselves have already announced their intention to reduce the size of their armed forces, and that there really is no reason to not make the commitment in the initial treaty if an equitable figure can be worked out."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/29/world/upheaval-east-rumania-20000-stage-rally-rumania-protest-against-new-rulers.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1990-01-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1156, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  20,000 Stage a Rally in Rumania To Protest Against the New Rulers", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: RUMANIA;   20,000 Stage a Rally in Rumania To Protest Against the New Rulers", "body_text": " **********Shouting anti-Communist and anti-Government slogans, about 20,000 people marched today to the headquarters of the ruling Council of National Salvation for an opposition rally that revealed the widening split over the country's political course. **********The demonstration was led by the three major opposition parties, which are already engaged in round-table talks with the council. As the rally dispersed in a bitter mood early tonight, President Ion Iliescu said the discussions would continue next week. **********Earlier in the week, organizers of the rally, which included the Peasants' Party, the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, issued a communique calling for a new provisional government, to be made up of representatives of the major parties, youth leaders and people who have opposed the Communists over the last 45 years. **********But as the crowd marched to Victory Place on a cool and sunny day, the chant was for the Council of National Salvation to step down. ''Down with Iliescu!'' ''Down with Communism!'' and ''Resign!'' the crowd shouted. **********The placards underlined similar themes. ''We don't want to be laboratory rats for the Communists,'' read one. Another put an equal sign between the Nazi swastika and the hammer and sickle. **********Suspicions in the Streets **********Although the council renounced Communism when it assumed power after the overthrow of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu on Dec. 22, suspicions about its leading members continue. Many were not only members of the Party, but at one time also held high-ranking posts in the Ceausescu Government. **********A dog-eared clipping from a French newspaper showing a picture, dated 1976, of Mr. Iliescu, a former Party Secretary for Youth, and Mr. Ceausescu bowling together was handed back and forth among demonstrators. **********''We are here because they are all Communists and Stalinists,'' said Juliana Vasinschi, a translator at a construction institute, who was on the front lines of the demonstration, ''and we don't want neo-Communism, any more than we want neo-fascism.'' **********General elections are scheduled on May 20, but the recent announcement that the council will field its own candidates, without reorganizing as a political party, has alarmed the opposition. A series of Government decrees limiting the right to protest has also upset independent groups, particularly students, although today there was no effort by the armed soldiers guarding the council's headquarters to enforce the new rules. **********At about 4 P.M., after standing still for three hours, the chanting crowd burst through a line of soldiers, running past tanks parked in the street, to crowd around the entrance at the council headquarters, which is also the Foreign Ministry. Although generally peaceful, the rally had its ugly moments as pro-Government supporters, called to Victory Place by an appeal on the Government-controlled television, formed phalanxes and pushed and shoved demonstrators away from the area directly in front of the building. **********The men, burly and tough, moved ahead of a large truck that also pressed through the crowd, with a group of chanting council supporters riding on top, waving banners. Within an hour, as a patriotic song was broadcast from giant speakers, drowning out the anti-Government chants, the place in front of the building had been cleared of protesters, leaving in their place a crowd that greeted Mr. Iliescu with cheers instead of boos. **********The strong-arm tactics, eerily reminiscent of the way ruling Communists typically broke up protests, only reinforced people's disgust with the council and its tactics. ''I thought I knew what I thought of them when I came today, but now I am sure,'' said Florin Tanascu, an engineer who was working as a marshal for the Peasants' Party. **********''They are our enemies,'' said Ion Radoiu, who heads the Peasants Party's youth group. ''They were using not workers but gypsies and people let out of prison. They are animals.'' **********Some of the scenes today were also reminiscent of episodes during the revolution that ousted Mr. Ceausescu. But this time, those who had been in the crowd besieging the party's Central Committee building on Dec. 22 were now on the balcony, and the chants from below were not against Mr. Ceausescu but Mr. Iliescu. **********After the speech by Mr. Iliescu from the floodlit balcony, the two groups -supporters and opponents of the council - separated by a swath of ankle-deep mud, yelled bitter, angry slogans at each other. **********''You are not Rumanians!'' and ''Down with immigrants!'' were some chants by the council's supporters, while the protesters shouted back, ''Assassins!'' and ''Criminals!'' **********Foreign Money Assailed **********Several council supporters said they had come because they wanted to defend Mr. Iliescu, who had steered them in the days after the revolution. Others said they had heard that the opposition parties were trying to buy support with foreign money, apparently referring to the well-publicized return of Rumanians from abroad. **********The battle of the crowds outside matched a debate that went on inside the building, where leaders of the opposition sat at a round table with Mr. Iliescu, Prime Minister Petre Roman and other council leaders. Most of the opposition figures are old men who had been active in their parties before the Communist era, and in the case of the leader of the Peasants' Party, Corneliu Coposu, were imprisoned as a result. **********The demonstration today capped a week of almost daily rallies, protesting new issued by the council or its continuing hold over news organizations. **********With the exception of the daily newspaper Romania Libera, most of the press is in the hands of the council, particularly in the provinces. **********New Peasants' Party Formed **********In the Teleorman region, about 70 miles south of Bucharest, the local paper ignored the founding of a new Peasants' Party chapter eight days ago. Still, the party president, Gheorghe Mardale, a 63-year-old forester, said many peasants were besieging its offices asking to join. As of Friday, he said, 1,261 have signed up. Of these, 180 today took a four-hour train ride to make their case before the council's headquarters, he said. **********Marian Mirlea, who was also with the Peasants' Party at the rally today, had a different problem. One of the first members of the Council of National Salvation, he has not been able to make his resignation known. **********''I quit the council on Jan. 24,'' he said. ''But I could not announce it, because no one would print it.'' **********The national television tonight gave lopsided coverage to the demonstration with little attention paid to either the reasons or the people participating in the protests. It did, however, broadcast unedited portions of the round-table talks on the evening news."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/16/world/sri-lanka-rebels-raid-vital-airfield-in-north.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 246, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sri Lanka Rebels Raid Vital Airfield in North", "print_headline": "Sri Lanka Rebels Raid Vital Airfield in North", "body_text": " **********Tamil rebels today fired mortars at a vital airfield in the Jaffna peninsula at the north of this island nation, minutes after a Government minister had left at the end of a round of peace talks, military officials said. **********At least 275 people, including 137 unarmed policemen slain by the rebels, have been killed since Monday, when rebels with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam staged a wide offensive, overrunning police stations and military camps along the east coast and the north.

W. de Klerk. Mr. Bush would greatly like to lift some of the sanctions imposed since 1986, officials said, as a show of support for Mr. de Klerk, who is regarded with admiration in the Administration. **********But Mr. Bush is prevented from doing so just yet because a law enacted four years ago over President Reagan's veto provides that the sanctions remain in place until a series of conditions are met, including the release of all political prisoners and the complete lifting of state-of-emergency regulations. **********There is nonetheless a widespread concern that something should be done to help Mr. de Klerk, who officials say may be in danger of losing support among his white constituents because of his initiatives, including the legalization of the African National Congress, of which Mr. Mandela is deputy president. **********'Something of a Visionary' **********''He's something of a visionary,'' an official said of Mr. de Klerk. ''The problem is that he may be out too far in front of his people.'' **********When asked early last week about the impending Mandela visit and the issue of sanctions, Mr. Bush immediately began speaking of his admiration for Mr. de Klerk, although he had not been asked about him. **********''Let me be very clear,'' he said. ''I salute Mr. de Klerk for what he's done. He's come a long way. And I salute Mr. Mandela for his approach to Mr. de Klerk.'' **********The President noted almost wistfully that he was unable to lift sanctions now because of the law, and he added, ''I'd like to find a way to show Mr. de Klerk that we, the United States, are grateful for this new approach that is having South Africa evolve to a much more open society and hopefully one day to one which is color-blind in terms of participation in the political process.'' **********Mr. Bush also said that there were other black leaders in South Africa who were opposed to sanctions and that he was ''looking forward to talking to Mr. Mandela about this.'' **********Comparison to Gorbachev **********Administration officials acknowledge that their approach to the South African President in some respects resembles their attitude toward President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. In both cases, their policy is heavily dependent on the continuation in office of a specific national leader. **********Robert I. Rotberg, the new president of Lafayette College and an expert on southern African politics, said it was appropriate to regard Mr. de Klerk that way. But he said it would be a mistake not to think of Mr. Mandela in the same terms, as someone on whom the peace process depends. Mr. Mandela, he said, also faces impatient elements in his constituency. **********''We should think of them as an indispensable duo,'' Mr. Rotberg said. ''It would be wrong to tilt in any public way toward de Klerk.'' **********Herman J. Cohen, the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, said the Administration was sensitive to the idea that both South Africans have to deal with restive supporters. ''The main thrust of our policy now is to support negotiations,'' he said in an interview. ''Last year our policy was to press the Government to accept the idea of negotiations, but now De Klerk has done that.'' **********As a result, he said, it is Mr. de Klerk who now faces political dangers, because of his efforts to engage the African National Congress in negotiations as well as other steps to change the apartheid system. **********'De Klerk Needs Support' **********''Our analysis of the situation in South Africa right now is that President de Klerk is under increasing pressure from the right,'' Mr. Cohen said. He cited a parliamentary by-election this month in which Mr. de Klerk's ruling National Party barely held off a challenge from the extreme rightist Conservative Party in a district once thought to be safe for the Government. **********''This indicates that Mr. de Klerk needs support,'' he said. **********Mr. Cohen said that lifting some of the sanctions would be most useful to Mr. de Klerk now, but that ''our hands are tied by the law.'' **********Representative Howard Wolpe, a Michigan Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on Africa, said there were ways other than lifting sanctions to help Mr. de Klerk. ''We can make clear the tangible benefits that would flow to South Africa from a fully normal relationship,'' he said. ''We would even encourage companies to move there.'' **********Mr. Cohen said sanctions could not be removed, even partly, until all political prisoners are released and a state of emergency imposed by the Government is completely lifted. The African National Congress and the Government have been negotiating over the release of prisoners. The Government has accepted a tentative agreement reached by a working committee representing the two sides, and in an interview last week, Mr. Mandela indicated that the proposal was acceptable to his side as well. **********Lifted in Three Provinces **********Mr. de Klerk has lifted emergency regulations, which gave the security forces broad powers to suppress unrest, in three of the four provinces. Even though the African National Congress has not complained strongly about the Government's decision to leave the state of emergency in place in Natal province, where violence between rival black factions continues. Administration lawyers say this precludes the lifting of sanctions. **********Mr. Cohen noted that Mr. Mandela has pressed his view that pressure should be maintained on South Africa, and he said Mr. Bush and others ''certainly want to hear his point of view.'' **********''But one thing that has to be made absolutely clear is that decisions will be made here on that policy and that Mr. Mandela will not make those decisions for us,'' he said. **********Another senior Administration official expressed this viewpoint more bluntly. He said it was important to signal to the African National Congress that Washington would not back its every demand. ''They might think they never have to compromise,'' the official said. **********Mr. Mandela has said the people chosen to negotiate with the Government should be elected. While Mr. Cohen said that was feasible, other Administration officials have dismissed this idea as absurd."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/business/tokyo-market-uneasy-on-fears-about-soviets.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1990-01-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 711, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tokyo Market Uneasy On Fears About Soviets", "print_headline": "Tokyo Market Uneasy On Fears About Soviets", "body_text": " **********Fears about political turmoil in the Soviet Union helped undermine a record-setting stock market rally, causing prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to skid over the last week in an increasingly nervous investment climate. **********On Wednesday, investors on the Tokyo Stock Exchange succumbed to concerns that ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union threatened President Mikhail S.

''But there is a real edge to what is happening. Everybody is anxious about everybody else, what the other person is doing.'' **********Some analysts described the tumble as more a symptom of a growing nervousness here than a direct result of concerns about troubles in the Soviet Union.

Then, the oil exporters, awash in cash, deposited the money in Western banks, which in turn lent it to the countries that needed the money to pay for oil. The banks called the process ''recycling,'' and no one spent much time worrying about how those countries would ever repay the loans. It turned out many of them couldn't. Bankers have not forgotten that lesson. **********This time around, the problem may be greater because Eastern Europe no longer can count on cheap Soviet oil. **********It's not only the countries that have problems, of course. ''The combination of recession and oil price shock will create a new wave of bankruptcies,'' forecasts Richard Hoey, the chief American economist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''It's very clear that optimistic estimates of cash flow of a lot of borrowers will be disappointed.'' Mr. Hoey had been forecasting a mild recession before the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait.

These projects, known as build-to-suit developments, are experiencing a boom as the nation's developers, most of which build on speculation, try to compete in the custom market. **********''The market in build-to-suits is getting really crowded because speculative development has dried up and companies with development staffs are competing for these opportunities,'' said Robert Williamson, the director of national marketing for the Prudential Property Company, a big national developer. **********In build-to-suit projects, developers design and construct buildings to the needs of a primary tenant, which pays the developer a marginal fee for design and construction work and agrees to buy the completed building or occupy all or most of it in exchange for a favorable long-term lease. **********Clear Numbers for Lenders **********The projects are easier for developers to finance than speculative buildings because rental incomes are guaranteed through a contract, allowing lenders to see clearly how their loans will be repaid. **********''The banks will only come into a situation where debt coverage is clear and up front from the beginning, and right now that's in build-to-suits,'' said William Conway, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton, an international real estate concern based in New York. **********But these projects are usually less profitable for developers than speculative developments. Custom builders must absorb any overruns themselves, because they are locked into fixed rental rates or selling prices before they complete a project. **********By contrast, speculative builders can pass on all of their building expenses to their tenants, and they generally charge higher rental rates for taking on more risks, including the possibility that they will be left holding on to thousands of square feet of vacant office space. **********Pricing Problem **********As a result, many speculative builders are not well versed in the intricacies of build-to-suit pricing, leading to predictions that many will have trouble competing in the market. **********Build-to-suit developments were pioneered by a few large developers in the 1970's for designing specialized industrial projects.

In that deal, NCNB Texas National Bank beat out another large domestic bank and two Japanese banks to provide construction financing. Prentiss, which has generally limited itself to doing build-to-suit projects, prevailed over competition like the Trammell Crow Company to build the 1.1-million-square-foot office space. **********''We got the project because we had already established a real good relationship with I.B.M.,'' said Michael Prentiss, president of the developer. **********Prentiss had completed six other made-to-order buildings, valued at about $1 billion, for I.B.M. **********''They had a tight time schedule and it's an important project, so they needed a partner that could deliver the product on time,'' Mr. Prentiss said. **********Growth for Trammell Crow **********Dallas-based Trammell Crow, the nation's largest developer, has more than doubled its build-to-suit business over the last two years, to 10 million square feet, said Marc Myers, a partner at Trammell Crow who oversees these projects. **********''It's always been about a third of our business, and right now it's about 80 percent,'' he said. **********''Over the next five years, on a sustained basis, I expect it will be about 60 to 65 percent of our business,'' said Mr. Myers, who added that the number of build-to-suits Trammell Crow is doing has doubled this year, to 10 million square feet. But many developers who excelled at speculative building are discovering what the build-to-suit developers have known all along: the two businesses are radically different. **********'A Different Business' **********''Build-to-suits are going to be the largest share of the business, and everyone is going to be competing for them,'' Mr. Myers said, ''but it is fundamentally a different business because it requires greater technical skills, greater pricing precision and a team approach.'' **********In the typical build-to-suit project, a prospective tenant approaches a builder with specifications for the type of building it needs. A period of exploration and negotiation between the developer's technical staff and the client follows. During this period, which can last for months, the developer nails down the specific kind of building the client needs. **********The development team then offers the client a guaranteed price on the building based on computer-estimated costs of construction. Competition among builders prevents padding of the estimates in case of overruns, and usually if the cost of construction runs up because of rising interest rates after the project has begun, the developer assumes the expense. **********Challenge of Pricing **********''You have to price the rent precisely to fit the project and make a slight return,'' Mr. Myers said. **********The developer then works closely with the architects and contractors to deliver the building on time and within costs. **********''In order to be a really strong build-to-suit developer,'' said William Alter, president of the Alter Group, a build-to-suit company based in Wilmette, Ill., ''you have to be able to do the numbers properly because you give the client a guaranteed fixed price up front, and you have to have proper asset management ability.'' **********For instance, an unexpected engineers' strike delayed by six weeks a 1982 project by the Alter Group to build a 350,000-square-foot research center in Naperville, Ill., near Chicago, for A.T.&T.'s Bell Laboratories. Bad weather delayed the project by another three weeks. Nonetheless, the complex still had to be delivered within 17 months of the starting date. Alter not only arranged for nonstriking engineers to keep things going at 60 percent of capacity, but also increased the total hours logged weekly to make up for lost time. **********The developer also had to absorb the cost of design changes ordered by the client. These changes doubled the cost of the cafeteria alone. **********Land Problems **********The most frequent source of overruns is problems with the land. Building codes and zoning regulations can change, and increasingly complex environmental issues can add to a developer's expenses. **********Build-to-suit projects often require more technical skill because they often are specialized projects like research and development centers, manufacturing plants or distribution warehouses. Some projects combine many of these different functions. **********Increasingly, big corporate tenants in such deals are not satisfied with favorable long-term leases or equity positions in the completed project. Many corporate tenants choose to buy the building, several builders said. **********Lower Profit Margins **********In part because they sell or invite tenants to take equity stakes in these buildings, custom developers' profit margins are less than those of speculators, who make much of their money on a property's long-term appreciation. Although it differs with each project, the margin on build-to-suit projects can sometimes be as thin as three-quarters of 1 percent between the rent and the cost of the construction, Mr. Myers said. But generally the industry tries to get closer to 2 percent. **********And developers have no guarantee of getting financing even for those build-to-suit projects with large, well-known clients and long leases. The banks are rigorous in their due-diligence reviews and can be very reluctant to finance even these deals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/06/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-mubarak-says-israel-and-iraq-had-secret-contacts.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 613, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Mubarak Says Israel and Iraq Had Secret Contacts", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   Mubarak Says Israel and Iraq Had Secret Contacts", "body_text": " **********An assertion by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt that Israel has been secretly in contact with Iraq in recent weeks drew angry reactions from Israeli officials today, but no denials. **********The Israeli officials accused Mr. Mubarak of violating a policy of playing down Israel's role in the Persian Gulf crisis.

Mr. Gomes cried gleefully as one ton of wood crashed back into the roiled waters of this normally placid lake in eastern Amazonia. **********While a canoeist corralled the floating log, Mr. Gomes, a spry, 58-year-old backwoods inventor, spun his vision of a new growth business for the Amazon: underwater logging. **********Brazil's growing charcoal, furniture and home construction industries are placing mounting demands on the Brazilian logging industry. And there is a lot of wood under the water brought by three hydroelectric power dams that flooded 2,000 square miles of Amazon forest in the 1980's. **********Underwater Tree Cemetery **********A bridge between supply and demand is visible in this lake, an underwater cemetery peopled by millions of gray, leafless tree trunks. In one of the biggest scandals of the military Government that ruled Brazil until 1985, a group of retired military officers received a contract to clear all timber from the area to be flooded by Tucurui, Brazil's second largest dam. Lacking business experience, the group harvested only 5 percent. **********Obeying a construction timetable, Eletronorte, the Amazon's electric power company, closed the dam on the Tocantins River in November 1984. Since then, six million cubic meters of wood have been entombed in a lake the size of Lake Champlain. **********Watching from the shoreline was Mr. Gomes. ''I thought it was absurd to lose all this wood, so I started working on a machine,'' he recalled. ''At first, we played white men and Indians with Eletronorte. We hid in the woods when their boat went by.'' **********Today, however, accusations of wood theft are a distant memory. The power company smiles benignly on Mr. Gomes's enterprise, and takes 10 percent of wood sales. **********Decomposition Is a Threat **********Decomposing wood produces ammonia and hydrogen sulphide - substances that could pit and corrode the turbines of the $5 billion, 3,370 megawatt dam, explained Tacachi Hatanaka, an Eletronorte biologist who monitors water quality. **********Corrosion threatens the two other new Amazon dams maintained by the power company, Samuel in Rondonia State and Balbina in Amazonas State. **********Meanwhile, on land, demand for wood increases. With a mountain of high-grade iron ore being mined 100 miles from here at Carajas, a steel smelter in Maraba at the southern end of the lake requires 500 tons of charcoal a day for production. **********This year, a second smelter in Maraba closed after the federal authorities imposed a $1 million fine for using charcoal without a permit. **********The smelters are part of a series that ecologists warn could chew up much of eastern Amazonia with their need for charcoal. Visiting Carajas in mid-July, Brazil's President, Fernando Collor de Mello, announced a freeze on new smelters and a plan to reforest 2.2 million acres with eucalyptus and other plantation trees. **********Charcoal Contract Signed **********This year, Mr. Gomes signed a contract with the remaining smelter in Maraba to supply half of its charcoal needs with charcoal burned from lake wood. The rest of the smelter's charcoal is to come from sawmill scraps. **********''The part of the tree above the waterline is damaged and will go for charcoal,'' Mr. Gomes said. ''The submerged wood is still green and can be used for furniture and construction.'' **********Mr. Gomes has cut and sold 43,000 cubic meters of underwater wood in the last two years. As word spread, inquiries even came from abroad. **********''This wood is preserved like an olive in a jar,'' Mr. Gomes said as a barge derrick hoisted a dripping two-ton log, Worth $400 uncut. **********Using Trial and Error **********The derrick is part of a new kind of underwater logging that Mr. Gomes and his divers are exploring through trial and error. **********Some woods, such as cedar and mahogany, float. Other woods sink and have to be hoisted aboard the barge, a battered British-made scow appropriately named O Elefante. **********For underwater lumberjacks, the danger is not from falling trees, but from the perils of prolonged work at depths up to 150 feet, using an air hose from the surface. So far, Mr. Gomes said, there have been no accidents, except for several cases of rapid decompression - none serious. **********''My air hose once got tangled in a tree, and I took the airplane,'' Edidarcio Fereira da Silva said of the time he rode a ton of tree that rushed 100 feet to the surface. **********Snakes and Piranhas **********On land, loggers keep an eye out for snakes. Underwater, tree cutters keep an eye out for piranhas. **********''I cut one in half the other day,'' Mr. da Silva, said of a defensive slash he made with his saw. **********The wiry, 26-year-old diver dresses entirely in black - wet suit, jogging pants and sneakers. ''It's harder for the fish to see me,'' he said Not all precautions work. Last year, a piranha took a bite out of a thumb joint, a rare bit of exposed flesh. **********The product of backwoods ingenuity, Mr. Gomes has applied for a patent for his amphibious power saw. Mounted on a boat, a diesel-powered compressor forces oil at 750 pounds per square inch through rubber lines. Running through the saw, the oil spins the saw blade at 3,500 rotations per minute, about one quarter the speed of normal chain saws. **********Employing 15 people, the Amazon entrepreneur calculates that his costs are 25 percent less than above ground. The largest savings is in transportation. Instead of using trucks, he uses the barge or simply tows floating wood to sawmills that are sprouting at the lake's edge. **********Mr. Gomes estimates that it will take 15 years to harvest Tucurui's submerged wood."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/05/business/finance-new-issues-citicorp-unit-to-revamp-municipal-bond-operations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 361, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Citicorp Unit to Revamp Municipal Bond Operations", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Citicorp Unit to Revamp Municipal Bond Operations", "body_text": " **********Citing heavy competition, Citicorp Securities Markets Inc., the broker-dealer subsidiary of Citicorp, said yesterday that it was reorganizing its activities in the municipal bond business by dropping out of traditional areas like underwriting and trading and concentrating instead on providing derivative products like interest rate swaps to customers. **********The move is the most recent step by a securities house to redefine its niche in the municipal bond business, which since 1986 has been hampered by a sharp slowdown in underwriting volume. **********Over the last few years, many firms have addressed the slowdown by reducing their municipal bond operations.

But he had one fatal flaw - an obsessive need to control. ''He would constantly fly off the handle and give confusing orders,'' recalled Paul Middelhoven, vice president of engineering. **********Between the general manager's refusal to accept input from other executives, including Mr. Middelhoven, and their retaliatory sabotage of project deadlines, the office was a battlefield. **********Enter Mary Riley, Ph.D., management consultant and author of the recent book ''Corporate Healing: Solutions to the Impact of the Addictive Personality in the Workplace.'' **********Brought in by the general manager, under pressure from senior management, to fix the problem, Dr. Riley sat in the room while Mr. Middelhoven discussed the problems with his boss. The meeting, Mr. Middelhoven said, made his boss finally realize the seriousness of the problem. ''He saw that he wasn't making his orders clear and that he was just overworking everybody by giving them one vague order,'' he said. **********According to Dr. Riley, many executives struggle with an almost neurotic inability to communicate their desires and goals at work. Stemming from the same addictive-compulsive behaviors that riddle executives' personal lives, these habits can hinder the efficiency, productivity and profitability of their corporations. Executive stress alone is estimated to cost companies $50 billion annually for such things as counseling, disability claims and absenteeism. **********Ten years ago, Dr. Riley and her ilk might have been laughed out of the executive suite, dismissed contemptuously as merely purveyors of ''new age'' psychobabble. Her favorite word, after all, seems to be ''spiritual'' - as in spiritual values, spiritual steps to recovery, spiritual healing and spirituality. **********But corporate America has awakened to the effects of executive health and emotional well-being on the bottom line. Chief executives and others in senior management now voluntarily enter alcohol and drug-dependency programs to cope with their substance-abuse problems. Psychotherapy has become commonplace among top executives.  Against this backdrop come self-proclaimed corporate healers like Dr. Riley. And if her thriving client list is any indication, executives are proving that their free-thinking on emotional well-being knows few limits. Dr. Riley has been hired by scores of corporations to shake up their executive suites by conducting self-help sessions between company executives and their subordinates. **********These $80-an-hour sessions consist largely of each employee stating to the other what he or she specifically needs to get a certain project done. ''One person is likely to be either an addictive personality - too demanding and controlling - while the other is probably going to be co-dependent or not demanding enough,'' Dr. Riley said. ''The addictive person probably has 20 things he or she wants to demand, but I ask them to focus on just the most important. The co-dependent employee is forced to come forward with his or her most important demand.'' **********Many companies tap Dr. Riley to cope with the oversized egos of particular executives. In 1984, after the Bankers Trust Company had entered investment banking, it ran up against a culture split between the aggressive experienced investment bankers it had hired from the outside and its own more conservative commercial banking executives that supervised the new recruits. **********''A lot of the new investment bankers had large egos and were very arrogant,'' remembered Susan Lawley, then the vice president in charge of administration in the investment banking department. ''They were not used to performance reviews or to having bosses tell them what to do.'' **********They put off the reviews as a result. Concerned, the bank called on Dr. Riley, who helped identify another problem: the bank's executives were stressed, neurotic and unable to communicate. Ms. Lawley remembers getting a frantic telephone call from one senior banker, who had been asked for a written appraisal of some of his colleagues' strong points. ''He said, 'Sue, I can't do it!' '' she said. '' 'In my family, we grew up either screaming or saying nothing. I've never been good at telling people what they do well!' '' Dr. Riley suggested that performance reviews be held as informal meetings between investment bankers and their superiors. During the meetings, each executive would be required to voice just one grievance or request of the other. An investment banker afraid to ask his busy boss to accompany him on client calls to help close deals was able to make his point in a calm meeting, without looking like he was whining for attention. **********''The classical review - where the boss is in the authoritative position and the investment banker his subordinate - just didn't work,'' Ms. Lawley said. ''Often, the banker knew more about the business than his boss. The ability to have meaningful dialogue between senior management and the deal-doers made for a more productive, open environment where people could take risks.'' **********It all sounds so simple, this getting together and talking things out. Why does it take a consultant with a Ph.D to get it all going? ''I think we had, and probably still have, some skeptics in our company who thought that boy, this is kind of touchy-feely,'' said Richard Meslang, president at Unicom International Inc. in San Francisco, which has used Dr. Riley's services. ''But it helped reduce our turnover and improve morale.

''Venezuela feels it is her obligation to look after our clients and to safeguard the equilibrium of the world oil market.'' **********Big Supplier for the United States **********Venezuela's production increase is good news for the United States. In recent years, the South American country has alternated with Saudi Arabia as the largest source of crude oil for the United States. In 1989, Venezuela sold the United States about a million barrels of crude oil a day - about 18 percent of America's total crude-oil imports. **********During the 1973 Arab oil embargo, Venezuela sharply increased oil production and exports to the United States. This time, Venezuelan public opinion is again heavily in favor of increasing production. **********Frustration over a prolonged recession in Venezuela, a country recently accustomed to the highest standard of living in Latin America, is bolstering the push for more production.

''To close the embassy in the face of this high tide would be stupid.'' **********Still, another Eastern European diplomat said, the focus of foreign policy among the newly non-Communist governments must be Europe, the Soviet Union and the West, with Indochina only a distant concern. **********Anxiety in Phnom Penh **********He said the changes are causing severe anxiety in the Cambodian Government, which is trying to secure relations with more countries and fears losing ties with any of the 10 that now have diplomatic missions here. **********Many Eastern European embassies, a diplomat said, are operating with no clear instructions from their tumultuous home capitals. **********''There is a dangerous silence on the part of many East European embassies here,'' he said, while Western countries like Australia, Japan, Sweden, Canada, France and Britain are gearing up for better relations ''as soon as it is seemly.'' **********Cambodia's main aid donors are the Soviet Union, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. **********Change in Trade Relations **********''These relationships will inevitably change, and soon,'' a Polish diplomat said. ''Comecon is moving toward a hard-currency relationship, and no one can afford to subsidize trade in the same ways.'' **********Even the Soviet Union, which supplies Cambodia's oil and gasoline at subsidized prices and provides military aid, is now negotiating a new five-year plan, to run from 1991, that will look very different from the last one. **********''Many figures may change,'' a Soviet diplomat said. **********With the possibility of an Indochina peace settlement and changes in Moscow's foreign policy, military aid to Hanoi is sure to decrease, a Soviet diplomat there said. ''Our relationship, which was before mostly political and military, is now becoming mostly economic and cultural.'' **********'We Start to Count the Money' **********''That creates more problems,'' he said, including how to value old loans. Instead of building huge plants and infrastructure projects all on credit, ''with no thought about cost, now we start to count the money.'' **********The new five-year plan, he said, would concentrate on joint ventures and contracts between enterprises on the basis of hard currency and market prices. ''We seek to balance our relations and make them mutually beneficial,'' he said. **********He said Western estimates of $2.5 billion a year in Soviet help to Vietnam were ''roughly right,'' not including direct aid. But he would not comment on suggestions that this figure may be reduced as much as 40 percent. **********Such considerations clearly worry the Vietnamese. Nguyen Ngoc Minh of the State Bank said Hanoi's 1989 budget deficit was more than double 1988's, increasing inflationary pressures. **********A sizable cut in Soviet aid as Hanoi tries to remodel its industry, create jobs, adopt market prices and eliminate subsidies would be bound to hurt. **********In particular, he said, it would intensify Vietnam's credit squeeze, at least until Washington stops blocking new loans from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. **********Planned Comecon projects, like improving the north-south railroad, ''are as good as dead,'' a diplomat said. **********Even the official news organizations of the countries that were once Communist now have little reason to maintain Hanoi bureaus. As Western news agencies negotiate to open offices in Hanoi, at least two Eastern European agencies are planning to relocate to Bangkok or Jakarta."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/04/world/evolution-europe-russian-republic-backs-private-farm-plan-but-rejects-private.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-12-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Russian Republic Backs Private Farm Plan but Rejects Private Sale of Land", "print_headline": "EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; Russian Republic Backs Private Farm Plan but Rejects Private Sale of Land", "body_text": " **********The Russian republic approved a program today to revive the private peasant farm 60 years after Stalin snuffed it out with his collectivization program. **********But the Parliament of the republic, which has most of the nation's farmland and much of the current separatist zeal for private enterprise, stopped short of allowing the private sale of land between farmers. **********The lawmakers, in effect, compromised the plan of Boris N. Yeltsin, the insurgent leader and President of the republic, to allow relatively free sale of land by individual farmers. Instead farmers were restricted to reselling plots only to the state, and not to the nascent private market that Mr. Yeltsin had envisioned. **********\"You would never understand the spirit of Russians who never have been accustomed to the terminology and even more to the practice of selling and buying land -- the motherland, as we call it,\" Mr. Yeltsin told foreign correspondents at a press conference. **********\"As some legislators used to say, 'One can not sell his or her mother,' \" the Russian leader said, admitting he had to accept a compromise to at least start the revival of the small family farms that were obliterated in Stalin's drive to collectivization. **********The change amended into the Yeltsin plan would require individual farmers to work their plots for a minimum of 10 years, with any later sale permissible only to the state. Mr. Yeltsin, who faced a spectrum of anxious criticism from party ideologues to individuals uneasy about the unknowns of personal land ownership, had proposed a five-year minimum for farmers to work their new plots and then have the right to sell to most buyers other than foreigners. **********The amendment was approved by 602 legislators and opposed by 369, with 40 abstaining. **********In effect the amended proposal accepts the idea of carefully controlled privitization plus individual ownership and inheritance rights, but nullifies Mr. Yeltsin's attempt to pioneer the selling of land among individual farmers. His supporters said the compromise would still encourage tens of thousands of farmers to apply for individual plots of land.  Hard-Line Criticism **********Millions of Soviet citizens died in the forced program of farm collectivization and rural hamlet destruction carried out by the Government against peasant farmers six decades ago. The nation has never recovered from the effects and the tradition of large-scale family farming was virtually lost. **********For four days of debate on the Yeltsin proposal, Communist hard-liners argued long and fervidly against decollectivization of the Russian farmland. They defended the party's bedrock dogma and achieved a victory that to a considerable extent also reflected the Soviet public's doubts about private land ownership. **********President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has led the way in pronouncing his reluctance to see outright land ownership, having cautioned the issue is too vital to be settled by anything but a voters' referendum. In a speech earlier this week, he said he did not fear the general concept, but personally was opposed. **********\"I do not accept private property on land,\" he said. **********Across the city, the national Parliament voted general approval of Mr. Gorbachev's proposed plan for redesigning the lines of authority of the Soviet Union. Mr. Yeltsin, a critic who is seeking a far greater measure of republic sovereignty than Mr. Gorbachev has proposed, gestured with his arms as he said the Soviet President's authority should be reduced considerably. Mr. Yeltsin's hands came closer and closer, as if he were buying a wedge of cheese, as he demonstrated the strait he prefers for his Kremlin rival.  'A Psychological Issue' **********One of the strongest arguments against denationalizing farmland was the concern, amid the current economic spiral, that easily available land would be cornered by profit-minded speculators with no interest in fostering agricultural improvements. **********Mr. Yeltsin said the compromise measure approved was \"historic\" in authorizing revival of individual farms and that fuller acceptance of privatization would follow across the first decade of experience with individual farms. **********\"It is a psychological issue,\" he said. **********He also contended the example set by Russia would affect other republics to enact private farming. **********\"This will not go unnoticed,\" he said. **********The opposition to the Yeltsin proposal included a coalition of Communist ideologues, state collective farm managers who amount to agricultural moguls under the Communist system, and individuals legislators who criticized the anti-speculation provisions as too weak. **********The original proposal included various assurances that collective farming would continue to be encouraged in a broader, variegated farm market intended to encourage competitiveness rather than state planning devices as the critical arbiter. **********But the amended version had firm devices to guarantee that local authorities would have the final say over the privatization, deciding whether and how a collective might shed some plots for willing individuals. Local authorities also would reacquire the land in behalf of the state when a farmer who worked the land a decade or more might be interested in selling."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/09/world/lebanese-weigh-intervention-in-christian-enclave.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1990-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 438, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lebanese Weigh Intervention in Christian Enclave", "print_headline": "Lebanese Weigh Intervention in Christian Enclave", "body_text": " **********President Elias Hrawi conferred with aides on a possible military intervention in the war-torn Christian enclave today as sporadic clashes and sharp political disagreement kept tension high between rival Christian factions. **********Three people were killed, including an Army officer, and four wounded, when Lebanese Army troops loyal to Gen.

It offers frank, if brief, descriptions of human rights violations that Mexican Governments have long sought to keep out of the public eye. **********\"Mexico has a human rights problem that it cannot and does not wish to hide,\" said Jorge Carpizo, president of the new National Human Rights Commission, presenting the report to Mr. Salinas.  Rights Groups Are Critical **********But the report specifically disqualifies the commission from investigating complaints of abuses related to political campaigns or the electoral process. And it was quickly criticized by private human rights groups that have described the new commission as a Government attempt to appear actively concerned about human rights issues while avoiding outside investigations. **********\"This commission is just an ornament for the Government,\" asserted Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, president of Eureka, a human rights group that has been sharply critical of Mr. Salinas's Government. \"Its aim is to cover up the situation, to make it appear that a human rights problem does not exist.\" **********In its six months of existence, the report states, the commission has received 1,343 complaints involving abuses that affected more than 3,500 people. Of those cases, it said, 397 have been fully resolved, 200 had too little information to permit investigation, and 746 are still being processed. **********The largest number of cases in which the commission issued formal recommendations involved members of the state and federal judicial police forces, which have often been linked to corruption and brutality. Many of those cases also involved the most serious crimes reported to the commission, including murder, torture and kidnapping.  Mayor Is Ordered Freed **********On Tuesday, Mr. Salinas ordered the release of an opposition Mayor in the southwest state of Michoacan after the commission found that he had been abused by federal judicial policemen. The Mayor, Salomon Mendoza Carajas, had been held in a Mexico City prison on drug charges after signing a confession that he asserted had been coerced from him under brutal interrogation and torture by the police. **********Other cases in which the commission recommended the investigation or dismissal of Government officials ranged from the abuse of inmates at prisons to unjust imprisonment by local prosecutors.

But it's at the expense of Shearson shareholders. In 1987, American Express sold the public a minority interest in Shearson at $34 a share. Last week, American Express decided to buy each share back - for American Express stock worth about $11.93. American Express actually had wanted to sell more, but plans for another public offering and for a deal with Sanford I. Weill of the Primerica Corporation fell through. So with the help of more money ($1 billion), fewer employees (at least 2,000 layoffs) and a new chief executive (Howard L. Clark Jr.), American Express hopes to revive its brokerage. Some analysts say it will be years before Shearson can be peddled again. ''These companies are clearly wed for quite some time,'' said Michael L. Blumstein, a First Boston Corporation analyst. **********Coke: Another Generation **********''New'' Coke is about to become even newer. The Coca-Cola Company said last week that it will test a Coke II brand as a renamed, repackaged, remarketed version of ''new'' Coke. The new, sweeter than the old, was supposed to appeal to the Pepsi generation, but its sales have slipped to 1.4 percent of the domestic soft drink market. Analysts say the Coke II name also might help the company distinguish new Coke from its original product, now called Coca-Cola Classic. Coke II cans will have dashes of blue, a color more familiar on the cans of Coke's largest competitor. And what if Coke II succeeds? As Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, put it, ''They have 'Karate Kid III.' I can't wait for Coke III.'' **********Will They Go Back to Greyhound? **********Will Fred G. Currey become the Frank Lorenzo of the bus business? Mr. Currey's Greyhound Lines Inc., like Mr. Lorenzo's Texas Air Corporation, is perilously leveraged. And, as Mr. Lorenzo did at Eastern Airlines, Mr. Currey is trying to replace strikers with nonunion workers. The union walked out March 2, but Greyhound claimed last week to be operating 30 percent of its bus system, a figure disputed by the union. Prior to the current troubles, Mr. Currey arguably improved service, investing in his bus fleet, increasing ridership and, last year, eking out a small profit. But if a 1983 Greyhound strike under previous owners is any guide, it could take the company years to win riders back. **********Demystifying Food Labels **********How not to cash in on the nutrition boom: Dr. Louis Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services, called last week for food companies to have mandatory nutritional labeling on nearly all their packages. Saturated fat, fiber, cholesterol, percentage of calories from fat - all would have to be clearly listed. No longer would food packages rival supermarket tabloids in telling stories that are mystifying, creative and incredible. Ideally, consumers would be able to see at a glance that a frozen dinner now labeled low-calorie was actually a meager, starvation-ration serving laden with fat. Said Dr. Sullivan: ''The grocery store has become a Tower of Babel, and consumers need to be linguists, scientists and mind readers to understand the many labels they see.'' **********The $2,000 Difference **********The main difference between Genentech Inc.'s genetically engineered clot-dissolving drug and a more conventional product is about $2,000 a dose, European researchers reported on Thursday. They found that streptokinase, at $186 a dose, could treat heart attacks as well as Genentech's tissue plasminogen activator, or Activase, at $2,200 a dose. The study raises questions about whether sophisticated genetic engineering can produce drugs any better than those made by cheaper means. **********USX and Dumping the Steel **********Corporate raiding in the post-junk-bond era somehow seems a lot more complicated. The most that Carl C. Icahn has gotten from the management of the USX Corporation so far was a promise on Thursday to have shareholders vote on spinning off at least 80 percent of the steel business. Though he may be the largest shareholder, some analysts say he is unlikely to win the vote. But they note that Charles A. Corry, the USX chairman, has no long-term commitment to making steel. USX also has major interests in oil and gas. **********In Brief **********A 32-year-old great-grandson of the Ford Motor Company's founder moved a step closer last Wednesday to someday maybe running the company himself. William Clay Ford Jr., who already sits on the board, will direct the company's worldwide automotive strategies. **********THE ECONOMY **********Riskier Munis? **********Since the turn of the year, Treasury and corporate bond prices have tumbled but municipals have remained as solid as an old granite courthouse. Rates on long-term municipals have hovered near 7 percent since last year while 30-year Treasury bonds have gone from 7.8 percent in December to about 8.5 percent now. David Johnson, a portfolio manager at Van Kampen Merritt Inc., said municipals have held stable because of relatively low supply. But some analysts see a risk: As more cities and states face financial troubles, their credit ratings, and the value of their bonds, will fall. **********Melamed to Leave the Merc **********Leo Melamed plans to resign as head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to spend more time with his family and, in his own fashion, explore outer space. He announced on Monday that he will retire as executive committee chairman at the end of the year. The father of financial futures, he turned a market once most concerned with pork bellies into an arena with global influence on currency exchange levels, stock prices and interest rates. His tenure has also seen a Federal investigation of trading abuses. Mr. Melamed intends to continue trading for his own account. But he might find the cosmos more peaceful than the commodity pits: He also plans to write a sequel to his 1987 science-fiction novel, ''The Tenth Planet.'' **********Coloring for Babyboomers **********How to cash in on the graying of the baby boom: Open a beauty salon and concentrate on hair coloring. American Salon magazine predicts that salon customers will spend $5.5 billion on hair coloring this year, up 29 percent from last year. ''More women are going out into the work world,'' said Norma A. Lee, speaking for next week's International Beauty Show. ''They don't have time to fool around and do it themselves.'' **********Unemployment Holds Steady **********The unemployment rate continues to defy predictions of an economic slowdown. The Labor Department reported on Friday that the rate stayed at 5.3 percent in February for the ninth month in a row. Meanwhile, January's 5.4 percent drop in factory orders, the steepest in 15 years, only reflected weak manufacturing, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. ''What stands out,'' he added, ''is the enormous strength of the service sector.'' **********INTERNATIONAL **********Brussels: The Boring Boom **********Brussels is blossoming as the headquarters of an increasingly unified Western Europe. The European Community concentrates its offices there, with most European Parliament meetings there as well. As European companies have crowded in, commercial real estate values have doubled and tripled. Construction cranes are everywhere; seven major downtown hotels are going up or have just been completed. But the boom has brought more discount shopping stores than sophistication. The city's real attractions remain the Gran' Place, some classic restaurants and a naughty little statue. The hottest ticket in Brussels come Friday night is for the train to Paris - which is where the Group of Seven industrial nations has chosen to meet next month. **********Mitsubishi Finds a Friend **********The Mitsubishi companies of Japan have found a friend to induct them into the corporate club in Europe. On Tuesday, they announced plans for ''intensive cooperation'' in automobiles, aerospace and microelectronics with Daimler-Benz of West Germany. Japanese companies have been rushing to enter Europe before a single, borderless market takes shape in 1992. Daimler, whose products include Mercedes-Benz cars, stands to gain access to Japanese technology and markets. **********Small Business, Soviet Style **********Soviet leaders seem determined to keep passing laws making small businesses legal until everyone gets the message. In 1988, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed small businesses to open their doors as worker-owned cooperatives. In some areas, they have flourished; in others, they have been squashed by local politicans. Last Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet tried to encourage the spirit of enterprise some more, voting 350-to-3 to allow citizens to own the means of production. But local officials will still apparently own the means of obstruction: Workers can possess a factory, but only the government will be entitled to own the land underneath."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/09/business/company-news-trump-documents-ordered-released.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Trump Documents Ordered Released", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Trump Documents Ordered Released", "body_text": " **********Casino regulators in New Jersey ruled today that more than 1,000 J.

A few days later, Sir Geoffrey Howe, her deputy Prime Minister, resigned in protest and set off the leadership crisis. **********Today, some European politicians took satisfaction from the fact that, while domestic problems first undermined Mrs. Thatcher's popularity in Britain, in the end the European question was one of the central issues that split the Conservative Party and forced her to step down as Prime Minister. Welcomed in Bonn **********\"I hope this will put an end to divisions on such a vital issue as Europe,\" said Willy de Clercq, a Belgian representative to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. \"Whoever becomes Prime Minister, I hope their policies will be positive and pro-European.\" **********In a rare public comment from one of her former Community colleagues, Belgian's Prime Minister, Wilfried Martens, said he hoped her resignation \"will bring change, meaning we will be able to progress more quickly in the construction of European political union.\" **********In Bonn, the news was also welcomed by politicians. \"Thatcher failed because she either could not or would not grasp the chances of Europe,\" said Otto Lambsdorff, leader of Germany's Free Democrat party. \"The times are gone when you could win applause in Britain by stepping on the brakes in the European Community.\" **********Hans-Jochen Vogel, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said Mrs. Thatcher's resignation would give \"great encouragement to all advocates of speedy European integration.\" Alfred Dregger, a Christian Democratic leader, said she had \"tragically\" refused to recognize change in Europe. Some Familiar Figures **********Among the three contenders to succeed Mrs. Thatcher, the Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, are already familiar figures in Europe because of their participation in frequent community meetings. While always loyal to Mrs. Thatcher, both were considered more pro-European than the Prime Minister. **********But Michael Heseltine, the former Defense Secretary who first challenged Mrs. Thatcher this week, has perhaps raised more expectations in European capitals because, while less well known, he chose to gamble his political career on the European question. **********In Brussels, where the community's Executive Commission is headquartered, the word from 10 Downing Street this morning was particularly well received, not least because Mrs. Thatcher often accused the Commission and its French President, Jacques Delors, of trying to undermine Britain's sovereignty. **********For the record, Mr. Delors merely expressed his \"highest esteem\" for the outgoing Prime Minister today, but the Vice President of the Commission, Sir Leon Brittan, who held four Cabinet posts under Mrs. Thatcher, said her resignation would enable Britain to play \"a constructive part in the European Community.\" Seen as Symbol by French **********In Paris, a spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand said, Mrs. Thatcher symbolized an important era in the history of her country and Europe while the the Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, said he expected \"an evolution\" and \"a modification\" of Britain's policy toward Europe -- though not toward the Gulf crisis -- under a new Prime Minister. **********Mrs. Thatcher was in Paris on Tuesday attending a 34-nation European summit when she learned she had failed to win an outright victory in the first round of voting for the Tory leadership. As if sensing she was on the way out, several European leaders bade her farewell Wednesday with special warmth. **********While causing mounting irritation to her community colleagues in recent months, Mrs. Thatcher's impact on Europe throughout the 1980's was enormous, not only because of her firm support for a strong Western security posture and for what became known as Thatcherist free market policies, but also because of her special ties to Washington. **********Today, a former French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who is currently a member of the European Parliament, said he now expected Britain to contribute to European union, but he had friendly words for his fellow conservative. 'The Curtain Falls' **********\"The curtain falls on the Iron Lady,\" he said, using the nickname first given to her by the press. \"She has earned our applause. The Britain she leaves behind is no longer as she found it. Margaret Thatcher will have been, with Winston Churchill, the greatest British Prime Minister in the last 50 years. The Iron Lady was also a great lady.\" **********Another French conservative leader, Jacques Chirac, himself a former Prime Minister, praised Mrs. Thatcher's \"attitude of dignity and courage\" in giving precedence to the interests of her party and country and paid tribute to her \"historic role in restoring Britain to its proper place\" in the world. **********John Bruton, leader of Ireland's Fine Gael opposition party, spoke of her as \"a politician who had sincere convictions and worked with relentless energy to achieve the things she believed in.\" In a similar tone, Giovanni Spadolini, President of the Italian Senate, referred to her \"intrepid character.\" **********In Eastern Europe, where Mrs. Thatcher won a strong following in the 1980's for her unwavering anti-Communism, word of her resignation came as a shock. Only Wednesday, Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's Finance Minister, described her as \"a wonderful personality and we wish her all the best.\" Praised Gorbachev in 1985 **********Mrs. Thatcher, who in 1985 was the first Western leader to declare that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is \"someone we can do business with,\" also leaves admirers in Moscow. \"She was a historic figure who helped bring the Soviet Union closer to Europe,\" Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman, told Reuters. \"We will remember her as someone who made a great contribution to the good relations with the Soviet Union and the Continent.\" **********Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, said he had no official reaction, but he too noted that she had helped improve relations between Moscow and London. \"We regard her very highly and hope to continue our good relations with the new leader,\" he told Reuters. **********In Stockholm, a spokeswoman for Sweden's Green Party had a different reason for lamenting Mrs. Thatcher's departure. Referring to the frequent \"family photos\" taken of the British Prime Minister and the 11 men who are community leaders, the spokeswoman, Margareta Gisselberg, said the party would miss \"the dress in a row of suits.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/03/world/evolution-in-europe-with-nonreaders-gone-marxism-s-journal-fails.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1990-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   With Nonreaders Gone, Marxism's Journal Fails", "print_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   With Nonreaders Gone, Marxism's Journal Fails", "body_text": " **********One of the world's most widely circulated unread magazines, Problems of Peace and Socialism, is capitulating before the problems that have uprooted Communism and is giving up publication.

''It reflected the situation inside the movement. Its incapacity to produce a review efficiently was also part of that system.'' **********A Circulation of 550,000 **********''It was very expensive,'' said Mr. Molnar, still a loyal Communist and a former diplomat and foreign-policy assistant to Milos Jakes, the hard-line Czechoslovak Communist Party chief overthrown by the democratic revolution in November. ''No one but the Communist parties could have permitted themselves that.'' **********More than 400 editors, about half of them Soviet citizens, worked in the former seminary to prepare the master edition of the monthly in Russian. Editions in English and Arabic were also prepared here but printed in their countries of circulation. Hundreds of other editors worked around the world to prepare 70 editions of the identical journal in a total of 41 languages, whose global circulation was reported at 550,000 copies. **********The costs were borne largely by the Soviet party, with lesser contributions from East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Mongolia. As the tide turned, parties withdrew their contributions until, Mr. Molnar said, ''We are ending this historical period with money only from the Soviet Union and Mongolia.'' **********The magazine was standard equipment on desks and tables in Communist offices around the world except China and Albania. But it seemed that wherever they were spotted, the copies always looked mint-fresh. **********The table of contents in March 1989, before revolution came to Eastern Europe, included typical offerings like ''We Have Much to Say on Human Rights,'' by James Stewart, general secretary of the Irish party; ''Humanism: The Gist of Revolution,'' by Trevor Munroe, the Jamaican Communist leader, and ''Forward-Looking Ethiopia,'' by Tesfaye Dinka of that country's Politburo. **********'A New Way of Thinking' **********Mr. Molnar said no article could be published if a single member of the editorial board vetoed it, a fact that prevented anything critical of a Communist country or party. **********But at the end of last year, the editorial board decided on a sweeping change in policy, which brought articles by outsiders like Zbigniew Brzezinski, Alexander Dubcek, Milovan Djilas and Andrei D. Sakharov. **********''The last numbers really reflected a new way of thinking,'' said Mr. Molnar, who took office in February. ''The local perestroika came too late.'' **********Agreeing with that conclusion, the Soviet Union withdrew its contribution in May. The last Soviet editor, Aleksandr M. Subbotin, who headed the more important Trud, the trade-union daily, until Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power, left earlier in the year. Most of the Soviet staff has followed, and all will be gone in July, Mr. Molnar said. **********The Staff Is Down to 40 **********Where more than 400 used to occupy the long flights of well-furnished offices, only about 40 employees remain, mostly Czech housekeeping staff. **********But Mr. Molnar said he was negotiating with former financial contributors to convert Peace and Socialism International Publishers into an unsubsidized publishing house for left-wing, but not necessarily Communist, writing. ''It will be more democratic, flexible and open,'' he promised. **********The editor has already chosen a non-internationalist name for the new enterprise - Patria. **********Had there been a link between the large Soviet presence in the publishing house and the secret police next door?

Their programs imitate both the appearance and the command set of Lotus 1-2-3, the best-selling spreadsheet program, which lists for $495. **********The two cases were separated when the lawsuit originally went to trial, and yesterday's ruling applied only to Paperback Software and its Canadian development partner, Stephenson Software Ltd. **********Continues Trend **********Executives of Lotus, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., have argued that the two smaller companies copied thea Lotus format - a grid-like design on the computer screen - as well as the sequence of keystrokes used to manipulate information. **********The Lotus ruling continues a legal trend of the past decade that has significantly broadened the notion of what constitutes intellectual property protection for software. Originally, most of the industry felt that only the programmer's underlying instructions were protected under copyright law. But beginning in the early 1980's, a series of lawsuits involving the video screens of game programs extended protections to the appearance of programs. **********Some industry executives contend that the Lotus case could radically change the nature of software competition. Many in the industry fear that companies that are successful in setting an ''industry standard'' might be able to use the case to block newcomers, restricting innovation. Now It appears that the dividing line between imitation and innovation may be clearer. **********''It's an important ruling,'' said Jack Russo, a Palo Alto, Calif., lawyer who specializes in copyright issues. ''In the future, if there's a product that becomes the accepted product in the industry, it will be very difficult to create a program that competes with it.'' without being willing to retrain users extensively.'' **********The Lotus ruling may affect other lawsuits now pending, including a suit that Apple Computer Inc. filed against the Microsoft Corporation and the Hewlett-Packard Company, accusing them of copying certain portions of its Macintosh software, Mr. Russo said. **********''It's an overwhelming victory for Lotus,'' said Thomas M. Lemberg, the company's general counsel. ''There is a larger message to the industry, and it's a very helpful one,'' he added. ''The copyright law really does protect incentives designed to reward innovation.'' **********Executives at Paperback Software said they intended to appeal. the ruling. They said they were still trying to digest the 110-page ruling made by United States District Judge Robert Keeton. and would have no immediate comment. **********'Not Totally Surprised' **********''We're not totally surprised by the direction the judge has taken,'' said Micheal K. Burdick, Paperback's vice president of sales and marketing. ''Our view is that it is just one step in the legal process.'' **********In his ruling Judge Keeton wrote: ''I conclude that a menu command structure is capable of being expressed in many if not an unlimited number of ways, and that the command structure of 1-2-3 is an original and non-obvious way of expressing a command structure.'' **********The ruling would affect only programs that directly copy the visual appearance and the command structure of 1-2-3, Lotus executives said. The principal competitor to 1-2-3, Microsoft's Excel program, has a different appearance and a different menu-based command set. **********Lotus officials said that the ruling did not extend to companies that publish programs that are compatible with Lotus files, and that it had no intention of trying attempting to claim copyright protections over file compatibility. **********Paperback Software was founded in 1984 by Adam Osborne, a personal computer industry executive who also founded Osborne computer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/02/business/company-news-pratt-whitney-planning-layoffs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pratt & Whitney Planning Layoffs", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Pratt & Whitney Planning Layoffs", "body_text": " **********Aircraft-engine maker Pratt & Whitney Canada Inc. announced plans to lay off as many as 1,200 workers, about 12 percent of its work force.

Manuel Antonio Noriega in American custody and out of the country, relieved Panamanians turned their attention today to the arduous process of repairing the damage he inflicted on the political, social and economic fabric of this nation of 2.3 million people during his six-year rule. **********At Government offices, businesses and banks, Panamanians reported to work still aglow with delight from the street celebrations that exploded here when General Noriega's departure was announced Wednesday night. But that joy has been tempered by awareness that the country still faces serious problems that will not be easy to resolve. **********''The criminal is gone, and we are happy to be rid of him,'' said Ligia Cornejo, a middle-aged office worker. ''But I am still here, and my children and I are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of all the evil deeds the dictatorship committed when it pillaged and intimidated this country.'' **********The new civilian Government that took power after the American military invasion on Dec. 20 took no time to savor its victory. While ordinary Panamanians were dancing in the streets, President Guillermo Endara summoned his Cabinet for an unusual midnight meeting, part of a continuing effort to revise or abolish the many institutions that General Noriega and his associates subverted or corrupted. #90% Support Seen for Endara ''This is a golden opportunity to restructure this country in a much more modern light,'' a prominent Panamanian political figure said. ''We need to repeal the political and judiciary systems, cleanse the bureaucracy and get rid of practices that only create corruption.'' **********A senior Panamanian Government official said today that the resignation of Col. Roberto Armijo, appointed on Dec. 23 as head of Panama's new Public Security Force, came after evidence of his corruption surfaced in a Government investigation. The official said he could not rule out the possibility that Colonel Armijo, a member of General Noriega's inner circle, would be prosecuted on the corruption charges. **********Action against other remnants of the Noriega Government continued today. It was announced that Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, the much-despised head of the secret police, is now in United States custody on a military base here. **********For the moment, Mr. Endara is the principal beneficiary of the vacuum left by the collapse of the Noriega Government. Archbishop Marcos McGrath, the country's highest-ranking Roman Catholic, estimated today that ''at least 90 percent of the population'' supports the Endara Government and would vote for it if a plebiscite were held immediately. **********Discord in Panama Government **********But many Panamanian and foreign analysts said they believed it would be difficult for the new Government to maintain that consensus for very long. Members of Mr. Endara's Authentic Panamanian Party and First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon's Christian Democrats have already begun sniping at each other in private. **********''So long as Noriega was around, he could be the focal point of the entire nation's hatred and frustration,'' an Latin American diplomat said. ''But now, things will inevitably start to splinter because this is, after all, going to be a democracy.'' **********The most immediate problem, however, is rebuilding the shattered economy that once gave Panama the highest standard of living in Central America and the Caribbean. As a result of the political turmoil of the last two and a half years and the American economic sanctions imposed last year, the economy has shrunk by at least 25 percent and unemployment has doubled, to a quarter of the working population. **********Those difficulties were compounded by the Dec. 20 American invasion, which Panamanian economists and bankers estimate inflicted at least $500 million in damage and looting. They argue that the economy needs an immediate and large injection of credit if the downward spiral is to be reversed. **********Urgent Calls for U.S. Aid **********''The most urgent thing is to replenish commercial activity now, in January and February,'' said former President Nicolas Ardito Barletta, an American-educated economist. ''If that does not happen, then unemployment will rise and the hopeful note struck by getting Noriega out will be reduced.'' **********Since the Endara Government inherited a national treasury that was virtually empty, Panamanian officials are looking for outside assistance, particularly from Washington. But at a news conference here just hours before General Noriega's surrender, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and other members of an American economic reconstruction mission made no specific offers or promises of assistance, saying they need more time to assess the situation. **********Several Panamanian economists and businessmen said they thought the Eagleburger mission had failed to understand the urgency of the situation. They emphasized that it is in the long-term interest of the United States to support Mr. Endara's Government and other democratic elements that are seeking to replace the Panamanian military as the country's dominant institution. **********''The new Government now has to really take hold and project its image,'' said Mr. Ardito Barletta, who was forced by General Noriega to step down just months after he was elected in a 1984 presidential election marred by widespread accusations of fraud. ''Also, the United States Government must, at the highest level, announce that it supports the recovery of Panama. That has to be done dramatically, by President Bush at the White House.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/business/company-news-eastern-planning-vacation-flights.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 192, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Eastern Planning Vacation Flights", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Eastern Planning Vacation Flights", "body_text": " **********Eastern Airlines said it would begin special vacation flights during the peak winter travel season to reward frequent business fliers.

Japanese companies held 69 percent of worldwide memory chip sales in 1989, and American producers had 16 percent, according to Dataquest Inc., a research firm in San Jose, Calif.  'Perseverance Has Paid Off' **********\"It's nice to know that Texas Instruments' perseverance has paid off in being able to compete,\" said Ione Ishii, a Dataquest analyst who follows the industry. She said worldwide sales of 16-megabit memory chips would exceed $5 billion in 1994. **********The executive directing Texas Instruments' production of the advanced memory chips, Lionel White, said in a statement that design engineers and computer industry managers say Texas Instruments has a slight lead over its foreign competitors in the race for high-volume production. **********\"According to our customers, these 16-megabit samples are the first they've seen that are based on a design developed for high-volume production,\" he said. Initial output of the chips will be from the company's newest semiconductor plant, in Avezzano, Italy. Other Texas Instruments plants in Dallas; Miho, Japan, and Taiwan will be equipped later to make the chip. **********The International Business Machines Corporation and American Telephone and Telegraph Company have also spent heavily to develop and produce the 16-megabit chip, but virtually all of their output would be for their own products. **********The 16-megabit memory chip is certain to lead to smaller and more powerful products in the computer and telecommunications industries, as well as find broader uses in aircraft, automobiles and other products. It is also a crucial technology being developed for high-definition television. **********A single 16-megabit D-RAM chip the size of a fingernail can provide two million characters of storage in computers.

The NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., grew rapidly enough to raise earnings despite more real estate problems. Earnings also rose at Wells Fargo & Company, San Francisco, which is a heavy lender for real estate and corporate takeovers, but has managed to avoid making loans that turn sour. **********Problems Expected **********As the nation's largest lender for real estate, Citicorp has not avoided lending to projects in regions where a glut of new buildings has caused prices to fall and made some developers unable to repay their loans. Problems with real estate loans began increasing more than a year ago, and Citicorp executives have warned investors that they expected problems to grow this year. **********''The key question for Citicorp is whether they will have another round of loan difficulties after the examiners come in June,'' said Thomas Hanley, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. **********Citicorp earned 60 cents a share, slightly less than most analysts had expected, and well below the $1.52 it earned in the first quarter last year. **********Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, said last month that examiners would be focusing on real estate loans. In the earnings report released yesterday the bank said that becuase of unsettled conditions in the real estate market, a ''relatively high level of real estate charge-offs may continue.'' **********The real estate loans causing problems are for commercial properties like apartments, shopping centers and offices. Mortgages for single-family houses have not been a problem at major banks recently. **********In the first quarter, the company charged off $135 million of commercial loans in developed countries, including $56 million of real estate loans, mostly in North America. About 40 million of loans to finance corporate takeovers or other heavily indebted borrowers were charged off. A year ago, charge-offs in those countries totaled only $36 million. **********Citicorp said that problems with loans to highly indebted companies involved in corporate takeovers or other refinancings accounted for about half the $548 million increase since the end of the year in loans that are troubled and not paying interest. Analysts noted that Citibank was one of the leading lenders to the Campeau Corporation, whose American retail operations filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. **********Another sign of real estate problems was the $570 million allocated to the reserve for loan losses, up $212 million from a year earlier. About $56 million of the increase was to cover commercial real estate loans. American real estate loans that are not paying interest rose $119 million, to $1.3 billion. **********The strongest aspect of Citicorp's business continues to be consumer banking, which reported record profits of $270 million, up from $214 million a year ago. The credit card business, where Citicorp's various banks are the most active in the country, and the consumer banking business in the New York City market were especially strong,the company said. **********Despite the decline, Citicorp said its long-term prospects were favorable enough to increase its quarterly stock dividend nearly 10 percent, to 44.5 cents a share from 40.5 cents. Citicorp stock rose 25 cents, closing on the New York Stock Exchange at $24.50 a share. **********NCNB **********The NCNB Corporation, the seventh-largest banking company, announced first-quarter earnings of $140.1 million, or $1.33 a share, up 84.5 percent from $75.8 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Much of the growth reflects the acquisiton last year of a 100 pwercent ownership of the Republicbank Corporation of Texas, now known as NCNB Texas. **********As it warned analysts in March, NCNB said the weakening economy in the Southeastern part of the country caused some increase in problem loans, particularly for real estate. The banking company added $88.7 million to its reserve for loan losses in the first quarter compared with a $57.2 million addition a year ago. Troubled loans not paying interest, or facing other difficulties were $599.1 million, up from 446.1 million at the end of 1989. **********NCNB is benefiting from cost savings as it develops its operations in Texas. Non-interest expnses in the first quarter fell 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1989. NCNB's shares gained 37.5 cents yesterday, to $37.375. **********Wells Fargo **********Wells Fargo & Company, the nation's 12th-largest banking company, which relied heavily on lending to real estate and corporate takeovers to become one of the country's most profitable banks in the 1980's yesterday reported a 12.9 percent gain in earnings, to $159.8 million from $141.5 million. **********The strong gain in earnings confused many banking analysts, who have expected that Wells Fargo's concentration in real estate and corporate takeover lending would eventually result in losses. **********''They continue to defy Wall Street,'' said Mr. Hanley of Salomon Brothers, ''and the quality of their loans remains squarely intact.'' **********In the first quarter, Wells Fargo added only $75 million to its reserve for loan losses, down from $100 million a year earlier. Troubled loans that are not paying interest or have been restructured rose to $752.1 million, from $625.1 million a year earlier.

There are armed guards located at the hotel, but the Americans have not been threatened.'' **********Some relatives of the Americans held in Al Rashid have expressed a different view. **********Margie Walterscheid said she considered her husband, Rainard, a drilling supervisor, a hostage at Al Rashid. ''State says the Iraqi people say they just took them for their safety, that they're not being detained, nor under arrest. But I know the hotel is surrounded by soldiers. If they were free to go, I doubt they still would be in the hotel.'' **********Mrs. Walterscheid, of Jacksboro, Tex., said she felt less secure about her husband's well-being since American troops were deployed to Saudi Arabia. **********Reports on foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait were sketchy. Mr. Boucher said it was his understanding that Americans in Baghdad and Kuwait City were free to walk the streets. **********Telling Americans to Pack **********He said the United States Embassy in Kuwait City was communicating with Americans there by telephone ''to the extent possible; lines, however, are only open sporadically.'' When they can get through, embassy personnel are telling Americans to prepare to leave as soon as borders are open. **********So far, no Americans have been reported harmed. But there have been repeated reports of Iraqi forces' raping foreign women, including a British Airways flight attendant taken by a soldier from an airline bus in Kuwait at gunpoint. **********Mr. Boucher said that should Baghdad comply with its promise to allow American diplomats to leave Iraq, the State Department would keep some embassy employees in the country to maintain diplomatic contacts and consular services. **********Europeans Slip Through **********AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 8 (Special to The New York Times) - European business executives who slipped out of Iraq today said that several hundred foreigners who have been prevented from leaving Baghdad have been segregated by nationality and taken to three hotels in the capital. **********The businessmen said that restaurants and shops appeared to be operating normally and that the foreigners were not being threatened. **********An estimated 3,000 foreigners, including 1,400 Americans, were in Kuwait when Iraqi tanks and troops invaded last Thursday.

In 1987, students helped force the military-dominated Government to hold its first free elections. **********But behind this youthful enthusiasm is a darker reality not always appreciated by many of the freshmen donning their first gas masks: the price that protesters sometimes pay for their idealism in damaged job and social opportunities. **********Even a young person's marriage prospects here, some maintain, can be harmed by a political record. **********Few Places to Turn **********''Activists can only marry other activists,'' said Myung Ro Keun, a professor of English linguistics at Chunnam University in Kwangju, a well-known dissident and the father of two daughters who were jailed for their student political activities. ''It has been very hard for these students to find jobs, too. Many just become factory workers.'' **********The permanent alienation of so many young people, said Yoo Jong Hae, a professor of public administration at the prestigious Yonsei University, ''is a tragedy for Korea.'' **********Park Shin Il, a Government spokesman, insisted that there was no blacklist against former student leaders who have been imprisoned, and pointed out that there were laws preventing discrimination. But many who have been through that experience tell a different story, even some who are back in the mainstream. **********Two cases illustrate the perils that student protesters face. **********Shim Jae Chul, a 32-year-old who speaks in a clear, confident voice, is one former dissident student leader who made the long journey back from imprisonment; he is now a television news reporter. But he says he sees himself as a token of conciliation, someone given a break denied to many others in a gesture that makes more poignant the problems that other former protesters face. **********'Incredibly Lucky' **********He was chosen for special treatment in part because he was from Kwangju, the southern city where the military brutally suppressed pro-democracy protests 10 years ago. By official count the army killed 200 people at Kwangju, although many say the true toll is in the thousands. The unrest last week was staged to mark the anniversary of those deaths. **********''I was incredibly lucky,'' he said. ''Not many were, though.'' At the same time that Mr. Shim was being given his second chance, another young Korean student was just beginning his passage to the fringes of Korean society, from which he has yet to fully emerge. **********This slender, nervous and intense young student, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said he was arrested in 1986 as an underground organizer of student rallies, jailed, tortured and eventually convicted of violating the vague and feared National Security Law. **********Thrown Out of School **********Though he was soon paroled, he said his hopes of becoming an agricultural economist were broken. He got his new job, in communications, through a relative, an edge that allowed him to avoid a potentially damaging background check. **********Today, the ambitions of this young man, who spoke admiringly of an older brother studying to become an accountant, are in many ways the ordinary middle-class dreams of a good job and a better life. **********Mr. Shim's story began when he was elected president of the student council at the prestigious Seoul National University in 1980, the year that the military sought to tighten control after a coup and cracked down on the Kwangju protests. He was arrested in Seoul in a sweep of student leaders and was handed a five-year sentence, then released a few months later as part of an amnesty. But he was thrown out of the university and drafted into the army. **********The experience, he said, left him shattered, not because he was surprised at being arrested, but because of his personal sense of failure and frustration. ''I felt guilty not for losing to the army,'' Mr. Shim recalled. ''That was inevitable. But we failed to give people hope and trust and faith that we could overcome them. You have to understand, at that time there was just fear. It was complete terror. There was no hope.'' Sense of Commitment Mr. Shim said his fortunes turned only when the Government sought to create a more conciliatory image. He was allowed back into the university in 1984, and then found a job as a reporter with the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, one of two television networks here. **********He insists that he remains committed to many of his goals as a student leader and sees journalism as a way of continuing to help Korean society in a less fiery way. **********The other young man said he became interested in the student movement when his older brother was arrested in the early 1980's. **********The experience led him to become involved in a political study group that eventually became an underground circle for organizing the students at his university in Seoul. One day when he showed up for a meeting, the police were waiting. **********Like Mr. Shim, he said his brief imprisonment left him with a crushing sense of failure, one that took him two years to shake. **********''It was so hard to accept that my relationships with friends were being destroyed and that I could not trust anyone,'' he recalled. ''That was the moist painful thing I had to overcome. I didn't even trust myself.'' **********The 'Hidden' Violence **********The two former students also expressed misgivings about what they saw as the greater violence used by student demonstrators today. **********But they said their experiences had given them some understanding of why the protesters sometimes resorted to force. **********''People outside the movement just see the violence of the demonstrators,'' said the former student leader. ''What you have to realize is the hidden forms of violence that the Government uses against its opponents.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/07/business/company-news-investor-increases-stake-in-henley.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 148, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Investor Increases Stake in Henley", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Investor Increases Stake in Henley", "body_text": " **********The Lebanese investor Toufic Aboukhater has raised his stake in the Henley Group Inc. to 9.11 percent from 7.67 percent.

The diplomats reported that France was trying to persuade the 54-year-old general to leave, and had offered to provide him with safe passage to Paris. **********A two-day onslaught by army troops to dislodge fighters of the Lebanese Forces militia in East Beirut bogged down on Friday, prompting General Aoun to call off the offensive and agree to yet another cease-fire, the 16th since the violent confrontation between Christians broke out on Jan. 30. **********Shell-shocked men, weeping women and hungry children emerged from bomb shelters today to stock up on food and water, walking in streets strewn with fallen mansonry, burned cars and broken water pipes.

The woman, who was not identified, was referring to General Aoun and the Syrian bombardment of the Christian sector last summer.

Citing senior politicians, the newspaper said General Aoun's military and civilian advisers were seeking a way out of the deadlock, and were proposing that the general hand power to Mr. Hrawi. **********There was no immediate word on the subject from General Aoun, who resumed contacts with mediators between him and Mr. Geagea. **********One of the mediators, a Maronite Catholic Bishop, Khalil Abi Nader, met today with President Hrawi, who is internationally recognized and has the backing of the 22-nation Arab League. **********Government officials said the Bishop discussed relief aid for the devastated Christian sector.

But several limited partners confirmed that they had transferred money to the buyout firm on Monday. And those who had signed a confidentiality agreement that was requested by Kohlberg, Kravis were told that the estimated $1.7 billion would be used to invest in a restructuring of the RJR Holdings debt. **********What the Partners Know **********Kohlberg, Kravis executives, who took RJR Nabisco Inc. private in 1989 in the largest leveraged buyout in history, did not tell their partners specifically how they planned to restructure the debt. But several partners said yesterday that Henry Kravis, a founding member of the firm, had discussed buying back some of the bonds that were issued to finance the buyout. Prices of many of these bonds had dropped sharply in recent months on investor concerns about the company's ability to pay its debts. **********Kohlberg, Kravis, with one of the largest buyout funds in the country, is able to raise cash quickly from its partners - banks, insurance companies and pension funds - by making a ''capital call'' for all or some of the funds its investors have committed. The investors have virutally no say in the way the firm invests that money. **********In the past, Kohlberg, Kravis has financed its equity investments with borrowed money. **********Investors in the buyout fund who provided the equity financing for the original RJR Nabisco takeover said yesterday that they did not think the company was in financial trouble or that the original deal was badly structured. Indeed, operating results of RJR Nabisco and its asset sales have exceeded many investors' expectations, they said. **********Returns of 25 to 30 Percent **********Instead, they said Mr. Kravis had convinced them that they could earn returns of 25 to 30 percent by restructuring the company's finances and buying back bonds at a discount. **********If the debt is restructured favorably, such a move would also increase the return on equity investments in the company. **********For months, rumors about such a transaction had periodically arisen in the junk bond market. Yesterday, analysts and traders in this market reacted favorably to the news. Prices of many low-rated bonds, including those of American Standard, Duracell and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, rose sharply on heavy buying. **********Investors appear to be more confident that RJR, which had been unable to raise money in the battered junk-bond market, will now have access to a large source of cash, making it easier for the company to repay its debts to banks and shareholders. **********''The market is now comfortable that they have accessed money,'' said Dirk Van Doren, a junk bond analyst at McCarthy Crisanti Maffei, a bond-rating firm in Montpelier, Vt. **********Two Issues Rise $7 **********The heavy buying affected two bonds that were issued in 1989 to help finance the buyout of RJR Nabisco. Yesterday the securities in question - $4.1 billion of exchange debentures due in 2007 and $1.8 billion of senior converting debentures due in 2009 -jumped more than $7 apiece in heavy trading, closing at $77 and $90.50 respectively for each $100 of face value. **********In recent months, the two issues have traded as low as $52 and $58. The convertible issue can be exchanged into 25 percent of the company's common stock in 1993. **********The two issues have been volatile this year. They have a so-called reset feature, and such securities are considered extremely risky. No later than April 1991, the interest rate on both issues must be reset at a rate that will make the bonds trade at 100 cents on the dollar, and some investors have worried that RJR will be forced to set a prohibitively high rate to achieve that. **********Also, the bonds have moved sharply up and down because they pay investors interest in more securities, not in cash, and these ''pay-in-kind'' bonds are more sensitive to market moves. **********Change in Market's Perception **********By demonstrating that RJR has access to new cash, Kohlberg, Kravis is likely to make it less onerous to reset the interest rate on the bonds. A change in the market's perception could cause investors to drive the prices of the bonds up so that the reset feature becomes less expensive to finance. That, in turn, could make it easier for the company to refinance its $1.2 billion of bank debt that is due next February."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/18/business/business-people-first-interstate-sets-changes-at-the-top.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1990-01-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  First Interstate Sets Changes at the Top", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   First Interstate Sets Changes at the Top", "body_text": " **********First Interstate Bancorp said yesterday that Edward M.

Ryzhkov, the miners' intended effect was to press President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ease their lives by quickly providing them with better pay, better housing and more available goods. Hundreds of thousands of miners displayed their most confrontational attitude yet toward the troubled reform program of Mr. Gorbachev, saying a full-scale walkout would follow if their situation did not improve. **********The militant edge was a reminder of the three-week strike that shut down the mines a year ago in protest against living and working conditions, a crippling walkout costly to the Soviet economy and the Gorbachev leadership's prestige. **********Even before the protest walkout, Mr. Gorbachev charged that it was instigated for political reasons and was not truly the miners' idea. **********Today, miners rallied in the hot sun of the city square here, frequently praising Boris N. Yeltsin, the President of Russia, the largest of the nation's 15 republics, and playing him off against Mr. Gorbachev. The strikers denied that they were motivated by anything but hard times and their desire to prod the Government. **********A Land Defaced **********The one-day protest strike covered the main coal areas of the nation, including the Kuznetsk Basin field here in Siberia, where verdant summer only partly masks great expanses of land gashed by mines and belching factory smokestacks. **********Other mines were idled in the Vorkuta fields inside the Arctic Circle, the Donets Basin fields of the Ukraine and even a few mines on Sakhalin Island far to the Pacific East, said organizers from the Confederation of Labor, a new nationwide workers' movement. **********The scene here, where last summer's strike erupted, was notable for the stronger emphasis on politics and not just economic need, and for the bold new spirit in which workers have begun ordering Communist Party officials to clear out of the mines. **********Weary of the rambling, inconclusive nationwide congress of the Communist Party continuing today in Moscow, the miners denounced the Communists at scores of rallies across the country. Workers at dozens of factories also staged sympathy strikes and rallies with the miners, organizers said. **********Rally participants mocked the party as a ''mere entertainment.'' They smiled at signs that proclaimed: ''No to the diktat of the party! Yes to the diktat of conscience!'' **********But there was no immediate mood to extend the strike, which was estimated to have involved more than 400,000 workers at more than 250 mines in 24-hour shutdowns or part-time sympathy strikes. **********'Hotheads,' Says Gorbachev **********President Gorbachev, in some heated remarks at the party congress in Moscow, contended that the miners had ''not achieved their goal.'' He insisted that the ''hotheads'' in the Kuznetsk Basin fields had failed. The miners here in the fields contradicted him, saying workers in most mines were taking part. **********''In the last year things have gotten worse,'' said Vasily Grinev, a miner for most of the last three decades. ''The food stores are mostly empty again. The politicization of the miners is growing, and that's the biggest change in a year.'' **********The strike today, conducted in a genial, almost holiday atmosphere, was presented as a warning of more intense job stoppages to come unless the Government helps miners improve their housing, food and health care, and frees the mines of central control so that the miners might make better deals directly for themselves. **********''We will be waiting on the action of the Russian Federation Parliament,'' said Aleksei Soloveov, one of the strike leaders, describing the miners' strategy. ''Many of us trust Boris Yeltsin, and he met with the miners and promised to consider our demands immediately in the Parliament.'' **********Counting on Discontent **********While Mr. Yeltsin, as Russian President, has asked for a respite from strikes, he has also been capitalizing on various political movements across the land. The Communist Party continues to stumble, and insurgent forces are seeking a way to coalesce into an opposition. **********The miners say Mr. Yeltsin's goal of making Soviet laws subordinate to the law of the republic fits in with their agenda of decentralizing more economic initiative to workers. **********One of the miners' rallies today reflected the nation's new political habit of instant cult interest in anyone who is denounced by the Kremlin. The rally, in Novokuznetsk, presented the spectacle of miners' hailing Oleg D. Kalugin, a longtime operative in the K.G.B. security police, who has lately joined the ranks of the reformers. He was recently stripped of his job and privileges for telling the public what it already knows: that the K.G.B. remains untrustworthy. **********The miners' demand for the resignation of the Soviet Government has stung Kremlin officials, who were busy a year ago negotiating compromises to end the worst labor unrest in decades. **********Ryzhkov as Scapegoat **********''This is the Government that took measures to solve their problems,'' Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Sunday in condemning the protest along with Mr. Gorbachev. **********The miners are demanding that Mr. Ryzhkov and the rest of the Council of Ministers resign for incompetence, but not Mr. Gorbachev. He is theoretically above the fray, but is actually the national leader under the quasi-parliamentary system. **********A year ago, when his own standing was stronger in the country, Mr. Gorbachev, far from criticizing the striking miners, said they were inspirational for the grass-roots initiative lacking in his reform program. This time, however, the Soviet leader said the ''pushing'' by the miners ''is not acceptable.'' **********The Government-controlled press has been portraying miners as dissatisfied, but with conditions improving. Workers have begun leasing mines now for their own collective management. **********Considerable problems are reported with this new option. But the first results are evident here in the form of some Japanese cars and video equipment received by mines that dealt directly with Japanese companies needing coal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/12/business/a-troubled-winery-where-debt-is-aging.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1607, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Troubled Winery Where Debt Is Aging", "print_headline": "A Troubled Winery Where Debt Is Aging", "body_text": " **********When Paul M. Schlem created the Vintners International Company three years ago by acquiring Paul Masson, Taylor California Cellars and the Taylor Wine Company of New York, he planned to sell assets to reduce debt, cut overhead and move these once- strong brands into the higher end of the market. **********But as it enters the 1990's, the nation's third-largest winery company still has a balance sheet designed in the 1980's and a product mix more appropriate to the 1970's. Debt is about $216 million, more than 16 times the privately held common equity, at a time when banks and Wall Street have turned negative on highly leveraged companies. And more than 90 percent of Vintners' production is inexpensive jug wines, the segment that is suffering a decline in sales even steeper than that of the market as a whole; health-consciousness and shifting tastes are prompting consumers to drink less but better wine. **********Staggering under a heavy debt load, with declining sales of its core products, Vintners must sell major assets if it is to remain solvent, wine industry consultants say. After an aborted move to attract a new minority investor, Vintners has reluctantly put Taylor New York, its only operation not encumbered by mortgages, on the block. **********Mr. Schlem acknowledged Vintners' difficulties, but said they had been blown out of proportion by competitors and disgruntled former executives. ''We're not in dire straits with our financial situation; we just have a huge bank loan,'' said Mr. Schlem, 65 years old, who is Vintners' chairman and chief executive. ''The ratio of debt to equity which was very fashionable in 1987 is now out of vogue.'' By selling Taylor New York and retiring most of the company's bank debt, ''we'll put ourselves in a position that's unassailable,'' he said. **********With 14 million cases of wine sold annually, Vintners trails only the E & J Gallo Winery of Modesto, Calif., the nation's biggest winery by far, and Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. of Britain, which owns Almaden and Inglenook. Vintners' main winery at Gonzales, 125 miles south of San Francisco, is among the most sophisticated in the industry and the Paul Masson and Taylor brand names still enjoy substantial customer recognition in the United States and abroad. **********By selling Taylor New York, which he expects will fetch about $80 million for the brands and operations and about $20 million for inventory, Mr. Schlem said he could pay off nearly all short-term bank debt, leaving about $104 million in mortgages on the California wineries and $12 million in preferred stock. Even then, he said, Vintners will remain the third-largest winery business on the strength of Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars. **********As a closely held company, Vintners is not required to disclose earnings, but Mr. Schlem said the company was marginally profitable on an operating level even after paying debt, and showed a loss of $8.4 million after depreciation in the fiscal year 1989, which ended July 31. It had $247.5 million in revenues. It expects revenues to be flat in the 1990 fiscal year, with an operating profit of $4 million and a net loss of $3 million. **********Loans Called **********Mr. Schlem said the company must sell its New York operation in part because the troubled Bank of New England, Vintners' major lender, is under pressure by Federal regulators to cut back on loans to highly leveraged companies and is calling Vintners' loans. He said it would be hard to replace those loans because in the new climate banks are demanding equity in exchange for loans to such companies, and he is not willing to offer that. **********Mr. Schlem said the New York operation accounted for about $60 million in revenues and was profitable. In addition to about two million cases of its own brands, it bottles several million cases of coolers for Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Inc. under contract. **********Still, wine industry consultants say that the $100 million asking price is a bit rich, and that without the sale Vintners' survival is in question. **********Given the softness of the wine market and the lack of demand for New York State wines outside a few Eastern states, ''who would want a New York facility?'' asked Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based beverage industry consulting firm. ''I don't see how Vintners can sell enough assets to get out of the hole,'' he said. ''I don't think they'll make it through the next harvest.'' **********Paul Gillette, a wine industry consultant and publisher of the Wine Investor, said that the list of potential buyers for such a huge winery was short but that there was interest. (Taylor's operation in Hammondsport, N.Y., has a storage capacity of 23.8 million gallons and a bottling capacity of 44,300 cases a day.) If Vintners can make the sale, Mr. Gillette said, it can probably survive. **********''If Schlem can keep the wolf away from the door, he may be able to go on profitably for some time,'' Mr. Gillette said. ''His situation is critical, but it's not desperate.'' **********A Changing Market **********Besides paying down the debt, Mr. Schlem must complete the tricky task of rehabilitating and repositioning Paul Masson and Taylor California Cellars for a changing market. Not counting coolers, wine sales declined about 10 percent in the 1980's, but generic jug wines, the segment where Taylor and Masson make most of their sales, declined 20 percent. In that environment, the big producers battle for market share, which drives down prices and profit margins. **********The solution is to move up to the one segment still growing - premium, so-called varietal wines. These typically bear the name of a single grape type, like chardonnay, rather than a generic label like chablis. Rarely accomplished successfully, moving a brand ''up market'' involves not only using different grapes but also more attractive packaging, store promotions and advertising to recast the brand's image. **********Such a move is proving difficult for Vintners' brands, because while many consumers know them - who can forget Orson Welles's breathy incantation of ''We will sell no wine before its time'' for Masson - they lack cachet. **********'No One Wants It' **********''In this area, no one asks for Taylor, no one wants it, no one cares, and it's the same thing for Masson - it's a nonentity,'' said David Wilce, manager of Pacific Wine and Spirits, a retailer in Los Gatos, Calif., near the original Paul Masson winery. **********Michael Cliff, who was dismissed as Vintners' chief executive in July 1989, said he had been stymied in efforts to move the brands to the higher end of the market by Mr. Schlem's reluctance to enter the fine wine business. **********''We had a major philosophical difference of opinion on the strategy,'' Mr. Cliff said. While it is difficult to shift a brand from the generic to the premium market, he noted that ''Sebastiani did a very good job doing exactly what I wanted to do.'' Sebastiani is now the largest producer of chardonnay with its Country Chardonnay brand. **********But Mr. Schlem is continuing some of Mr. Cliff's strategies, like the split of Masson's varietal wines into two distinct labels: Paul Masson Vintage Selections, which sell for $4 to $5 for a 750-milliliter bottle, and Masson Vineyards, for 100 percent Monterey County varietals, which sell for $6 to $7. The Masson Vineyards wines have won a number of medals in competition, but to Mr. Schlem's frustration, still go unmentioned by wine critics. **********Plus and Minus **********''The negative is your good restaurants all refuse to take the wine in,'' Mr. Schlem said. ''The positive is the supermarkets all take it. Our focus is on good wines at reasonable prices that the consumer will pick up.'' **********Vintners, which had almost no varietal sales when acquired three years ago, will sell about one million cases this year, and more if white zinfandel is included in the count, Mr. Schlem said. The company also has the largest-selling non-alcoholic wine, St. Regis, at 300,000 cases. **********Vintners has ''a lot of pockets of strength in various niches,'' Mr. Gillette said. ''But Taylor California is iffy.'' **********Coca-Cola created the Taylor California brand from scratch after buying the Taylor Wine Company of New York; it sold all its wine businesses to Seagram, which already owned Masson, in 1983. Mr. Schlem bought the businesses from Seagram in a leveraged buyout. **********One area in which Mr. Schlem has made considerable headway is in reducing overhead. While he retains an office on Park Avenue and a private table at the Four Seasons, the company's headquarters are considerably less lavish than under Seagram. The work force has been trimmed. **********''This is not turnover; I've cut the ranks,'' Mr. Schlem said. ''They were very good people, but too many.'' **********Despite declining sales and general gloom in the wine industry, Mr. Schlem said he has no interest in selling any assets beyond the New York operation and is confident the company will be far more valuable in two years. ''Is business wonderful?'' he said. ''No. But we're ahead of the pack in not losing share this calendar year. It's a wonderful business if you don't weaken.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/13/business/rig-count-dips-in-week.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rig Count Dips in Week", "print_headline": "Rig Count Dips in Week", "body_text": " **********The number of working rigs in the United States dropped by 20 last week, to a total of 1,124, Baker Hughes Inc. reported today.

Frawley 3d, chief of staff at the Schick Shadel Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., obtained a patent this week for an artificial cocaine used in ''aversion therapy'' programs for drug addicts. **********Aversion therapy, long used in treating alcoholics, consists of allowing people to use substances while giving them medications that make them violently ill if they do. The goal is to disrupt the deeply rooted associations between, for example, taking a drink and the ensuing high. **********But aversion therapy for cocaine has not been feasible because the drug is illegal. So Dr. Frawley developed a substitute that resembles cocaine in appearance and smell and creates the same numbing sensation in the nose when snorted. The substitute is a white powder that contains a local anesthetic similar to that used by dentists. It is mixed with quinine and a scenting agent to mimic cocaine's bitter taste and distinctive smell. The substitute does not provide any of cocaine's euphoric feelings, however. **********The substitute is intended for use in conjunction with medications that will induce illness as soon as the substitute is taken.

Repeatedly, John Paul has left no doubt that these rules will remain intact during his papacy. **********If anything, Vatican officials said, the subject of celibacy should arise at the bishops' conference only in the context of how to reinforce the regulation. Their goal would be to help seminary students and priests overcome, as one senior official put it, ''any hidden frailties, poor motivation or deep resistance'' that they may have. **********Nonetheless, church leaders acknowledge that the issue of sex and the clergy cannot be ignored if they are to end a crisis in the recruitment of priests that is especially conspicuous in the United States and Western Europe. It is also a problem, in many poor countries, like those in Africa, where the Catholic Church is growing rapidly but where the ''formation'' of priests lags, partly because the celibacy rule collides with cultural traditions. **********''Some priests question this requirement, and some candidates leave formation for this reason,'' said the synod's working paper, made public in July. ''The problem becomes more serious as priests seek to live in a world characterized by eroticism.'' More broadly, the working paper said, many priests suffer from overwork, loneliness and isolation, ''to the point of becoming deeply demoralized.'' Helping them cope, through improved theologicial and even psychological preparation, is expected to be an important synod topic. **********Archbishop Jan P. Schotte of the Netherlands, who is general secretary of the bishops' gathering, used phrases like ''identity crisis'' and ''burnout'' to describe problems that he said ''priests of all ages seem to suffer.'' **********The Pope ceremonially opened the synod at a Mass today in St. Peter's Basilica, but real sessions do not begin until Monday. He did not mention specific issues he wants discussed. **********The synod is the 11th to be held since such assemblies were created in the 1960's by the Second Vatican Council as a way to enhance the collegiality between the Vatican and the 4,100 bishops who work in the field. **********Although the synod is an important forum for analyzing church problems, it is purely an advisory group to John Paul and has no power to set policy. **********Even though church officials are heartened by a recent increase in the number of men studying for the priesthood, shortages persist. Worldwide, according to the most recent Vatican statistics, there were 401,930 priests in 1988, compared with 406,376 in 1983. **********In the United States, the clergy-lay ratio is more favorable than in many countries - nearly 55,000 priests for an estimated 55 million Catholics. Even so, new diocesan seminarians totaled 4,981 in 1988, roughly half the figure of a decade earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/21/world/upheaval-in-the-east-soviet-union-in-moscow-heated-cry-for-an-opposition.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 976, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Soviet Union;   In Moscow, Heated Cry for an Opposition", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Soviet Union;   In Moscow, Heated Cry for an Opposition", "body_text": " **********Freely debating how to create a viable political opposition, political insurgents from across the country met today in a gathering that presented the most open challenge thus far to the Communist Party's dominance over Soviet public life. **********The dissident meeting, hailed as an evolutionary step toward pluralism in this crisis-ridden one-party state, drew 450 advocates of change from 78 cities and more than 100 local political clubs. **********A measure of the party's increasingly withered role in national life, the conference included ranking theoreticians from within the party and organizers of ad hoc movements who warned that only more rapid democratization could allay increasing national turmoil. **********Some of the more than 2,000 politicians and academic specialists differed quickly on tactics, posing the basic choice of whether to try one last time to change the party from within or abandon it as corrupt and hopeless. **********Liberals to Party Teachers **********But speakers ranging from embattled liberals in the national parliament to intellectuals who teach communism itself to the party rank-and-file were as one in expressing scathing dissatisfaction with the party's continuing hegemony in the face of communism's collapse in Eastern Europe and separatism's increasingly violent rise in the nation's provinces. **********''All we have now is the politics of crawling liberalization,'' said Vyacheslav N. Shostakovsky, the rector of the famous Higher Party School for Communists, who pleaded for a course more moderate than a direct challenge to the current constitutional ban against party pluralism. He proposed demanding of party leaders something of an intramural revolution: honest and open elections by the 90 million party members of the 5,000 delegates who will set the party's future course at the critical party congress due in October. **********Other speakers, however, argued that the party autocracy and its careerist underlings lacked the courage to reduce their role. **********''My conviction is this party cannot be reformed,'' said Yuri N. Afanasyev, a leader of the informal minority opposition in the national parliament who argued that a ''complete break with the Leninist tradition'' was the party's only chance of survival. **********'Breaking Apart Under Our Eyes' **********He proposed a new democratic party, citing the separatist violence in Azerbaijan as only the latest evidence of ''the collapse of the monster, of the artificially created U.S.S.R., which is now breaking apart under our very eyes.'' **********The gathering took some pride, as a measure of opposition progress, in openly discussing democratic socialism as a more attractive alternative to the party, and in openly planning the best strategy for confronting President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. One proposal is to have the informal opposition's most celebrated representative, Boris N. Yeltsin, present the group's program for party democratization as a member of the Central Committee plenum. **********But the dissidents' gathering also was a measure of the hesitant nature of the opposition movement in this nation after 72 years of party rule. A nationwide opposition organization still has not been formally proclaimed even as the East European rebellions have been ending one-party monopoly with a fast vengeance not lost on party leaders in this country. **********''Is not the plenum approach an illusion?'' asked Arkady N. Murashev, a parliamentary deputy. ''We'll just lose more time,'' he said, measuring the October party congress as far too distant to suit the hyperkinetic pace of communism's collapse. **********'Party Is a Criminal' **********Mr. Murashev disclosed that he crossed his own personal Rubicon on Friday when he declined his pending permanent membership in the Communist Party, sensing that the public itself had given up faith in change from within the party. ''The voters would never understand why I joined,'' he said. **********''Do not yield to illusions,'' he said, pleading for a candid attempt at forming a true opposition party, not some amoebic replication. ''The Communist Party is a criminal that cannot be forgiven.'' **********The goal of the two-day conference is to produce a united strategy for confronting the meeting of the party's leadership later this month with a de facto opposition consensus that the party must democratize itself and quickly face the rising popular pressure for political pluralism. **********In often pessimistic remarks, participants complained of President Gorbachev's fervid defense of the party's monopoly and his dominance of the agenda for political change. **********No Cure-All, Gorbachev Warns **********In a speech last week in Lithuania, where the local party has declared itself independent of the national party in Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev said that a multiparty system was ''not a cure-all.'' But he also said, ''I do not see anything tragic about a multiparty system if it emerges and meets the realistic interests of society.'' **********Mr. Shostakovsky, whose school for training the younger party hierarchy has become something of a hotbed for change, said at the conference, ''At least we are beginning to feel our strength and our future possibilities. **********''We are already a democratic part of the party - that's the reality,'' he said. **********Mr. Afanasyev argued that the various democratic-oriented platforms of the local political clubs quietly emerging around the nation amounted to an opposition consensus for permitting democratic factions within the party. **********Should the party rebuff that approach, he said, ''we will speak of the creation of a different party.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/23/world/china-and-saudis-open-diplomatic-relations.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China and Saudis Open Diplomatic Relations", "print_headline": "China and Saudis Open Diplomatic Relations", "body_text": " **********China and Saudi Arabia announced today that they had established diplomatic relations. **********The move has significance for both countries.

Gorbachev has introduced democracy and market economics. **********The elections on Sunday included many races in which numerous candidates competed for one seat. To win, a candidate had to take at least 50 percent of the vote. Thus, many races were thrown into runoffs, which will be held on March 18. **********Outright winners included Boris N.

''That's already progress.'' **********Disadvantages Overcome **********The showing was especially impressive since Rukh was not legally registered in time to field candidates for all races, and was prohibited from publishing its own newspaper in competition with the Communist Party's republic-wide press network. **********The leader of the Byelorussian popular front, Zenon Poznyak, and several other members of that organization won seats in the Byelorussian parliament, despite a concerted campaign by the Communist Party to prohibit them from taking part in the elections. **********Yefrem Y.

American diplomats here dubbed the election ''Slavic super Sunday,'' because the people of the three republics are of Slavic descent. **********Turnout Is Low **********The confusion of voters confronted with scores of candidates and little information - and the mood of disappointment - were reflected in a turnout that was low by Soviet standards. In Moscow fewer than 65 percent of the voters came to the polls. **********As the three republics voted Sunday, the Sajudis independence movement in Lithuania enlarged its majority in the republic's parliament in runoff elections on the same day, clearing the way for a declaration of political independence and gradual disengagement from the Soviet Union. **********The Tass press agency said tonight that after the second round 116 of 141 seats in the Lithuanian aparliament had been filled, enough for a session to convene and consider secession. **********Sajudis candidates have won 90 of the seats, and are expected to move quickly to replace the Communist government of the republic with a nonpartisan executive. **********The parliaments in the three republics have the power to deal with matters affecting the entire republic, while the local councils will deal with local matters like housing and sewers. **********Inroads at Local Level **********While most attention in the three Slavic republics has focused on the parliaments, or supreme soviets, it is at the local level that the insurgents made some of their most intriguing inroads. **********Only 32 of the 498 seats on the Moscow city council were decided in the first round, but leaders of the democratic alliance called Democratic Russia said their candidates had moved into the runoffs with the lead in a solid majority of districts. **********In Leningrad, an opposition group called Democratic Elections '90 predicted that it would win 60 percent of the council seats. **********''At first there will be a victory of democracy in various districts, cities, and republics,'' said Ilya I.

The Communists hold 27 seats. **********Setbacks for Liberal Democrats **********In July, the Socialists and other mainstream opposition parties won the election to the upper house of Parliament by riding a wave of voter resentment over Government corruption, an unpopular sales tax and a scandal over disclosures of extramarital affairs by Sousuke Uno, who resigned as Prime Minister on July 24. **********Since July, many voters say they have become disenchanted with the opposition, and particularly with the Socialist Party's continued questioning of military spending and its refusal to disavow completely its longtime opposition to the United States-Japan security treaty. **********After the defeat in July, the Liberal Democratic Party retained control of the Government by virtue of its majority of 298 seats in the more powerful lower house. **********In the last three years, the party's fortunes have skidded, especially after the enactment in 1988 of a 3 percent sales tax on goods and services that, while accompanied by income-tax cuts and other tax cuts, nonetheless hit hard among the middle class and salaried workers. **********The Government also angered one longtime group of supporters, Japan's farmers, by lowering trade barriers on beef, citrus fruits and other farm imports. **********Mr. Kaifu said today that his party would campaign in favor of the 3 percent sales tax, while promising to reduce it for food, rent, tuition and some other items. **********The opposition reiterated its intention to criticize the sales tax, demanding its repeal, and to accuse the Liberal Democratic Party of corruption and complacency."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/12/business/talking-deals-mci-deal-called-antitrust-test.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1990-04-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 885, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Deals;   MCI Deal Called Antitrust Test", "print_headline": "Talking Deals;   MCI Deal Called Antitrust Test", "body_text": " **********THE agreement by the MCI Communications Corporation to buy Telecom USA Inc. raises several antitrust issues. The Justice Department's response to the $1.25 billion deal, in which the nation's second-largest long-distance company would buy the No. 4 company, is widely seen as a test case of the Bush Administration's antitrust policy. ''If you're going to challenge a merger, this would be the one,'' said a former regulator who asked not to be identified. **********But former Government officials and other experts on the long-distance telephone industry say they doubt that the Justice Department will seek to block the deal. **********The department's reaction may also signal whether the Administration intends to continue the Government's oversight of the telecommunications industry through the judicial system, or instead give a greater role to the Federal Communications Commission. **********MCI says its acquisition of Telecom will increase competition in the $52 billion long-distance market because the acquired assets will make it a more fit competitor to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. MCI seeks only to take business from A.T.& T. and does not try to compete directly with the regional telephone companies, said MCI's president, Bert C. Roberts Jr. The Justice Department declined to comment. **********The department's current merger guidelines, released in 1982, do not require a general review of the Telecom deal. The Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust act does require MCI to give the department 30 days to decide whether to question the takeover. **********The agreement announced on Monday between MCI, with 12 percent of the market, and Telecom, with 1.4 percent, would raise by only 34 points the index the department uses to measure market concentration. The current guidelines call for a review when the move exceeds 50 points in an industry as concentrated as long-distance service, in which A.T.& T. holds two-thirds of the market and U S Sprint has 9 percent. **********But some economists have argued that market concentration indexes should not be applied to industries as heavily regulated as long distance. ''The market shares in this industry are as much a result of regulation as company cost structures,'' said Peter Pitsch, a Washington lawyer and until recently the F.C.C.'s chief of staff. **********Some academics contend that the Justice Department's guidelines underestimate the extent to which small concerns and potential entrants may discourage market leaders from raising prices. By this criterion, the absorption of America's largest regional long-distance company by a market leader is harder to accept, said Alfred E. Kahn, a Cornell University economist and former chairman of the New York Public Service Commission. **********The question raised by Mr. Kahn and other economists and former regulators is whether Telecom, if left alone, could grow into a fourth national competitor. Both MCI and U S Sprint needed more than a decade to become profitable national networks, and there may be cause for concern if these market leaders are then allowed to acquire other businesses trying to follow the same long road, said Eli Noam, a Columbia University economist and New York Public Service Commissioner. **********Telecom's sales have been growing by 25 to 30 percent a year, reaching $713 million last year with earnings of $36.9 million. The company has completed 40 acquisitions since its founding in 1984. It has laid an extensive network of fiber-optic cable in Iowa and the Southeast, and developed several innovative products, like a special calling card that allows users to set up conference calls from any Touch-Tone telephone. **********Telecom has won a strong base among small and medium-sized businesses, and in the last several years has begun to offer 800 numbers and expanded its national services. It is also the keystone of the National Telecommunications Network, a consortium of six of the largest regional carriers that seeks to coordinate their activities. **********Even by the politically sensitive standards of antitrust regulation, the Telecom deal is especially touchy for the Justice Department. On the one hand, the Bush Administration has signaled an interest in increased enforcement of existing statutes, and the Telecom deal is the first large transaction with clear antitrust issues. **********But the F.C.C.'s new chairman, Alfred C. Sikes, and other Government officials have been arguing that the F.C.C. should reassert some of the regulatory authority it lost when the Justice Department and Federal District Judge Harold H. Greene oversaw the breakup of A.T.& T. in 1984. A challenge to the Telecom agreement would put the Justice Department back in the center of telecommunications regulation. **********The Justice Department also has a longstanding interest in the survival of MCI, having shielded it for many years until it grew into a large corporation able to compete with A.T.& T. In the end, the Justice Department may find itself hamstrung by its commitment to the current merger guidelines, Mr. Kahn said. For this reason, he said, a challenge to the Telecom agreement would be a hard case to win in court."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/28/business/cftc-role-is-seen-at-risk.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 249, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C.F.T.C.

Four experts give their views. **********Ara K. Hovnanian **********President, K. Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., Red Bank, N.J. **********There seems to be a little more activity in the housing market because seller prices are coming into line and developers' prices are too. I think we have probably hit bottom. I don't know if we can say the market is on its way up yet, but buyers are beginning to realize there are real deals out there. **********For the first half of this year we expect the current situation to remain without much change. However, we believe that when the market does begin to recover, particularly in the Northeast and California, there will be a steady upward ratcheting of prices. I don't know if the recovery will happen in 6, 2, or 12 months. But once it happens, it will turn rapidly and we will see a real strong market. Real estate is cyclical. When people start selling, they also start buying and then the market accelerates. **********Lyle E. Gramley **********Chief economist, Mortgage Bankers Association, Washington. **********It would be a mistake to make too much out of this number. The November figures are in part a consequence of the earthquake in California. But even so, the picture for new-home sales is improving modestly. **********Those stories about an impending collapse of the residential real estate market were overblown. An impending collapse was wrong and that's what this upturn tells us. No one doubts that the housing market is different from what it was a decade ago. Prices are not rising as fast, the demographics are different, rental space was overbuilt and housing is now responding differently to lower interest rates. **********If interest rates continue to move down, as I think they will, then there will be further improvement. But the current 710,000 annual rate for new-home sales is higher than can be sustained. **********David F. Seiders **********Chief economist, National Association of Homebuilders, Washington. **********We are looking for a flat period in all of single-family housing through the middle of this year and then a gradual improvement. Those new-home sales figures do jog around a bit. But all of the single housing numbers for November were solid. **********The one place where the numbers signal something really fundamental is the Northeast. We have been forecasting a bottoming out in that market and a resurgence in the Northeast in housing starts, new sales and sales of existing homes. We see confirmation now that it has bottomed out and we're looking for a gradual upturn throughout the year and into 1991 in that market. **********Francis Schott **********Chief economist, Equitable Life Assurance Society. **********This upturn in housing has been part of my forecast and it's why I don't think we'll have a recession. A decline in mortgage rates has happened - so you can get a fixed-rate mortgage below 10 percent - and it created the turnaround. Housing starts looked poor before the Fed eased. There was pent-up demand as people adjusted to higher rates and the lower rates now are making a difference. **********I am convinced that interest rates will go down further until mid-1990. I think the signs are clear that new home starts will be at the 1.5 million rate, seasonably adjusted, for most of 1990 with a possibility of going even higher. In the fourth quarter of 1989, we had the bottoming out of new-home sales. **********The downward adjustment with rising interest rates has ended. The market won't be buoyant, but it will have stability with a little updrift through 1990."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/31/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-sega-commercials-take-on-nintendo.html": {"writer_name": "Kim Foltz", "pub_date": "1990-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Sega Commercials Take On Nintendo", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING - ADDENDA;   Sega Commercials Take On Nintendo", "body_text": " **********Sega of America, a maker of video games, will begin a campaign next week that takes a hit at rival Nintendo of America. **********The spots show the action on Sega's Genesis sports video games, like Joe Montana's Football and Michael Jackson's Moonwalker as an announcer tells viewers: ''You can't do this on Nintendo.''

Manuel Antonio Noriega was removed from power. **********The Panamanians say the current laws and the new Government are more than adequate to prevent such abuses. American law-enforcement officials and legislators are concerned that the new Government and the country's appetite for foreign investment will actually lead to even greater use of Panamanian financial institutions to conceal illicit drug profits. **********Edgardo Lasso Valdes, the president of the Panamanian banking association and one of the country's seven banking commissioners, said in an interview: ''The only problem of money laundering in Panama is the newspapers that mention that Panama is a big money-laundering center. , To be honest, we don't feel there is any problem.'' **********But a senior State Department official here, who asked not to be identified, said the existing laws ''are grossly inadequate'' to prevent money laundering, a process in which illegally earned profits are deposited in bank accounts or legitimate businesses, then withdrawn as ''clean money.'' He said the United States was strongly urging Panama to revise them. **********A Growing Tension **********In interviews in recent days, local banking regulators, senior Panamanian officials and United States officials demonstrated through their comments a growing tension between the two nations over the money-laundering issue. A fight appears likely in Congress over a proposed $1 billion aid package for Panama. **********An extensive review of Panamanian banking records and court documents shows that many senior leaders in the Government, while never accused of money laundering, have had strong ties to corrupt banks. Several of the banks have been indicted for money laundering or been shut because of pressure from the United States. **********The nation's new President, Guillermo Endara, has for years been a director of a Panamanian bank used extensively by Colombia's Medellin drug traffickers. **********Guillermo (Billy) Ford, the Second Vice President and chairman of the banking commission, is a part owner of the Dadeland Bank of Florida, which was named in a court case two years ago as a central financial institution for one of the biggest Medellin launderers, Gonzalo Mora. **********Rogello Cruz, the new Attorney General, has been a director of the First Interamericas Bank, owned by Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, one of the bosses of the Cali drug gang in Colombia. **********There is no evidence that President Endara, Vice President Ford, Mr. Cruz or other current leaders were aware of or involved with the illegal operations carried out at the banks to which they have ties. But officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice Department say the business connections and friendships make it difficult to believe that any real crackdown against money laundering is likely. **********American law-enforcement officials said they had evidence that Panamanian banks were used to launder money through the waning hours of the administration of General Noriega, who is awaiting trial in Miami on drug and money-laundering charges. And though most of General Noriega's senior aides remain either fugitives or in jail, all the bankers with whom they are said to have dealt remain in key positions. **********''I'm very concerned about it,'' said Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has held extensive hearings on money laundering and the use of Panamanian banks. ''This is the moment to do something - but it now appears that not enough is being done.'' Long History of Aiding Money Launderers Panama's secrecy laws and tax breaks for foreign depositors, coupled with the country's proximity to cocaine production and trafficking in the Andes, have long made banks here a kind of hidden tub for cleaning dirty money. **********In a recent interview, President Endara acknowledged that the success of Panama's financial center in the 1970's and 1980's was a result of the Latin American drug cartels. **********Increased pressure is now on the nation's banks, whose foreign deposits have fired rapid economic growth for two decades, to lure back more foreign investors, many of whom had left during the turmoil of recent months. Illegalities Aid G.N.P.  The financial community represents as much as 15 percent of the Panamanian economy, according to Government figures. Last year, the gross national product was estimated at $1.76 billion, and virtually all economists agree that laundered drug money, arms sales and other illicit income have played a large role in the accumulation of that wealth. **********The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama in 1988 in an attempt to halt money laundering. As a result some banks were forced to freeze some deposits, and some banks failed. Until the sanctions, Panamanian authorities would occasionally seize assets of suspected accounts but would generally not provide information to law-enforcement authorities. **********Merchants from Colon, on the Atlantic coast about 50 miles north of Panama City, said one common way of laundering money was the purchase of large amounts of clothes with millions of dollars in drug profits. The clothes are then shipped to Colombia and sold for Colombian pesos, which are deposited in local banks. Hidden Bank Accounts And Secrecy Laws But the strongest attraction for money launderers appears to be Panama's hidden bank accounts. **********The bank secrecy laws permit a depositor to sue a bank if confidential information is disclosed, and prosecutors can also bring criminal charges against the banker who, without authorization, provides information about an account. Panama also has corporate secrecy protection that enables the founder or founders of a business to keep their identity secret. **********Talks on Cooperation **********Negotiations have been under way to forge an agreement of cooperation between Panamanian and American law-enforcement authorities, following a preliminary agreement signed last month by the Panamanian Government and the State Department. **********Nonetheless, the widely held view among drug officials is that as banking restrictions imposed during the period of United States sanctions are lifted over the next four months, illegal profits will again pour into many of the country's 110 banks. **********''Given the chaos and general turmoil of the country following the invasion, there is now an excellent opportunity for organized crime and the cocaine cartels to step back in,'' said James E. Preston, an Arizona prosecutor who has spent recent months on a Federal grant studying international money laundering. **********President Endara has said he sees no need for any significant banking-law changes and so does not expect any. The National Banking Commission, which regulates banks, is dominated by local and international bankers, many of whom agree with the President and Mr. Lasso that the magnitude of the drug problem has been exaggerated. Feelings of Resentment Over U.S. Pressure Disputing reports by the Drug Enforcement Administration and other people at the Justice Department, the new Finance Minister, Mario Galindo, said in an interview that there was no money-laundering problem in Panama. Many bankers and some officials expressed resentment over pressure by the United States to alter the banking system. **********Mr. Lasso, who is also general manager of the Panamanian branch of the International Bank of Costa Rica, said it was hypocritical of United States officials to be citing Panamanian banks. He said the punishment meted out recently in the two largest drug money-laundering cases in the United States shows that American officials themselves are not particularly tough on money laundering. **********The settlements were of $5 million over four years in the case of Banco de Occidente and $14 million for Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Both banks admitted in courts that their Panamanian branches were used extensively to launder drug money. **********''How can you ask us to break a bank in Panama when all they do in the U.S. is pay a fine?'' Mr. Lasso asked. ''We don't understand it. It gives us some doubts.'' **********Reputable Banks Driven Out **********The economic sanctions have driven out some of the more reputable international banks, and many of those left continue to be found to have drug ties, knowingly or not. Testimony in one recent case tied a third of the banks to laundering operations for drug money. Most of those banks were used not as points at which customers would deposit cash but rather as places to which launderers in the United States would electronically transfer funds for deposit. **********Virtually all those banks remain in operation today, and none were prosecuted for laundering. **********''There are already laws here on the books that make money laundering illegal,'' said a senior banker who has been in Panama for more than 20 years and now works at a large Asian bank in Panama City. ''But the laws have only been as good as the people who enforce them.'' Important Banking Ties Of Top Panama Officials It is difficult to find any senior officials here who do not have important ties to banks. **********President Endara has for years been a director of Banco Interoceanico de Panama, one of the two dozen Panamanian banks named in a case based on a Federal Bureau of Investigation case code-named Cashweb/Expressway. F.B.I. agents posing as money launderers were given large amounts of cash in that case by Colombians in the United States who instructed them to transfer the funds to these 24 banks. **********Mr. Endara, a corporate lawyer before becoming President, is a close friend of Carlos Eleta, a Panamanian businessman who was arrested in Atlanta in April on charges of conspiring to set up a major cocaine smuggling ring. Released on bail, he is now awaiting trial. **********The families of First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon and the Finance Minister, Mr. Galindo, are also heavily involved in banking.

Mr. Menem managed to retain the support of the unions working for private business, but he lost that of the public employee unions. **********Opposition also mounted from party leaders not directly involved in his Government, particularly the powerful group led by Antonio Cafiero, the Governor of Buenos Aires Province and the party president. But two weeks ago Mr. Menem and Mr. Cafiero buried some of their differences. **********The Peronist leadership also called for a ''national truce'' and appealed for broad help in facing the economic crisis. This appeal was directed mainly at the Radical Civic Union, the party led by former President Raul Alfonsin. **********Mr. Menem's main hope seems to be to win the backing of the Governor of Cordoba Province, Eduardo Angeloz, the Radicals' presidential candidate against Mr. Menem. Mr. Angeloz, in his campaign, argued for policies similar to those of Mr. Menem, but he has so far refused to back the Government unless Mr. Alfonsin and the entire Radical leadership go along. **********But Mr. Alfonsin is still bitter over the fact that Peronists opposed his own unsuccessful efforts to reform the economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-shrinking-supplies-of-food-evident-in-iraq-reports-say.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1990-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   Shrinking Supplies of Food Evident in Iraq, Reports Say", "print_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   Shrinking Supplies of Food Evident in Iraq, Reports Say", "body_text": " **********While the American-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia continues, another weapon, the withholding of food for Iraq under the United Nations trade embargo, is beginning to cause hardship, a variety of reports from officials of Western governments and food experts say. **********The Iraqi leadership is struggling to cope with shrinking supplies and an abrupt cutoff of imported food that, until the crisis, was fulfilling three-quarters of the country's nutritional needs. Eggs, sugar, cooking oil, fruits and vegetables have disappeared from store shelves in Baghdad or are in short supply, according to reports from the Iraqi capital that were confirmed by American Government officials. **********Food imports from Jordan, the only neighboring state not to have fully committed to barring trade with Iraq, have not kept up with Iraqi consumption. And even these supplies may be dwindling as ships with Iraqi-bound cargos are being discouraged by United States Navy vessels from entering the Jordanian port of Aqaba, said a State Department official who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ''The clear impression is that they are running down their food supplies,'' he said. **********One possible source of food for Iraq is Iran, which President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is wooing by returning lands occupied in their eight-year war and by releasing Iranian prisoners. But Iran has so far shown no interest in actively helping Iraq, and in any case, routes between the countries are not adequate to support the large food shipments Iraq needs, grain industry experts say. **********Mr. Hussein has exhorted his people to eat less, threatening to limit the food that foreign residents receive and announcing that merchants who hoard supplies will be sentenced to death. **********'I Think They Can Make It' **********But it remains unclear how quickly the pressure of the embargo will mount and at what point it might induce the Iraqi government to come to terms with those blocking its supplies. ''I don't think hunger is going to make the regime capitulate,'' said Daniel Pipes, the director of the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. ''Unless we start bombing bridges and factories, there will be hardship but I think they can make it.'' **********Iraq's people are among the better fed in the Middle East, and their food supplies could last months with rationing, Mr. Pipes said. Farmers could also plant more grain for human consumption and less for animal feed next spring. Iraq has indicated that its soldiers may be fed before civilians. **********President Hussein does not appear to have anticipated an embargo on food before his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, said John P. Parker, a Department of Agriculture economist who studies Middle Eastern food supplies. While Iraq dramatically increased its food stockpiles on the eve of its 1980 invasion of Iran, these stockpiles fell every year from 1984 to 1990 and had reached unusually low levels by July 25, he said. **********Because Iraq's population was growing in this period, the food supply for each person fell and the country was left with only a two-month supply of wheat as of July, Mr. Parker said. **********Reports by people who fled from Kuwait after the country was overrun say Iraqi soldiers began asking local residents for food. ''It was like the old method of sending armies foraging for food on the ground they occupy,'' said a Kuwaiti businessman in a telephone conversation from Saudi Arabia, where he arrived four days after the invasion. **********Some Stores Looted in Kuwait **********The average Iraqi may notice shortages of sugar and tea first, he said. ''They drink a lot of tea, and heavy tea. It's like triple the amount of tea Westerners use, and that, of course, means you need a lot of sugar.'' **********An executive of a multinational corporation with employees trapped in Baghdad said yesterday that ''there is a shortage of certain food items,'' including eggs. The executive spoke only on the condition that neither he nor his company be identified. **********Many stores in Kuwait were looted immediately after the invasion but others kept their shelves stocked, said Katherine C. Baker, an American store manager who escaped from Kuwait on Aug. 12. She said the banks were closed, she had little money and lived on potatoes, rice and pasta. **********The amount of food seized by Iraq from Kuwait is unclear but may prove important, the State Department official said. The Kuwaiti businessman said his country had enough canned goods stored in warehouses to feed its population for four to six months, and Iraqi soldiers took over these warehouses and sent Kuwaiti employees home soon after the invasion. **********But the canned goods may not feed Iraq for long. In 1987, Kuwait had 1.87 million people; Iraq's population was 16.1 million in 1986. **********U.S. Supplies Had Been Cut **********The United States cut subsidized food shipments to Iraq in half last year because of a financial scandal involving Government credit guarantees and an Italian bank, and Iraq had not found alternative suppliers. **********The United Nations sanctions allow food shipments to Iraq and Kuwait to relieve famine only. The United States and the world's other major grain producers have said famine is not yet a problem. The American naval blockade includes food. **********President Hussein's current predicament has been compounded by the failure of Iraqi agriculture to surmount problems like infertile land and inadequate irrigation. **********Effects of Fabled Rivers **********Two large rivers flow through Iraq, the Tigris and Euphrates, and their banks were the breadbasket of the Middle East in ancient times. Nearly five thousand years ago, the Sumerians built one of the world's first great civilizations there, while the wealth of the court of Harun ar-Rashid, an eighth-century caliph of Baghdad, was described in the famous work of Arab literature, ''Thousand and One Nights.'' **********But in the 12th century, the fields of Iraq became dry and less fertile after the Tigris began flowing faster and dug itself a deep channel instead of periodically flooding and distributing rich silt over the fields, said Engin D. Akarli, an associate professor of Middle Eastern history at Washington University in St. Louis. **********Most of Kuwait is desert, and with the exception of some vegetables grown in greenhouses and limited shrimp fishing, the nation depends on imported food, Mr. Parker said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/26/business/company-news-bp-in-accord-on-coal-unit-sales.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  B.P. in Accord On Coal Unit Sales", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   B.P. in Accord On Coal Unit Sales", "body_text": " **********The British Petroleum Company said it had reached an agreement to sell substantially all its remaining United States coal operations to the Zeigler Coal Holding Company for $115 million.

Milken to absorb the shock. **********Throughout a morning of mounting drama in Room 318 at the Federal Court House at Foley Square, probably no one had an inkling there would be the electrifying theater that resulted, for probably no one imagined a magic number as high as 10 years. All that many in the audience could do was squirm and gasp. **********When United States District Judge Kimba M. Wood gave her pronouncement -- 10 years in prison, 3 years probation -- she ended the long, tortured case against what has been viewed as the biggest scalp in the Wall Street investigations. **********She also ended a long morning that began shortly after dawn as members of the press and onlookers blanketed the Court House steps, hoping for pictures and glimpses of the financial wizard, maybe the last for a while.  'Hey, Junk Bond Man' **********Wearing a gray suit, the 44-year-old Mr. Milken and his wife, Lori, arrived in a Lincoln Town Car at 9:30. He stepped out first, turned and waited for his wife, then gave her his hand. He strode up the steps looking straight ahead, never heeding the repeated cries of, \"Hey, junk bond man\" and \"Yo, Michael, baby. Look this way.\" **********Up in the squarish courtroom, a packed house of nearly 200 people listened patiently to an hourlong plea by Arthur L. Liman, Mr. Milken's attorney. In large part, it was a reading of letters from people touched by Mr. Milken. There was one from a new employee who was so afraid of work she thought of jumping off a chair and breaking her legs so she could stay home. But Mr. Milken soothed her. **********Mr. Liman mentioned the $360 million Mr. Milken had given away. He mentioned he had volunteered to be a math teacher. And he confessed that he wasn't a psychiatrist and, \"I can't offer an explanation for how Michael slipped.\" **********All Mr. Milken wanted to be remembered for, Mr. Liman said, was that he \"made a difference to the children in the inner city.\" **********Jess Fardella, an assistant United States attorney, took just 10 minutes to stress the prosecution's belief that Mr. Milken did not resemble anything like an angel and that his crimes were worthy of heavy-duty punishment.  Indication of a Surprise **********It was during the 27 minutes of prefatory remarks by Judge Wood that one got the impression that a surprise was in the offing. She emphasized that she did not buy the argument that Mr. Milken had committed \"subtle\" and \"technical\" crimes. She said one had to wonder whether he calculatedly chose to commit crimes that would be hard to detect. She underscored the fact that Mr. Milken had not yet cooperated with the Government in its inquiries, something that could win a more lenient term. **********Mr. Milken had sat as a silent enigma throughout an eight-day special hearing preceding the sentencing. He sobbed audibly during part of Mr. Liman's plea yesterday, but spoke only a few choked-up words of apology before the sentence was announced. He stood stoical, listening to the sentence, though there was no escaping the feeling that here was a beaten man. **********After the sentence was announced, the spectators were divided in their impressions. \"Brutal,\" exclaimed one grizzled man. \"That's a long time to go up the river.\" **********\"I don't know why one man should take all the heat of the battle,\" a middle-aged woman said. \"What about the politicians taking bribes? How about them letting kids buy houses in New Jersey for 10 percent down. It used to be 25 or 30 percent. Why just stick it to this man?\"  A Decade of Greed **********But there were people hoping for a verdict condemning a decade of greed. A young woman wearing a ponytail insisted that \"even 28 years would not have been enough.\" **********Rebecca Gessler brought a curious perspective to the sentencing. She was covering the event for her reporting class at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. Before enrolling at Columbia, however, she had worked for a firm that had been hired to perform economics research for Mr. Milken's attorneys. From January through August, she and colleagues inspected every transaction that Mr. Milken's department executed, searching for foul play. She said the work was absolutely no fun. **********\"When I was working there, my opinion was that what he did wasn't as bad as the prosecutors made it out to be,\" Ms. Gessler said. \"But now that I've been away from it, I feel a little different. I was shocked by the sentence. But I feel the crimes seem to warrant a long sentence.\" **********Martin Klein, a lawyer and longtime friend of Mr. Milken, was indignant and quick to share his views. \"Obviously, it's a miscarriage of justice,\" he said. \"I think the judge may have been reacting to the hundreds of people here and is making Michael a scapegoat for the excesses of the 1980's.\" **********\"He's a good person and a strong person, and he will survive,\" Mr. Klein went on. \"Unfortunately, the country will be deprived of his talents for a long time.\"  Betting on the Sentence **********Many gambling pools were formed around the magic number. One young woman felt miserable that she had put her money on five years. Only her boss had picked 10, she said, \"and we all thought she did that because she was ignorant.\" **********As the lunch hour neared, hundreds of people waited outside to witness Mr. Milken's departure. An hour ticked by without anyone more newsworthy appearing than a troop of third graders who had dropped by to see a swearing-in ceremony. **********Then someone came up with a reasonable answer. Mr. Milken had abruptly wised up and was upstairs finally spilling all to the Government. All over Wall Street, hundreds of people were being fingered. **********Among those impatiently listening to such theories was Enid Adler, a lawyer from Philadelphia who said she was engaged in a class-action suit against Mr. Milken. She clasped a small Nikon. \"After poring through thousands and thousands of documents, I think I'm entitled to a photo,\" she said. **********But in the end, Ms. Adler and the throng were disappointed. Mr. Milken had ducked out the back."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/14/business/ex-judge-named-to-study-action-under-asbestos-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 840, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Judge Named to Study Action Under Asbestos Plan", "print_headline": "Ex-Judge Named to Study Action Under Asbestos Plan", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge in Brooklyn took the first steps yesterday toward carrying out a national plan for resolving asbestos personal injury cases. Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said that he had appointed Marvin E. Frankel, a former Federal judge, as a special master to conduct hearings on part of the plan. **********Vowing that a class action would not take years to resolve as others have required, Judge Weinstein said Judge Frankel would begin a proceeding tomorrow that could lead to the national resolution of tens of thousands of asbestos cases. **********Judge Frankel will determine whether a class action would be warranted in thousands of cases against Eagle-Picher Industries. To recommend approval of a class action, Judge Frankel must find that Eagle-Picher's assets are so limited that a verdict in favor of some plaintiffs would hurt others. **********He said in an interview following the hearing that he would begin his examination tomorrow at Federal court in Brooklyn, when he meets with lawyers to narrow the issues and set up a schedule for hearings and fact-finding about the financial condition of Eagle-Picher, a Cincinnati-based maker of consumer and industrial products that made wide use of asbestos. He added that he expected to complete the task no later than Sept. 10. **********A lawyer for the company, Arvin Maskin, told the court yesterday that Eagle-Picher was now facing 65,000 asbestos cases, with thousands more being filed monthly, and legal bills of more than $100 million a year. **********An order endorsed by 10 Federal judges last Friday consolidates many of the cases into a series of proposed class actions that would be supervised by Judge Weinstein and two other judges, Thomas D. Lambros of Cleveland and Robert M. Parker of Tyler, Tex. **********The arrangement was reached after lawyers for many asbestos victims sought a class action before Judge Parker, who has a reputation among lawyers for favoring plaintiffs. Judge Weinstein originally called for a nationwide consolidation that set off the skirmish among judges and lawyers last month for class actions. Many of the plaintiffs' lawyers, recalling an order by Judge Weinstein when he supervised the Agent Orange class action brought by Vietnam veterans, feared that a nationwide consolidation exclusively before him would result in a huge slashing of their fees. **********Several judges and lawyers have said that as much as two-thirds of the money companies have been spending to resolve asbestos cases had been going for lawyers' fees and other legal expenses. **********The Judges' Plan **********Under the judges' plan, Judge Lambros will attempt a nationwide settlement, while Judge Parker will try cases that do not settle. Judge Weinstein has told colleagues and friends that he agreed to the arrangement because he is not convinced that the broader class actions would withstand appellate review. **********The judge said that he expects to supervise class actions against a half-dozen asbestos companies with sharply limited money and pool their resources to cut down on enormous legal costs. He also said he was considering the appointment of Bertram Harnett as a special master who would examine the insurance coverage of Eagle-Picher and other companies that move to have their cases consolidated. Justice Harnett retired from the New York State Supreme Court in 1977. Judge Frankel, Justice Harnett and Judge Weinstein have known each other since they studied together at Columbia Law School, graduating in 1948. **********At the hearing yesterday, two plaintiffs' lawyers expressed reservations about the use of a class action, but stopped short of outright rejection. One of the lawyers, Gene Locks of Philadelphia, said that a class action would not succeed in quick relief for asbestos victims but instead would result in more money being spent ''on needless transaction costs.'' He said it would be more beneficial if Eagle-Picher went into bankruptcy. **********Eagle-Picher Claim Questioned **********The other lawyer, Stanley Levy of New York, said he was not convinced that Eagle-Picher actually had limited resources, an issue that will have to be determined by Judge Frankel. The two plaintiffs' lawyers met with Judge Weinstein privately after the hearing. **********Judge Weinstein said that more than 250 cases arising partly out of work at the Brooklyn Navy Yard more than 25 years ago would probably not be tried before October; he had hoped for trial in early September. **********Settlement is expected by early September of 265 Brooklyn Navy Yard cases, Kenneth R. Feinberg, a Washington lawyer appointed by the court to reach a settlement, said yesterday. Attempting to persuade the defendants in those cases to settle, Judge Weinstein said any payments that they made would be taken into consideration in the class action proceedings before Judge Lambros and Judge Parker."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/31/world/nicaragua-set-to-free-foes-under-general-pardon.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1990-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 709, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nicaragua Set to Free Foes Under General Pardon", "print_headline": "Nicaragua Set to Free Foes Under General Pardon", "body_text": " **********The Nicaraguan Government began work today on a final list of more than 1,000 rebel supporters and former National Guardsmen who are to be released next month under a general pardon for imprisoned opponents of the Sandinista Government. **********The release, announced Monday by President Daniel Ortega Saavedra, is expected to free most, if not all, of the Government opponents still in prison. It was described by Sandinista officials as a gesture of good will during the campaign that is to culminate in national elections here on Feb. 25. **********''We hope that when the elections are carried out, these prisoners will be with their families and integrated into the pacification process,'' Mr. Ortega said. **********The release of political opponents of the Government has been a longstanding demand of opposition groups and has often been tied to regional negotiations over the disbandment of contra rebel base camps in Honduras. But despite years of intense diplomacy and bargaining, the contra army has remained intact, and the prisoner issue has remained unresolved. **********New Appeal on Bases **********In his comments about the release, which he said is to be carried out between Feb. 5 and Feb. 15, President Ortega recalled the stalemate over demobilization, and urged the United States and Honduras to dismantle the contra bases, which are still believed to contain as many as 10,000 armed fighters. **********''With this step, the Nicaraguan Government is not only fulfilling 100 percent of its commitments, but overfulfilling them,'' Mr. Ortega said, speaking to gathered members of the diplomatic corps in Managua. **********Government officials said the final list of the prisoners to be released would not be ready for submission to the Sandinista-controlled National Assembly, which must approve it, until Thursday. But they said the decree would cover more than 1,000 imprisoned contras or contra supporters as well as the 39 members of the National Guard of the country's former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who remain in prison. **********At the height of the contra war, the number of prisoners held for their opposition to the Sandinista Government reached as high as 5,000, human rights officials say. Opposition groups have repeatedly accused the Government of concealing the existence of what they allege are thousands more political prisoners still being held. **********Large Groups Freed **********But in recent years, Sandinista leaders have freed several large groups of prisoners in special pardons, such as one last March when 1,894 former National Guardsmen were released. Officials of international organizations that have done extensive investigations of prison populations and conditions here say they are satisfied that the number of prisoners being discussed by the Government include all, or nearly all, of the remaining prisoners. **********''I think it includes virtually everybody,'' said Juan Mendez, an official of Americas Watch, one of the human rights groups that has carefully monitored Nicaraguan prisons. **********Human rights groups have taken a cautious attitude about blanket pardons for all prisoners involved in anti-Government activities, arguing that those found guilty of particularly heinous crimes should be distinguished from common prisoners of war. **********But human rights groups, church officials and other foreign experts have questioned the legal proceedings against many prisoners accused of anti-Government activities. International groups, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, had specifically recommended the release of the remaining National Guard prisoners. **********''As far as we can tell,'' Mr. Mendez said, ''all of the National Guard people had been subjected to an unfair trial early on, and therefore required a new trial or an early release, and since they had already served 10 years, we thought they should be released.'' **********In mid-December, the Government also approved a pardon for 464 former members of the Sandinista People's Army and security forces who had been convicted of crimes or human rights violations.

But there are so many things we don't know and will never know or understand.'' **********On the streets of Boise, friends and neighbors echo Mrs. Ronneburg's feelings. ''We're all very frustrated,'' said Mayor Dirk A. Kempthorne. ''But there is an acknowledgment that you must not negotiate with terrorists.

Asking for Bush himself to come would have been too presumptuous, but the Assistant Secretary was no big deal.'' **********Ms. Kelly said she believed the United States was directing the Syrians to act as its agents. ''I think this was a missed opportunity,'' she said, ''and I think the President has egg on his face.'' **********At the Sav-On Cafe, Frank B.

There is the buzz of talk on cellular phones on her porch. Portable toilets have been set up on the street. There are discussions about flipping a coin to see who will interview her for what broadcast. **********For Two, Escape From Beirut **********In the tiny home she shares with Jesse's stepfather, Eugene Ronneburg, a long-haul trucker, Mrs. Ronneburg slowly spreads on the coffee table recent photos of Joanna, the granddaughter she has never met. **********The child, born 5 months after the kidnapping, will be 3 years old in June. She is shown in sunglasses splashing in a pink plastic tub and in the Lebanese dress of her mother, Badr Turner. Mother and child fled Beirut last May and live in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, with her mother's relatives. Mrs. Ronneburg only met Badr once, in Greece in 1986. **********Jesse and Badr met when he was an associate professor of mathematics and computer sciences at Beirut University College and she was the mathematics department's secretary. **********Pictures of a blond teen-ager with cropped hair contrast starkly with recent photographs of Mr. Turner with a beard.

Seymore, the 47-year-old executive editor of People magazine, another Time Warner publication. **********The move appeared to be intended to redirect the four-month-old publication, which has received mixed reviews from subscribers and advertisers, toward more of a middle American audience and to bring it into the mainstream of Time Warner's magazine group. **********According to company employees, who spoke yesterday on the condition that they not be identified, Mr. Jarvis wanted tough reviews and offbeat subjects to have a prominent place in the magazine, which covers videos, movies, books, music and television. **********More Personality Driven **********But the senior managemers of the magazine group - Jason McManus, the editor in chief; Richard B. Stolley, editorial director, and Gilbert Rogin, the corporate editor - are said to prefer a more personality-driven publication. **********The appointment of Mr. Seymore from People magazine, which has enjoyed great success by chronicling the lives of celebrities, suggests that Entertainment Weekly will now take a less irreverent approach. Mr. Seymore declined to be interviewed. **********''Management wants more celebrity coverage and a more mainstream magazine,'' said one employee at Time Warner, adding that the magazine's staff was ''shell-shocked'' by Mr. Jarvis's departure. **********Along with Michael Klingensmith, the publisher of Entertainment Weekly, Mr. Jarvis, 35, was the driving force behind the magazine. He first proposed the idea in 1984, while he was a television critic at People. **********''I spent six years working on it,'' Mr. Jarvis said in an interview yesterday. ''I am very disappointed. Of course, I am.'' He declined to comment further. **********Peter Castiglio, a Time Warner spokesman, said only that there had been ''creative differences'' between Mr. Jarvis and senior management. **********According to company employees, one clash involved the magazine's review of the movie ''Pretty Woman.'' The magazine group's management was not pleased when Entertainment Weekly panned the movie, which was a box-office success. **********At the outset, executives of the magazine group had promised Mr. Jarvis and Mr. Klingensmith a free rein, believing this worked better than a bureaucratic, corporate approach. But the employees described an increasingly tense situation in which top management had become steadily more involved in the day-to-day operations, to make sure the magazine proved a success. **********The magazine is the first introduced since Time's merger with Warner, which left the company with about $10.6 billion in debt. Media analysts believe the company has been acutely preoccupied with the magazine's success because Time's last big effort, TV-Cable Week, cost the company more than $45 million when it closed in 1983. **********Picture Week, a black-and-white news and photo magazine, was abandoned in 1986 after test-marketing and a $30 million investment by Time. Time Warner has spent an estimated $40 million to test market and introduce Entertainment Weekly. **********Circulation at 600,000 **********Mr. Castiglio said that Entertainment Weekly was doing well, with a circulation of 600,000, including subscribers and newsstand sales, and that advertising was running ''ahead of schedule.'' Mr. Klingensmith said he was ''increasingly satisfied'' with the publication and predicted that it would ''go on and prosper.'' **********But Peter P. Appert, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., said, ''This is a very difficult advertising environment for magazines, and I believe Entertainment Weekly is off to a rough start.'' **********Advertising at many leading magazines has been down at least 10 percent this year. **********''The future has to be cloudy,'' said Bob Zach of Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. ''When there are so many changes in so short a time, you have to ask whether they are focused on where they are going. Such turmoil does not sit well with the advertising community, which tends to be conservative about where it puts its money.'' **********The magazine's design has already changed once since introduction, after widespread criticism that its different graphics, typefaces, column sizes and print colors made the publication cluttered and hard to read. Moreover, initial covers on K. D. Lang, the country-and-western singer, and books on Vietnam, which were criticized as too esoteric, have given way to more recent covers featuring the movie star Tom Cruise and the rock star Madonna. **********The Jury Is Still Out **********''The magazine has improved,'' said Joseph Ostrow, media director at Foote, Cone & Belding Communications, the advertising agency. ''It was too downtown and too young in tone. It looks a lot more like a Time magazine now, and I'm comfortable with that.'' But he added that ''the jury is still very much out.'' **********But Entertainment Weekly faces tough competition from the News Corporation's Premiere and Arrow Publishers Inc.'s Rolling Stone. Analysts said doubts still hanging over the magazine included whether the public would adopt a single publication for news on media and entertainment products, and whether it could really provide a service that was not already available. **********The Time Warner employees are fearful that the magazine will, as one put it, ''become another People.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/27/business/key-talks-on-output-for-opec.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Talks On Output For OPEC", "print_headline": "Key Talks On Output For OPEC", "body_text": " **********As members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gathered informally here today to confront some of the most crucial issues in the group's 30-year history, some predicted that a formal meeting would be announced on Monday to address questions of oil production and prices. **********But regardless of the forum, a majority of OPEC members expect at least three member nations to carry out their plan to raise oil production to help meet the supply shortfall caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. **********There is a growing sentiment here that the member nations would be better off to permit production increases within an OPEC framework instead of allowing a free-for-all that might be difficult to control once the Persian Gulf crisis is over. Once the conflict comes to an end, this logic holds, OPEC can retake control and regulate production under its quota system. **********While there are serious differences among members on how to respond to the turmoil in the world petroleum markets, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela are pressing to increase their production substantially when the meeting ends. **********Long-Dormant Animosities **********The Iraqi-Kuwaiti conflict has rekindled long-dormant animosities within OPEC that reflect the political schisms separating poor and rich countries and pro-Western and anti-Western nations. **********OPEC officials from Algeria, Libya, Iran, Nigeria and Iraq, for example, argue that it is not OPEC's mission to save the West from an economic crisis caused by rapidly rising oil prices. They say the West has done little for indebted third world nations in the last decade and argue that there is enough oil in world markets to compensate for the interruption of supplies caused by the Iraqi invasion. **********Delegates from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, however, say that unless OPEC allows members that can raise their output to do so immediately, OPEC itself will pay a high price if demand drops. **********These delegates say higher oil prices will eventually create a backlash as they have done in the past, when industrialized countries countered rising prices with conservation measures that reduced oil consumption. **********A number of member countries, including Indonesia, Algeria and Nigeria, seem to favor a middle ground in which OPEC would raise output to make up for only part of the shortages in the markets. **********Their view is that oil prices had been quite weak for a long time earlier this year, and higher prices now are needed to compensate for the earlier losses. **********A Fundamental Split **********But behind the issues of output and prices is a more fundamental split along political and ideological lines. **********Among the poorer, more militant members of OPEC, there is an unquestionable antipathy toward the United States and a conviction that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, the prime advocates of higher production, are acting under strong American pressure. **********''We are not here to respond to the wishes of the Americans,'' said an Arab delegate from one of the militant countries. ''This is OPEC, and our mission is to serve the best interest of our members.'' **********In an argument echoed by several moderate countries, including Nigeria and Indonesia, which are allies of the West, an OPEC official from Algeria said: ''There is no real shortage of oil in the market. If the American and Western oil companies release their stocks of oil instead of hanging on to them to make more money, there will be no shortage.'' **********Advocates of this view say that even if OPEC now authorized all its members with surplus capacity to produce all the oil they could, this would not amount to the full four million barrels a day missing from Kuwait and Iraq. **********Delegate From Kuwait **********Among the delegates who gathered today, Kuwait's representative, Ali Khalifa al Sabah, the Finance Minister and a senior member of the Kuwaiti ruling family who has been an architect of OPEC policies for a decade, was greeted warmly by most other OPEC ministers. **********So far, there has been no sign of the Iraqis, who have indicated that they would wait for the meeting to be elevated into a formal session. **********The general sentiment here is that even if Iraq took part, it would not be able to prevent other OPEC members from raising output to compensate for the loss of the four million barrels of oil a day. **********In pressing their case for increased production, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela concede that international oil companies, the United States, Japan and Western European countries hold large stocks of oil that could be released to help make up for the shortfall. **********But they argue that these stocks are held by rich industrialized nations and that poorer third world countries, like India, Pakistan, Brazil and many African nations, which do not have stocks of oil, are experiencing a real shortage and are facing huge, untenable price increases. **********A Middle Ground **********One OPEC delegate, who is among those who are unable to raise production but strongly favor higher prices, advocates bargaining for a smaller increase in output by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates. ''Perhaps something on the order of two million barrels instead of say 3.5 or so,'' he said. **********But Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have said that under the existing OPEC agreement, which mandates the production of a total of 22.5 million barrels a day by all 13 members at a price of $21 a barrel, there is plenty of room to produce all they can now. Prices now stand at about $31 a barrel and production is substantially below 22.5 million barrels a day. **********Some delegates are hoping that the talks do not raise emotions too high. Sadek Boussena, the OPEC conference president and Algeria's oil minister, said in an interview tonight on CNN: ''I have big hopes that all of us will try to remain calm and stay out of matters that do not concern us.'' **********Making a Decision **********Mr. Boussena added, ''I think we have to make this decision in a way that allows all OPEC members not to consider this decision as against them.'' **********The Algerian oil minister noted that the rise in oil prices is not something OPEC can remedy by itself. **********He and others have said psychology and market speculation are driving prices up and that these elements have little to do with how much oil is on the market or how much production is missing from Kuwait and Iraq."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/12/business/real-estate-office-space-slumping-in-chicago.html": {"writer_name": "Cheryl Kent", "pub_date": "1990-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Real Estate; Office Space Slumping In Chicago", "print_headline": "Real Estate; Office Space Slumping In Chicago", "body_text": " **********SAPLINGS are being planted at the corners of a vacant downtown block that has become a symbol of Chicago's deflated building boom. With trees in place, the site will presumably look less forlorn until the city's slumping property market improves. **********The Block 37 project, as it is known, is on hold. The land is across the street from the Richard J. Daley Plaza and one block from City Hall. It is to be the site of a $350 million office and retail project. **********The development team consists of a consortium of Chicago's largest and most powerful developers, including Metropolitan Structures, JMB Realty and the Levy Organization. \"We can't start without tenants, and we don't have them now,\" said Bernard Weissbourd, chairman of Metropolitan Structures. **********With financing dried up and major tenants hard to find, developers in Chicago are postponing groundbreakings. Sixteen projects amounting to 21 million square feet are on hold. Among these is a 125-story building proposed by Miglin-Beitler Inc., a Chicago development concern. The building was to succeed the Sears Tower as the tallest building in the world, but so far no financing for the project has been obtained. **********The office vacancy rate here reached 14.5 percent in October, the highest it has been since 1974, according to Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate Services in Chicago. The rate rose three percentage points since June as five million square feet of office space came on the market. **********Although a total of 8.4 million square feet is now under construction, none of those projects is scheduled for completion this year, leading to expectations that vacancy rates will not rise in the fourth quarter. **********Chicago is no worse off than other cities. The Real Estate Research Corporation's report on emerging trends in real estate in 1991 ranked Chicago fifth in the perceptions of business people about the prospects of real estate markets' attracting developers, investors and lenders. Los Angeles ranked third and New York 12th. **********All the cities in the ranking, based on 112 interviews with real estate experts, have slipped. For 1990, Chicago had a rating of 6.7; for 1991 it is 5.4. New York's 1990 rating was 6.2; 1991's is 3.8. **********Among the projects that are under way in Chicago is a 50-story office building by the Prime Group at 77 West Wacker Drive. It represents a kind of deal that is not available any longer; the tower is being financed by Swiss and Japanese banks, a development partnership of the Prime and the Kemper Investors Life Insurance Company. **********Commercial brokers say that the deals that brought pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors and commercial banks, sometimes in combinations, into joint ventures with developers on new projects can no longer be made. **********One by one, these sources of financing are drying up. Jolts to Japan's stock market have made investors from that country pull back from American real estate. Pension funds and insurance companies have been disappointed by their returns on real estate and are becoming cautious about investing more. **********Because of the savings and loan crisis, Federal banking regulators are concerned about the heavy commitments of banks in real estate loans. Some developers say that new underwriting requirements imposed on commercial banks by regulators are the immediate cause of the halt in construction. **********\"The real estate industry is out of capital,\" said Richard Hanson, president of Stein & Company of Chicago, which has developed several downtown office towers. \"You need lots of equity now, and I'm talking about 40 to 50 percent. We have been put into a regulated recession by changes in the underwriting.\" **********Many new buildings that have come on the market recently are only slowly being leased. Lincoln Properties' 1.3-million-square-foot building at 311 South Wacker Drive opened in May and is only 25 percent leased. The cleared sites for the project's second and third phases have been landscaped and paved over for parking. **********\"Projects like this exert a continued downward pressure on rents,\" said Richard Kateley, president of the Real Estate Research Corporation. \"Tenants have multiple options for low rents, so they can bargain.\" **********Asking rents for prime space range from $22 to $32 a square foot a year. Deals are actually being made at rents ranging from $16 to $27 a square foot, the reseach corporation said. **********Chicago experienced intensive development over the last 10 years, partly because of its low vacancy rates, which stood at just 4 percent in 1980. Since 1987 Chicago has added nearly 11 million square feet to its inventory of office space. Of a total of just over 100 million square feet downtown, 15 million square feet is now unoccupied. **********Predictions vary as to how long the downturn will last. With two million square feet absorbed annually, estimates are that it will be at least four to five years before significant new construction starts again."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/24/world/upheaval-in-the-east-moscow-s-forces-step-up-pressure-across-lithuania.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1437, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  MOSCOW'S FORCES STEP UP PRESSURE ACROSS LITHUANIA", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;   MOSCOW'S FORCES STEP UP PRESSURE ACROSS LITHUANIA", "body_text": " **********The Soviet authorities sent a column of tanks and paratroopers rumbling past an all-night session of the Lithuanian Parliament early this morning, in what witnesses described as the strongest attempt yet to intimidate the republic into abandoning its declaration of independence. **********More than 100 tanks and trucks, and more than 1,500 soldiers armed with automatic weapons thundered by the Parliament building in central Vilnius at about 3 A.M. as legislators worked through the night to complete the creation of an independent government. **********The Parliament broke off from its work to pass an emergency resolution declaring that it would transfer all authority to its representative in Washington in the event that legislators were arrested or martial law was imposed. **********No Signs of Takeover **********The column proceeded through the town, stopping at an army base inside the city limits after passing the Parliament, and there were no signs that the central Government was trying to take power in Lithuania, where independence was declared on March 11. **********[United States officials anxiously monitored signs of abnormally high Soviet military activity in Lithuania. as concerns mounted in the Administration that the Kremlin may be contemplating harsher action against the secessionist movement in Lithuania.

Gorbachev's decree issued Wednesday, demanding that Lithuanian citizens turn in their firearms and ordering the authorities to defend the Soviet Constitution in the republic. **********Communist Party members loyal to Moscow also seized the party committee headquarters in Vilnius, which the Moscow loyalists had been sharing with the breakaway Communist Party of Lithuania. The Moscow loyalists said they were fulfilling the Government decree ordering the protection of Soviet installations in Lithuania. **********The Lithuanian Parliament here in the capital reported that a Lithuanian soldier who deserted from the Soviet Army was abducted on Thursday evening from the streets of Vilnius by plainclothes military officers and was being held against his will at the city's military headquarters. **********The Lithuanian Government has been sheltering local military deserters, and the Soviet authorities have set today as the deadline for the republic to turn in the young men. **********Protest to Gorbachev **********After the column of paratroopers passed through the city this morning, the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, said he had sent a telegram to President Gorbachev protesting the show of force. **********''This is the same thing that has been going on for a week,'' Mr. Landsbergis said. ''It is a war of nerves, psychological pressure, and humiliation of the Lithuanian people.'' **********''We are under constant pressure from the outside,'' he said. ''A certain kind of psychological warfare is being waged against Lithuania.'' **********The Lithuanian Parliament decided Friday night to go into an all-night session to finish creating Lithuania's independent government, completing a formal step in the republic's declaration of independence from Moscow. Lithuania, along with its sister republics of Latvia and Estonia, were forcibly annexed by Stalin in 1940, as part of a nonaggression pact between Stalin and Hitler that divided Europe into spheres of influence. **********As the members of Parliament were meeting shortly after midnight, they got a telephone call from a police station in a nearby town saying that a column of armored vehicles, including 59 light armored tanks and 50 military trucks, was on the way. In response, the deputies passed their resolution saying that they would delegate their powers to Stasys Lozoraitis, head of the Lithuanian legation in Washington, if they were ''restricted from acting and expressing the will of the nation freely.'' **********After the declaration, the newly appointed Foreign Affairs Minister, Algirdas Saudargas, said he believed that the military may have been deployed in fulfillment of the army's vow to seize deserters from the armed forces. ''There is certainly a basis for fear, which is why we decided to continue meeting through the night to form a government,'' he said.''But we believe that everything is aimed at these deserters.'' **********Rumors of Separate Army **********Several deputies from the Parliament said they believed the dispatch of the column to Vilnius was prompted by rumors in Moscow that the republic was organizing its own military formation, using Lithuanian deserters from the Soviet Army. **********In his telegram to Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Landsbergis said the republic has been registering civilian volunteers as a contingency, only ''in case of necessity to help in the defense of the general order and in control of roads.'' He added, ''We have no formations of this type, even though we are surrounded by arms.'' **********On Friday, at the borders, where Soviet K.G.B. guards were on heightened alert, new simplified visa-free procedures were suspended between Lithuania and Poland. **********And in the first sign that the Soviet Government is trying to restrict reporting from Lithuania, the Soviet Foreign Ministry telephoned many foreign news organizations in Moscow, including The Washington Post and Reuters, and told them that their correspondents' scheduled trips to Vilnius had been canceled. **********Given 12 Hours to Leave **********Soviet officials also told two visiting American diplomats that they must return within 12 hours to the consulate in Leningrad, where they are based. **********Foreign journalists accredited in Moscow and diplomats stationed in the country must notify the Foreign Ministry in advance of travel. The Foreign Ministry seemed to have randomly rescinded permission for certain journalists, and the duty officer who informed them said that it was for ''temporary reasons.'' **********''If they closed Lithuania to the press, it would be the beginning of an information blackout,'' Algimantas Cekuolis, a Lithuanian journalist and an aide to Mr. Landsbergis, said on Friday. ''That would mean trouble, because you only need a blackout if you're going to do something nasty.'' **********Most of the several dozen foreign journalists now in Vilnius arrived earlier in the week, when the situation between Moscow and Vilnius was not so heated. **********Special Panel for Deserters **********A special commission of the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet has been registering local young men who have left their army units and informing the Soviet military that they are in the charge of the Lithuanian Government. **********The Government has set aside certain hospitals where the deserters can stay under auspices of the Lithuanian Red Cross and the protection of the Lithuanian Interior Ministry. But officials acknowledged that they were powerless to protect the young men in the event of an armed attempt by the military to seize them, and many here are worried that today could be the first violent confrontation between Moscow and Lithuania. **********''If military force is used against us, we would not be able to counter such a great power,'' said Marionis Misiukonis, who was confirmed on Friday by Parliament as the new Interior Minister, a post he held in the previous government. **********Officials say they have only sketchy information about the seizure of a Lithuanian deserter, Vidas Zalazicius, which Mr. Landsbergis labeled a ''kidnapping.'' He was walking with a friend in the city on Thursday night when he was taken, and nobody, including his parents, has been given access to him since. **********Information Is Denied **********A guard at the military headquarters refused to provide information on the case, and Lithuanian officials said they have been similarly denied information. **********The Lithuanian leadership today protested the increased Soviet military presence in the republic. **********''The size of the army keeps growing,'' Mr. Landsbergis told Parliament today. ''It is openly demonstrating that it is armed and very strong and ready for anything.'' **********On Friday, several armored personnel carriers were spotted in the city, as were trucks carrying armed soldiers and several military vehicles hauling bed frames, leading many people to speculate that the military was setting up encampments around the city.

The Dow generally managed to stay in higher ground before the closing. **********Among the blue-chip industrials, Procter & Gamble rose 2, to 85 3/4; McDonalds rose 1 1/4, to 35 7/8, and Merck rose 1 7/8, to 86 1/8. **********As they do in uncertain times, the drug stocks registered impressive gains. **********Abbott Labs rose 1 1/8, to 42; Bristol-Myers gained 1 1/4, to 64 1/2, on more than a million shares; Johnson & Johnson tacked on 1 1/4, to 67 7/8.

Medtronic, which produces pacemakers, rose 2 5/8, to 82 3/4. It raised its quarterly dividend yesterday. **********A.T.&T., which topped the New York Stock Exchange's list of active stocks on Wednesday, topped it again yesterday. On Wednesday it forecast that second-quarter profits would decline, prompting a selloff that trimmed the stock 2 1/8 on 11.5 million shares. Yesterday, the telecommunications giant fell another 3/8, to 38 3/4, on nearly 3.8 million shares. **********The selloff in A.T.&T. appeared to have lost most of its strength by yesterday. Added to that, portfolio managers still dressing up their investments by removing underperforming stocks have only today left before the second quarter ends. **********Profits - and the prospect of greater profits - continued to dominate investment decisions. Nike and L.A.

Bush Administration officials said in March that a fire that month at Libya's chemical weapons plant at Rabta might have been a hoax engineered by Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. The Central Intelligence Agency has detected recent activity at the Rabta complex but no firm proof that the plant is back in operation, Administration officials said last week. **********Senators Hold Hearing **********Washington's new concerns came to light today when a senior State Department official testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Bush Administration's policy toward China. **********Under sharp questioning from Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, Richard Solomon, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, indicated that the Administration was concerned about the possible export of chemical weapon ingredients by China to the Middle East, but declined to identify the possible recipient or to offer any details. **********''We've got some indications that something may be going on in that area, and we have expressed our concerns to them at a very high level,'' Mr. Solomon said. **********Another Administration official, who asked not to be identified, said the American Embassy in Beijing was instructed several days ago to ask the Chinese not to sell Libya precursor chemicals, as the key ingredients of poison gas are known. **********The United States latest concerns have raised new questions about the Bush Administration's concilatory policy toward Beijing. The Administration recently decided to renew most-favored-nation trading status for Beijing and has also maintained high-level diplomatic contacts with China despite continued repression there. **********U.S. Policy Criticized **********At the Senate hearing, Senator Biden asserted that the Bush Administration policy toward China had been a failure. **********''You certainly can't defend China on trade; you can't begin to defend them on human rights; you can't begin to defend them on their handling of the situation since Tiananmen Square,'' said Senator Biden, who questioned whether China was being responsive to concerns over the spread of missiles, poison gas and nuclear weapons. **********In response, an aide to Mr. Solomon noted that China had pledged not to sell M-9 missiles to Syria and had offered a more general assurance not to sell medium-range missiles to the Middle East. **********The aide, Kent Wiedeman, director of the State Department's Office of Chinese and Mongolian Affairs, indicated that the Bush Administration was trying to get China to accept an internationally agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a medium-range missile. The definition is contained in export guidelines agreed to by Western nations and was confirmed in a United States-Soviet joint statement on combating the spread of missiles, poison gas and nuclear weapons that was issued after the summit meeting in Washington. **********''We are ever vigilant, we're concerned, just as you are,'' Mr. Wiedeman said, referring to continuing re= ports and rumors of Chinese efforts to sell missiles, poison gas and nuclear weapons technologies. **********Administration specialists said that while there was evidence that officials from Chinese companies and Libyan officials have been negotiating the sale of poison gas ingredients, there was no firm proof that a transaction had been consummated or that the ingredients had been shipped to Libya. **********Other Nations in Talks **********Administration officials said also that intelligence reports indicated that Libya was not the only country to discuss the possible sale of Chinese ingredients for the manufacture of chemical weapons. **********These chemicals often have legitimate civilian uses as well as military applications. The West has sought to control their export by establishing export guidelines. As a result, some third-world countries have turned to suppliers outside the West like India. **********The movement of a convoy of missiles though Beijing in March prompted concern about possible Chinese missiles sales because they appeared to be headed toward the port of Tianjin. **********An Administration official said today that they may have been short-range surface-to-surface missiles, which would not be formally covered by China's assurance not to sell medium-range missiles to the Middle East.

Nowhere else does Burmese society so symbolize the devotion to religion and ritual as in this city of nearly one million people. **********But in October the military Government, which had until then reserved its violent tactics for opposition leaders and protesting students, took on the church as well. It began a campaign to purify the Buddhist religion throughout Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and the brunt of the attack was borne by the monks in Mandalay. **********The Government arrested 200 monks for engaging in politics, in particular for staging a boycott against the military. Then, as if to pacify the abbots as well as the indignant population, military leaders made pilgrimages to several monasteries. They took food and lavish gifts like imported color televisions. **********Monks here have played a prominent part in the opposition to military rule ever since anti-Government demonstrations erupted in 1988. Those demonstrations led in the fall of that year to a nationwide military crackdown in which more than 2,000 people died. **********The monks of Mandalay were strongly supported by the country's opposition party, the National League for Democracy, which won elections in May this year. But instead of handing over power to the victors, the military Government has arrested many of them. **********This is a city of fear, where soldiers are as omnipresent as monks. Early in the morning, as the monks make their rounds for rice, soldiers jog in phalanxes, grunting their way past the entrances of monasteries. **********At the Myataung monastery, one ofthe main compounds raided by troops, three soldiers were slumped on a bench, their rifles propped up beside them. **********\"The state order forbids you to enter this monastery,\" a security agent told a foreign visitor as the soldiers blocked the way. The agent, who had followed the foreigner by motorcycle to the monastery, added, \"I cannot tell you when the order will be lifted.\" **********It was not clear whether this monastery and others in the southwest of the city were still occupied by troops, but local residents and foreign diplomats said that the dramatic military presence had diminished substantially since the height of the crackdown in the last week of October. **********The confrontation began on Aug. 8, when monks and students staged a small demonstration in Mandalay tomark the second anniversary of the nationwide crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. The crackdown ultimately led to a declaration of martial law, which is still in effect. **********The August protest led to clashes in which security guards fired at demonstrators and killed a monk. **********Militant monks then called a meeting at which they persuaded thousands of others to join a boycott of the military by refusing to accept alms from military men and their families. **********While the army was invulnerable to direct attack, it seemed susceptible to this spiritual boycott. Giving alms to monks is considered an extremely important way of earning merit for the next life. **********On Oct. 20, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the military's governing body, ordered an end to the boycott, and said it would bring recalcitrant monks before a tribunal, which could conceivably sentence them to death. It also announced the abolition of certain Buddhist sects, apparently those linked with the unrest. **********Abbots and senior monks have signed documents announcing that they have abandoned the boycott. **********Now, with the army having apparently succeeded in its crackdown on the monks, diplomats say that the Myanmar Government has crushed the last significant source of opposition. **********\"The military is absolutely determined to crush anyone who does not go along with it,\" said a diplomat in the capital, Yangon, formerly called Rangoon. \"It has crushed the spirit of everyone.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/12/world/south-africa-s-new-era-tv-critic-s-notebook-firm-step-smile-mandela-floods.html": {"writer_name": "Walter Goodman", "pub_date": "1990-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1002, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  A Firm Step, a Smile: Mandela Floods the Screen", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW ERA: TV CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;   A Firm Step, a Smile: Mandela Floods the Screen", "body_text": " **********The moment was worth the wait. Along the road leading out of Victor Verster prison he appeared, hand in hand with his wife as though strolling to Sunday church, and everything we had been hearing of the man's dignity and strength was there on the screen. **********He walked slowly, bearing erect, expression composed. He waved a little, then more vigorously with both arms, shook someone's hand and smiled slightly, gave the clenched-fist salute. And then it was over; Nelson and Winnie Mandela were in the limousine that would take them to Cape Town, and the people who had been waiting for hours for a glimpse rushed forward to touch the car. The networks can be forgiven for the somewhat reverential tone of their coverage. **********Ted Koppel of ABC News, who had been talking pretty steadily, uninterrupted by commercials, for most of the 80-minute wait, repeatedly resorting to compliments on Cape Town's natural beauty and splendid weather, understandably welcomed the first view of the freed leader as ''a moment best left alone without commentary.'' But the commentator for South African television, which was supplying the pictures to all the American networks, did not leave it alone. He noted, ''There is a very nice picture of Mr. Mandela and his wife.'' **********Cape Town, Then Soweto **********Until then, the morning had been mostly commentary along with background pieces, interviews and pictures of the scene near the prison as photographers, security forces and Mandela supporters waited. From one angle, the flag of the African National Front, outlawed until the other day, seemed to be flying over the heads of a group of policemen. **********Outside Mr. Mandela's home in Soweto, which he would not reach for at least another 24 hours, a party had been going on all night, and from the look of things would go on until he arrived, with young people dancing, singing, chanting, cheering. Two men were painting the black, gold and green colors of the flag of the African National Congress on the Mandelas' garage. In an inadvertent feat of timing, the CBS News camera broke away from Dan Rather in Johannesburg to relay pictures from Cape Town at the instant that the ABC News camera broke away from Mr. Koppel in Cape Town to relay pictures from Johannesburg. Negotiating on the Air?  Tom Brokaw of NBC News, who had daringly not joined Mr. Rather and Peter Jennings of ABC in Moscow a few days earlier for the meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, was on the spot in Cape Town, where he got into an argument with Denis Worral, a white South African politician, about the value of sanctions. The correspondents left little doubt as to whose side they were on. **********Mr. Koppel, first on the scene and somewhat more objective, began his reports from South Africa on Wednesday. On Thursday, ''Nightline'' showed what it could do by offering three major spokesmen for often clashing groups who chatted warily yet amiably, via Mr. Koppel, across the miles. **********From Cape Town, Foreign Minister Roelof W. Botha appealed to all his ''black brothers and friends'' to build a new South Africa; from London, Thabo Mbeki, who serves as Foreign Minister for the African National Congress, expressed restrained hope; and from Durban, Chief Mangosuthu Gathsa Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu nation, welcomed the spirit of conciliation. Mr. Koppel said he realized that ''negotiations don't take place on television programs.'' But when Mr. Botha and Chief Buthelezi called for the lifting of sanctions and Mr. Mbeki responded ''it's still early days'' for that sort of thing, they were plainly talking at least as much to the world as to one another. **********The freeing of Mr. Mandela may not be as fraught with international consequence as the Moscow meeting, but it made for richer television, abounding in color and feeling and with a world-class hero at its center. A preview of the big moment came on Saturday morning, with the press conference at which F. W. de Klerk, the South African President, announced the ''open doors'' for Mr. Mandela. **********The cameras brought us dancing and singing in the dusty streets of Soweto set off by the announcement, and there was a jaunty Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the Anglican primate of southern Africa, in his cleric's fuchsia shirt, which seemed to have gotten brighter for the occasion. **********A Practiced Performer **********''Hallelujah!'' he cried, ''Hallelujah! Hallelujah!'' He did a little dance. ''Freedom is coming!'' he cried. ''Mind boggling!'' he cried and waved his arms. The Archbishop, a practiced television performer, had a fresh exclamation for every photographer, but even if his reactions were not altogether spontaneous, this South African best known to Americans personified the excitement. **********All the early reports, however, included cautions against expecting too much too soon. Winnie Mandela, interviewed by everybody, was restrained, and Mr. Brokaw talked to a black woman near Cape Town who had never heard of Nelson Mandela. On Sunday, CNN noted that the beaches and restaurants were as busy as ever and that South African television was devoting considerably less attention to the event than American television. **********As the light faded in Cape Town on Sunday, Mr. Mandela returned to the network channels. Standing on a balcony at City Hall, he spoke for about 15 minutes to an enormous crowd. David Brinkley of ABC, in Washington and at some emotional remove from his colleagues, observed by way of dry introduction, ''Whatever he says, I promise you, they will like.'' Again South African television fed the event to the American networks. But, like several of the other events, it was not carried live in South Africa itself."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/business/company-news-harleysville-to-buy-a-uslico-unit.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 425, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Harleysville to Buy a USLico Unit", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Harleysville to Buy a USLico Unit", "body_text": " **********A Pennsylvania insurance company announced today that it planned to buy the property and casualty insurance operations of the USLico Corporation for $135 million in cash and notes. **********Harleysville Group Inc. and its parent company, the Harleysville Mutual Insurance Company, said they had signed a letter of intent to buy USLico's Hawkeye-Security Insurance Company, based in Des Moines. **********The deal also includes two Hawkeye-Security subsidiaries, the United Security Insurance Company, based in Des Moines, and the Western States Insurance Company, based in Freeport, Ill. **********USLico, based in Arlington, Va., would receive $93 million in cash from the Harleysville Group, $17 million in cash from Harleysville Mutual and $25 million in a seven-year 10 percent note from Harleysville Mutual.

Yeltsin, a rival and fierce critic of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, took the lead early this morning in the contest for the presidency of the Russian republic - a job that would give him an important power base. **********Preliminary results after a first round of secret balloting by the republic's Parliament showed Mr. Yeltsin leading his main opponent, 497 votes to 473. A third candidate trailed with 32 votes, and 31 members of Parliament crossed out all three candidates on the ballot, a deputy who saw the results early this morning said. **********To win the job as leader of Russia, the most populous republic in the Soviet Union, Mr. Yeltsin needs 531 votes - or a majority of the 1,060 representatives elected to the Russian republic's Parliament. A second round of voting is expected today on the candidacy of Mr. Yeltsin, who broke with Mr. Gorbachev three years ago and became a popular hero. **********Gorbachev Assails Yeltsin **********Mr. Yeltsin's original chief opponent, Aleksandr V. Vlasov, the Prime Minister of the Russian republic, withdrew his candidacy at the last minute on Friday. Mr. Vlasov, who was head of the Interior Ministry under Mr. Gorbachev for two years, had been seen as the choice of the moderate wing of the Communist Party and presumably of Mr. Gorbachev. **********Mr. Gorbachev did not openly endorse any of the candidates for the Russian presidency - there were originally 12 - but earlier this week he made a guest appearance before the Russian Parliament to deliver a severe criticism of Mr. Yeltsin, whom he accused of setting ''the people of the republic at loggerheads.'' **********In a campaign speech on Friday, Mr. Yeltsin offered a program of rapid change, starting with greater autonomy for the Russian republic within the Soviet Union, renegotiation of relations involving the republic's constituent parts, closing of nuclear testing sites, creation of a separate and convertible Russian currency, and establishing an independent Russian K.G.B. **********'Relaxed Manner' of Change **********Mr. Yeltsin, who as Moscow party chief three years ago broke with Mr. Gorbachev over the need for faster economic changes, today criticized the Soviet Government's new plan to raise prices. He said the move toward a market economy should not be made ''at the expense of the people.'' **********''The main thing is for us to find the only right solution to the issue: how to switch over to a market in a relaxed manner, without lowering the living standards of the population,'' he said in a speech that won him prolonged applause. **********Mr. Yeltsin became a popular hero in 1987, when he was dismissed from his job as leader of the Moscow Communist Party organization. He attracts huge crowds, particularly in the Russian republic. Since winning an at-large seat in Moscow to the Supreme Soviet in 1989 with 89 percent of the vote, he has become a leader of the insurgent parliamentary opposition organization called the Interregional Group. Repeated attacks on him for his maverick views by members of the party and Government establishment have seemed only to make him more popular. **********The sudden withdrawal of Mr. Vlasov created a quandary for moderate Communist Party members, who had to choose between Mr. Yeltsin and his most serious rival, Ivan K. Polozkov, a doctrinaire party first secretary from the region of Krasnodar in southern Russia who recently created a controversy with a crackdown against owners of private cooperatives. **********Aviation Instructor Trails **********The two men represent the opposite ends of the Soviet political spectrum. Mr. Yeltsin is backed by Democratic Russia, a liberal group that advocates a swift, clean break with the past, while Mr. Polozkov, a staunch defender of socialist ideals, has the support of conservatives in the Communist Party apparatus, who are closer to the hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev than to Mr. Gorbachev. **********A third candidate, Vladimir Morokin, was also on the ballot distributed to the deputies. But Mr. Morokin, a 44-year-old senior instructor at an aviation institute from the Tatar region and a nonparty member, was seen as running a distant third. **********The contest for the Russian presidency, featuring the highly visible and flamboyant Mr. Yeltsin, has captured popular attention more than any other election to a top post. The bulletin boards in the corridor outside the meeting hall are draped in telegrams sent to deputies from across the republic, urging, chastising and in some cases browbeating their representatives to vote for their candidate. **********''The miners of the Donets Basin region demand that the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic stand up in defense of Mother Russia - without the Communist Party and usurping powers,'' said a message from miners in the Ukraine, asking for support of Yeltsin. **********Backers Send Messages **********Five members of the Miklashevsky family from Moscow sent a telegram asking the deputies to vote for Mr. Polozkov, and to ''stop disarmament, market economy and to bring money reform to a popular vote.'' **********A collective of transport workers from Leningrad warned their representatives to vote for Mr. Yeltsin, ''or else,'' their telegram read, ''we will call for a strike.'' **********Vasily Sondikov, a deputy from the oil-rich Tyumen region, said all but two members of his 20-member delegation support Mr. Yeltsin. ''We need this kind of man - someone who is strong and decisive,'' he said. **********Mikhail Trubitsyn, a doctor from the ancinet Russian city of Vladimir, said he supported Mr. Polozkov because ''he will preserve Russia and not break up the Soviet Union in the process,'' and because he understands Russians' reluctance to endorse business practices that make some people rich while leaving the rest poor. ''He understands the social psychology,'' said Mr. Trubitsyn. **********Brisk Communist Lobbying **********Mr. Polozkov, in his campaign speech today, said the Russian people were not ready to go to a market system. ''I am for a market in principle,'' he said. ''But at the same time, I regard idealizing a market economy as dangerous, particularly based on private ownership of the means of production.'' **********Mr. Vlasov, who until last week was regarded as the favorite to win the election, was widely criticized after he gave a poor performance in a speech outlining the state of the Russian republic's economy. The question today was whether party loyalists simply switched their allegiance to Mr. Polozkov, or whether moderates would decide to resist the apparat's distrust of Mr. Yeltsin. **********Deputies described brisk lobbying by Communist Party officials, particularly within their local delegations. But many deputies were divided between the demands of their local bosses and of rank-and-file voters, among whom Mr. Yeltsin is considered the popular choice. **********An unpublished poll on the Russian republic presidency, made public Friday by the All-Union Center for the Study of Public Opinion, said 41 percent of people interviewed were undecided, while 29 percent supported Mr. Yeltsin. Only 3 percent supported Mr. Vlasov, while Mr. Polozkov was chosen by 1 percent of those interviewed. **********Deputies said Mr. Yeltsin's strength - estimated at a hard-core 350 vote -lies in the Moscow and Leningrad delegations, made up mostly of liberals, and also in the region of Ural Mountains, where he began his career, and other industrial areas. Mr. Polozkov's strength comes from more rural regions in the south and north of Russia, they said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/15/business/company-news-ibm-introduction-may-come-earlier.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News;   I.B.M.

Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it was the first time it had made an instant camera available to another manufacturer for consumer markets. **********In making the announcement, I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's chief executive, said the agreement was ''a first step to explore a potential long-term collaboration between our two companies.'' Officials of both companies declined to speculate on what future projects were being considered. **********First Instant Model **********The agreement gives Minolta, which built its business selling 35 millimeter single-lens-reflex cameras, an instant model for the first time. An instant camera produces a picture within seconds, while conventional film needs processing. **********''We view this as another avenue of imaging,'' said John Jonny, a spokesman for Minolta (U.S.A.). ''It is not going to replace anything else, but it is a great party camera, and it has uses in industry as well.'' **********In a statement, Mr. Booth said: ''Minolta is one of the world's best-known and most highly respected camera manufacturers. This agreement will help to expand the market for instant photography to the benefit of both companies.'' **********Analysts described the agreement as a good one for Polaroid. ''The problem Polaroid has been facing is the steady loss of share to 35 millimeter cameras,'' said Eugene G. Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. ''Now they are hooking up with a company that has a good brand name in 35 millimeter. That should help boost camera and film sales.'' **********But he cautioned, ''It is still an open question how big the market for instant photography is.'' **********Designed for Serious Amateurs **********A Polaroid official said the Spectra Pro model was designed for serious amateur photographers who tend to consume a lot of film and for business users, like real estate agents who take pictures of properties. Unlike some simpler instant cameras, the Spectra Pro comes equipped with a liquid crystal display control panel, a three-element glass lens and a special lens for taking close-ups. The suggested retail price is $219. **********Even bearing the Minolta name, the camera will use Polaroid's Spectra film and Polaroid will continue to manufacture the camera at its plant in Dumbarton, Scotland. In Japan, the camera will be sold only as a Polaroid. **********Polaroid introduced the Spectra Pro earlier this year, and a spokesman said limited quantities had become available in stores. The Minolta Instant Pro is expected to be available through Minolta's distribution network starting in August. **********A Minolta spokesman said this was not the first time it had sold products of other manufacturers.

The United States, under pressure from other members of the Security Council not to go it alone against Iraq in the Persian Gulf, announced that it favored the plan, The Soviet Union had shown interest in the committee as early as 1987, when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a major shift in Soviet policy on the United Nations. In urging that the United Nations be given a bigger role in finding political solutions to regional conflicts, Mr. Gorbachev urged that the moribund Military Staff Committee be revived and given the job of coordinating United Nations peacekeeping operations. **********The Soviet Viewpoint **********Last October, Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir F. Potrovsky reiterated Mr. Gorbachev's proposal when he told Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that the Military Staff Committee could be a useful forum for discussing peacekeeping operations and other ''politico-military'' affairs of the United Nations. **********Despite Moscow's renewed interest, no new role was given to the committee. That could be changing. Last month, after the Security Council resolution imposing a trade embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, Under Secretary of State Robert Kimmett met with the representatives of the other four permanent members of the Security Council - the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France - to discuss ways in which the Military Staff Committee could help enforce the sanctions. **********A week later, in the discussion leading up to the Security Council resolution permitting military force to back up the sanctions, the Soviet Union insisted that the resolution include a directive that any military actions be coordinated ''as appropriate'' though the Military Staff Committee. **********Historically, the United States has shied away from any commitment that would require American forces to serve under foreign commanders.

''It would be difficult to make it work, but it is certainly worth a try.'' **********Representatives of the permanent members are expected to propose that the Security Council await the findings of the special panel it has set up to see whether the sanctions are being observed before discussing a new role for the Military Staff Committee.

Analysts have been projecting those earnings at as much as $325 million, or $2.50 a share, so the divestitures should lead to a slightly profitable or break-even year. **********The North American action follows a similar move in May to sell off poorly performing European operations with annual revenue totaling more than $200 million. **********Volatile Profit Margins **********But the move announced yesterday also signals Campbell's withdrawal from one of the three major sectors of the modern supermarket. The closings come mainly in refrigerated fresh foods. Fast distribution of these items is sometimes difficult and their profit margins are volatile because of changing commodity prices. **********The main asset being put on the block is Campbell's Fresh Foods Group, which includes mushroom farms in eight states and Canada; a refrigerated salad business, and the Marie's brand salad dressing. Also scheduled for sale is a frozen poultry operation and a salmon processor. **********The drive into fresh foods was a prime goal of Campbell's previous president and chief executive, R. Gordon McGovern, who retired early last year. In January, David W. Johnson, former chief executive of the Gerber Products Company, was named to replace him. **********In an interview yesterday, Mr. Johnson said, ''I'm very focused on producing cash so I can build the sinews of war.'' He said he was referring to competition with other food giants like Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods, the country's largest food company; Conagra, the second largest, and H. J. Heinz, one of the most profitable. **********Campbell will retain relatively strong businesses in the other two major supermarket sectors - frozen foods, like Mrs. Paul's fish sticks, and shelf-stable non-refrigerated foods, like Campbell's soup and Pepperidge Farm cookies. These highly processed foods have higher profit margins. **********The most recent restructuring charges include writing off about $113 million in good will on Campbell's struggling Freshbake Foods operations in Britain. Good will is the accounting term for the premium over book value paid to purchase an asset. **********The proposed sales equal about 5 percent of Campbell's annual revenue of $5.67 billion in the year ended July 31, 1989. Net income last year totaled $13.1 million, or 90 cents a share, after $261 million in restructuring charges. **********Analysts reacted favorably, if without surprise, to yesterday's announcement, which was in keeping with Mr. Johnson's stated goals. **********William Leach, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, raised his earnings estimate for the 1991 fiscal year to $3.05 a share from $3. **********Investors responded favorably. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Campbell Soup shares rose 75 cents, to $57.25. **********Family Divided on Future **********The moves come at a time when the Dorrance family, which owns 58 percent of Campbell's common stock, is divided about the future of Campbell, which has substantially underperformed the rest of the food industry. A minority faction of the Dorrances, owning 17.4 percent of the company, announced in January that it favored selling Campbell, prompting months of takeover rumors on Wall Street. **********Mr. Johnson noted that members of both Dorrance factions sit on Campbell's board and that he is in constant communication with the family.

A fourth hostage, Brian Keenan, is from Northern Ireland, but his family has asked him to be classified as Irish in the hope that might increase his chances of being released. **********''We feel the Iranians have a very significant part to play'' in getting the hostages released, the Foreign Office spokesman said. **********A third condition has been the removal of the order for Muslims to kill Salman Rushdie, the author of ''The Satanic Verses.'' Attacking the novel as blasphemous, Iran's leader at the time, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued that death order, or ''fatwa,'' in February 1989. Since then Mr. Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Muslim family in India, has been in hiding. **********Foreign Office Optimistic **********A month after the fatwa, Iran severed diplomatic ties with Britain, saying it had shown disrespect for Islam by refusing to condemn Mr. Rushdie and his novel. **********The British Foreign Office spokesman seemed optimistic today that if the Iranian news reports were true then the fatwa would be lifted. ''We feel we're on the way to resolving the fatwa issue,'' he said. **********In the last two months, British leaders, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, have made several statements praising Islam. **********But in a letter to a Member of Parliament that was made public on Wednesday, Mr. Hurd not only praised Islam but also distanced Britain from the publication of ''The Satanic Verses.'' **********He called Islam ''one of the world's great religions'' and said that ''we have the greatest respect for it and its values.'' **********He added: ''The British Government had nothing to do with the publishing of ''The Satanic Verses.

Columbia holds more than $4 billion of the securities, which pay a high yield because they are used to finance high-risk ventures. **********Imperial and Columbia were two of the largest customers of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and both worked closely with the securities firm's former junk bond chief, Michael R. Milken. Drexel, which pioneered the junk bond market, collapsed last week as its parent company filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors. **********Big Write-Downs Expected **********Columbia is expected to show write-downs in the value of its junk bond portfolio of several hundred million dollars in its financial results for the last three months of 1989, although the institution remains solvent. The Government has already seized two other savings institutions with big junk bond investments, Centrust Bank of Miami, which was taken over earlier this month, and City Federal Savings Bank of Somerset, N.J., which was taken over in December. **********Besides Imperial, which has $9.7 billion in assets, regulators today took over the Mercury Savings and Loan Association of Huntington Beach, Calif., with $2.2 billion in assets. Mercury's troubles stemmed from the failure of the savings and loan's two biggest borrowers to complete hotel-building projects, forcing Mercury to foreclose on the properties and take large losses. **********Imperial has been battered over the last two years by a series of bad loans and investments in a variety of fields, including its relationship with a fast-growing automobile dealership that went into bankruptcy. But the deterioration of its junk bond portfolio proved to be its biggest problem. **********Effect of Stricter Rules **********Under the Government's stricter new regulations contained in the industry bailout bill signed last August, savings institutions must value junk bond holdings at their market prices rather than at face value, as they had been allowed to do previously. **********As junk bond prices declined last fall, Imperial was forced to reduce its portfolio's value by about $200 million through the end of November, wiping out the institution's capital, which is its buffer against losses. **********The Government indicated that Imperial had to take further write-downs in December, although it did not provide any precise figures. The Office of Thrift Supervision, the primary Federal regulator for savings and loans, said Imperial's most basic level of capital had fallen to negative $60.1 million as of Dec. 31. **********Further Losses Foreseen **********Janis L. Smith, a spokeswoman for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said the additional losses from Imperial's junk bond portfolio in December were substantial. She added, ''There was also the expectation of further substantial write-downs in the first two months of this year, and that had a bearing on the decision'' to place Imperial into conservatorship. **********In a statement, the Office of Thrift Supervision said, ''Due to Imperial's weak financial condition and sustained losses, there was no possibility of its replenishing capital without Federal assistance.'' **********Imperial and Mercury now join the hundreds of other institutions that have been put in the hands of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency set up last summer under the bailout legislation to merge, sell or liquidate failed savings and loan companies. Junk Bond Holdings of U.S.  The Government now controls at least $3 billion of junk bonds held by the institutions it has seized. Wall Street executives have expressed some concern that the Government might try to sell the holdings quickly, further depressing prices in that market. So far, however, regulators have given no indication that they plan to move quickly in disposing of the bonds, and most analysts think the Government will probably hold on to at least a portion of the securities for some time in the hope that the market will turn up. **********Executives at Imperial spent the last several months trying to convince regulators that they had developed a plan to return the institution to health without Government aid. The plan called for Imperial to sell half of its assets and generate earnings from mortgage lending and investments in mortgage-backed securities. **********Regulators, however, expressed skepticism about the plan and ordered Imperial last month to halt all lending and investment operations. **********Rapid Growth in the 1980's **********Imperial, which was founded in 1950, grew rapidly during the 1980's by taking advantage of California's liberal savings and loan regulations to invest in fields far removed from traditional mortgage lending and deposit taking. Under Kenneth J. Thygerson, who resigned under pressure as chairman last summer, Imperial backed such ventures as the company that imported the Yugo automobile, which proved to be a sales failure. It also provided automobile loans to customers of a Los Angeles dealership that later turned out be involved in what several lawsuits contend was a huge fraud. **********Mr. Thygerson also led the push into junk bonds, arguing that the risks could be properly managed. **********Mercury, by contrast, had long prided itself on sticking close to traditional savings-and-loan activities.

Armenia and Azerbaijan accepted the offer as a means of dealing with their conflict beyond the purview of the Kremlin. **********Central Authorities Absent **********Notably absent from the conference, whose details were carefully explained in Riga today after an initial announcement on Sunday, will be the central Government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It has sent thousands of troops in an attempt to calm the chaotic Transcaucasus region, but has been at a loss to stir political conciliation in the face of the strong nationalist passions now challenging the Kremlin. **********The Kremlin has not commented on the Baltic initiative. **********The Riga conference will, in effect, gather together five of the most powerful de facto movements in the new politics of separatism sweeping major parts of the Soviet Union in the face of the Kremlin's objections. Negotiators, who already are predicting some sort of a formal final agreement on at least some differences, will be representing populist movements in regions where the central Communist Party, the Moscow Government's normal conduit of political power, has suffered severe rebuff and change. **********The host popular fronts of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia announced details of the conference in their joint organization, the Baltic Council, saying an agenda has already been formulated through the council's mediation with the Azerbaijani Popular Front and the Armenian National Movement. **********The agenda will focus on the Soviet troop occupation of the region, the large-scale refugee upheaval created by conflict, and various other problems described as ''humanitarian,'' including hostage-taking by warring factions. The Kremlin's sending of troops to defend central authority already has been widely criticized by separatists in both republics. **********The agenda diplomatically puts aside the most explosive and intractible issue of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Azerbaijani region where conflict has raged for two years between the majority Armenians and the Azerbaijanis who retain government control in the semi-autonomous enclave. **********Should the peace talks' implicit end run around the Kremlin produce substantial progress on easing a critical national problem, the popular front movements would undoubtedly compound their prestige as political forces in this changing, troubled nation. **********Originality Demonstrated **********In contrast to the Transcaucasus movements, the Baltic popular fronts have been free of pogrom-like excesses, although controversy has arisen among the Baltics' growing numbers of Russian immigrants because of new voting laws they consider discriminatory. **********In playing the role of national peacemaker, the leaders of the three Baltic movements once again demonstrated some of the political originality that has helped make their campaign one of the most confounding problems faced by the Moscow Government. **********The peace talks were announced as greater calm was reported in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, which stormed by central Government soldiers nine days ago when Mr. Gorbachev ordered an end to the civil insurrection mounted there under the banner of the Azerbaijani Popular Front. Incidents of violence were decreasing, but only a few factories were reported operating in the general strike organized by the Popular Front. **********The situation in neighboring Armenia was reported still greatly troubled, with shortages of food and fuel worsening in the general railroad blockade being waged by militants in Armenia, presumably one of the ''humanitarian'' issues to be discussed in Riga. **********As in key parts of Azerbaijan, most factories in Armenia were reported idle in sketchy news reports tightly controlled by the central Government, which has closed the region to Western reporters. **********Schools have no heat, television transmission has been reduced and homes ''frequently'' remain unlit at night in Armenia, according to Tass, the Government press agency, which said more than 100 supply trains stood halted short of the Armenian border. **********Militants Withdrawing **********Officials of the Armenian and Azerbaijani movements said militant gangs had begun withdrawing from one of the most tense regions. This is around the border between Armenia and Nakhichevan, a western part of Azerbaijan on the Iranian border that is separated from the main part of the republic by a strip of Armenia. Weeks of protest there have focused on the related issue of Azerbaijani demands for closer ties to their Islamic kin across the Soviet border with Iran. **********Anda Anspoka, a spokesman for the Latvian Popular Front, said the Riga talks were likely to produce ''a serious document'' that would be signed by the leadership of all five separatist movements. **********Nagorno-Karabakh ''is not the problem of the moment,'' she said, adding that it was excluded from the agenda at the behest of the two principals. **********''It should be solved in a while, when the republics have more freedom,'' she said. **********The problem has only worsened in the two years since long-simmering enmities erupted when the enclave's Christian Armenians demanded independence of the Islamic Azerbaijanis. More than 100 civilians, mostly Armenians, have been killed in fighting in the region. **********Dispute Over Death Total **********In the Baku rebellion, Azerbaijani political demonstrations against Moscow's control degenerated this month into pogroms against the city's minority Armenians. The central Government news reported 125 people died when troops reclaimed authority, but popular front members contend many hundreds more were killed. **********The news of the Baltic peace initiative was not mentioned tonight on the main national news program, ''Vremya.''

Yazov, who was quoted on Friday as telling a group of Soviet journalists in Baku, the regional capital, that the intervention was designed to prevent the Azerbaijani Popular Front from seizing power from the Communists. **********A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said today: ''Certainly we found those comments disturbing, especially if they represent accurately Soviet policy.'' **********Mr. Dubinin, at a news conference designed to convey Soviet policy, said General Yazov had spoken only about measures taken against ''armed activities'' of the Azerbaijan Liberation Front."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/02/business/company-news-oppenheimer-buyout-is-set.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 181, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Company News;   Oppenheimer Buyout Is Set", "print_headline": "Company News;   Oppenheimer Buyout Is Set", "body_text": " **********The Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company said today that it would take part in the acquisition of the Oppenheimer Management Corporation from British and Commonwealth Holdings P.L.C. for about $150 million. **********Massachusetts Mutual, the nation's 11th-largest life insurance company, said members of Oppenheimer's senior management would also participate in the purchase.

The President himself was reported to have been shot in both legs before being taken away. **********By nightfall, there had been no word from a rival rebel faction led by Charles Taylor, which controls much of the country outside the capital. Liberia's civil war began last December when forces of the two rebel leaders invaded from the Ivory Coast, moving into Nimba County, about 300 miles northeast of Monrovia. **********The Liberian Government sent troops and provincial policemen to oust the rebels. By most accounts, the soldiers then went on a rampage, indiscriminately killing and maiming hundreds of unarmed civilians - people they apparently believed were sympathetic to the rebels. At least 400,000 Liberians are believed to have fled across the eastern and northern frontiers to escape the bloodshed, most of them settling in the heavily forested hills of the Ivory Coast and Guinea. **********Split in Rebel Ranks **********In early February, the two rebel leaders split into rival factions, with Mr. Johnson accusing Mr. Taylor of corruption. Mr. Taylor, a former Cabinet member, also had been accused of corruption when he was serving in Mr. Doe's Government; the President charged he embezzled nearly $1 million in Government funds. **********Mr. Johnson also accused Mr. Taylor of having received arms and money from Libya, an accusation Mr. Taylor has denied. **********The war has become increasingly three-sided, with the two rebel factions fighting each other and Mr. Doe trying to hold onto the small fraction of the country - mostly central Monrovia -that his troops still control. **********The bitter rivalry between Mr. Taylor and Mr. Johnson took an unexpected turn in late August, when Mr. Taylor announced that he had signed a cease-fire agreement with President Doe. Mr. Doe and Mr. Johnson were apparently discussing the agreement today when they began to argue and fighting erupted. It was not known what role the West African peacekeeping force had played in the incident, although it reportedly occurred outside its headquarters in Monrovia's port area. **********Court-Martial for Doe **********According to a BBC correspondent with the West African peacekeeping force in Monrovia, Mr. Johnson said tonight that he would court-martial Mr. Doe, a former soldier, but that he did not want to kill him. **********The incident reportedly began when the President, who had only rarely left his heavily fortified executive mansion since July, appeared unexpectedly at the port headquarters of the peacekeeping force. About 10 minutes later, Mr. Johnson and several of his fighters reportedly arrived and began to quarrel with President Doe's bodyguards. The rebel troops then reportedly hunted down the President's soldiers from room to room and slaughtered them. **********Eventually, they grabbed the President and carried him off to their base camp outside the city. Members of the peacekeeping force reportedly made repeated appeals to the two sides, but were unable to stop the fighting. **********Bloody Coup in 1980 **********In 1980, President Doe, a 28-year-old master sergeant who dropped out of the 11th grade, came to power after he and other army noncommissioned officers seized power from President William R. Tolbert, who was shot and bayoneted to death. Ten days later, foreign reporters were invited to watch 13 senior Government officials, including most of the former Cabinet, marched nearly naked through the streets of Monrovia, tied to seaside posts and then executed at point-blank range. **********President Doe's international reputation never fully recovered from that incident. His image has also suffered from persistent accusations of human rights abuses. The State Department's 1989 human rights report, released shortly after the rebel invasion, said, ''Brutality by police and other security officials during the arrest and questioning of individuals is fairly common, and there has been no evidence of Government efforts to halt this practice.'' **********Since Mr. Doe came to power, more than 20 senior Government officials and army officers have been executed on charges of plotting coups."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/24/business/french-publishing-feud-ends-up-in-the-courts.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1990-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 521, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "French Publishing Feud Ends Up in the Courts", "print_headline": "French Publishing Feud Ends Up in the Courts", "body_text": " **********The family feud that has convulsed Editions Gallimard for the last two months ended up in court today when Antoine Gallimard's brother and two sisters formally challenged his control over France's most prestigious publisher. **********The Trade Tribunal of Paris said it would rule on April 2 in the suit brought by Christian, Francoise and Isabelle Gallimard, who assert that their ailing father, Claude, acted improperly in transferring large blocks of his shares to Antoine in 1984 and 1987. **********Until then, each of Claude's children controlled 12.5 percent of the family-run company.

Spain, for example, waited until today to announce it was sending one frigate, two corvettes and an auxiliary ship to the gulf. **********France, which over the past two weeks has sought to emphasize its independent posture in the Iraqi crisis, also stressed today that it now shared the position of its Western allies. French officials said President Francois Mitterrand held a long telephone conversation with President Bush on Monday evening. **********Action From Paris **********Today, Mr. Mitterrand said at a news conference that France had responded positively to a request for personnel and materiel from ''different countries of the region'' and would be sending ''reconnaissance squadrons from the ground forces'' to the United Arab Emirates. He did not disclose how many troops would be involved. **********Barely one week after France criticized American and British threats to stop ships suspected of trading with Iraq, Mr. Mitterrand also noted that ''an embargo without sanctions would be a sham.'' He added that only he could order French warships to fire on foreign vessels, although he acknowledged that the crisis had now entered ''a logic of war.'' **********With 8 French and 3 British warships, a total of 32 naval vessels have now been mobilized by European countries as a result of the Iraqi crisis.

A global relief effort got under way and a stunned nation began to grasp the magnitude of the disaster, which killed thousands and laid waste to a region half the size of New York State. **********The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 29,000 people had been killed and 28,000 injured in the quake, which shook northern Iran early Thursday. United Nations relief officials in Geneva quoted the Iranian Foreign Ministry as saying at least 35,000 had died and more than 100,000 had been injured. **********Toll Expected to Rise **********The numbers were only rough estimates based on surveys taken amid widespread confusion and crippled communications. Iranian leaders said the toll was expected to rise in the coming days as relief teams using bulldozers, dogs and bare hands search the rubble of more than 100 cities, towns and villages that were heavily damaged or destroyed. There was no estimate of the number of victims still trapped in rubble. **********The Iranian Red Crescent Society estimated that 400,000 people were left homeless by the temblor, which struck heaviest in Zanjan and Gilan provinces, a densely populated region of mountains, plains, hilly farmland and beach resorts in Iran's Caspian Sea coast area. **********The earthquake, which struck at 12:30 A.M. Thursday, was measured at Teheran University at 7.3 on the Richter scale, indicating a severe quake. It combined with more than 100 aftershocks to cause huge landslides that blocked roads and relief convoys, knocked out electricity and water supplies in many areas, destroyed crops and left many villages isolated and thousands of people buried in the rubble of their homes. **********Villages and Towns Wiped Out **********''For the next 10 days, we will be digging through the ruins for corpses,'' an official of the Red Crescent Society said today after returning from the stricken region. **********''There are dozens of villages, particularly in Gilan, that have completely disappeared,'' he added. ''Whole towns were flattened as if they never were there. We have no way of getting to many, because the roads are blocked by falling boulders and rocks, and planes have had difficulty landing in the mountains.'' **********Iranian television showed masked rescuers in white aprons pulling dust-covered bodies from under jagged chunks of concrete and placing them on blocks of ice in open trucks, and survivors as if in a daze rummaging through the remains of homes for loved ones and possessions. **********Airborne cameras captured mile after mile of flattened homes and apartment buildings. Hospitals were shown overflowing with victims, including Shakineh Shevediny, a 16-year-old from the village of Manjil, in Gilan province, who recalled waking to find herself buried in debris. **********''I could hear the screams of my grandfather,'' she said. After many hours, she was rescued. **********''But it was too late for grandfather and my little brother,'' she went on. ''We waited for help on the street. Again at noon, another strong earthquake came, and again and again, until nothing was left of the village.'' **********Elsewhere in Manjil, a woman held her dead daughter in her arms as workers unearthed the body of another daughter. And a man in Rudbar, a mountainside village in Gilan province, told Iranian television that ''a rock as big as a building'' had crushed his home, killing four of his six children. His wife lay in the ruins for hours before help came. **********'Not a Single House' **********''There is not a single house in this area that has been left standing,'' said Ali Mohammadi, a farmer in Rudbar, where at least 6,000 people were reported to have been killed. **********Rescuers used dogs to search for victims and survivors trapped beneath the rubble, and relief officials said in television interviews that thousands had been found alive. Television broadcasts from Rasht, the capital of Gilan province, showed young men frantically digging for victims, cranes lifting concrete slabs and bulldozers clearing roads for ambulances and other rescue vehicles. **********About 3,000 trained relief workers and 3,000 tons of supplies were flown into the stricken areas northwest of Teheran aboard 50 flights today, officials of the Red Crescent Society said. Earlier, bad weather and poor visibility had hampered the airlift. **********The Teheran airport was thronged with people trying to reach the quake zone to learn the fate of relatives, but only relief flights were going through. Iranian news reporters were in the stricken area, but foreign reporters were not allowed to travel there. Iranian authorities said they would be allowed into the area on Monday or Tuesday. **********As military helicopters, C-130 transport planes and special Iran Air flights ferried medical personnel and tons of supplies into the region and flew 6,000 injured survivors out to hospitals in Teheran and other cities, President Hashemi Rafsanjani said the death toll was bound to rise as rescue teams reached thus-far inaccessible towns. **********President Asks for Aid **********''Realistic casualty figures would be a lot higher than those already announced,'' President Rafsanjani said as he stood beside a helicopter in the destroyed village of Rudbar and appealed for foreign assistance. ''Everyone is helping,'' he said, ''but with a calamity this disastrous, nothing could be enough.'' **********Despite Iran's recent history of diplomatic isolation, many nations rushed to offer humanitarian assistance and condolences. Those offering aid includied Iran's bitter enemy Iraq and the United States, which has not forgotten the 444 days when 52 members of the American Embassy staff here were held hostage in 1979-80. **********''I convey my sincerest condolences and declare that we are ready to provide any assistance you may require,'' Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, said in a message to President Rafsanjani. Iran and Iraq each sustained heavy losses in their Persian Gulf war from 1980 to 1988. **********The Red Cross in Geneva said Iran had requested antibiotics, tents and blankets, surgical equipment and thread, blood bags, food, vehicles and heavy equipment to lift and move rubble. It said the Red Crescent Society had indicated that doctors, technicians and other medical personnel were not needed. **********Offers of assistance were received from the European Community, France, Britain, Japan, Israel, Syria, Finland, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Greece, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Poland and other countries. **********Tons of Supplies Sent **********Tons of supplies and relief workers were being flown to Iran today, and many more planeloads were expected over the weekend. A senior official in Washington said Iran had accepted the Bush Administration's offer of aid, and the American Red Cross said the organization was raising money for earthquake relief in Iran. **********While the full extent of casualties and destruction was unknown, it appears that the quake was the worst ever to strike Iran and - if the casualty estimates hold true or become worse - the world's worst since 200,000 people, by official estimates, died in an earthquake at Tangshan, China, in 1976. Other estimates say as many as 800,000 people may have died in that quake. Iran's worst previous quake killed 25,000 in 1978. **********The quake caused damage estimated in the billions of dollars, ravaged one of Iran's major farming regions and could have serious implications for the nation's economy. **********The deaths of thousands of laborers, the need to rebuild vast tracts of housing and commercial property, the destruction of irrigation systems and large crops of fruit, rice and wheat are all expected to have major effect on an economy already strained by years of war. **********Reza Asghari, an insurance salesman, reached by telephone, said many people were stranded on the streets of Rasht looking for relatives and children. He described the damages in the city as minor compared with surrounding villages like Fuman, Manjil and Rudbar. The Islamic Republic News Agency said the town of Abbar was 100 percent destroyed. The Loshan Dam near Manjil was said to have been damaged by cracks and flooded surrounding areas, the agency said. **********In Zanjan province, 4,000 bodies were found and more than 8,000 people were injured, reports indicated early today. In many areas, not a single structure was left standing. The towns and cities of Teheran, Qum, Hamadan, Arak, Saveh, Mahallat and Ashtian suffered minor damage to buildings. **********Groups Taking Aid Donations Adventist Development and Relief International, 12501 Old Columbia Pike, Silver Spring, Md. 20904. **********American Jewish World Service, 1290 **********Avenue of the Americas, 11th floor, New York, N.Y. 10104. **********American Red Cross, Iran Earthquake **********Disaster, P.

These executives, people like Sally McKinney, a former vice president at Seamen's Bank for Savings who decided to write a novel rather than find another job after Seamen's was taken over by the Government in the savings and loan bailout last spring, have found a way to reap the benefits of executive life while leaving the disadvantages behind. **********They have become temporary executives. \"I've spent 20 years in corporations, and I've been through outplacement twice, when my companies went under,\" said Ms. McKinney. \"It's a good feeling to think I'm finally in charge.\" **********For temporary executives, the work is everything. Solving problems, finishing projects and completing specific tasks are more important than the more social aspects of corporate jobs. These executives are willing to give up the particular brand of security, identity and competition that comes with working for a company on a permanent basis for the instant and more fleeting rewards of \"temping.\" **********\"Now when I hear about jobs I want,\" said Ms. McKinney, \"it's more the challenge of the particular job that I like than the structure of the position.\" **********In these sluggish times, the attraction of temporary executives, who often have an M.B.A. and typically 10 years of managerial experience, is obvious. Companies may pay them $500 a day for three months or so, but they don't have to commit to bonuses, benefits or a salary over the long term. **********\"Many companies also use them to replace temporarily an executive who has been lost unexpectedly to another company, or who has gotten sick or died,\" said Kieran Hackett, president of the Executive Source, a Manhattan search firm that provides temporary executives to companies. \"And small companies can use the expertise of a temp without spending the money to hire someone permanently.\" **********There are also some less obvious benefits for companies that use temporary executives. \"You're an outsider, so you see things more objectively in the company,\" said Roberta Schlaifer Semer, a temporary executive with a master's degree in clinical psychology. \"People tend to talk to you much easier about problems because you have no vested interests. As a result, you can usually help point out problems more effectively than others who are there day in and day out.\" **********While temporary executives have roles that sound suspiciously like those of business consultants, Mr. Hackett says they actually differ. \"These temporary executives are implementers -- they do the project, run the office, whatever,\" he said. \"They do not just limit themselves to doing an overall analysis of problems and recommendations, like most consultants do.\" **********For those executives who decide to take up temping, the job provides the perfect solution to a whole host of life-style problems they may have been confronting. When Ms. McKinney decided to write a novel instead of finding a new job, she quickly discovered that writing would not pay the rent and that she missed her executive income. **********After offering her services to a temporary executive search firm, she landed an assignment last July at a major foreign bank with its American headquarters in New York. As the bank's interim manager of employee benefits, Ms. McKinney, who is in her 40's, works three days a week doing such tasks as writing up benefits plans and compiling data on pension plans. **********She spends the rest of her time working on her book. \"I know this job won't last forever,\" she said. \"But while it does it's great. My time there is very pure. I'm there only to do the job they've hired me for and that gives me great freedom.\" **********Other executives turn to temping to relieve the boredom of everyday corporate life. \"I like the excitement of creating a whole new thing -- of going in, finding the problem and actually fixing it,\" explained Ms. Semer.\"For example, at the first company I worked for as a temp, I set up an entire computer system. But it would bore me to tears to have to sit there and run it. -- the challenge for me was in getting it up and running.\" **********But all good things come with a price. The very qualities temporary executives seek in choosing such a style of life, like the ability to work only at their leisure, can pose major problems. \"I'm basically just a high-priced Kelly Girl,\" said Ms. McKinney. \"I don't get paid if I don't work, so if I get sick, it can be a disaster. I have to provide my own benefits, which are expensive, and my own retirement funds.\" **********Starting a new job over and over again can also be emotionally wearing. The first day at any new office is usually a nightmare: Meeting new people, learning the office politics and finding one's way around the building is hard enough. Imagine going through the process all the time. \"You've got to be incredibly flexible and very pleasant,\" said Ms. Semer. \"You're cutting in on someone else's space. Sometimes people look sort of funny at you -- they don't believe you're not after their job. I brought cookies in to work early on to kind of warm people up, and I keep candy on my desk so that if people are really stressed out, they can stop by, take a piece of candy and chat.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/05/world/as-soviet-oil-becomes-a-trickle-havel-seeks-gorbachev-meeting.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 472, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Soviet Oil Becomes a Trickle, Havel Seeks Gorbachev Meeting", "print_headline": "As Soviet Oil Becomes a Trickle, Havel Seeks Gorbachev Meeting", "body_text": " **********The Czechoslovak Prime Minister met today with the Soviet Ambassador in an effort to resolve a crisis here as new measures were announced to stop panic buying of gasoline. **********Prime Minister Marian Calfa said he and President Vaclav Havel want urgently to meet with President Mikhail S.

Although banks have generally avoided buying the loans and real estate holdings of savings institions, they have viewed purchases of consumer deposits and branches as an inexpensive way to expand in one of the most profitable parts of the banking business. **********So far this year, commercial banks have bought $43.8 billion of deposits from savings institutions in 185 transactions, up from $11.2 billion of deposits in 41 deals during 1989, according to SNL Securities, a banking research concern in Charlottesville, Va. Excluding deals with failed savings institutions controlled by the Resolution Trust Company, banks have bought $9 billion of savings institutions' deposits this year, up from $2.5 billion in 1989. **********Manufacturers Hanover agreed to pay $16.5 million in the first quarter of next year for the Goldome deposits. Edward D. Miller, vice chairman at Manufactuers Hanover, estimated that it would take about 18 months for the company to recoup the purchase price from profits generated by the branches. Late last year, Manufacturers Hanover paid $65 million for $1.2 billion of deposits at 11 Goldome branches in New York City. **********\"It is more of a buyer's market now, with a greater availability of branches from thrifts,\" Mr. Miller said. **********Purchasing branches is popular with bankers because it is a cheaper way to expand than opening new branches. In New York City, where Manufacturers Hanover is in tight competition with Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan to be the second-leading bank in the consumer market after Citibank, Mr. Miller said it could take five years for a new branch to become profitable. **********Chase Manhattan has also been an active branch buyer recently, having acquired 25 branches with nearly $2.8 billion of deposits since April.  Avoiding Wholesale Money **********Large New York City banks have sought to expand their local branch networks in recent years as a way to reduce their reliance on borrowing money in wholesale markets. Because of Federal deposit insurance, consumers are generally reluctant to shift funds, even if they know their bank has losses and lower credit ratings. But corporate treasurers and other institutions in the wholesale markets, whose large deposits are not insured, are much quicker to withdraw funds at signs of weakness or trouble. **********\"The acquisition is a terrific positive for Manufacturers Hanover,\" said Judah Kraushaar, a banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. \"It allows them to use the new deposits to replace more expensive funds borrowed in the wholesale market.\" **********Officials at Manufactuers Hanover estimated that the cost of consumer deposits was three-quarters of a percentage point to a full percentage point lower than the millions in Eurodollar deposits they will replace. **********Despite the acquisition, Manufacturers Hanover's stock fell 75 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $18.625. Goldome, which earned a profit last quarter but is looking for investors to restore its badly depleted capital, closed at 62.5 cents a share, up 6.25 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Manufacturers Hanover said it would close three of Goldome's Manhattan branches that are near existing Manufacturers Hanover offices. Of the remaining 10 branches, two are in Manhattan, one is in the Bronx, two each are in Westchester and Orange Counties and three are in Rockland County. Goldome will retain 32 branches in western New York, 37 in Florida and 10 in central New York. **********The branch sales are part of Goldome's strategy of concentrating on local consumer business. It has abandoned its strategy of the 1980's, when it bought other savings institutions and was doing business in almost every state. Goldome has contracted to $12.8 billion of assets from about $15 billion at the end of 1988.

The airline could also fly over the Pacific to Anchorage and on to San Francisco. **********United States carriers, including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, plan to apply to the Transportation Department to fly some of the new routes, hoping that, as tensions ease between the two nations, business and tourist traffic will increase. **********But even though the number of passengers flying Pan Am's Soviet routes has grown by 195 percent since 1987, to 58,638 last year from 19,892, the airline said the recent events in the Eastern bloc had not increased traffic to the Soviet Union, although they may when the tourist season reaches its peak in the summer. **********Although Pan Am has been flying between New York and Moscow without interruption for three years and has four nonstop flights a week, the Soviet Union remains ''a tough market,'' according to John P. McCaffrey, vice president of industry. **********Pan Am has been able to get only a small number of Soviet passengers because all tickets in the Soviet Union must be bought through Aeroflot. Only when Aeroflot sells out its own flights will it sell seats on other airlines, he said, and that rarely happens. **********''There is no way to beat a state monopoly when they control the sale of the tickets,'' said Daniel Kasper, an expert on international aviation at Harbridge House. **********Need for Tourists **********For this reason, American carriers entering the Soviet market would have to rely mostly on passengers from the United States to fill their flights. And that means mostly tourists, because, according to Mr. Kasper, business activity between the two countries has been sparse, producing few of the business travelers who tend to pay full fare and help an airline keep its routes profitable when tourist traffic is light. **********One way both countries hope to encourage tourism is to answer complaints that hotel accommodations in the Soviet Union are inadequate. Many hotel-related joint ventures are currently under way, including one by Aeroflot, the Moscow City Council and the Sheraton Corporation to build a Sheraton Hotel in Moscow by 1993. **********Additional American carriers will also face tough competition from strong European carriers, including British Airways and Lufthansa, which have been serving the Soviet market for a long time. **********In order to help fill its planes, Pan Am has arranged with Aeroflot to, in effect, lease half of its planes to the Soviet carrier, which then pays half the expenses and sells Pan Am seats as if they were its own seats. **********Mr. McCaffrey said Pan Am's flights have in recent years been operating just a little better than break-even as a result of the agreement. **********Currency Problems **********Even if Aeroflot agrees in negotiations to give up some of its monopoly, Mr. McCaffrey said, Soviet customers can pay only in rubles, which cannot be converted into other currencies. He said rubles could not even be used to pay for expenses incurred by Pan Am in the Soviet Union; the country wants to be paid in dollars or other hard currencies. **********Air service between the United States and the Soviet Union has been affected by the prevailing political climates of the past. President Jimmy Carter ordered Aeroflot to stop its flights to New York after the Soviet military incursion into Afghanistan in 1979. Pan Am also had to suspend its flights to the Soviet Union. And President Ronald Reagan stopped Aeroflot service to Washington in 1981 in retaliation for a Soviet crackdown in Poland. **********Flights began again in April 1986, and the two countries agreed last month to cooperate in air-traffic control for flights between Alaska and Siberia, clearing the way for flights across the Bering Strait."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/04/business/your-taxes-hiring-a-preparers-can-ease-the-pain.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Sloane", "pub_date": "1990-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1581, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Hiring a Preparers Can Ease the Pain", "print_headline": "YOUR TAXES;   Hiring a Preparers Can Ease the Pain", "body_text": " **********THE 50 million Americans who will pay someone to prepare their income tax returns this year face an important choice: what kind of service to use. **********Tax preparers charge anywhere from $12 to several thousand dollars, depending on the complexity of the return and their own qualifications, which vary widely. **********''Anyone can set up shop and hang out a shingle as a tax preparer,'' the Council of Better Business Bureaus warns in a brochure. ''Tax preparers range from the amateur to the professional.'' **********The Internal Revenue Service defines a tax preparer as anyone who receives compensation for preparing all or a major part of the return for another individual. This includes lawyers, certified public accountants and enrolled agents, who have met the education standards of their professions; personnel trained by the tax preparation services that employ them, and untrained people who are simply cashing in on the tax season. **********Despite the complexities of tax law, there are no nationally recognized educational requirements for preparers, so clients should ask preparers what their credentials are. **********Most people who pay someone to help with their returns choose a commercial tax-preparation service. Employees of such firms typically work on a seasonal basis, from January through the filing deadline - April 16 this year - and come from a variety of educational and employment backgrounds. Although some local services are operated by men or women who do not have specialized experience in tax preparation, the national chains usually have their own training programs to insure that their preparers meet company-wide standards. **********One person using a tax-preparation service this year is Eutisha McClain, a clerk in Kansas City, Mo., who has a relatively simple return. ''They know what they're doing, and they won't mess up my taxes,'' she said. **********Dagmar O'Connor, a New York psychologist and author, decided to use a certified public accounting firm. ''It makes me feel safer,'' she said. ''I'll get more money back, if it's done right.'' **********And the client can help be sure it's done right, by providing adequate, well-organized information. If the taxpayer walks in with a shoe box filled with papers and tells the preparer to make sense out of it, the fee will probably be higher than it would be if information and documents applying to the taxes were better organized. **********The more substantiation for deductions the taxpayer provides, the better organized the papers are and the more honest the taxpayer is in discussions with the preparer, the less time will be required by the person paid to do the work. **********For routine returns, the storefront tax services with their big, unpartitioned rooms and absence of privacy may be adequate. Their average fees are about $50, with the cost normally dependent on the number and type of tax forms filed. **********For instance, one national chain charges only $12 if a taxpayer is filing Form 1040EZ, the simplest of the Federal forms for single filers with no dependents. Yet that same chain charges $85 to a self-employed individual who files a standard Form 1040 with a number of extra schedules attached. **********Thomas M. Bloch, president of H & R Block, the country's largest commercial preparer, said his company also has an executive tax service, which has an average fee of $100. **********''It's for people who prefer a more private type of environment,'' he added. ''The quality of the return isn't different, but the amenities are different.'' **********The next level of sophistication among tax preparers is the little-known category of enrolled agents. These are people who have been certified by the I.R.S. after having worked at least five years as a tax auditor or passing a Federal test. The name ''enrolled agent'' comes from the fact that they are authorized to represent taxpayers before the revenue service. **********''When you get into an area where people have a number of limited partnerships, you want someone who is better qualified'' than a commercial tax preparer, said Bess Messmer, an enrolled agent with a tax practice in Colonial Heights, Va. She said that enrolled agents have the specialized knowledge required for complex returns. **********According to Ms. Messmer, enrolled agents charge by the number of forms prepared, by the hour or by a combination of the two. For filling out simple Federal and state returns for an individual, the price generally ranges from $75 to $150; if a business schedule is added to the return, the cost might go up to $250. **********Certified public accountants who specialize in taxes are not only highly skilled in accounting matters, but also serve as tax advisers. They must have a college degree or the equivalent in work experience, pass a stiff state professional qualifying examination, meet the appropriate continuing education requirements and receive accreditation from the state. As a result, the Better Business Bureau Council pamphlet noted, many people consider C.P.A.'s ''the top of the line'' in tax assistance. **********''Clearly a wage earner who has a W-2 form from an employer and a couple of interest slips doesn't need a sophisticated tax preparer,'' said Robert L. Israeloff, executive partner of Israeloff, Trattner & Company, a certified public accounting firm based in Valley Stream, L.I. ''But when you believe your financial situation is a little more complicated than the ordinary - certainly around the $75,000 level - that's the point when you should seek a professional like us.'' **********Directly or indirectly, most C.P.A.'s set their fees on an hourly basis, with charges typically ranging from $50 to $250 an hour. Many have minimum fees ranging from $250 to $500 for tax preparation. **********The work of tax attorneys appeals primarily to people who want to shelter part of their income. These lawyers - who have passed a state bar examination and may have special tax education and experience - are often consulted on complicated tax-planning matters and are usually well-informed on tax laws and their applications. **********''The practice of taxation is the practice of law,'' said Alexander Gurevitch, a tax lawyer in Pearl River, N.Y. ''A knowledge of what the proper deduction is might well depend sometimes on a Federal law and the interpretation of that law.'' **********''The role of the lawyer is more of giving advice and resolving disputes,'' observed Mortimer Caplin, a partner of the Washington law firm of Caplin & Drysdale and a former I.R.S. commissioner. ''Even though an accountant may be preparing a return, a particular issue may come up, and you may also need the talents of a lawyer.'' **********Legal fees, also set on an hourly basis, are the highest for any tax preparer. The hourly range is about $75 to $350 an hour, depending on the city, with minimum fees between $750 and $1,500. **********One step in picking a tax preparer is to ask professional societies, like the national office or state chapters of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American Association of Attorney Certified Public Accountants or the National Association of Enrolled Agents, for the names of a few in the area. Another technique is simply to ask for referrals from friends and colleagues. Then call or visit a few practitioners and ask questions about fees and services. **********''You want to feel comfortable with your adviser,'' said Herbert Paul, a New York C.P.A. and lawyer. ''You want to make sure you have the same chemistry.'' **********Martin Leventhal, senior partner of the New York certified public accounting firm of Leventhal, Zupnick, Berg & Company, added, ''It's like a family physician - you have a personal relationship.'' **********This year, more than half the 109 million Americans who will file individual returns will pay a preparer, and among the key questions to ask in selecting the preparer are: *********** What is your training and experience in preparing tax returns? *********** How many tax forms do you complete each year, and will you have enough time to devote to my return? *********** Will the person who interviews me be the same person who actually prepares the tax forms? *********** Is the accuracy of your work checked manually or by computer to determine if there are mathematical errors or errors in the interpretation of tax rules? *********** If my return is audited, can you - and will you - represent me, and what will you charge? *********** How long will it take between the interview and the completion of all the forms? *********** How much will it cost to prepare my taxes and how is that fee determined? **********Steve Pyrek, a spokesman for the I.R.S., warns taxpayers to ''watch out for anyone who promises to get you a refund. And watch out for anyone who bases fees on the size of the refund. You're responsible for the return, even if it is prepared by somebody else.'' **********At the end of the tax-preparation process, when the return is completed, the taxpayer should make sure the preparer has signed it, complete with Social Security number. Before signing it, the client should verify the information and contact the preparer if there are any discrepancies. The taxpayer should never sign a blank return."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/29/world/managua-journal-uniting-the-germanys-in-a-latin-american-setting.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1990-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1010, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Managua Journal;   Uniting the Germanys, in a Latin American Setting", "print_headline": "Managua Journal;   Uniting the Germanys, in a Latin American Setting", "body_text": " **********If there is an important political upheaval in the world, you can probably find out about it by checking the stack of work in Georg Boomgaarden's in-basket. **********The transformation of Eastern Europe: a bureaucratic nightmare. The fall of the Sandinista Government: more paperwork. German reunification: a blizzard of complications. **********Mr. Boomgaarden, the soft-spoken West German Ambassador in this poor Latin American capital, is hardly an obvious partner in the grand deal making that has reshaped world politics. But his job as the envoy of a fast-changing country has turned his embassy into an impossibly busy back-office of diplomacy, scrambling to sort out the accounts from a yearlong binge of international change that has all, it seems, found its way back to Mr. Boomgaarden's desk. **********''We all think we've got problems,'' said another diplomat here. ''But when you see what the Germans are up against, you want to say a prayer.'' **********Embassy Was Tightly Watched **********The trouble began last fall when Mr. Boomgaarden's West German homeland, a critic of the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua, began talking about reconciling with East Germany, a prominent ally of the Sandinistas and sponsor of the Sandinista spying apparatus that, among other things, kept a tight watch on Mr. Boomgaarden's embassy. **********That set of complications was multiplied when the Sandinista Government was defeated in elections here on Feb. 25, reversing the local alliances and status of the two Germanys, and turning both countries' trade and aid relationships with Nicaragua into a tangle of administrative and commercial contradictions. **********The Ambassador's problems were then compounded again when the fast-merging Germanys and the new Nicaraguan Government announced plans for large-scale privatization and the return of confiscated property, throwing into doubt the legal standing and future ownership of thousands of contracts, commitments, loans and credits on all sides, not to mention dozens of embassy houses in Managua and Berlin. **********When the formal reunification of Germany comes on Oct. 3, the good news for Mr. Boomgaarden will be that he automatically inherits all of the local property and staff of the former East Germany, whose embassy here is six times larger than his own. **********Assuming Economic Burden **********The bad news is that he will also assume responsibility for political and economic problems that include an estimated $500 million in East German debts, hundreds of byzantine barter and aid arrangements, dozens of giant unproductive East German investment projects, an unfinished rice mill, Nicaragua's busiest hospital and a grade school with no teachers. **********The large intelligence apparatus manned here by agents of East Germany's secret police agency, the Stasi, collapsed after the agency's headquarters in Berlin was ransacked by demonstrators. But that abrupt departure has only left more diplomatic detritus for Mr. Boomgaarden and his embassy to cope with, including a set of unfulfilled secret contracts between the Stasi and the Sandinista Interior Ministry that the former Sandinista security chief, Tomas Borge Martinez, has publicly demanded must be paid off. **********''He does not seem to realize that the whole institution has vanished,'' a German diplomat said, somewhat perplexed. **********Sorting out the financial web that linked East Germany and the former Sandinista Government has been complicated by the chaos of Nicaragua's own change in government, which has scattered key files and bureaucrats, and drawn a line that never before existed between the state and Sandinista party. **********Conflicting Sets of Numbers **********Looming over everything, moreover, is the problem of what numbers to begin counting. On the East German side, tens of millions of dollars in trade contracts must now be translated into West German marks under complex protocols unifying the German currency. Nicaragua, on the other hand, now has two completely different currencies circulating at the same time, each floating on a bewildering three-tier exchange rate and with hyperinflation that changes prices by the hour. **********As the pace of German reunification accelerated last spring, Mr. Boomgaarden began a series of weekly meetings with his East German counterpart, Matthias Dietrich, focusing particularly on humanitarian aid. **********''We have made a special effort to avoid development ruins - aid projects abandoned in midstream,'' Mr. Boomgaarden said in a rare public comment about his labors. ''That was not the kind of monument we wanted to leave to German reunification.'' **********A recent West German aid mission gave preliminary approval to a plan that will maintain all of the principal East German aid projects here, turning Nicaragua overnight into one of the principal centers of future German aid in Latin America. **********The smooth cooperation between the two embassies has permitted departing East German diplomats to obtain help with crucial but unfamiliar requirements of their lives in a reunified Germany, like setting up personal checking accounts. **********A Change for East Germans **********It has also meant a rather fundamental turnaround for other East German citizens living here, who formerly could not even go to the movies without embassy permission. Under West German privacy laws, Mr. Boomgaarden's staff must ask each of them for permission before even keeping their names on his embassy's courtesy file of local German residents. **********A few key details still remain to be ironed out. At the stroke of midnight on Oct. 3, East German officials here will lose their special status and, as ordinary Germans without a Nicaragua visa, will turn abruptly into illegal aliens. **********But they can celebrate their country's reunification at a elegant reception that is also on the agenda on Oct. 3 at Mr. Boomgaarden's embassy. And as newly minted Westerners, they will be able for the first time to leave Nicaragua and travel home freely through neighboring countries, even the United States. **********When that moment arrives, Mr. Boomgaarden will take a few hours out to preside over the champagne and the cheers - before he gets back to work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/02/business/sec-looks-at-interstate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

The Communist Party has lost over half its members here, reducing it to about 50,000, the bulk of them Serbs who are locked in a struggle with the more numerous Albanians for control of Kosovo. **********Former Communists Join League **********A number of former Communists have joined the league and Mr. Rugova said that more than 2,000 members were ''non-Albanians,'' including some Serbs and Montenegrins. **********The league's program, issued by Mr. Rugova and his executive board, endorses general democratic principles, including a multiparty parliamentary system and an independent judiciary.

Mr. Rugova and his associates have been denounced in the Belgrade press. **********Mr. Rugova's answer to the charge is that the league is simply seeking ''greater autonomy'' for Kosovo, which was established as an autonomous province of Serbia. The Serbian authorities essentially overruled that autonomy last year, and have moved to impose direct rule from Belgrade. **********Mr. Rugova's associate, Veton Surroi, a 28-year-old journalist, said that he saw Kosovo becoming a ''federal unit'' of a Yugoslavia under a new constitution. The current Constitution established six republics and made Vojvodina and Kosovo autonomous provinces of Serbia, the largest republic. **********''We want to apply democracy to Kosovo,'' Mr. Surroi said, ''with a free parliament, an end to martial law, and the freeing of political prisoners.'' **********There is little autonomy to be seen these days in Kosovo, where in the wake of violent clashes the army and special federal and Serbian riot police units are deployed.

Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation and head of the panel. ''Program trading is not the single big issue, the big bad bear.'' **********Another conclusion of the panel was that regulation of the stock and stock index futures markets be unified under one Federal agency. A proposal for such authority is pending in Congress, and the battle has already become heated. **********The panel, which included the heads of corporations like A.T.&T. and International Paper, was formed amid the public outcry after the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 190 points in the final 90 minutes of trading on Oct. 13. **********Although the Big Board group, the Market Volatility and Investor Confidence Panel, recommended increased restrictions on a controversial form of program trading, the members concluded that the computer-assisted investing technique was an ''appropriate'' activity for investors. **********But one panel member, an outspoken critic of the form of program trading known as stock index arbitrage, described the panel's meetings over the last six months as contentious and complained that other members were unwilling to compromise on a number of subjects. **********''The recommendations are fine, but they don't go far enough,'' said Stephen B. Timbers, a senior vice president of Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, who has criticized Wall Street firms for program trading. **********Because the panel was dominated by members from the Wall Street brokerage firms and corporations whose stocks are listed on the exchange, some investors said its conclusions highlighted the rivalry between the stock market in New York and the stock index futures market in Chicago. **********Reaction Is Mixed **********Wall Street reaction to the recommendations was mixed. In general, however, the proposed restrictions, which would apply to stock, options and futures markets, would be likely to convince individuals that another huge one-day drop would not occur, professional investors said. ''In the end it will restore investor confidence,'' said Howard Stein, chairman of the Dreyfus Corporation, a large mutual fund organization. **********The panel also found that investors were more worried about the honesty of brokers than about program trading. [Market Place, page D10.]  A number of traders and financial executives were pleased with the recommendation for a single regulator but were disturbed by the call for the ''circuit breakers'' that would halt trading after specific market moves. ''I'm personally very nervous about circuit breakers,'' said Donald Marron, chairman of Paine Webber Group Inc. **********The proposed restrictions were seen as virtually insuring that there would be no repetition of the situation on Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow fell more than 500 points. The panel recommended trading halts of various lengths after moves of 100, 200, 300 and 400 points. If the Dow rose or fell 400 points in a single day, the market would close for the day. **********The halts were viewed as giving investors time to learn more about the sudden price moves. But such restrictions will make it more difficult for investors to sell stocks during market turmoil, said the chief executive of a large communications company. ''Somebody who says I want out cannot limit his losses,'' said Charles Wohlstetter, the chairman of the Contel Corporation. **********Relaxation on Buybacks **********The panel also urged that during turmoil the rules governing corporate buybacks of stock should be relaxed. The day after the 1987 crash, the market got a lift when a number of corporations said they would buy back their securities. **********The panel endorsed an exchange proposal that would require firms engaging in arbitrage to use it in a ''stabilizing'' manner after 50-point moves in the Dow. For practical purposes, exchange officials said, nearly all index arbitrage would be impossible after such a move. **********Wall Street firms that abandoned the practice for their own accounts will not immediately resume such trading, some executives said. Spokesmen at Morgan Stanley & Company and Salomon Brothers, two firms that were among the biggest users of the technique in recent years, said the firms would not resume such trades for their own accounts. **********The proposals must be approved by an array of regional stock exchanges and Federal regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Current trading restrictions of stocks are handled by the various exchanges and the S.E.C., while regulation of the futures and options markets is under the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the commodity commission. **********Bitter Battle Expected **********Earlier this month a bill was introduced in the Senate to transfer jurisdiction of the futures contracts to the S.E.C. Lobbyists for the exchanges expect this battle to be a bitter one. **********In Chicago, where stock index futures contracts are traded on the Merc, officials disagreed with the panel's recommendation for one regulator. In a statement released yesterday the exchange said a single Federal regulator ''would be unnecessary and detrimental to the best interests of United States financial markets.'' **********The panel did not find widespread evidence of trading abuses by professional investors or brokers although executives on the panel stressed that it was not created as an investigatory group. In fact, the executives recommended that the exchanges and regulators should improve their ability to uncover trading abuses. **********''The paper trail is not as well documented as it should be,'' said James L. Cochrane, senior vice president of the stock exchange. **********No Agency Mentioned **********Even though the Big Board's panel urged that one regulator oversee the financial markets, it deliberately did not mention any agency. Because Wall Street firms have traditionally been regulated by the S.E.C., however, it is widely agreed that this agency is favored. The panel members said they found no evidence that a single regulator would affect volatility in the markets but a majority of the members believe that such a step would improve investor confidence. **********The panel's recommendation for trading halts would replace all other circuit breakers in domestic markets. They would affect trading in all domestic markets and would be coordinated among the stock, futures and options markets around the country. To be adopted, the recommendations would have to be approved by the regional stock exchanges and the S.E.C. **********A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange described the proposals yesterday as ''reasonable and responsible'' but said they would require ''detailed'' study. **********The proposed system would work as follows: Trading in stocks would be halted for one hour if the Dow moved up or down 100 points from the previous day's close. If the average moved 200 points from the previous close, trading would be halted for 90 minutes. Trading would be halted for two hours if the market moved 300 or 400 points. Since the trading day is six and a half hours, the cumulative effect of those halts would be to end trading for the day. **********Price 'Indications' Required **********During the halts, market makers would be required to provide investors with ''indications'' of where prices might trade based on their flow of orders. Such ''shadow'' quotes would give investors a hint of expected trading. **********The panel recommended that after the stock moves, trading in all financial instruments around the country be halted for the same period. **********Since the 1987 crash, executives at the stock exchange and the Chicago Merc have experimented with various trading restrictions in stocks and stock index futures contracts, but there has been little coordination between the markets. After the plunge on Oct. 13, 1989, some traders complained that selling was aggravated because they were unable to sell futures contracts. **********A number of market professionals said yesterday that if the proposals were adopted and trading was halted in all domestic markets, institutional investors would be likely to seek to trade in London and Tokyo. ''The era of global capital markets is here, and if the stock exchange doesn't want to fill the need we'll go elsewhere,'' said Michael A. Petrino, president of Matrix Capital Management, a Stamford, Conn., firm that invests $1 billion for pension funds. **********Members of Panel **********Following are the members of the panel: **********Roger B.

But a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta could not immediately confirm this. **********No Company-Owned Bottlers **********Like Coca-Cola, Pepsico has no company-owned bottlers in South Africa, but it has about 150 franchised Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and 12 franchised Pizza Hut outlets. **********The Investor Responsibilty Research Center, a nonprofit research firm that focuses on social issues, said that 175 American companies, including Pepsico and Coca-Cola, had a ''nonequity'' interest in South Africa, meaning that they maintain contracts, licenses or franchisees. **********Pepsico, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., said it had no plans to search for another franchisee to sell its soft drinks. ''We're effectively out of the business,'' a spokesman said. **********Pepsi-Cola has long been in a losing battle with Coca-Cola in South Africa. Pepsi's bottler sold about two million cases last year for a market share of about 1.7 percent, in contrast to more than 170 million cases of Coca-Cola for about a 70 percent share, the Pepsico spokesman said. **********Small One May Still Be Left **********There still may be one tiny Pepsi franchisee left, bottling about 10,000 cases annually. ''We're not sure,'' the Pepsico spokesman said. ''But at any rate that's so few cases you could practically carry them away by hand.'' **********Pepsico sold its company-owned facilities to Pepsi-Cola Africa in 1985, following Pepsico's acquisition of those facilities from another troubled bottler. It is Pepsico's normal practice to seek franchisees for foreign bottlers. Indeed, about 95 percent of them are independently owned, rather than company-owned. **********Although political conditions have improved with the release of Nelson Mandela, the black South African leader, ''from an economic point of view,'' the Pepsico spokesman said, ''it just doesn't make any sense to stay with the business.'' **********The company said it had not been able to find a viable bottler, ''and whatever strategic sense it may make, we have to admit that Coca-Cola'' is doing a good job there, the spokesman added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/29/world/pretoria-raids-union-and-seizes-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1990-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pretoria Raids Union and Seizes Leaders", "print_headline": "Pretoria Raids Union and Seizes Leaders", "body_text": " **********The South African police raided the Johannesburg headquarters of the country's biggest black labor federation and arrested several of its senior leaders today after union members reportedly abducted a black undercover agent, assaulted him and then forced him to address a news conference. **********Col. Franz Malherbe, the officer who led the raid, said the detained leaders of the Congress of South African Trade Unions - including Secretary General Jay Naidoo and Assistant Secretary General Sydney Mufamadi - had been seized on charges of being accomplices to an assault. The federation, which is allied to the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party, is widely known by its acronym, Cosatu. **********''This is not an operation related to an unrest situation, but criminal charges that we are investigating,'' Colonel Malherbe said. ''One of our police constables was allegedly removed at about 11:30 A.M. from Rissik Street by Cosatu members, taken to their headquarters and allegedly assaulted.'' The officer said the labor officials could apply for bail after 48 hours in detention as suspects in an assault case. Union officials said they would apply for bail tonight. **********Introduced to Reporters **********Earlier, the purported agent was introduced to reporters at a news conference shortly before the police raid. **********Cosatu officials identified him as Joseph Maleka, who appeared before reporters with a sweater pulled over his head. He said he had been recruited in Sebokeng township, south of Johannesburg, at the weekend and given training in Johannesburg's John Vorster Square police station on Monday in the use of a two-way radio. **********When reporters prevailed upon him to use the radio, a voice at the other end told him to ''turn off your radio or shut up.'' **********Before his arrest, Mr. Naidoo, a well-known labor official, told reporters union supporters had seen Mr. Maleka on Rissik Street, a Johannesburg street that leads past National Acceptances House, the modest high-rise in the downtown area where Cosatu and the National Union of Mineworkers have their headquarters. **********Photographs of Militants **********Mr. Maleka had been carrying a two-way radio and two photographs of Geraldine Fraser, a labor militant recently returned to South Africa from exile. His mission, for which he had been promised the equivalent of $200, was to radio the police when Ms. Fraser left the Cosatu building ''so that they can arrest her,'' Mr. Maleka told reporters. **********It was not clear from his appearance at the news conference if he had been assaulted. Labor officials said they doubted Mr. Maleka's assertion that he had been recruited in recent days and Colonel Malherbe said ''that could have been his cover story.'' **********The incident was the second time in a week that Cosatu leaders have been arrested by the police. Last week Cyril Ramaphosa, the federation's leader, was arrested and later freed on $20 bail for purportedly taking part in an illegal march in Natal. **********Further Strains Seen **********Because of the labor federation's close relationship with the African National Congress, the detentions seem certain to further strain the relationship between the Government and the congress. It came after two weeks of factional violence in black townships in which the congress has accused the police of siding with its adversaries. **********''Unless President de Klerk does something concrete, unless he goes beyond his verbal assuarances and roots out those elements committed to undermining the progressive movements, then we must presume tacit Government support for these actions,'' Mr. Naidoo said before his arrest. **********The township fighting pitted supporters of the A.N.C. against the Zulu Inkatha movement of Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi. **********A Cosatu statement tonight expressed outrage at the arrests, saying that the labor federation's representatives had called the security police to take their supposed undercover agent away.

This official and others who described the weapons purchases spoke on the condition that they not be named. **********The account in The Post stated that roughly $8 million of the $40 million spent in Romania was diverted to Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Ceausescu family, with the rest going to middlemen. **********The arms sales were controlled by Lieut. Gen. Ilie Ceausescu, then Deputy Defense Minister, and Marin Ceausescu, who ran Romania's trade mission in Vienna and who negotiated the sales, the newspaper said. It quoted one unnamed official who said the operation could not have progressed without the knowledge of Nicolae Ceausescu, who, though a hard-line Communist, was a bitter rival of the Soviet Union. **********The retired Pentagon official said today that the Ceausescus' principal motive for selling arms to the West was financial. Confirming The Post's account, he said that in the early 1980's, the Ceausescu network sold the United States an advanced Soviet anti-aircraft system called the Shilka as well as mobile rocket launchers and military radar systems. **********Millions Offered for a Tank **********He confirmed that the Pentagon was prepared to spend millions of dollars in 1981 to secure a Soviet T-72 tank through the Ceausescus, but that the deal fall apart hours before the tank was to be shipped from Romania. **********The Pentagon went on to acquire a T-72 tank in the late 1980's from a Middle Eastern nation, that official said. It has since been supplanted in the Soviet Army by a more modern version. **********As in many other weapons-buying programs, officials said, the Romanian venture was initiated by the Pentagon, which selected the types of Soviet weapons it wished to acquire. Case officers of the Central Intelligence Agency negotiated and paid for the arms. **********The operations directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coordinated the roles of the Pentagon and the C.I.A. to insure that the operation worked smoothly, officials said. Pentagon officials have frequently criticized the C.I.A. for assigning a low priority to arms purchases in the intelligence establishment. **********Looking for an Edge **********Like other Soviet equipment that is purchased, the Romanian-supplied weapons were dismantled and studied by Pentagon experts. The findings were used to design American hardware with a specific technological edge over the Soviet models. **********For example, The Post reported, the Pentagon used its analyses of Soviet radar acquired from Romania to design Stealth aircraft that could evade radar detection. **********Two Pentagon officials said today that Romania generally did not receive the most advanced Soviet weaponry because of its strained ties with Moscow. Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, all closely allied with the Soviets in the 1980's, were considered more attractive targets for the secret buying program, they said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/world/did-gangs-benefit-from-papal-visit.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1990-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DID GANGS BENEFIT FROM PAPAL VISIT?", "print_headline": "DID GANGS BENEFIT FROM PAPAL VISIT?", "body_text": " **********For five days last month, Pope John Paul II traveled in and around hard-pressed Naples, visiting blighted neighborhoods on a crusade against the Camorra, the local version of the Sicilian Mafia. **********Be honest, he excoriated Neapolitan politicians. Be courageous, he urged business leaders. Stand up to gangster threats of violence. \"You businessmen must be in the front line in this battle,\" he said. \"Don't give up.\" **********Now, prosecutors in Naples say they are looking into the possibility that organized crime figures skimmed off some of the more than $7 million in public funds that were spent to welcome the Pope. **********The disclosure of their investigation this week startled even Italians who had considered themselves inured to reports about underworld predators.  Outrages Out of Control **********Italian Government leaders bluntly acknowledged that they have lost control of large segments of the country's southland to clans of the Mafia, the Camorra and their Calabrian cousin, the 'Ndrangheta. Rarely does a day pass without word of a fresh outrage, be it a spectacular holdup or a murder spree like the rapid series of shootouts among rival gangs last Tuesday that left eight people dead in the span of 18 minutes in the decaying Sicilian town of Gela, population 85,000. **********But to steal -- assuming the charges are proved -- from under the gaze of the Pope, especially while he was in town to denounce the mob, struck Italian press commentators and others as carrying temerity to a new level. **********Even before John Paul arrived in Naples on Nov. 9, some people there were warning that public funds for the visit had been misused. At the city's Cardarelli Hospital, the largest in the Italian South, a group of patients sent an open letter to the Pope saying his journey had \"unleashed a serious waste of money that could have been used for helpful purposes.\" **********Among the questionable spending written about in recent days by the Italian press was a $900,000 appropriation to restore an old church that John Paul wound up never visiting because of security concerns.  Where Did $1.3 Million Go? **********But the focus of the criminal investigation, prosecutors say, is the ultimate destination of $1.3 million in construction contracts, including several that involved building a huge platform in the heart of Naples for a papal Mass. **********Opposition politicians, whose accusations got the inquiry under way, claimed that city officials had ignored normal bidding procedures to hand a contract for the platform to a company in Bologna. It is also charged that the platform was put in the wrong place and had to be rebuilt. This time, the contract went to a company in a Neopolitan suburb that is said to be a Camorra stronghold. **********In addition, the investigators are examining charges that the city paid too much for about 1,000 rented chairs that were put near an improvised altar set upon the platform. Beyond agreeing to possibly excessive rental fees, it seems that local officials paid twice in some cases. Many chairs were stolen the night before the Pope's Mass and had to be replaced.  Wrongdoing Is Denied **********A city commissioner responsible for construction, Diego Tesorone, denied any wrongdoing and said he would prove it to the prosecutors. From the Vatican there has been no comment. Nonetheless, the Pope's contempt for organized crime and \"the degeneration of public life\" that it causes is hardly in doubt. **********His Naples visit, the longest journey to an Italian city during his papacy, was seen as a symbol of the Vatican's faith in the region, despite all its troubles. Another hopeful sign came a few days ago when Fiat, the Italian auto giant, announced that it would build two new factories in the South, creating 8,300 jobs for a high-unemployment area that many industries have fled. **********Still, life is often an uphill fight in that hard-scrabble area. **********One day after the Fiat announcement, the state electric company said it had stopped work on a new power station in the Calabrian town of Gioia Tauro, even though nearly $2.5 billion had already been spent on the project. It had been discovered, the company said, that too many local companies hired for the construction were Mafia-connected."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/12/business/talking-business-with-breeden-of-the-sec-risks-of-market-fragmentation.html": {"writer_name": "Leslie Wayne", "pub_date": "1990-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 776, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Business; with Breeden of the S.E.C.;   Risks of Market Fragmentation", "print_headline": "Talking Business; with Breeden of the S.E.C.;   Risks of Market Fragmentation", "body_text": " **********Richard C. Breeden, the 40-year-old head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has a knack for making waves. In his short tenure, the Bush Administration appointee has taken a hard line toward people suspected of violating securities laws, has made overtures toward helping Eastern Europe develop stock exchanges and has made it clear he wants to eliminate creaky regulations that may inhibit United States companies in global competition. **********One of his most controversial moves has been an effort to regulate some of the financial futures now under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. And he is strongly backing a measure introduced by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, that would empower the S.E.C. to suspend some program trading and close the exchanges in an emergency. Mr. Breeden was in New York recently and discussed several issues. **********Q. Where do things stand legislatively on regulations for Wall Street? **********A. The most important is the Administration's new legislation, which has three objectives. The measure would put the S.E.C. in charge of overseeing margins on stock index futures, would eliminate the ''exclusivity clause'' that has inhibited Wall Street's ability to develop new hybrid products, and would transfer the jurisdiction for regulating stock index futures from the commodity commission to the S.E.C. This is a significant step in dealing with instability in the current system. **********Q. Is passage assured? **********A. There's a vigorous campaign under way by the futures industry to block it. But the odds are very high that this step will be taken. The United States is the only nation that maintains this market fragmentation - and the risk and costs it entails. I don't think we're willing to see leadership in both the futures and securities markets move overseas. **********Q. The Chicago markets see the bill as an effort by the traditional New York markets to assert their dominion. How do you respond? **********A. That's absolutely groundless. The Secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the chairman of the S.E.C. are urging reform. We've all watched severe risk in the stock and futures markets not once, but twice, in 1987 and 1989. Last Oct. 13, 50 million Americans lost $160 billion of value in their pension and retirement accounts in 90 minutes. The element that introduced the greatest amount of risk was that we went into that day, just as we did in 1987, with 97.8 percent leverage in the stock index futures market. And then, in the midst of the crisis, those exchanges were trying to dramatically raise margins, which sucked out liquidity and created further selling pressure. **********Q. Had you been the S.E.C. chairman in October 1987, what would you have done? **********A. We wouldn't have entered that day with margins of 2.2 percent on stock index futures. If you had a minimum margin of 15 percent, you then would have the flexibility to cut margins to 10 percent when the market was under stress to inject liquidity. Under the Markey bill, the futures exchanges would have the authority to recommend margins. But if they proposed going from 14 percent to 2.2 percent, we would have the authority to say ''that's too low.'' We'd expect to see margins set in line with those in the options market. **********Q. Isn't computer index arbitrage almost always destablizing to markets? **********A. I would not make a blanket statement. Index arbitrage is a symptom of an underlying problem and that problem is the vast differences in leverage rules that apply to the same products. If you have $100,000 you can buy $200,000 worth of S.&P. 500 stocks or $4.4 million worth of them through the index futures market, and the index futures market will react more forcefully to economic stimuli. **********Q. What sort of sentence should Michael Milken get? **********A. A substantial period of incarceration would be appropriate. **********Q. Should we have a clearer definition of insider trading. **********A. The basic prohibition against insider trading as elaborated by the Supreme Court and other courts is reasonably clear and probably more clear than if we had a long, tortuous statutory definition. **********Q. Will the savings and loan crisis lead to securities fraud prosecutions? **********A. It may. It is a matter of public record that several institutions that were customers of Mr. Milken have failed and involved losses to the taxpayers of several billion dollars."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/01/business/business-people-tosco-appoints-director-to-management-posts.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-06-01", "snippet": "LEAD: The Tosco Corporation, which owns an oil refinery in California and a fertilizer factory in Florida, said today that it had named John J.

Since then, the rebels, whose numbers have increased to several thousand, have pushed the Government forces out of virtually all the northeastern and north-central parts of the country. **********The rebels, who have reportedly received training and financial support from Libya, have taken many important economic objectives, including the country's important iron mines, the Firestone rubber plantation, and Buchanan, the second-largest city. **********Reports From Monrovia **********Reports from Monrovia itself were few and vague due to the cutting of telephone and telex lines, but there were indications that at least one army base on the edge of the city was in flames. Rocket, artillery and automatic-weapons fire reverberated from the eastern suburb of Paynesville, while frightened people streamed out of the capital, according to pooled dispatches from journalists in the city and local radio broadcasts monitored from the neighboring Ivory Coast. **********The rebels moved into the capital this morning in a two-pronged attack from the northwest and the east. Some Government troops fled from the fighting, jumping into pickup trucks heading downtown, and Mr. Cohen said there was no sign that the army was effectively resisting. Lieut. Gen. Henry Dubar, the army chief of staff, resigned over the weekend. **********Mr. Taylor, who has accused General Doe's Government of brutality and large-scale corruption, has promised a thorough political house-cleaning but has equivocated about his intention to hold national elections. The war has been fought mostly along tribal lines, with members of the Krahn and Mandingo ethnic groups, who hold most high positions in the Government and army, battling the Gio and Mano tribes. Both the rebels and the Government forces have been accused of brutal attacks on civilians during the fighting. **********The peace talks, held at the United States Embassy in Sierra Leone, failed when General Doe refused to accept a rebel demand that he resign unconditionally. The Liberian President promised not to run for re-election in January and offered to include the guerrillas in an interim government, but the rebels refused to continue the talks. In response to the offensive, General Doe repeated his peace offer on radio today. #4 American Ships The United States Navy has deployed a four-ship task force off the Liberian coast to evacuate about 800 Americans still living in the West African country. American officials in the last few weeks have expressed concern that forces of either side, particularly those of General Doe, were undisciplined and could go on a rampage. There were reports today that drunken soldiers were commandeering cars and extorting money from civilians. **********Mr. Cohen said the Navy ships ''are ready for an emergency evacuation if necessary.'' But, as of Monday evening, he added, ''we don't have any reports of Americans being harmed or asking to leave.'' **********The United States has had close relations with Liberia since it was colonized and founded by freed American slaves in the early 19th century. American installations in the country include a navigational station that guides ships and aircraft across wide areas of the Atlantic Ocean, and two communications relay stations, one that transmits the Voice of America and the other that handles diplomatic and intelligence traffic for nearly all of Africa south of the Sahara. **********Mr. Cohen said the Voice of America station is already behind rebel lines, but remains unharmed. He said, so far, the rebels ''have been disciplined and correct.'' **********Government forces control the area where the diplomatic and intelligence station is situated, and it also remains undamaged, Mr. Cohen said. **********Abuse Is Reported **********Mr. Cohen was less sanguine about human rights in Monrovia. He said United States officials were receiving reports of the abuse of civilians, carried out along tribal lines, by both sides. Such violence, he said, included beatings and shootings. **********Washington has had a sometimes close, sometimes difficult relationship with the Doe Government since it took power in a bloody 1980 coup, which resulted in the execution of President William R. Tolbert and other members of the deposed Government. The Reagan Administration was critical of the executions and later of the Doe Government's corruption. But between 1980 and 1985, the Administration granted Monrovia $500 million worth of military and economic aid. **********The relationship began to sour after accusations that the Doe Government tampered with election results in 1985, leading to a succession of Congressional aid cutbacks. This year, Liberia received no military aid and just $10 million in food and other humanitarian assistance. **********Still, the Bush Administration was reticent about cutting all ties to the Doe Government. In February, two American military advisers were dispatched to a northeastern combat zone in an effort to improve the Liberian Army's human rights performance. Based on the advisers' counsel, some officers were transferred, but American officials have privately admitted that the army continued to abuse villagers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/27/business/business-people-microchip-technology-names-new-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 396, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Microchip Technology Names New President", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Microchip Technology Names New President", "body_text": " **********Microchip Technology Inc., a semiconductor manufacturer based in Chandler, Ariz., has named Steve Sanghi president and chief operating officer.

Rebecca H. Garner, vice president of Associated Capital Investors in Little Rock, Ark., whose performance in 1989 was No. 1 in a ranking of junk bond managers, expects some clients to profit from any disarray arising from the new regulations. **********''You'd be crazy not to buy them,'' she said, adding that she is working on a list of bonds she hopes eventually to buy at lower prices. ''There are a lot of good names I'd like to own.'' **********In the near term, she still says the fragile market is going to come down, in part because of the proposal by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners that the more than 200 insurers that own junk bonds limit their holdings. ''We're waiting to see what gets battered,'' she said. ''We may have seen the bottom, but it may stay down here for a while.'' **********No matter how she views junk bonds, Ms. Garner may be constrained by the regulators and may be forced to sell low-rated bonds from an account she manages for her parent company, the Monarch Life Insurance Company. Although she sold $50 million of the insurer's bonds last year, Monarch executives may decide to reduce their holdings further in reaction to the regulators' proposals, she said yesterday. ''We truly don't know what we plan to do at this point,'' she said, but she hopes to buy more junk bonds for her pension accounts, Such sentiment about junk bonds is spreading, as some investors are being attracted by what they consider bargains. Robert M. Wallace, president of Gateway Advisors in San Jose, Calif., said he planned to add to his holdings slowly over the next few months. **********But their long-term bullishness is still a contrarian view. Many investors are still nervous about this volatile, thinly traded market. Professional investors who own these bonds have been blind-sided by bad news from these highly leveraged companies, and in many cases their holdings have suffered steep price declines. **********Even Ms. Garner, whose accounts returned 13.5 percent, in 1989, putting her at the top of junk bond managers ranked by Plan Sponsor Network, a Port Chester, N.Y., firm, was burned. **********Her investment performance slipped in the first quarter of this year because one holding dropped sharply. Executives at the Charter Medical Corporation surprised investors in March when they disclosed accounting irregularities, and the bonds dropped from the mid-80's to the low-40's. Ms. Garner sold her bonds at 50. As a result, her accounts so far are down 3.72 percent, compared with the 1.58 percent decline of the Merrill Lynch High Yield Index. **********Ms. Garner declines to name the bonds she plans to buy. But she said she would look at well-known, liquid issues like Duracell and First Brands. She will also be watching to see which bonds insurers are forced to sell. For instance, last November prices of bonds of the Fort Howard Corporation fell on rumors that the First Executive Corporation was selling the bonds, she said. Some market participants think the weakened life insurance company might sell more of these, as well as other bonds, to avoid increasing its reserves. **********''Everybody has reason to believe there is more,'' she said. ''But you don't know what the next name will be.'' **********Ms. Garner has $255 million of assets allocated to junk bonds although $50 million is held in short-term funds like Treasury bills. In addition to investing assets for Monarch and pension fund clients including Eastern Airlines, she and her staff manage a junk bond fund that is included as an investment option for annuity holders of an affiliate, the First Variable Corporation. **********For most of last year, she avoided many well-known issues like American Standard, Kroger and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which were hurt when the market selloff accelerated last fall. **********She also reduced her holdings of bonds underwritten exclusively by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from 42 percent of the portfolio to 19 percent because she worried that without the firm's support these bonds would decline in value. And she managed to avoid some damage by shunning zero-coupon bonds and pay-in-kind bonds, which pay holders more bonds instead of cash. ''Interest is truly all I care about,'' she said. ''I don't want to be a hero.'' **********Her largest holdings include the Tonka Corporation, whose bonds have been trading near their par value, and McCaw Cellular Communications and Ann Taylor Inc. are in the 80's. **********The disarray in the junk bond market, Ms. Garner said, is creating opportunities for investors who are willing to buy when others are selling.

Mr. Bohme denied the allegations, which had been made anonymously. **********According to the Interior Ministry, the daily tally of immigrants dropped steadily from 1,359 last Monday, the day after elections, to 551 on Friday. The flow moved back up today to an estimated 1,000, but Monday is usually the heaviest day. **********This arrival of hundreds of thousands of immigrants has placed a heavy strain on West Germany's social services and housing and led to growing resentment of those coming from the East, prompting Bonn to limit benefits and to take other actions to curb the influx. **********Relatives Coming Now **********Adding to a cautious optimism was the fact that many of those now coming over were family members of men who had come alone earlier to look for work and housing. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said the number of single men had dropped sharply. **********Officials here speculated that many East Germans had assumed that Bonn would shut the doors to immigrants immediately after the election. Thus, those who intended to leave would probably have left by the election. **********Then on Tuesday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced that the special benefits for immigrants would remain in force until July 1. That presumably encouraged wavering East Germans to stay home and see if their newly elected Parliament would start to bring real economic improvements. **********Three states - North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland and the city-state of Bremen - have now stopped accepting immigrants from the reception camps, arguing that the law was written for political refugees and did not apply to East Germans now that they have a freely elected government. Last year, 350,000 East Germans moved to West Germany, and 150,000 more have joined them so far this year. **********A Week's Statistics **********The flow had averaged 2,000 a day until the elections. It then dropped to 1,359 on Monday, 1,156 on Tuesday, 931 on Wednesday, 706 on Thursday and 551 on Friday, the West German Interior Ministry said.

''Maybe people now think something will happen soon and so they do not need to come over. Maybe those who have decided to go have already gone. Maybe the word has spread in East Germany that settling in West Germany is getting increasingly difficult.'' **********Mr. Zimmermann said the flood could still resume if East Germans lose faith in the benefits of introducing the West German mark to the East, which Bonn intends to do by this summer. **********In a related matter, the West German Employment Agency in Nuremberg said it would hold back transition money from an East German immigrant for 12 weeks if he lost his job through his own fault.

The repairs, to be done next month or later, are precautionary. If the repairs fail, the astronauts have alternatives for a safe return. The astronauts have enough supplies aboard Mir to live for months in orbit, and more supplies can be sent to them. **********''There's no crisis,'' said James E. Oberg, an American expert on Soviet space programs. ''This is a prudent action to enhance cosmonaut safety.'' **********The trouble has been discussed in the Soviet press and a detailed account of the planned repair mission appears in the current issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology, an industry journal. The damaged ship, the journal noted, leaves the two astronauts ''without a reliable escape vehicle in the event of an emergency.'' The astronauts are Anatoly Solovyov and Aleksandr Balandin. **********Thermal Blankets Loosened **********The problem centers on the Soyuz craft, which transports Soviet astronauts to and from the 100-foot-long Mir station. The Soyuz now docked at Mir was set aloft on Feb. 11, carrying two astronauts. An inspection of the Soyuz later showed that some of its thermal blankets had come loose, exposing the metallic skin of the ship to space. **********The blankets are not a heat shield for re-entry but rather a many-layered cover meant to help curb the extreme temperatures encountered in everyday operations in space. A device facing toward the Sun can reach temperatures of 400 degrees Fahrenheit on one side, and minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit on the other. **********At first, Soviet concern was rather low, said Mr. Oberg, who monitors the Soviet press. The damage seemed to affect temperature control in the craft and some electrical generation, and was viewed as bothersome at worst. But apprehension rose when it turned out that the torn insulation blocked critical navigation sensors meant to guide Soyuz on its return to Earth. **********Those sensors were the same ones that acted up in 1988, leaving two Soviet astronauts stranded in space for a day before the problem was fixed and the crew landed safely. The sensors locate the Earth's horizon, helping the ship correctly orient itself for its plunge back through the atmosphere. **********A Complex Repair Job **********According to Aviation Week, the repair plan involves a spacewalk in which Soviet astronauts are to fix the torn blankets. The repair job is complex because the damaged area cannot be easily reached. **********The Soviets are planning to send special tools and a ladder to the astronauts. Those are to be carried into space by a 20-ton expansion module for the Mir station, whose flight has been repeatedly delayed and is now scheduled for early June. It is known as Kvant 3. The first Kvant module arrived in April 1987. **********After the new module docks with Mir, a spacewalking astronaut will deploy the ladder, which is to extend about 20 feet from Mir to the Soyuz craft. The Soyuz has few handholds on its exterior to aid a spacewalking astronaut. **********It has not been decided whether to repair the torn blankets or to strip them away so that they would no longer block the sensors. **********Several Alternatives **********''Securing them back in place would be a more difficult task,'' Aviation Week noted, ''but would help improve the spacecraft's thermal problems.'' **********If the effort fails, which is considered unlikely, several alternatives exist, Mr. Oberg said. The astronauts could try the repair again or could take the risk of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere with the blankets unrepaired, since there are other ways to help guide the module's re-entry. **********Another alternative, Mr. Oberg said, would be to abandon the damaged Soyuz and have another one sent into space to pick up the astronauts, especially if an emergency arises. ''There's always one available as a rescue vehicle,'' said Mr. Oberg."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/27/business/company-news-pennzoil-raises-stake-in-chevron-to-9.4.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1990-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 438, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pennzoil Raises Stake In Chevron to 9.4%", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Pennzoil Raises Stake In Chevron to 9.4%", "body_text": " **********The Pennzoil Company said today that it had bought $90 million worth of shares in the Chevron Corporation since Dec. 3, increasing its stake in Chevron to 9.4 percent, from 9.1 percent. **********The purchases, made in the open market at an average price of $69.75 a share, increased Pennzoil's total investment in Chevron to $2.2 billion. **********The company also said today that the Internal Revenue Service had extended to May 31 the deadline for Pennzoil to invest the remaining proceeds from its $3 billion award from Texaco Inc. in April 1988.

Scoresby Scotch has grown into the largest brand in California, indeed the Western United States -without advertising. While sales of domestic Scotch declined by 4.6 percent last year, Scoresby's sales grew by more than 11 percent - without advertising. **********So what does Scoresby see as the key to its future growth? Advertising. **********The Glenmore Distilleries Company, which acquired distribution rights to Scoresby when it acquired the Fleischmann's Company in 1988, is about to begin the first ad campaign ever for an alcoholic secret so well kept that it provides the tag line for the ads, ''The secret's out.'' **********''Why start advertising when the brand is doing so well?'' asked Roland Grybauskas, who, as president of Grybauskas & Partners, Scoresby's agency, has a stake in the rhetorical query's answer. ''Because the momentum and the opportunity are tremendous.'' **********Having grown without it, though, Scoresby is trying an alternative approach to advertising. In the print ads appearing in USA Today and in the April issues of such hip magazines as LA Style, Premiere and Interview, 1960's-style cartoon art, similar to the pop art of Roy Lichtenstein, will introduce the brand to drinkers between the ages of 25 and 40. And Grybauskas intends to make the ads' cartoon couple - Todd and Cheryl -running characters, whose loves, desires and intrigues should captivate consumers enough to induce them to order the Scotch. **********Beverage analysts say Scoresby grew because its distributors took the money that would have gone into advertising and put it into price promotions. **********''At a time when premium imports were quite high, they were one of the lowest-priced Scotches in the country,'' said Jerome M. Levy, the marketing director of Jobson's Beverage Alcohol Group. ''It was perceived by the consumer as a good value and a good product. And because they liked the name and the label, they weren't afraid to buy the product even though the price was lower.'' **********Scoresby, it seems, has always bucked trends. Liquor-industry experts say that brands of Scotch, a beverage with a sophisticated European heritage, are generally introduced in the Eastern United States and spread West. But Scoresby was introduced in California in the early 1970's and has slowly worked its way East. **********Such contrariness was evident in the approach to the ads. ''We didn't want to do me-too advertising,'' Mr. Grybauskas said. ''Doing a competitive analysis, we found two things: either the ads were about authenticity, with men in kilts, or they were about life style - 'You work on Wall Street; this is the Scotch for you.' '' **********Indeed, as Americans' consumption of Scotch has declined, the category has turned out numerous attention-getting campaigns aimed at making Scotch a trendy drink. Grace & Rothschild has done whimsical wordplays for J & B; one execution, headlined ''J & B at home,'' has an aerial photograph of a baseball stadium with a bottle of the Scotch at the plate. Smith/Greenland has made waves with its sexy allusions to modern courtship in its ''. . . And he drinks Johnnie Walker'' campaign. **********These notable campaigns presented a challenge to Grybauskas, the $15 million agency that won the Scoresby account on the basis of its work for other Glenmore brands, including Elduris Icelandic Vodka and Chi-Chi's margaritas. Another challenge was the research. ''The Scoresby drinker is a typical Scotch drinker - there is nothing unique about him or her,'' said Cheryl Suhr, Glenmore's group brand director for imports. **********Grybauskas's decision to use cartoons - because they are ''intrusive,'' Mr. Grybauskas said -matches that made by other advertisers, like 7-Up and Jell-O, which now believe that cartoon characters have a way of standing out from the printed page and the television screen. To further the cartoonish associations, Glenmore and its agency have developed point-of-purchase displays that will tie Scoresby in with the home video release of the forthcoming movie ''Dick Tracy.'' **********Mystique has built brands like Coors beer; such mystery-eroding advertising might seem to be risky. But neither the agency nor the client worries about destroying any mystique that might have gathered around Scoresby. **********''The brand was not built on its sexy word-of-mouth,'' Mr. Grybauskas said. ''It's been built on taste. There was a great sensitivity about what it's impact might be. But we say, no risk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/31/business/credit-markets-treasury-securities-inch-higher.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1990-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1000, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Treasury Securities Inch Higher", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS;   Treasury Securities Inch Higher", "body_text": " **********Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in slow trading yesterday, as dealers began to position themselves for tomorrow's release of May employment data. **********Market participants said generally weak reports on April movements in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators and new home sales had had little impact. **********''The April data has already been incorporated; it was weak, and no one will deny that,'' one Government bond trader said.

They have done this by charging either no management fee or a lower one than other funds. **********Now, in a complaint focusing on the lack of a guarantee that those lower management fees will continue, a competitor of the high-flying funds is demanding that the Securities and Exchange Commission take steps to force more disclosures in advertising about the possibility of those yields shrinking. **********The hot funds are the Fidelity Spartan Fund, which began in January 1989 and now has $7.8 billion in assets, and the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Fund, which began in February 1989 and now has $6.5 billion. **********At issue are the yields quoted for the funds, which are significantly higher than those of their competitors. Those rates are quoted for a year, but their higher yields are likely to last only as long as management fees stay low. And the funds offer no guarantee that the fees will not be increased within a year. **********For example, the Dreyfus fund says its seven-day compounded annual yield through Tuesday was 8.83 percent, while the Fidelity fund quotes a figure of 8.65 percent. By contrast, Fidelity's largest money-market fund, Liquid Assets, has normal management fees and a rate of 7.99 percent. **********Vanguard Group, a mutual fund organization that charges relatively low management fees, now has funds that have seven-day compounded yields ranging from 7.88 percent to 8.03 percent, depending on whether the funds stick to Treasury bills or venture into more risky assets. It is Vanguard's chairman, John C. Bogle, who asked the S.E.C. to force Dreyfus and Fidelity to reduce the rates they quote to consumers. **********''If you want to guarantee the fee waiver for a year, that's fine,'' Mr. Bogle said yesterday. ''But don't annualize it if it is good for a day.'' He asked the S.E.C. to require that funds cut their stated yields if they reserve the right to raise management fees during the year. He said the stated yields should reflect how low they would be if the fund took its full management fees for whatever period the fund has not guaranteed it will not raise them. **********Kathryn McGrath, the director of the S.E.C. division of investment management, was at a conference and not available for comment, the S.E.C. said. **********Both Dreyfus and Fidelity responded by saying they had not misled customers, and were in full compliance with the rules. ''They miss the point,'' said Laurence Dwyer, a Fidelity spokesman. ''The true beneficiary here is the customer. The yield we advertise is the yield we pay. It's as real as any advertised or paid by Vanguard.'' **********Mr. Bogle insisted that there were no ''sour grapes'' in his complaint, and noted that since the end of 1988, his group's money fund assets had risen more rapidly than either Fidelity's or Dreyfus's. But Neil Litvack, a marketing vice president at Fidelity, said that was changing. Since the end of 1989, he said, Spartan's assets are up 40 percent, and the Dreyfus fund's assets are up 46.9 percent. Vanguard's largest money market fund is up just 12.6 percent. ''You tell me that is not sour grapes,'' Mr. Litvack said. He said Vanguard had been ''the only company to offer a product with low costs,'' but now had competitors. **********When Fidelity began Spartan, it charged no management fee. It imposed an annual fee of 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, in June and raised that to 10 basis points in September. Its prospectus says it could raise that fee as high as 60 basis points, but it has promised not to go above 45 basis points before May 1992. It does charge fees for such things as moving money to other funds or writing checks. **********The Dreyfus fund could impose a fee of 70 basis points, but now has no fee, and has repeatedly delayed introducing one. Its latest promise is that no fee will be imposed before April 15, or when it reaches $7 billion. There are no fees for checks or transfers. **********Howard Stein, the chairman of Dreyfus, noted that his ads do not quote a yield, but do say the fund has been the highest-yielding one. He said that even if fees were imposed, it would be done gradually, keeping investors fully informed. **********''This money is from savers,'' he said, adding that most of it seems to be coming from banks, not from other money market funds. **********Gathering the billions for the two funds has been an expensive proposition for Fidelity and Dreyfus. Fidelity now says the fund is marginally profitable at the low fees it is charging, but Dreyfus says it is losing money on its fund. Both concede that they hope to make money later by raising fees, but note that investors do not have to keep their money in the funds after that. **********''If the individual is unhappy with the yield, he can take his money,'' said Julian Smerling, vice chairman of Dreyfus. ''He won't pay any penalties or charges at all, and he will have had a good yield while his money was here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/19/world/upheaval-east-iran-worried-about-its-own-azerbaijanis-teheran-acts-with-caution.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 708, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Worried About Its Own Azerbaijanis, Teheran Acts With Caution", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: IRAN;   Worried About Its Own Azerbaijanis, Teheran Acts With Caution", "body_text": " **********The armed revolt in Azerbaijan has been received with apprehension in Iran, where an estimated 16 million Azerbaijanis represent the largest ethnic minority and have at times challenged the authority of the Teheran Government. **********By contrast, within the Arab world, the upheaval seems to have elicited little more than simple curiosity. Much of the Arab press has merely underlined softly that the Azerbaijanis are mainly Shiite Muslims and has stressed the continuing danger of Islamic fundamentalism emanating from Iran. Unlike Iran, which is not an Arab country, many Arab nations of the Middle East are populated by Sunni Muslim majorities who have come to view Iranian Shiite fundamentalism as a threat. **********Arab sentiment about the events in Azerbaijan was summed up by a senior official from an oil-producing country, who said most of the Arab Middle East wants President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ''to succeed in his efforts to liberalize Communist regimes and put an end to the threat of Soviet expansionism.'' **********Iran's Message to Soviets **********Iran's supreme religious guide, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has cautioned the Soviet Union not to mistake the revolt for a desire among Azerbaijanis to separate themselves from the Soviet Union but to look at it as a manifestation of Islamic sentiments. **********''Anyone who thinks or pretends that the motives behind these movements are ethnic or nationalistic is making a big mistake,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said Wednesday. ''Soviet leaders should face this fact with realism.'' **********Despite the ruling clergy's cautious approach, a militant minority of Iranians have voiced the view that the Azerbaijani revolt should be encouraged as another successful example of the export of the Iranian revolution. Among these are a group of parliamentarians, and the militant newspapers Gumhuri Islami and Abrar. **********Conflicting Interests **********Experts said the Government of President Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani is caught between radicals who openly advocate material and even armed support for fundamentalist Shiites in Soviet Azerbaijan, and those in the Government who think too many vital interests shared with the Soviet Union can be put at risk by such a stand. **********''The Rafsanjani camp wants to work with the U.S.S.R. and has been the driving force behind recent economic agreements concluded between Iran and the Soviets,'' said Baqer Moin, an Iranian author based in London. **********Such policies of compromise with the Soviet Union differ sharply from Iran's approach to similar events under its previous leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died last June. ''Had Khomeini been still alive, Iran would have been able and anxious to inspire the revolt,'' Mr. Moin said. **********Until two years ago, the Iranian Government actively encouraged Shiite fundamentalism in Soviet Azerbaijan and among the 50 million Muslims who live in the southern Soviet Union. **********But Mr. Rafsanjani visited the Soviet Union last June and concluded a number of energy and industrial agreements valued at $10 billion - financial aid badly needed by Iran. A few days ago, the Soviet Union offered to mediate an end to the Iraq-Iran war, in a move clearly meant as an incentive for Teheran to stay out of the Azerbaijan trouble. **********Other Reasons for Caution **********But Iran has other reasons to stay put. Leading figures in the Government worry that if the movement of the estimated seven million Soviet Azerbaijanis in the Soviet Union proves to be primarily nationalist, it may lead to similar trouble among the Azerbaijanis of Iran. **********''There is a danger that if the Soviet Azerbaijanis engage Soviet troops, and use Iranian Azerbaijan as a sanctuary, they may embroil their cousins in Iran in their fight, forcing Teheran to make a decision it would rather not make,'' said Shahram Chubin, an Iranian affairs expert at the Geneva Graduate Institute of International Affairs. **********Iran, Mr. Chubin added, ''has no desire to give its minorities much more than very limited autonomy.'' **********Some nationalists in Azerbaijan have called for a Greater Azerbaijan that would unite the estimated 23 million Azerbaijanis on both sides of the Iranian-Soviet border."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/27/business/orders-for-durables-increase-by-2.5.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 535, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Orders for Durables Increase by 2.5%", "print_headline": "Orders for Durables Increase by 2.5%", "body_text": " **********Orders to the nation's factories for durable goods rose 2.5 percent in December, climbing for the second consecutive month. **********The Commerce Department said today that orders for durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, increased to a seasonally adjusted $133.5 billion in December, after gaining 4.9 percent in November. **********But the manufacturing sluggishness through much of 1989 was reflected in the report's figures for the entire year.

Though not the only reason, the Persian Gulf crisis was a factor in the decision, they said. **********They also said Canada, already a free trade partner of the United States, was likely to participate, giving an accord hemispheric scope and clearing the way for common standards and trading rules in all three countries by the end of the century. **********The integration of economies in North America would follow similar moves in Europe, as the European Community inches toward economic union. **********''Acting at this time is a way of telling Mexico that we're really serious,'' a senior Administration official said. In late August, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked the United States to open the talks. **********Mexico's Oil Reserves **********The Middle East crisis has focused the world's attention on global oil supplies. Mexico, with the eighth-largest reserves in the world, would be likely to attract more outside capital with a trade pact to help tap those reserves. **********While the United States wants to work with Mexico on increasing oil production, another factor behind the speed-up, officials said, is a desire to accommodate President Salinas, who has seized on free trade to modernize the Mexican economy. **********Mexico, which has already cut tariffs from 100 percent or more to less than 10 percent, sees an agreement with the United States attracting foreign capital that would spur modernization. **********An economic basket case early in the last decade, Mexico, through deregulation and tax cuts as well as freer trade, has already reduced inflation and interest rates sharply and all but eliminated capital flight. **********Cooperation in Energy **********Bush Administration officials expect a trade agreement to intensify cooperation in the energy sector, for example, by increasing already robust sales of American oil equipment to Mexico. **********One recent sign of cooperation was Mexico's pledge to lift overall oil exports by 100,000 barrels daily to help ease the current pressure on global supplies. Mexico exports about half of its 2.5 million barrels daily. The United States takes about 60 percent of the exports, Japan 15 percent and Europe most of the rest. **********Far more controversial is the issue of American participation in Mexican oil and gas exploration, for 50 years the exclusive preserve of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex. **********Because of political sensitivity about oil, many analysts consider it unlikely that international oil companies would be permitted to operate in Mexico. **********''The political cost associated with accepting foreign investment in the upstream sector of the petroleum industry would be substantial,'' said Rafael G. Quijano, director of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington energy consulting group. **********Still Mr. Quijano, a former Pemex executive, suggested that ways might be found to get around the issue. **********Foreign Investment Fund **********One possible solution, he said, is a financial mechanism, like a trust fund established by foreign investors in a Mexican bank with which Mexican operators would carry out drilling activities. **********Decisions on such issues are not likely to be taken before the Salinas Government tests its strength at the polls in 1991 midterm elections. **********The Presidents of the United States and Mexico agreed in June to go forward with the pact, but the expectation then was that little progress would be made before yearend. **********George W. Grayson, a Mexican oil expert at William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said that Mexico was producing about at capacity and that because of rising domestic use from its rapid industrialization, it badly needed to find new oil. **********Immigration is another sensitive issue. Mexico had wanted to take up freer movement of workers as well as goods. Washington had warned that this could doom the talks and won its point. Immigration will not be negotiated, American officials said. **********Immigration Issues **********But immigration could be affected indirectly. If a free trade pact leads to a more prosperous Mexico, there will be less pressure on workers to come north. **********Organized labor in the United States has already signaled its strong opposition to a free trade pact with Mexico. But most industry groups, seeing a large potential for exports, have come out in favor. **********''Mexico is a wonderful potential market,'' said Colleen S. Morton, director of the United States Council of the Mexico-United States Business Committee. The council represents key American business groups. **********If, as expected, Canada joins the talks, in return for greater access to Mexico, Canada would have to be willing to offer Mexico the same tariff cuts and privileged access to Canada as the United States offers. **********The Administration's request to Congress starts a clock in which Congress has 60 legislative days, or at least four months, to determine whether such an agreement would be in the United States' interest. **********If Congress gives its assent, which is considered likely, negotiations will probably continue until 1993, officials said. It took about 18 months for Canada and the United States to negotiate a free trade pact in the late 1980's. Though still controversial in Canada, that pact has been so successful that the two nations agreed recently to accelerate scheduled tariff cuts. **********Mexico is the third-largest American trading partner after Canada and Japan.

But interest rates are high and most industries are already operating at the limits of their capacity, raising fears that inflation will rise. Additional inflationary pressure is coming from the settlements reached recently with unions in the metalworking and printing industries. **********Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the West German Bundesbank, said in a recent interview that he was less worried about East Germany than about the possibility that West Germany's economy will overheat. The Bundesbank, he added, will act to keep inflation in check; economists called it a clear signal that interest rates are not coming down soon. **********Some sectors, like the housing industry, are already overheating, according to Mr. Pohl. Demand for housing in both East and West Germany far outstrips construction capacity. West German construction companies were an early favorite in the Ostphantasie scenario. But they have fallen out of favor with many analysts and fund managers, who see them as financially suspect. One problem has been surging labor costs, in part from high overtime charges. **********Other sectors may also be peaking. Profits and production in West Germany's vast chemical industry were weak in the first quarter, and analysts have since revised full-year earnings estimates downward. **********Similar revisions are being made for a growing number of companies. Many West German businesses are faced with the choice of passing on higher unit labor costs to consumers or squeezing profit margins. They appear to be choosing the latter. **********As a result, Mr. Ruland said, foreign investors, who have long played the dominant role in West German equities trading, are shifting to other European markets and to Wall Street. **********''While we may still have good earnings growth for some companies this year, I think it's clear we also have a slowing economy in the pipeline,'' he added. ''International liquidity is going where the interest rates are lower. For the next three or four months the general outlook in the West German stock market is fairly negative.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/business/behind-thai-boom-the-japanese.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1990-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Behind Thai Boom: The Japanese", "print_headline": "Behind Thai Boom: The Japanese", "body_text": " **********Asia is replete with economic miracle stories, so it is little surprise that Thailand has joined the list as having one of the world's fastest-growing economies. As evidence, the number of cars have tripled, choking traffic, and cement is in short supply as prosperous-looking houses and industrial parks rise almost at once. **********But Thailand's remarkable boom has a twist that in many ways signals the future of much of Southeast Asia. The money, the technology, the business strategies and now even the emergency shipments of cement all come from Japan. And with a mixture of elation and misgivings, Thais themselves sometimes talk about their country as Japan's newest ''economic colony,'' a country whose prosperity is partly attributable to its role as a relief valve for Japan's skyrocketing land prices and acute labor shortage. **********The torrent of Japanese investment so apparent in Thailand is also cascading into Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the skills of workers are rising and Japan sees a chance to lock up the booming Southeast Asian market while the United States and Germany are distracted by the rush into Eastern Europe. The question increasingly being asked here, though, is whether it is wise for Southeast Asia to place so much of its economic destiny in Japanese hands. **********''It is not in our interest to be too dependent on the Japanese,'' said Snoh Unakul, chairman of the Thailand Development Research Institute and a former Government official responsible for drawing in foreign investment. ''But we are having a difficult time getting the attention of America and Europe. They are simply not competitive.'' **********And though there are still conflicts with Japanese investors here, Dr. Snoh notes, corporate Japan is coming in largely on Thailand's terms -a change that has dampened the resentments and tensions that go back to Japan's brutal occupation of Southeast Asia 50 years ago. **********''The land and labor problems in Japan have left them with no choice,'' Dr. Snoh said. ''They are forced by circumstances to be more open with technology and shared management responsibility. Now, we feel we are being treated more equally.'' **********The Thais have also encouraged the transfer of Japanese skills, notably by trying to enforce stringent local-content laws governing the automobile industry. **********Japan's influence permeates Thailand in a way it did not even four years ago. The cars and pickup trucks jamming Thailand's city streets and back mountain roads are almost exclusively Toyotas, Nissans, Isuzus and Hondas - all with no emission controls. By 1992, Japanese officials predict, 300,000 Thais, or 15 percent of the country's manufacturing workers, will be employed by Japanese companies. That figure is now a little under 10 percent. **********Adopting the Japanese Way **********Japanese managers experienced in setting up plants in the United States and soothing political squabbles have arrived here, hoping to do in Bangkok what they did in Georgetown, Ky., and Smyrna, Tenn., the American production sites for Toyota and Nissan, respectively. **********And like an uncertain student who decides the safest course is to mimic the teacher, Thailand's businesses are already adopting Japanese corporate behavior. At 8:30 one recent morning, employees at a nearby industrial park dominated by Japanese companies performed stretching exercises at their desks, while manufacturing workers outside sang a Japanese company song, translated into Thai. And deals are made by players on new golf courses. **********So far, Japan's widening business role in Southeast Asia has had two dramatic effects, business executives and government officials say. The first is a significant erosion of American economic influence in the region, where the United States had been the biggest investor. When talking about money or technology the countries in the region invariably look to Japan. **********The trend is clearest in Thailand: Last year Japan provided nearly half of the $8.2 billion foreign investment in Thailand. Taiwan, also stepping up its offshore investments, came in second, though far behind Japan. The United States invested only $1 in Thailand for every $6 that came from Japan. **********A Shift in Strategy **********The second effect, which is more subtle, is a fundamental shift in the way Japan is fitting Southeast Asia into its plans to internationalize its industries and blunt the political backlash from Japan's huge trade surpluses. Japanese companies have long had a significant presence in Southeast Asia, but in the past it was a small market for Japan and a cheap place to make low-cost, low-technology parts. Now the Southeast Asian market itself is exploding, and Japanese companies are carving the region into a loosely coordinated manufacturing bloc. **********Under agreements with the major Southeast Asian nations, except Indonesia, companies like Toyota and Mitsubishi Motors plan to make diesel engines and electrical equipment in Thailand, then trade them for transmissions built in the Philippines or steering gears in Malaysia. **********The result will be complete cars -most of them for sale in Asia, some for export to the United States and Europe - that never pass through Japan, and so do not add to Japan's trade surpluses. **********Mitsubishi Motors is already assembling Japanese-designed cars in Thailand, then shipping them to Canada, where they are sold under an American nameplate - Chrysler. The car is not a Japanese import, but it is hardly entirely Thai, either. **********'It Is Profitable' **********''We are in Southeast Asia because it is profitable, especially now,'' a senior Japanese auto executive said recently. ''But it also solves a lot of political problems, not only in Asia but across the Pacific.'' **********Still, economists and business executives in Thailand say that in two or three years, Japanese investment may tail off, at least until the country's roads, dilapidated telephone system and work force catch up to the breathless 11 to 13 percent annual growth over the last two years. **********''I can't imagine that the Japanese investment can keep increasing this fast,'' said Isao Kubokawa, a former official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry who now runs the Japan External Trade Organization's office here. ''There are very few Japanese companies that are not already here.'' **********The reach of Japan's investment can be seen throughout Thailand. Industrial parks are springing up around Bangkok; one recent morning, scores of Thai employees lined up, Japanese-style, at a new Toshiba plant to salute the company's first shipment of color television tubes, bound for other Southeast Asian nations. A few days later the president of Fujitsu Ltd. dedicated a new factory - owned by Fujitsu itself, a departure from the usual Japanese practice of taking on a local joint venture partner - that will produce computer parts. **********The influence can even been seen in the smaller towns to the north, near the borders of Myanmar, formerly Burma, and Laos. One recent weekend in the ancient city of Chiang Rai, Buddhist monks lined up in their saffron robes at a temple, while next door at a Mitsubishi Motors dealership farmers inspected a pickup truck. **********A Strong Auto Market **********For years Japanese companies kept small operations here, even after American companies left at the end of the Vietnam War. In Tokyo, though, Thailand was considered something of a poor backwater, a market that would bloom some day in the distant future. **********Now, for the Japanese and the few Americans who stayed, that day has arrived. The International Business Machines Corporation says that Thailand is now its fastest-growing Asian market. But American auto makers, who earlier shunned what they deemed a small and difficult market, are missing an explosion in auto sales. **********In 1987, sales of cars and pickup trucks - Thailand's favorite mode of transportation - topped 100,000 for the first time. Last year they totaled 208,000, and some say they may approach 300,000 this year. ''I keep wondering where the Americans are,'' said Takashi Murasawa, a senior official of MMC Sittipol Company, the Mitsubishi Motors joint venture here. **********The beneficiaries are all of Japan's car makers, who control 92 percent of the market despite stiff local-content laws that have required them to produce half to three-quarters of their components in Thailand. **********Wages Are Low **********But if Thailand thought it was about to learn the high-tech secrets of auto making it was wrong. Factories here look like flashbacks to the 1930's. ''We don't have any robots here,'' said Suparat Sirisuwanangkura, the manager of component engineering, ''because the labor is still very cheap.'' An average auto worker in Thailand earns about $200 a month, about what a skilled Japanese auto worker would make in a day. **********A key element in the Japanese auto makers' regional strategy lies in persuading Southeast Asian nations to abandon their hopes of building ''national'' cars, in which every component is produced in their own country. **********''The volumes are too low and they are very uneconomical,'' said Ninnart Chaithirapinyo, associate director of Toyota Motor Thailand. So the auto companies have assigned subsidiaries in each country to produce certain key components of each car, and in most cases have persuaded governments to treat those parts as if they were ''domestic content.'' **********''The idea is to trade parts roughly equally,'' Mr. Ninnart said. ''In practice, though, it is difficult to balance.'' **********Indonesia has refused to participate, apparently fearing that efforts to build its own cars would be undermined. Malaysia has already mounted its own effort. For five years, the country has been building the Proton Saga, a national car, although two years ago Mitsubishi had to step in to rescue the project. **********Whether Japan is really willing to share its high-tech knowledge with countries like Thailand is a matter of considerable debate. The companies all say they share generously, often bringing Thai or Malaysian engineers to Tokyo for training. But employees say that Japan is keeping its most sophisticated manufacturing processes to itself. **********''We need to put more emphasis on getting Japan to part with its technology,'' Dr. Snoh said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/21/business/merrill-officer-stepping-down.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 245, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Merrill Officer Stepping Down", "print_headline": "Merrill Officer Stepping Down", "body_text": " **********Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that William W.

Stern is a friend of the Famous Chicken. He thinks it's wonderful that Orlando hates Miami. He sees no reason why fans shouldn't stuff themselves with Charlotte Hornets Caramel Corn. **********Is this really the way for the commissioner of the National Basketball Association to behave? Apparently so. **********It has been six years since Mr. Stern moved into the half-court-sized office on the 15th floor of Olympic Towers in Manhattan and began calling the plays as the N.B.A. commissioner. During his stewardship - reflected in pugnacious rivalries among teams, an explosion of spinoff goodies and exhortations to bring jugglers and men in chicken suits onto the court - basketball has risen from its death bed to become the world's hottest sports business, and a paragon worthy of study by the other leagues. **********By working as hard at crunching numbers and cuddling corporate sponsors as at disciplining unruly players, Mr. Stern has demonstrated how deeply pro sports must rely on applying business discipline and thumping the marketing drums to flourish in a world rampant with entertainment options. The N.B.A., more than any other league, is profuse with Disney-like hoopla, practically murdering people with fun. The National Hockey League, in fact, has mimicked some of the N.B.A.'s marketing notions. And as they wrestle with the dizzying rise in player salaries, the National Football League and Major League Baseball have looked to the N.B.A.'s unique labor agreement, which limits salaries. **********''No question about it, basketball has done a stunning job,'' said John Ziegler, the president of the N.H.L. **********''They've changed the game from a sports package to an entertainment package,'' remarked Joel Steckel, a marketing professor at New York University and a rabid fan. **********One sign of the league's prosperity is the thickness of Mr. Stern's wallet. He was just rewarded with the highest-paying contract of any sports commissioner, a five-year package worth $10 million in bonuses and an annual salary of $3.5 million. He previously made do on an estimated $1 million a year. **********Just 10 years ago, the N.B.A. was an object of pity. A good 17 of its 23 teams lost money, and the league pondered folding as many as four of the most anemic ones. The sport's demons included skyrocketing player salaries, quarrelsome owners and a poor public image fomented by drug abuse. Attendance, television ratings and corporate sponsorship were all dwindling. Go to a basketball game? Better to just paint the living room. In 1983, when he was the league's executive vice president, Mr. Stern helped achieve a collective bargaining agreement with the Players Association that caps team payrolls while guaranteeing players 53 percent of league revenues, bringing extended labor peace to the sport. It also led to a system that provides care and discipline for drug users. **********Then Mr. Stern taught himself the ropes of marketing and began to sell the N.B.A. shamelessly. ''I'm the chief executive officer of an entertainment company,'' he said. ''And so you have to sell and sell and sell.'' **********The result is a striking rise in the sport's attendance, revenues and sponsorships. This year, the N.B.A.'s gross revenues should top $500 million, up from $118 million in 1980. Only a few of the 27 teams, including Washington, Indiana, Atlanta and New Jersey, are expected not to be profitable this year, but all are likely to be snugly in the black in 1991, when the roar of money begins from a sugary $600 million, four-year NBC contract for basketball rights, triple the prior deal with CBS. An additional $275 million will arrive over the next four years from Turner Network Television for cable rights, up from the previous two-year, $50 million package. **********Now, the 47-year-old Mr. Stern is embarking on his next big gambit: peddling the sport abroad (see box). And he likes nothing better than hustling. ''We had people in this league who would have trouble selling Blue Cross to Humpty Dumpty,'' said Pat Williams, the general manager of the Orlando Magic. ''David Stern can sell an anvil to a drowning man. He can sell a pogo stick to a kangaroo. You ready for this? David Stern could sell a stethoscope to a tree surgeon. That's the ultimate tribute I can pay the man.'' **********David Stern has a quicksilver mind, a sphagnum-soft voice, a mischievous face and a contemplative stare. He grew up in New York, the son of delicatessen owners, and attended Rutgers University and the Columbia Law School, before joining the New York law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn. He was a very low scorer on his firm's basketball team in the unobtrusive New York Lawyers League until he injured his knee and retired his sneakers. **********At the firm, Mr. Stern, a fervid basketball fan, toiled on innumerable N.B.A. cases, until, in 1978, he was hired by the league as its general counsel. Two years later, he was elevated to executive vice president. And in February 1984, Mr. Stern became the 38-year-old league's fourth commissioner. **********Early on, he worked at weeding out owners with shaky wealth and those disposed to fluctuant behavior. Nearly half the teams have changed hands in the last six years. **********One who got brushed with an unusual amount of tar was Theodore Stepien, who owned the Cleveland Cavaliers in the early 1980's, when the team's abysmal record earned it the nickname, the Cadavers. Mr. Stepien authorized so many dismal trades that the league imposed a moratorium on future Cavaliers' exchanges. He hired a ''Super Fan'' to attend games and rip apart beer cans with his teeth. When Mr. Stepien finally wanted out, the N.B.A. had to thrash out an arrangement that let the Cavaliers buy back draft picks that had been traded to get somebody to buy the team. **********In the Stern era, franchise values have rocketed faster than in any major-league sport. While some teams once couldn't be given away, the latest four expansion teams paid $32.5 million apiece to join. How well do teams pay? The Celtics, one of the most prosperous franchises and the only publicly owned team, reported a profit of $12.2 million last season, while an average team is thought to earn close to $4 million. **********A looming worry for the league is the widening gulf between the monetary opportunities available to smaller teams like the Utah Jazz and those playing in large markets - especially as local television deals mushroom in big cities. Thus the N.B.A. formed a committee a year and a half ago to probe ways to prop up the fortunes of the smaller franchises, like subsidizing smaller teams. **********Another potential thorn for owners is the practice of many players to defer part of their pay. Unlike in football and baseball, teams are not required by league rules to set aside funds to handle those obligations. ''We're paying for some players I never heard of,'' said Larry Miller, who inherited the debts when he bought the Jazz three years ago. If revenues shrink, some owners may be hard-pressed to find the cash. **********Charismatic players like Michael Jordon, Larry Bird, Patrick Ewing and Magic Johnson have had no small impact on the sport's popularity. The league has also benefited mightily from the fact that teams from populous areas with a fabled history - the Celtics, Lakers and Knicks -are among the current powerhouses. ''I think the popularity of basketball would quickly revert if the winningest teams were from San Antonio, Dallas and Milwaukee,'' said Mr. Steckel of N.Y.U. **********Lopsided matches are another danger, and may already be hurting television ratings. After rising sharply for a decade, ratings slipped last year - 7 percent on CBS, 17 percent on cable - and are off this season by the same amounts. **********Because not every team has mega-stars, Mr. Stern nudges owners to do more than just put teams on the floor. ''Game presentation is vital,'' he said. ''The way fans are shown to seats, the music, how breaks in action are used, the cheerleaders, how the arena is dressed, whether you play two minutes of a song and end on an upbeat.'' **********The new Orlando Magic tries hard to make fans overlook that its opponents usually score more points than it does. Magicians and dancers regularly delight fans. Stirring interest is a year-long contest that earns the winner a $150,000 home donated by Ryan Homes. Further shoving up ticket sales is a vitriolic feud with Miami Heat fans. **********To help owners with their pizazz, the N.B.A. operates a Team Services division. It spreads the word on such things as the best high-energy tunes to play to work up a crowd: ''Shout,'' ''Bad,'' ''Twist and Shout,'' ''Proud Mary.'' It also has the dope on the niftiest half-time acts - like Tanya Crevier, an expert dribbler who can spin nine basketballs on her fingers at once. **********In David Stern's view, basketball must always be conjoined with Big Macs and Tide detergent and - who knows? - thermal hosiery if need be. Do you have the N.B.A. Baby Bib? How about Dr. Scholl's Foot Powder, the one Dr. J says you must use? What about chomping some Charlotte Hornets Caramel Corn? Last year, $525 million worth of 140 different N.B.A.-licensed products were sold, up from less than $200 million in 1987. **********The league has also found a small gold mine in game videos. Last year, it sold 1.3 million tapes, about six times more than five years ago. It is now pushing into collectibles and is thinking of auctioning off player jerseys from next year's All-Star Game. **********Why not even have teams open their own retail stores to sell sports merchandise? There are three outlets for the Detroit Pistons, while the Utah Jazz leads the league with seven. **********The sport boasts 20 full-time corporate sponsors, up from three a decade ago, including Schick, Gatorade, Miller and Coca-Cola. Mr. Stern is tireless in ingratiating himself with sponsors. In fact, he's not above appearing in plugs himself. Watch for him in print ads for the Digital Equipment Corporation. **********N.B.A. LOOKS ABROAD FOR NEW FANS **********Zambia. Finland. Kuwait. These and some 70 other countries now regularly broadcast N.B.A. games. Nobody can resist. Last February, the Soviet Union began putting league contests on its tube, replete with plugs from Coca-Cola and Mastercard. **********Five years ago fewer than half that many countries were showing the N.B.A. With many teams playing close to capacity and with television contracts set for several years, the most promising way to grow is abroad. And foreigners swoon over basketball players. When Larry Bird spent two hours signing autographs in Madrid recently, he supposedly beat the popularity record set by Sophia Loren. **********Foreign broadcasts now bring only about $5 million to the N.B.A., but that sum is growing at 25 to 50 percent a year. Some day, David Stern imagines, the N.B.A. may garner as much money abroad as it does at home. **********The National Football League is planting a minor league of teams in Europe to start play in 1991. It faces some competition from the fledgling World Basketball League, which begins its third season in May with a few impressive sponsors, like Coca-Cola. Still, its games averaged crowds of only about 3,000 last year. **********The N.B.A. doesn't feel ready to create franchises in foreign cities, but it recognizes the value of live contests. Thus, three years ago it hatched an annual tournament, known as the McDonald's Open in honor of its hamburger sponsor, that pits an N.B.A. team against the best foreign teams. The game gets shuttled among foreign and American cities. What's more, Mr. Stern is discussing playing some regular season games next year in Japan. **********Meanwhile, he keeps cajoling, plying, exhorting. ''David will never be happy until he's able to walk down the street in Peking and see on every kid's head an N.B.A. cap,'' said Pat Williams. ''And don't think he won't do it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/03/business/company-news-comerica-in-deal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Comerica in Deal", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Comerica in Deal", "body_text": " **********Comerica Inc. said it had agreed to acquire Inbancshares, a bank holding company based in City of Industry, Calif., for $20.25 a share, or about $40 million.

In October, the index was at 43.3 percent. **********Economists said the report underscored their feeling that the nation's economy was heading into recession.

And Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress on Wednesday that economic activity had been contracting since last month.   Wide Range of Industries **********The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is based on a survey of managers from a wide range of the nation's industrial companies. It is also the first important indicator released each month. **********The report for last month also stated that the December index, if unchanged from the November level, would mean that growth in the gross national product for the entire year would be nine-tenths of a percent and that G.N.P. would decline in the fourth quarter by about six-tenths of a percent. **********In contrast, G.N.P. rose by 2.9 percent in 1989, and by five-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  Weakness in New Orders **********\"The negative growth in the United States economy, registered in October for the first time in 10 years, has deepened in November,\" said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the purchasing managers' business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc. \"With the engine of the economy, new orders, at its lowest point in over eight years, it appears likely the negative trend will continue for some time.\" **********The weakness in new orders reported by the purchasing managers was cited by economists as the greatest indicator of troubles in manufacturing. The index of new orders dropped to 39.4 percent in November, from 43.8 percent in October. The November level is the lowest since May 1982, when the index stood at 38.1 percent. **********\"The economic decline will not bottom until this index stops falling,\" the report said. **********Neal Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, said: \"The industrial sector has been in recession for some time and there is nothing that suggests an early rebound. New orders are weak and inventories are already low, which suggests that you won't get the rebound that sometimes comes when there is too little inventory.\" **********Production fell in November for the fourth consecutive month, with the association's production index falling to 41.8 percent, from 43 percent in October. \"Considering that the new-orders index is the weakest in over eight years, it is unrealistic to expect a reverse soon,\" the report said.  Prices Rise Again **********Prices that manufacturers pay for goods rose in November for the sixth consecutive month, but the rate of increase dropped from that of October.

While directors and staff members see at least several years of useful work ahead of them, they appear to share a feeling that the timer has begun to tick. **********Asked whether he could imagine a termination date for Radio Free Europe's broadcasts to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, Eugene Pell, president of the twinned stations, replied: ''My personal impression is that the process is very fragile. A two-year process? Five years? Ten years? I don't know the answer to that.'' **********Mr. Pell went on to say that he felt there was still a need for Radio Free Europe but added, ''I am not interested in perpetuating something for the sake of perpetuation.'' **********Uncertainty About the Future **********The future of the Munich stations will be decided in Washington by the Bush Administration and by Congressional oversight and appropriations committees. No one is calling publicly for a shutdown at this time. But there are proposals afloat both on Capitol Hill and in the White House to restructure international broadcasting operations. **********This has created what Bill Marsh, Mr. Pell's deputy, described as ''a lot of nervousness'' among the employees in Munich since one of the restructuring variants might be to fold Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty into the Voice of America, meaning it would become part of a Government agency. **********For the people in Munich, the optimal solution would be to empower the Board for International Broadcasting, which has supervised the Munich stations since their ties to the C.I.A. were severed in 1971, to assume the added role of supervising the Voice of America. That would mean separating the V.O.A. from its parent, the United States Information Agency. **********The board, a sort of corporation funded by Congress, allows the Munich stations a somewhat greater degree of independence from Government control than that accorded to V.O.A. **********''There will be some sort of amalgamation,'' Mr. Marsh predicted. **********Recruiting Is Under a Cloud **********Did the end of the cold war make it more difficult for the stations to recruit and retain staff members? **********Mr. Marsh said that several people had turned down job offers recently, citing articles saying the stations would be going out of business, but he added that in the last recruiting drive there were 200 applicants for 7 jobs. **********''Morale is pretty good but people are worried about the future,'' a young journalist said. ''Older staff members are quite concerned about the prospects of reaching pension age.'' He quoted an older employee as saying, ''We did such a good job that they are going to pull the carpet out from under us.'' **********''I wouldn't say there is a great deal of tangible fear,'' said a station official familiar with personnel issues, noting that he knew of only three employees who had left in recent months. ''There are more people coming than going.'' **********Whatever their expectancy, the Munich stations seem to be acting as if the future is forever. In the last few months, Radio Free Europe has opened bureaus in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest, with fanfares that included flying planeloads of European executives to the ribbon-cutting ceremonies. **********Radio Liberty Seems Stronger **********For the service to the Soviet Union, to which Radio Liberty broadcasts in 12 languages, the Munich station has hired seven reporters. Given the continuing uncertainty about the future of reforms in the Soviet Union, Radio Liberty's survival chances are probably better than those of Radio Free Europe. **********While he seeks to put Radio Free Europe's best foot forward by opening bureaus in Eastern Europe, Mr. Pell acknowledged that ''we have given a lot of thought'' to cutting broadcasting services ''country by country'' if forced to by budget cutters. **********He said the obvious candidates for trims or elimination of service would be those East European countries that had moved furthest on the road to democracy. Those would be Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, although not necessarily in that order, he said. **********Until then, Mr. Pell and his associates will continue to show budget cutters the rave notices from Eastern Europe's new leaders. **********Hungary's Prime Minister, Jozsef Antall, sent a notice dated in June that says, ''Your programs in the coming years can still help the strengthening of democracy in Hungary in many ways.'' **********Poland's Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, wrote a letter in May saying that he trusted that ''RFE may continue to serve as a reliable source of information.'' **********From Czechoslovakia's President Vaclav Havel came the comment in May: ''It seems to me that there are numberless spheres where it can continue to serve our nations well at this time - better than our own mass media.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/02/business/caesars-sees-a-profit-drop-for-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Caesars Sees A Profit Drop For Quarter", "print_headline": "Caesars Sees A Profit Drop For Quarter", "body_text": " **********After a run of bad luck at the gambling tables, Caesars World Inc. said today that it expected to report drastically reduced earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 31. **********Caesars World said in a preliminary report that its earnings for the period, which is the company's second quarter, would range from 3 cents to 10 cents a share, compared with 42 cents a share for the similar period a year ago. **********The poor results, it said, reflected ''substantially lower win percentages'' for the casinos at the company's two Nevada operations. **********Business Was Strong **********''The laws of probability work in strange ways,'' said Henry Gluck, Caesars World's chairman and chief executive.

The second ended two hours early, with the leaders instructing their foreign ministers to work late on a communique melding Mr. Bush's views with those of his colleagues. **********Mr. Bush formally presented his plan to redefine NATO nuclear doctrine, envisaging the use of nuclear weapons in Europe not as part of a ''flexible response,'' as before, but only as a ''last resort.'' **********Gorbachev Address Urged **********The President also proposed that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union be asked to address a future alliance summit meeting, and his aides continued to speak of sending a special NATO envoy to Moscow this weekend to deliver a copy of the communique to Mr. Gorbachev. [Georgi K. Shakhnazarov, adviser to the Soviet President, said in an interview on the ''MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour'' that Mr. Gorbachev would address the members of NATO if invited.]  While the ministers toiled on the communique under the chairmanship of the Dutch Foreign Minister, Hans van den Broek, the 16 national leaders attended a dinner given by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. **********There appeared to be no rifts so severe within the alliance they could not be bridged, and a German official said the day's meetings went smoothly, but both the British and the French were arguing for language somewhat more hawkish than that proposed by the United States. **********Thatcher's Strategy **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain implictly criticized Mr. Bush's proposal about weapons of ''last resort,'' remarking that ''we must not replace flexible response with inflexible response.'' **********Her spokesman later disclosed that Britain was trying to make Mr. Bush's proposed language more ambiguous, in the belief that only imprecise language would leave the Soviet Union in sufficient doubt as to when and where nuclear weapons would be used and thus constitute an effective deterrent. **********The President, on the other hand, proposed the phrase ''last resort'' precisely because it might allay some of Mr. Gorbachev's strategic concerns. **********'Generally Positive Response' **********Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the allies had given ''a generally positive response'' to Mr. Bush's opening presentation. **********''But as of yet, we don't have agreement on all the points,'' he added at a briefing tonight. ''The debate is real. The discussion is real.'' Trying to sum up the purpose of the meeting, Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, a key figure in arranging it, said, ''If we admit that there is a real risk that the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact countries might feel left out of things, then our role is to reassure them and to integrate them in a system of stability.'' **********Although this conference has often been described as the one at which NATO's new mission will be defined, its purpose is in fact more limited, allied diplomats said. The goal is to promise such a redefinition to help persuade Moscow that the cold war is really over, but it is also to prod the Soviet Union into action of its own on arms control, economic change and, above all, acquiescence in NATO membership for a reunited Germany later this year. **********Bush Presents Ideas **********''We want to reassure them and bring pressure on them at the same time,'' a senior American official said. ''We want to say, 'We are prepared to go down this new road, but we'll do it only if you're ready to join us.' '' **********To that end, Mr. Bush offered his ideas on altering the NATO nuclear doctrine. **********The participants in the meeting here were intensely conscious of the fact that it coincided with the potentially pivotal Communist Party Congress in Moscow. Mrs. Thatcher said she had received messages in the last 24 hours from both Mr. Gorbachev and President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia. **********''They are just as interested in this summit as we are here who attend it,'' the Prime Minister said in her speech. ''This century has been marked by war and suffering on an unparalleled scale. Nevertheless in its closing decade we are seeing new hope and new aspirations about the world.'' **********Mitterrand Has Reservations **********Endorsing what he called ''the spirit'' of United States proposals for redirecting NATO, President Francois Mitterrand of France also expressed some reservations about language. NATO's nuclear policy, he said, ''should have the unambiguous aim of nipping war in the bud, of preventing it breaking out, not simply of attempting to win,'' which sounded like a veiled criticism of the ''last resort'' formulation. **********None of the senior national leaders explicitly proposed a ''no first use'' nuclear policy for the alliance, but the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, a German, insisted in a radio interview in West Germany that NATO had always been ''a purely defensive alliance and would never be the first to use weapons of any sort.'' **********Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who has set the pace over the last year in building a new Europe in the wake of Communism's collapse, said publicly for the first time today that he would be prepared to negotiate at the conventional arms talks in Vienna ''the level of forces to be maintained by a united Germany.'' The Soviet Union has expressed concern about the size of German forces now that the Warsaw Pact buffer zone has all but vanished. **********Germans Ready to Talk **********Previously, the plan had been to address that issue later. But Mr. Kohl's spokesman, Hans Klein, said West Germany was ready to talk now, even though the Government in Bonn has not yet agreed upon a force level. **********Mr. Kohl also expressed willingness to sign a nonagression agreement along with other NATO and Warsaw Pact nations, as did Mr. Mitterrand. But though the French President said he would prefer to act through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, France's favored vehicle as a pan-European organization to eventually supersede NATO and the Warsaw Pact. **********Mrs. Thatcher appeared somewhat less enthusiastic. **********President Bush's package of confidence-building measures, which had been sent in a letter to NATO leaders several days ago, included withdrawal of nuclear artillery shells from Europe in addition to the nonaggression declaration and the proposal for the use of new language in stating NATO's policy on the use of nuclear weapons. **********New Institutions Weighed **********Mr. Bush's timetable for artillery shells, most of which are based in East Germany, would require Moscow to complete troop withdrawals from Eastern Europe before the last of the 1,400 shells were pulled out. But Mr. Kohl, whose country has a large anti-nuclear lobby, said he favored acting after the conclusion of a treaty cutting conventional forces, before actual withdrawals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/14/business/company-news-bally-delays-interest-payment.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bally Delays Interest Payment", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bally Delays Interest Payment", "body_text": " **********The Bally Manufacturing Corporation said yesterday that it would not make an interest payment of $5 million scheduled for Dec. 15 on its 10 percent convertible subordinated debentures due in 2006.

The 280-bed, not-for-profit voluntary institution, which contains a 60-bed nursing home wing, was established in 1977. **********Harris Village differs significantly from the so-called life-care communities proliferating around the country. Such communities also offer health services along with housing, but they charge high entrance fees that give buyers no equity in their homes and that are seldom refunded in full. The Harris Village plan allows buyers or their heirs to resell their units at any time, with any profits going to them. Residents will also have all the tax benefits of homeownership. They will pay for any medical services needed through Medicare and private supplemental health insurance. **********Hospital officials developed the concept and brought in a private developer, Harris Village Partners of Chappaqua, N.Y., as a joint venture partner. **********Harris Village is believed to be one of the few communities in which a hospital and a developer have teamed up to serve the elderly. The land for the project, a 35-acre tract, is now part of the hospital's grounds but will be deeded to the developer when sales begin next month. **********The community will look no different from other residential complexes springing up in this vacation resort area. The development is structured as a cooperative, but it has no underlying mortgage. Purchasers will buy their units as they would in any other cooperative, and they will pay a monthly fee to cover real estate taxes, maintenance, housekeeping and one meal a day. **********Buyers, or one spouse in the case of couples, must be 55 or older, but the average age is expected to be in the mid-70's. Health problems are not a limitation. Although some residents at Harris Village may ultimately have to enter a nursing home, the hope is that many will be able to avoid it because the hospital's comprehensive geriatric services will be provided on an outpatient basis. **********Indeed, the idea for Harris Village grew out of the realization by hospital administrators that the elderly can often be kept out of nursing homes if they have other options, like home care and day care. **********In return for its land, the hospital will receive a percentage of the sales, which is expected to net it more than $1 million. Hospital services to residents, home care and other services are expected to add more than $300,000 to annual revenues. **********''We have a housing project that's first class, and we're saying that if you come live here, we'll keep you with friends and loved ones as long as possible,'' said Martin I. Richman, Community General's executive director. **********Harris Village, whose architect is David Smotrich & Partners of Manhattan, will have a mix of one- and two-bedroom town houses and apartments. A 15,000-square-foot community center will offer dining, a cocktail lounge, a convenience store and a library among other amenities. There will also be an outdoor swimming pool and a tennis court. The Life Care Services Corporation of Des Moines will be the operator and manager. **********The development's first 99-unit phase, on which construction will start once contracts are signed for at least 60 of the units, will offer a range of choices from a 750-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment priced at $137,500 to a two-bedroom, 1,700-square-foot two-story town house for $225,000. Occupancy will be available in 1992. **********The 60-unit, three-story U-shaped apartment house, with front porches, gabled rooflines and traditional facades, has been designed to look like a turn-of-the-century Catskills hotel. All apartments have either a balcony or a porch. The town houses, most of which will be on one level, will be built in clusters of three to six units and each will have a one-car garage. They will also have front porches to promote the feeling of a small village. **********''The whole idea is one of aging in place with a degree of security, and that security also comes from interchange among people,'' said Mr. Smotrich, who is also the managing partner of the Chappaqua development group. **********Monthly maintenance fees, over which the cooperative corporation will have future control, will initially range from $1,014 to $1,195.

Mr. Jonah is traveling and could not be reached for comment. **********Calls It Embarrassing **********In the interview, he accused Baltic nationalist leaders of exploiting their contacts with the United Nations and said ''they really embarrassed the Secretary General.'' **********The contacts were never publicly announced by any official of the United Nations. **********The United Nations decision to end the contacts with the Baltic nationalists provoked an angry reaction from Americans of Baltic extraction, who accused the organization of failing to defend the ideals of freedom and self-determination in its Charter. **********''This is a shocking submission to Soviet pressure, which diminishes the effectiveness of the United Nations,'' said Margers Pinnis of the Baltic Appeal to the United Nations, one organization seeking United Nations help in winning self-determination for Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. **********Ojars E. Kalnins, spokesman for the Latvian American Association, called the United Nations decision ''outrageous,'' saying it ''follows a pattern of craven surrender to the Soviets.'' **********Ginte Damusis of the Lithuanian Information Center said ''it is scandalous to see United Nations officials running scared of Moscow.'' **********Contacts Are Ended **********Americans of Baltic extraction say the contacts were with the Office of Research and the Collection of Information, a division of the Secretariat headed by Mr. Jonah that briefs Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on world trouble spots where he might be asked to mediate. Officials of that division confirmed today that the contacts had ended, as Mr. Jonah said in the interview. **********''Mr. Jonah's position is illogical,'' Mr. Pinnis said. ''His office should keep up with events in the Baltic region because all the nationalist movements say the United Nations may have a role to play in securing a peaceful transition to independence.'' **********The Soviet Union, which opposes independence for the Baltic republics while admitting that their incorporation in 1940 was illegal, apparently considers that such contacts not only encourage the nationalist movements but also constitute interferance in its internal affairs, officials say. **********Under its Charter, the United Nations is barred from interfering in members' internal affairs, although the organization may be pushing the limits of that prohibition as it sets international standards in fields like human rights and environmental protection."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/17/business/business-people-s-l-failures-benefit-seller-of-troubled-assets.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1990-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 427, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  S.& L.

As for how much of the cargo at the pier today was going to Iraq, he replied briskly, ''No comment.'' **********Seven Ships a Day **********Aqaba receives an annual average of seven ships a day, according to port officials, and seven were tied up today at the modern long wharf at the foot of a craggy range of mountains rising from the desert floor, within sight of Israel's Red Sea port, Eilat. Three other vessels swung at anchor near beaches crowded with European vacationers. **********But there are signs that the Security Council's sanctions and the actions of countries enforcing them are likely to slow Iraqi traffic through Jordan and may already be having an effect. **********Ahmed Issa Habaiba of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company said a vessel he had been expecting was eight days overdue.

Jordanian economists estimate that 40 percent of Jordan's fruit and vegetables and light manufactured goods, as well as more than 20 percent of its phosphate and other minerals, go to Iraq.

A spokesman for the ship-tracking unit said shipping agents were reporting that business for Aqaba had virtually dried up. Many ships that had been on their way to Aqaba ''are diverting,'' he said, adding, ''the number of ships going into there is dropping drastically.'' **********John Prescott, a reporter for Lloyds List International, a newspaper that specializes in shipping, insurance, trade, energy and finance, said he had been told by people in the shipping industry that three vessels waiting to unload at Aqaba were carrying Iraqi-bound cargoes. **********The newspaper also said today that the Tanga, a ship owned by Jebsen, a company based in Bergen, Norway, was ''reportedly forced to continue discharging grain for Iraq at the weekend.'' The Tanga is a Liberian-flagged storage vessel that receives grain from ocean-going ships and then transfers it to trucks. **********In a telephone interview today from Bergen, Jan Pedersen, executive vice president of Jebsen, said today that the Tanga's master had tried to stop operations to comply with Norway's decision to abide by the United Nations sanctions. ''Then the master was threatened, I suppose by the Jordanian police,'' Mr. Pedersen said, and the ship continued operating today. **********Since Jordan's imports also largely come through Aqaba, some experts questioned whether the port had the capacity to handle the volume of cargo that is normally shipped to Kuwait and Iraq via other routes. ''It's a small port, and whether that will be sufficient to sustain Iraq remains to be seen,'' said John Landells, another shipping specialist at Lloyds List. **********But Marvin Zonis, Professor of international political economy at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, said that in normal times Aqaba handled a significant amount of Iraq's foreign trade.

W. Norton & Company is not only profitable, but also independent. **********And unlike other houses, it has never conducted sweeping layoffs or bought other publishing concerns to strip them of their backlists before disbanding them. Indeed, Norton is the only major house owned entirely by its employees. **********''I think they're the best there is,'' said Roger W. Straus, president of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, another quality independent house. ''They're absolutely first rate.'' **********Two Best Sellers **********Two Norton books are riding high on the best-seller lists: ''Liar's Poker'' by Michael Lewis and ''The T-Factor Diet'' by Martin Katahn. Earlier this year it had three best sellers at the same time. But the fortunes of Norton, which has a rich backlist of about 2,500 titles, do not rise and fall on best sellers. **********''We're happy to have them, because they're good for the morale of our authors, editors and sales force,'' said Donald S. Lamm, Norton's chairman and president. ''But our aim is to publish good books as well as we can. We don't see this as a trendy publishing house. In fact, I always say you can tell a trend has passed when Norton publishes a book on the subject.'' **********Actually, Norton publishes many books on many subjects - about 250 titles a year, of which 30 percent are college textbooks. Mr. Lamm will not disclose revenues, but he said the college divison accounts for most profits. He also said the 67-year-old house has been profitable for the last 25 years, although for a couple of years profits were ''razor thin.'' **********'Very Open and Very Smart' **********''Norton has very little bureaucracy,'' said Thomas C. Wallace, a literary agent and former Norton editor. ''Don runs the company, but he consults with others and he listens. He's very open and very smart.'' **********Educated at Yale and Oxford, Mr. Lamm, 58 years old, is partial to what he calls ''undermanagement.'' While there is a weekly editorial meeting, Mr. Lamm said he could not remember ever having a vote on whether to acquire a book. ''We aim for a meeting of the minds,'' he said, ''but there's a strong predilection on my part to let an editor with a passion for a book go ahead with it.'' **********Moreover, there is no end-of-the-year tally of how much money an editor's books made or lost, now common in some houses. **********Norton editors calculate the size of advances on the basis of what the house alone can earn on a book - not from potential earnings from the sale of paperback or book-club rights. While that policy has kept the house from having to write off substantial unearned advances, it has also cost it an occasional name author. **********Norman Cousins, for example, wrote two best sellers for Norton, ''Anatomy of an Illness'' and ''The Healing Heart.'' But when Norton decided the asking price was too high for ''Head First,'' the house and the author reluctantly parted company. That book recently published by E. P. Dutton. **********Norton is best known in educational circles for books on economics and psychology, and for its anthologies and critical editions of literary classics. It also publishes an extensive list of music and science books. **********Its longtime slogan is ''Books That Live,'' and Norton has in fact published many such books, including ''The Feminine Mystique'' by Betty Friedan, ''The Revolt of the Masses'' by Jose Ortega y Gasset, ''The Greek Way'' by Edith Hamilton and ''Philosophy'' by Bertrand Russell. **********A Norton speciality is the ''crossover'' book, published for both general and academic markets. A leading crossover author is Stephen Jay Gould, the Harvard paleontologist who has written nine books for Norton. **********''Probably three-quarters of the books I personally edit have double markets,'' said Edwin Barber, the editorial director, who has edited textbooks for about one-half of his 33-year publishing career. **********Mr. Lamm, who has spent his entire 34-year professional career at Norton, was also an editor in the college department. **********Value of Continuity **********''The thing Norton has, and I think we have, is continuity,'' Mr. Straus said. ''Don Lamm and many other Norton people have been there for years, and they consider themselves part of a team.'' **********In 1973, when independent houses were considered fair game for takeovers, George P. Brockway - Mr. Lamm's predecessor as chairman -vowed that Norton ''has never been for sale and is not likely to be.'' Mr. Lamm has also spent many hours discouraging potential suitors. **********After five years, employes are eligible to buy stock that under a 38-year-old ''joint stockholders' agreement'' must be tendered back to the company by retiring employes. The stock is currently held by about two-thirds of the 160 employees on the New York payroll.

And price increases excluding imports (which have gone up sharply because of the declining yen) have fallen even more, to seven-tenths of 1 percent, from 2.5 percent in March. **********In addition, the March report for the Japanese trade surplus indicates that it may be beginning to grow again, another change that would support the yen. In fiscal year 1989, Japan's surplus with its trading partners fell to $47 billion, from $78 billion in 1988. **********A third factor is that the Bank of Japan has allowed interest rates to creep up slightly as the new fiscal year began in April while not moving its official discount rate again. **********Last week the yen-to-dollar exchange rate weakened to the key 160 level, but then bounced back to fall under 157.

''I don't think he misled anyone on purpose. I don't think he was aware of what was happening inside the company.'' **********At a news conference today at its headquarters in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, Philips said Mr. van der Klugt would resign effective July 1 and would be replaced by Jan D. Timmer, the 57-year-old Dutchman who is often praised for revving up the company's consumer-electronics operations. **********Mr. Timmer, the director of the consumer-electronics division since 1987, had been designated to replace Mr. van der Klugt as chairman on July 1, 1991, when Mr. van der Klugt, 65, was scheduled to retire. The analysts say Mr. Timmer is a tougher executive and is likely to manage the company more tightly. **********The analysts said Mr. van der Klugt's downfall came because even as he implemented a long-term plan to cut costs and focus Philips's activities that had been widely praised, he failed to pay sufficient attention to the immediate trouble spots that drained company earnings. **********What is more, the analysts said, Mr. van der Klugt apparently did not get the information he needed to make accurate profit projections. One of the big surprises in the poor quarterly results was a $44 million loss taken for currency translations. The losses were caused partly by the decline of the dollar and yen. **********The analysts said it was unusual for a company as large and sophisticated as Philips not to have done more, through hedging or other means, to prevent such a large currency translation loss. **********The analysts said Mr. Timmer would have to speed up the restructuring program at the $31 billion-a-year electronics giant and would have to plug losses at Philips's most troubled areas, notably computers and integrated circuits. **********''Strategic vision hasn't been Philips's problem,'' said Bill Coleman, an analyst with James Capel & Company in London. ''But maybe that vision took their focus off of the short-term management of areas where they needed to get a quick grasp of the problems.'' **********On May 3, Philips said it had barely broken even on its operating earnings in the quarter, reporting a net income of $3.2 million, on revenues of $6.9 billion. **********Mr. Timmer will have to tie Philips more closely together and assert authority over its operations, the analysts say. ''To turn this thing around is going to take a heck of a lot of time,'' said Mr. Foyil of Phillips & Drew. **********Confidence Is Damaged **********At the news conference today, Wisse Dekker, the chairman of Philips's supervisory board, said: ''Confidence in Philips had been damaged. That's the worst thing that can happen to a company. Drastic measures are needed to restore confidence.'' **********Soon after taking the helm in 1986, Mr. van der Klugt announced a huge restructuring program that has reduced the work force by more than 20,000. The company has also spun off its heavy appliances division into a venture with the Whirlpool Corporation in the United States and has sold some of its military electronics business to Thomson-CSF S.A. of France. **********Many of the analysts say the computer division might be sold next. But as Philips weighs the computer division's long-term future, it has not taken the tough measures that concerns like Ing. C. Olivetti & Company S.p.A. and Nixdorf Comptuer A.G. have taken to control costs during a shakeout in Europe's computer industry. **********Mr. Timmer has shown far greater toughness that Mr. van der Klugt in closing plants and consolidating operations. **********Preserving European Jobs **********Mr. van der Klugt, who frequently talked about the importance of preserving jobs in Europe, has said that a factor making it hard to compete with the Japanese was that so many Philips plants were in high-cost European countries. **********To help turn around the company's consumer-electronics division, Mr. Timmer placed far more emphasis on marketing. Philips is an acknowledged technological leader - it invented the videocassette recorder and compact disk. But it has consistently fallen behind the Japanese in transforming its basic concepts into hot-selling consumer products. **********The analysts expect Mr. Timmer to continue cutting costs and emphasizing marketing strategies in the consumer electronics and lighting divisions. Philips is the world's No. 1 producer of lightbulbs and television picture tubes. **********But more radical measures are expected in ''non-core'' fields, like computers and medical systems, where many of the analysts say Philips's operations are too small to achieve the size needed to thrive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/business/company-news-chemical-said-to-plan-job-cutbacks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1990-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 411, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Chemical Said to Plan Job Cutbacks", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Chemical Said to Plan Job Cutbacks", "body_text": " **********The Chemical Banking Corporation is planning to cut more than 300 jobs in its consumer banking business in an effort to improve profits by reducing expenses, according to Chemical employees, who asked not to be indentified. **********Most of the affected jobs are in the marketing, administration and operations offices at 277 Park Avenue and 52 Broadway in Manhattan.

The banking company employs about 10,000 workers in its consumer banking business. **********Acquired New Jersey Bank **********In 1989, when non-interest expenses rose 11.4 percent, to $2.73 billion, the bank said the rise was entirely due to costs involving its Chemcial New Jersey unit and real estate owned by its Texas Commerce Bancshares subsidiary. **********But some bank analysts also pointed to the rise in other expenses, which do not include salaries, benefits, occupancy costs or equipment, as an area of concern. Those expenses rose $42.4 million in the year, to $809.4 million, excluding a $90 million charge for real estate owned by Texas Commerce. **********Some of the rise in expenses, a Chemcial executive noted, resulted from the introduction of new consumer banking products at Chemical New Jersey, formerly the Horizon Bancorp.

So does Adam M. Aron, its new senior vice president for marketing, who starts work on Monday when he leaves his current earthbound employer, Hyatt Hotels. **********Mr. Aron says he wants to spend more advertising dollars to build brand loyalty to United, which he says will be especially important as a recession looms and the price of jet fuel soars. And he hopes, competitors willing, to escape the industry's destructive round of fare discounting. \"For every person who wants a cheaper airplane ride,\" he said in an interview, \"there is another person who wants a better airplane ride.\" **********He would also like to see less emphasis on destination in United's marketing. \"My message would no longer be, 'We fly the Pacific,' but, 'Here's how we fly the Pacific.' \" **********Mr. Aron has his job cut out for him. With United's recent deal to buy Pan Am's routes to London, which is subject to British regulatory approval, United must cast itself as more of an international airline and must learn to sell itself to Europeans. **********For clues to Mr. Aron's brand-building approach, one needs look only at his successful \"The Hyatt Touch\" marketing campaign, which emphasized Hyatt's facilities, room service and frequent-guest program, modeled after the airlines' frequent-flier programs. **********But the Hyatt television commercials are also frankly sensual. As the Platters sing a version of their hit \"The Magic Touch,\" the camera pans past fluttering curtains, bedsheets in artful disarray and enough lithe limbs to outrage retired hotel detectives everywhere. Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, in Boston, handles the Hyatt account. **********The UAL Corporation, United's parent company, is not feeling quite that frisky, but it is getting there. UAL spent an estimated $127 million last year on print and broadcast advertising. But its marketing has been pretty much in a holding pattern because of the three-year battle over who will own the carrier. The airlines' unions had sought to it, as did other parties. The unions' latest bid collapsed last month. **********Mr. Aron said he admired United's current campaign, devised by Leo Burnett USA of Chicago, and planned no changes in the agency or its longtime slogan, \"Fly the Friendly Skies of United.\" Burnett's commercials are lushly colored, briskly edited montages of airplanes and foreign ports of call, with the booming strains in the background of George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" **********With the ownership question apparently resolved, UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, has taken firm control of United. He is buying a record number of new planes and also wants a new marketing approach. That effort will be led by Mr. Aron, a Wolf protege from 1982 when Mr. Wolf was senior vice president for marketing at Pan American World Airways and Mr. Aron was liaison to Pan Am's travel agencies. **********At 36 years old, Mr. Aron has a Harvard M.B.A. and is a marketing veteran from Western Air Lines as well as Pan Am. When Mr. Aron was with Western in 1985, the California carrier emphasized such amenities as steak, shrimp and champagne on its $59 flight from Los Angeles to Seattle. **********Mr. Aron also revived Western's venerable slogan, \"Western Air Lines -- the Only Way to Fly.\" He said the slogan helped a great deal in a brutal competitive battle in California, which nonetheless resulted in Western being acquired by Delta Air Lines. **********\"There was a lot of equity in that Western slogan and there is a very big lesson for United Airlines in that,\" Mr. Aron said. \"Way too many marketers underestimate the brand loyalty of airline customers.\" **********Mr. Aron sees many similarities between airlines and his most recent employer, the hotel business. Both are similarly seasonal, have similar business and leisure customers, and, most of all, have similar kinds of \"perishable inventory.\" **********\"An unsold hotel room is like an empty airline seat,\" he said. \"Once the sun sets or the airplane door closes, you're not going to make any money from it.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/19/business/salomon-unit-chosen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 160, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Salomon Unit Chosen", "print_headline": "Salomon Unit Chosen", "body_text": " **********The Resolution Trust Corporation said today that it had selected Salomon Asset Management Inc., a subsidiary of Salomon Inc., to serve as its adviser for selling high-yield ''junk bonds.''

The company, using its editorial discretion, chose not to publish these submissions and other similar material. **********Yet some authors have made the bizarre suggestion that Prodigy is required to publish whatever is submitted and that failure to do so is censorship in violation of their Constitutional rights of free speech. Prominent newspapers, including The New York Times, have taken the bait, suggesting that a new area of First Amendment law is emerging. They should know better. **********The First Amendment protects private publishers, like The New York Times and Prodigy, from Government interference in what we publish. The Constitution bestows no rights on readers to have their views published in someone else's private medium. What the Constitution does give readers is the right to become publishers themselves. **********The issue here is not the law -- that was decided 200 years ago. Nor is it public access -- Prodigy is not a common carrier. The real issue is freedom of choice. If consumers want to read uninhibited, titillating conversation, they can find it on hundreds of wide-open electronic bulletin boards. But if some of them want to subscribe to a family service, confident that what appears on their screen is appropriate for any family member, should they not have that option too? **********Is the home computer screen conceptually different from the home television screen? If the Disney Channel chooses to exclude certain types of raw movies, does that make them guilty of censorship? For my chidren's sake, I hope not. **********One of the blessings of our society is its diversity, letting citizens choose anything from Disney to X-rated movies, from Prodigy to \"adult\" computer bulletin boards. If that makes Prodigy \"the Disney of on-line companies,\" that's fine with us. **********We make no apology for pursuing a value system that reflects the culture of the millions of American families we aspire to serve. Certainly no responsible newspaper does less when it chooses the type of advertising it publishes, the letters it prints, the degree of nudity and unsupported gossip its editors tolerate. **********In discussing this matter, some people confuse private messages with public editorial features published by Prodigy. Private messages sent between Prodigy members through our network are just that, strictly private. The content is a personal matter between sender and receiver, who are the only ones to see it. So the question of censorship does not apply. **********But separately, Prodigy -- like a large newspaper -- publishes hundreds of daily editorial features. A few of these features are topical forums, on such subjects as travel, personal finance and the arts, that include material selected from what our readers submit for public posting. It is the publisher's responsibility to control that selection. **********That control is what any newspaper does.

In their ruling in Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, the Justices locked the doors of Federal courthouses to most customers who contend that they were defrauded by stockbrokers. **********The case that set the precedent is now entering its seventh year. The couple who brought the action are still pursuing their claim that they were defrauded of $560,000 through ''churning'' - excessive buying and selling to create commissions. The dispute has cost both sides hundreds of thousands of dollars. **********In one of several decisions in the McMahon case, a Federal appeals court said last week that the tactics of Shearson ''unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied'' the proceedings. **********The case seems to have fulfilled the prophecy of Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who predicted in his 1987 dissent that the Supreme Court ruling would have the opposite effect of its intentions, actually leading to more litigation over satellite issues. **********In its landmark decision, the Supreme Court reversed course on 24 years of rulings. Previously, securities fraud disputes, even those in which the parties had signed agreements favoring arbitration, had been accepted by the courts. But in the McMahon case, the Justices approved standard form agreements signed by customers and brokers that have clauses, usually in fine print, relegating all such disputes to arbitration. **********The McMahons had argued that they should be allowed their day in court. Like other customers who challenged the securities industry, they said the arbitration panels, often made up of former securities executives, tend to award smaller damages and favor broker-defendants. But in the McMahon case, the Supreme Court ruling has done little to reduce legal bills or insure swift justice. **********''It's getting to be more and more like a court case,'' said Theodore G. Eppenstein, the McMahons' lawyer, who said the two sides are now fighting over what evidence can be obtained. **********The plodding pace has not been lost on Wilfred Feinberg, a Federal Appeals judge who was part of the panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that last week issued the ruling on a related aspect of the McMahon case. Told during arguments where the case stands, Judge Feinberg said, ''So much for a speedy and economical method of resolving the dispute.'' **********Jeffrey L. Friedman, a lawyer for Shearson, declined to comment on the appeals court's unusually critical language regarding his client. **********The McMahon proceeding has interested some members of Congress who are examining the arbitration process. Three weeks ago, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked the General Accounting Office to review how the industry conducts arbitration. **********The latest wrangling in the McMahon dispute has been over a move by Shearson to have Mr. Eppenstein penalized for one aspect of the case. **********Mr. Eppenstein said he had elected to file with the American Arbitration Association because he considered it fairer than the New York Stock Exchange, in which a person from the securities industry is included on each panel and the parties in the dispute can challenge the seating of only one member of the three-member panel. **********Despite a Federal District Court order saying the McMahons had the right to choose where to file, Shearson filed the arbitration with the Stock Exchange. Mr. Eppenstein then went to New York Supreme Court to stop Shearson's move, provoking Federal District Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon to impose a $1,000 fine on the lawyer. **********In a significant decision on Rule 11, the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that has been increasingly used to penalize lawyers for filing frivolous motions, the appeals panel exonerated Mr. Eppenstein and criticized the brokerage house, saying it had drawn out the legal proceeding. **********Quoting Charles Dickens, Federal Appeals Judge Richard J. Cardamone said Rule 11 was motiviated by a fear that lawyers had been engaging in ''stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on slippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running their . . . heads against walls of words, and making a pretense of equity with serious faces, as players might.'' **********Despite Mr. Eppenstein's vindication on the Rule 11 issue, Shearson has had its way on the forum. The case is in arbitration at the New York Stock Exchange, although not even a pre-arbitration conference has been scheduled. **********Asked why the case wound up there, Mr. Eppenstein said that another move in the Federal courts would not be worthwhile for his clients.

Hatsopoulos has a more ambitious perspective. Thermo Electron's founder and chief executive believes his 36-year-old company would be a $7 billion business, roughly 10 times its current size, if he had been running it in Japan instead of here in suburban Boston. **********Mr. Hatsopoulos envies the access Japanese executives enjoy to cheap capital for investment in new ventures. Not only are Japanese interest rates lower, but Japanese companies are able to raise money by selling their stock at prices that Americans would regard as wildly inflated. **********\"A new venture here has to have twice the rate of return it would need in Japan to pay off,\" grumbled Mr. Hatsopoulos recently. **********If any executive in American industry has demonstrated how to brood constructively rather than cower in the face of such discrepancies, it is Mr. Hatsopoulos, a 63-year-old Greek immigrant who has fashioned Thermo Electron into an unusual mini-conglomerate of high-technology businesses. A sampling of the Thermo product family: small power plants that burn agricultural waste; trucks designed to incinerate petroleum-soaked soil; bomb detectors; more than 100 types of instruments to monitor environmental contamination; dressings for wounds, and gas-fired air conditioners. **********The common theme for most Thermo products is that they represent gambles on innovative technology to attack potentially huge markets in socially important areas, like the environment. Lately, the company has been bouncing from success to success while many of its more famous neighbors in the high-tech corridor surrounding Boston report slumping earnings. On Thursday, it reported that earnings in the quarter ended Sept. 29 rose 35 percent, to $9.5 million, while revenues jumped more than 27 percent, to $181 million. **********A mechanical engineer by training who taught thermodynamics courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the company's early years, Mr. Hatsopoulos began worrying about the cost of capital nearly a decade ago. Thermo Electron stumbled into an earnings downturn as recession gripped the country, but Mr. Hatsopoulos wanted to forge ahead with investments in a number of technologies he believed would become useful for dealing with the world's energy and environmental problems. And he wanted to do it without borrowing heavily. **********Mr. Hatsopoulos, who cultivates a wide circle of influential friends in government, industry and academia as part of his effort to anticipate business opportunities, delved so deeply into capital formation issues that he eventually became recognized as one of corporate America's leading experts on the subject. In 1982, he joined the board of the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston and served a two-year stint as its chairman that ended last year. **********\"I learned some things from him, and I never had a quicker student,\" said Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist, who was one of the first experts Mr. Hatsopoulos turned to for help. \"Today, he's right at the research frontier in this field and in a better position than most academics to say where theory meshes with experience.\" **********THE research also led Mr. Hatsopoulos and his younger brother John, the company's chief financial officer, to gradually invent Thermo Electron's unique corporate structure. Starting in 1983, Thermo Electron has repeatedly set up pieces of the company as separate businesses and sold anywhere from 10 percent to 40 percent or so of their shares to institutional investors or the public at large. The goal was to give investors a chance to bet directly on the development of various pieces of Thermo Electron's broad technology base and to establish a clear market value for the strongest subsidiaries, which in turn raises the value of Thermo Electron shares. **********\"Spinning off some of our best divisions gives investors a simple picture,\" said Mr. Hatsopoulos. **********It also allowed Thermo Electron to give managers stock options in their businesses, an incentive that is widely recognized as a heady stimulant for most executives. In addition, the option packages have helped Thermo Electron recruit and hang on to talented executives who wanted to run their own show. And dealing with outside shareholders helps groom potential successors for the top jobs in the company, according to Mr. Hatsopoulos, who says he hopes to stay at the company's helm another 10 years. **********About 850 of the company's 5,000 employees are in various option plans and 95 percent of all employees are shareholders, according to John Hatsopoulos. The company has to grow to make those investments attractive because George Hatsopoulos is dead set against paying dividends. **********Thermo Electron's spinoff strategy is by no means unique. Waste Management Inc., for example, won applause on Wall Street for selling 20 percent of its hazardous waste handling subsidiary, Chemical Waste Management Inc., to the public. But no company has taken the strategy as far as Thermo Electron. **********THERMO ELECTRON's publicly traded subsidiaries currently include: Thermo Instrument Systems Inc., a leading supplier of environmental monitoring equipment, as well as engineering and testing services; Thermo Process Systems Inc., which makes high-temperature metal treatment equipment and waste incinerators; Tecogen Inc., which makes gas-fired equipment ranging from experimental auto engines to energy-saving air conditioners marketed by the Carrier Corporation and small-scale cogeneration systems that simultaneously generate electricity and steam heat, and Thermedics Inc., which makes a number of medical products and has been a pioneer in the development of supersensitive devices to detect explosives and drugs. **********Through Thermedics, Thermo Electron also controls Thermo Cardiosystems Inc., which makes implantable pumps that keep damaged hearts beating regularly until patients can receive transplants, and Universal Voltronics Inc., which makes equipment to convert electricity supplied by utilities to currents and voltages used in industrial and military tasks with unusual power needs. **********The next Thermo \"pup,\" as analysts call the spinoffs, is likely to be Thermo Energy Systems Inc., which makes other cogeneration equipment, waste heat recovery systems and power plants fueled by alternate energy sources like agricultural wastes. Thermo Electron sold a 10 percent stake in Thermo Energy to institutional investors in Europe last summer for $8.5 million and hopes to have a public offering next spring. **********The private placement reflected the strong following the company has built up overseas as part of its effort to court longterm investors. Well over 80 percent of the debt of Thermo and its spinoffs is potential equity, in the form of debentures that are convertible into stock in the parent company or the various spinoffs, and more than half the convertible debt has been placed in Europe. Foreign investors now hold 35 percent of the parent company's shares, according to John Hatsopoulos. **********The Thermo spinoffs account for more than two-thirds of the company's sales. The most obvious drawback of the strategy is that accounting costs and other administrative expenses are relatively high, reflecting the extra filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and multiple annual reports. Each company has its own board of directors, but making sure that all dealings between the subsidiaries are fair to each company's shareholders is no mean feat. **********\"We don't make one move without the blessing of the legal department,\" said John Hatsopoulos. **********The strategy also results in frequent profits from stock sales that make earnings look stronger than the actual results from the operating companies. At times, some analysts believe, investors have bid the price of the company up higher than its operating achievements warrant. **********\"But Thermo has a relatively low degree of risk for a high-tech company,\" said Otis Bradley, who follows the company and its offspring for H. C. Wainwright & Company, a Boston brokerage. \"They have always had a fetish about maintaining a strong balance sheet. And they seem to get a strong market position in almost everything they do.\" **********THE spinoff strategy has led some observers to describe Thermo Electron itself as a venture capital holding company, a research and development firm, or, in the word's of one analyst, a \"perpetual idea machine.\" Such views square with Mr. Hatsopoulos's track record of pursuing many intriguing-sounding concepts in the belief that a few will become commercially successful enough to compensate for the disappointments. **********Thermo Electron existed in its early years entirely on research contracts from government agencies and industry groups like the Gas Research Institute. Last year, more than half of Thermo Electron's $45 million research budget was financed by outside sources. **********But Mr. Hatsopoulos's goal is to lead a multibillion-dollar company. With that in mind, the company sticks to projects where it can retain the right to commercialize the results. **********\"We have been working 25 years on artificial heart projects that we expect to bear fruit in the next three years, but the $70 million that has been spent was N.I.H. money,\" said Mr. Hatsopoulos, referring to the Federally funded National Institutes of Health. \"That's the advantage of working on socially important technologies.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/14/business/brazilian-stock-speculator-is-freed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 272, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brazilian Stock Speculator Is Freed", "print_headline": "Brazilian Stock Speculator Is Freed", "body_text": " **********A Brazilian judge has freed the stock speculator Naji Robert Nahas, who was placed under house arrest after causing a crisis in Brazil's stock exchanges last year, officials said today. **********Federal Judge Augusto Guilherme Diefenthaeler, who ordered Mr. Nahas arrested last July, released him on Friday night while an inquiry into his stock dealings continued. **********Mr. Nahas had been confined to his apartment in Sao Paulo for seven months. **********Mr. Nahas, 43 years old, who was born in Lebanon, said he would return to work as the head of his own firm but would not deal with the Brazilian stock markets. **********Mr. Nahas still faces charges of fraud and crimes against the economy.

But he added, ''Whether, in addition, it will be possible to combine elections in East Germany with that date will be a question for discussion in the very near future.'' **********The Chancellor would not comment specifically on when all-German elections would be held or how they would be organized given the postwar limits on West German sovereignty. **********Mr. Kohl's reaction to the public uncertainty over reunification, which he blamed for Sunday's electoral losses in North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, seemed at first blush contradictory. But political analysts said his suggestion that the unity process might be stepped up was rooted in several factors, most notably the boost that the prospect of reunification has given to the Christian Democrats' political fortunes. **********While the Christian Democrats have lost 11 of 12 regional and national elections since the previous general election in January 1987, the margin of defeat has narrowed substantially since the Berlin wall was opened in November. **********The Christian Democrats also scored a major victory when their East German counterparts won East Germany's first free elections on March 18, emerging as the nation's strongest party. If all-German elections were held today, the Christian Democrats would be likely to win. **********Those gains are threatened, however, by the pan-German anxiety about the social and financial costs of unity and international developments, Bonn officials said. **********The opposition Social Democratic Party, which favors a slower approach to German unity, scored a narrow win in Lower Saxony and retained power in North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany's most populous state. While political analysts said the results were a setback for the Christian Democrats, they were largely decided by local issues and cannot be seen as a referendum on Mr. Kohl's unity policy. **********Three Elements Seen **********A senior West German official said there were three main elements behind Mr. Kohl's hint today that unity could be expedited. **********''First there is uncertainty concerning the Soviet Union,'' he said. ''Gorbachev could come under even greater pressure through the economic situation and the nationalities struggle. That could result in slowing down the process of German unification or raising the stakes.'' **********The second factor is the financial cost. ''Every month that goes by without unification makes the whole thing even more expensive,'' he said, adding that East Germany ''has to fulfill its international economic obligations while the economic condition gets worse.'' **********Finally, the official said, Bonn fears that if the expectations of East Germans not rapidly met, they will begin pouring into the West again. **********Mr. Kohl may also be worried his appeal among West Germans will decline the longer the unification process takes, thereby reducing his chances to become the first leader of a unified Germany. **********'Two Plus Four' Talks Held **********But obstacles must be cleared away before all-German elections can be held, experts said. Foremost among them are the the so-called ''two plus four'' talks involving the two Germanys and the four World War II victors: Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union. **********Calling for early all-German elections would put more pressure on the talks, which began May 5. The negotiations center on the relationship of a united Germany with the Eastern and Western alliances, the presence of foreign troops in the two Germanys, and an end to the limits on sovereignty that the four powers have imposed on Germany. **********It is unclear whether the issues of the two-plus-four talks must be resolved before all-German elections are held, and whether the four victorious Allies would have a say in the timing of the elections. **********Those questions appear to worry Mr. Kohl less than pressing ahead with reunification. **********''Our course remains clear,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''Yes to the unity of Germany, yes to European unity.'' **********''Everyone who understands anything about international developments advises me: 'Act soon,' '' Mr. Kohl said. **********Meets East German Leader **********That appeared to be Mr. Kohl's main message when he traveled to West Berlin late today and met with the East German Prime Minister, Lothar de Maiziere, who is head of East Germany's Christian Democratic Union. **********After the talks, Mr. Kohl said the two had discussed details of the treaty to join the two Germanys economically. ''We have a very tight schedule,'' Mr. Kohl said. ''We have a lot to work on.'' **********A draft of the treaty merging the two nations' currencies and economies was worked out by East and West German negotiators over the weekend. Hans Klein, the Bonn Government spokesman, said today that the treaty should be formally approved by Bonn on Friday. The treaty then goes to the East and West German Parliaments for approval. Formal political union and all-German elections would follow, although the sequence of those two steps is uncertain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/28/business/business-people-creator-of-companies-builds-profit-by-region.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1990-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 496, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Creator of Companies Builds Profit by Region", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Creator of Companies Builds Profit by Region", "body_text": " **********Ten years ago, Ian R.

The military has run the country openly since crushing pro-democracy demmnstrations in September 1988. **********The main opposition party, the National League for Democracy, itself emerged from the 1988 demonstrations behind the charismatic leadership of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the daughter of the country's founder. The military put her under house arrest, incommunicado, nearly a year ago. **********Military Said to Be Split **********Faced with this overwhelming victory by the League, the military has been stalling, say diplomats here and in Yangon, formerly Rangoon. The diplomats suggest that the military is puzzled and divided, and at the very least wants to insure that its own interests and reputation are protected by any new civilian government. **********Even before the election, Gen. Saw Maung, the leader of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the military junta that runs the country, said any transfer of power would occur only after the new parliament writes a new Constitution. **********Diplomats say they think the military expected a split result, with no party winning a two-thirds majority or even a simple majority, meaning a drawn-out negotiation over a new constitution. **********In official results finally announced on Saturday, a month and three days after the vote, the National League for Democracy won 396 of the 485 seats at stake, nearly 82 percent of the total. Since the League only contested 450 seats, it actually won 88 percent of the seats for which it ran. **********Defeat for Ruling Party **********Just 10 seats went to the military-backed National Unity Party, the direct inheritor of General Ne Win's Burma Socialist Program Party that for many years was the country's only party. **********The remainder were shared among various smaller parties opposed to the military or representing Myanmar's many ethnic minorities. Some minority parties themselves were affiliated with the League. **********In the immediate aftermath of the vote, when the size of its majority became clear, the League said it was ready to install a new constitution, based largely on the country's last democratic one, dating from 1947, within a matter of weeks. But nothing happened. **********Calls from the League's current leadership for talks with the military on a handover of power have been rebuffed. There has also been no response to the League's request for the release of political prisoners. Both Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and the party's co-leader, U Tin Oo, are still under detention, along with most of its executive committee. Hundreds of other Burmese who took an open political stand against the military also remain in jail. **********'When the Time Is Right' **********Military spokesman simply say that they will meet with the League ''in due course,'' or ''when the time is right.'' **********Diplomats have read comments in the one official newspaper printed in Myanmar as suggesting that no national assembly meeting could be held until September, because the Electoral Commission first had to investigate charges of fraud. **********Today, the line from the military altered slightly, appearing to postpone matters further. In a statement by a military spokesman in Yangon, the army said all 27 parties winning seats should first hold meetings among themselves to discuss a new constitution. **********Meeting With Parties **********''Only after they have done so'' will the army ''meet and coordinate with them,'' the spokesman said. But there was no indication what might follow those meetings, or when the parliament will actually convene. **********Diplomats point to July 20 as an important date. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was put under house arrest a year ago on that date, with a year's sentence, renewable yearly. League officials hope the military will release her then. **********But Western diplomats are less optimistic. Some suggest she may simply be bundled secretly onto a plane, her Burmese passport revoked, and sent to rejoin her British husband. **********But if she is not released or deported, diplomats warn, popular demonstrations against the military could again break out, with violent consequences.

He does not want to lose the votes of strongly conservative Germans who might want to reassert territorial claims in western Poland. **********Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl are also expected to discuss ways to keep a united Germany in NATO and defy heavy Soviet pressure to weaken German links with the Atlantic alliance. **********Mr. Kohl is expected to ask Mr. Bush to support a speed-up in the process of unification that would conceivably permit East Germans to vote in West Germany's December elections. **********The visiting German leader is expected to contend that only rapid unification can avert the economic and political collapse of East Germany and stem the flood tide of East Germans leaving for West Germany. **********Mr. Kohl's visit comes just three weeks before East Germans go to the polls to choose a new government. One of the chief functions of the new government will probably be negotiating the terms of union with West Germany. **********Food Subsidies Reduced **********In the last few weeks, East Germany's economic crisis has become more severe. Alarmed at the reduction in Government food subsidies, East Germans have rushed to buy flour, sugar and meat, and the East German Government has promised emergency measures to keep up basic food supplies. **********West German officials now say that East Germany might seek union as soon as possible after its March 18 elections. **********Robert Gerald Livingston, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said that under the West German ''constitution'' - the Basic Law of May 23, 1949 - the constituent states of East Germany could vote to become part of West Germany. American officials say they believe that some of the East German states, or Lander, might do just that after the elections next month. **********American and West German officials said Mr. Kohl would probably discuss that possibility with Mr. Bush when they meet over the weekend. The West German Interior Minister, Wolfgang Schauble, apparently discussed it with American officials when he was in Washington this week to help prepare for Mr. Kohl's visit. **********'Reconstituting the Lander' **********A Western diplomat said tonight that Germans were ''thinking more and more'' about that provision of the Constitution, Article 23, as a vehicle for the swift unification of the Germanys. **********Mr. Kohl's plan for German unity, issued in December, made no reference to that article. But ''things are moving so fast in Germany'' that there is increasing interest in the constitutional procedure for incorporating East German states into West Germany. **********After the March 18 elections, Mr. Livingston said, ''the East German Parliament will probably pass a law reconstituting the Lander'' abolished in 1952. Then in May of this year, he said, the constituent states of East Germany will elect their own legislatures, which could adopt resolutions to merge with West Germany. **********Thus, it appears that Mr. Bush will get the clarification he seeks on Mr. Kohl's timetable for unifying Germany, and the Chancellor will make clear that he wants to achieve that goal sooner rather than later. Administration officials said that Mr. Bush believed it was in the long-term strategic interest of the United States for Germany to be unified and solidly anchored in the West. **********Mr. Bush is expected to use his meeting with Mr. Kohl to underline the importance of continued German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Bush will probably urge Mr. Kohl to stand firm in support of that position as a way to reassure his neighbors in Western and Eastern Europe that they have nothing to fear from a unified Germany. **********Kohl's Vision of Unification **********In Canada on Feb. 13, East and West Germany and the four major World War II Allies agreed on a framework for negotiating German unification after 45 years of division. Under that formula, the ''two plus four'' concept, the two Germanys would discuss the economic, political and legal aspects of unification. Then the four Allies would meet with the two Germanys to discuss security issues like the size of the army for a unified state and its ties to NATO. **********'' 'Two plus four' is a misnomer,'' Mr. Livingston said. ''It will be one plus four. The Germans will come into those discussions with a united delegation. They'll come in under one flag.'' Administration officials said Mr. Kohl would discuss such questions when he lays out his vision of a unified Germany at Camp David this weekend. **********The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said Mr. Bush and Mr. Kohl would talk about ''the full range of issues related to changes in Eastern Europe,'' including the future of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. **********''We don't anticipate any new agreements or announcements,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. Rather, he said, the weekend provides ''an opportunity for the two leaders to discuss the status of events, where they think things are going.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/15/world/a-car-bombing-in-peru-damages-fujimori-s-presidential-residence.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 390, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Car Bombing in Peru Damages Fujimori's Presidential Residence", "print_headline": "A Car Bombing in Peru Damages Fujimori's Presidential Residence", "body_text": " **********A car bomb exploded next to the government palace as Peru's new President, Alberto Fujimori, was meeting with advisers, injuring four passersby, the police said today. **********Other car bombs were set off in the highland cities of Cuzco and Ayacucho, killing one person.

She arranged to take a six-week leave after her son, John, was born in June 1983. The day she got home from the hospital, the station manager and executive news director called to say they wanted to stop by. **********Mary Loftus had spent six years working her way up and was prime-time news anchor at KSNT-TV in Topeka when she became pregnant. She arranged to take a six-week leave after her son, John, was born in June 1983. The day she got home from the hospital, the station manager and executive news director called to say they wanted to stop by. **********''I thought they were going to bring a gift for the baby,'' says Ms. Loftus, 37 years old. ''Instead they fired me.'' Although she was able to get a job at a competing station, she started at the bottom again, for half her former pay. ''The economic loss was substantial,'' she said. ''And I took a giant step backward careerwise.'' After working her way up again, she is now prime-time anchor. **********Things haven't changed much since 1983. Ms. Loftus is one of thousands of women - and men - who have lost their jobs when compelling family or medical needs have forced them temporarily out of the workforce, said Donna Lenhoff, legal director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. **********There are no Federal laws protecting an employee's job if he or she takes medical leave, and more than half the states have no laws on their books. In fact, the United States is one of only two industrialized countries - the other is South Africa - that fails to insure that a woman can return to her job after taking time off to have a child, said Sally F. Goldfarb, staff attorney for the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund. **********What was once ''maternity leave'' now has two components, Ms. Goldfarb said. The first is disability leave, when a woman is physically unable to do her job. The second - ''parenting leave'' - allows a mother or father to take time off to care for a new baby. **********But a broader, newer category - family leave - has drawn attention in Congress and in statehouses nationwide. Efforts are afoot to pass legislation guaranteeing a minimum amount of unpaid ''family leave'' to men and women for the birth or adoption of a child, to care for an elderly parent or to attend to their own medical needs. The trend is toward laws guaranteeing a range of family and medical needs, Ms. Lenhoff said. **********Employees in states without laws are subject to the whims of their employers, Ms. Goldfarb said. For example, a 1978 amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act requires that pregnancy be treated in the same way as any other disability, like a heart attack. The company sets policy: If it typically gives an employee six weeks off to recover from a heart attack, a woman who bears a child could insist on the same leave time. ''If an employer is stingy enough to give disability to nobody, then a worker would have no claim,'' Ms. Goldfarb said. **********Supporters of the family and medical leave laws argue that employees need a guarantee of far broader rights and the only way to get them is through Federal action. **********''American families need a minimum labor standard to protect jobs in times of compelling family need,'' Ms. Lenhoff says. ''Sometimes it is joyous and wonderful, as when a child is born. Sometimes it is horrible, as when a child dies or has a serious medical condition.'' Either way, she says, employees ''need a job to go back to.'' Family leave bills were approved by the House and Senate Labor Committees in 1989. They are expected to be debated on the floor soon. But they face opposition from business and from the Bush Administration. Elizabeth Dole, Secretary of Labor, has said that she will advise the President to veto the bill if it is passed by Congress. **********Employers worry that mandatory family and medical leave laws would hamper their ability to run their businesses, said Fred Rumack, director of tax and legal services at Buck Consultants in New York. And some employers are concerned that, although the bill specifies unpaid leave, ''It may someday require paid leave,'' he said. **********The Senate bill would require employers of 20 or more persons to provide 10 weeks of unpaid medical leave to care for a newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill child or parent and 13 weeks of unpaid medical leave for serious illness of the employee. **********The House version, which would apply to employers with 50 or more workers, would provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave and 15 weeks of temporary medical leave. Employers would also have to keep providing health care coverage during unpaid leave. **********This year, 14 states are considering family or medical leave legislation, Ms. Lenhoff said. Only eight - Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin -have what she considers progressive family and medical leave protection for most employees. **********Although New York has no family leave law, it is one of a small number of states with temporary disability leave insurance, which allows employees to collect a maximum of $170 a week while on disability leave. And a group of business and labor leaders appointed by Gov. Mario Cuomo is studying ways to expand that system. **********Despite the opposition from business, Mr. Rumack believes Federal legislation will be passed. ''It will continue to be passed at the local level and maybe this year, maybe next, at the Federal level,'' he said. **********WHEN TO TAKE THE CASH **********Receiving a lump sum distribution from a qualified retirement plan presents a problem: Is it best to roll this money over into an Individual Retirement Account? **********Financial planners generally recommend an I.R.A. rollover. However, William H. Mears Jr., a partner at Ernst & Young, points out that you should consider two things before rolling the money over: How long you intend to leave it in an I.R.A. and whether tax rates might increase during that period. **********Many experts expect tax rates to go up in 1991. If they do, and if you are over the age of 59 1/2 and thus will not have to pay the l0 percent penalty for early withdrawal, you may be better off paying tax on the lump sum at the current, lower rates, Mr. Mears says, particularly if you will need the money within the next 10 years or so. **********You also may be eligible for a special tax treatment on the money such as 5-year or 10-year income averaging if you pay the tax up front. **********In fact, Mr. Mears suggests that taxpayers over 59 1/2 who will need their money within 10 years consider withdrawing money from an I.R.A. and paying taxes this year rather than facing higher rates later."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/11/business/prices-encourage-search-for-oil-but-labor-is-short.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1990-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1565, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prices Encourage Search for Oil, but Labor Is Short", "print_headline": "Prices Encourage Search for Oil, but Labor Is Short", "body_text": " **********''We've been a very depressed industry,'' said John G. Nikkel, president of the Unit Corporation, a drilling and production company in Tulsa, Okla. ''Getting qualified, skilled people in the right spot, at the right time, is going to be a significant problem for us.'' **********Most of the major oil companies, as well as hundreds of independent producers, hold mineral rights to large proven reserves. But to tap those reserves, they turn to drilling companies that hire workers for 30 days at a time. After the collapse four years ago, many of these workers found jobs elsewhere, whether driving trucks or working in convenience stores, and many are not eager to return to the oilfields. **********The Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, for example, had to delay a drilling program in Kansas because payroll cuts among drillers had reduced the number of specialists it needed for the deep wells it planned. **********Speaking of one drilling contractor Anadarko uses, Paul Taylor, a company spokesman, said: ''There used to be crews in every office that knew this technique. Now there are only two. So, you wait.'' **********Drillers in southeast Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin and in the Austin Chalk range of South Texas also turned down bids from major oil companies to sink new wells because they could not find enough rig workers. **********After 40 years in the oil business, James E. Russell, an independent driller in Abilene, Tex., who operates in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, is drilling with 15 rigs, down from 50 during the boom years and is cautious about expanding. **********'A Lot of Interviewing' **********''If we thought the price would stay up to $25 or more for an extended period, naturally we would work into it,'' he said. ''Most people think this could just be a spike in price, and then fall back down.'' **********Earl Ritchie, vice president of Maxus Energy's exploration unit for North America, said Maxus had been able to hire petroleum engineers and other oilfield brainpower, mostly by luring them from other companies. But he said it was becoming harder to find good job candidates. ''It takes a lot of interviewing now,'' Mr. Ritchie said. ''I don't think a lot of the people who have gotten out of the industry are going to come back.'' **********Given the nation's production and consumption figures, this points to a serious problem. The domestic oil industry's output fell to an average of 7.3 million barrels daily in the first seven months of this year, from an average of 9 million barrels a day in 1985. In the same seven months, the nation's consumers - chemical manufacturers, utilities, car drivers, homeowners and others - used an average of 17 million barrels a day. **********The shortfall was made up by imports, which averaged 8.5 million barrels a day in the period, and by a slight drawing down of existing crude stocks. But the Persian Gulf crisis has led many to fear that the country is depending on imports from an insecure source. Still, the industry feels there is too much uncertainty in that area to conclude that it is time to sink expensive new wells. #1,000 Operating Rigs If the industry believed oil prices would hold above $25 a barrel in the coming years, it would be worth putting hundreds of rigs into exploratory drilling, as well as stepping up output in producing fields. **********Analysts say that if drilling was expanded to 2,000 rigs, from the 1,000 now operating, the slide in output would be halted, and production of natural gas, which is far more plentiful, would be sharply raised. But acute personnel shortages are likely to delay drillers before the count reaches as far as 1,300. **********More than 200,000 rig workers and other oilfield service employees abandoned the drilling business in the last seven years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Their total employment peaked at 434,500 in 1982 during the waning months of a 10-year boom during which the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pushed oil prices higher than $39 a barrel from less than $4 in 1972. **********One producer in the aging fields of East Texas, T. D. Howell, kept all 18 of his rigs during the four lean years and kept an average of 12 of them active during that period. His drilling and production companies have increased the payroll to 418, from 250 in the early 1980's. He was able to do that because as a unusually conservative businessman, he had no debt to repay during the downturn. **********A School for Roughnecks **********''One of my fears is the potential pirating of our employees,'' he said. ''If we tried to kick off another couple of rigs now, I don't know where we would get the personnel. Our rig rate has to go up so we can pay more.'' **********One potential source of workers is a school for roughnecks that Texas A & M University reopened in July for the first time in four years at an extension center in Abilene. But its costs - $2,200 a person for room, board and instruction - kept enrollment down to a dozen men for its first two five-week sessions, despite hundreds of callers. **********''Most of the guys seeking to become rig hands don't have much savings,'' said Will McNair, the program director. ''We approached the oil industry for help and they said, 'We don't have the money, but we need the people.' '' **********In two dozen recent interviews, analysts, academics and executives of drilling companies and independent producers said the tight market for rig crews would sweep the entire oil and gas industry next year if drilling activity rose. **********That, in turn, would lead to higher the offer of higher wages to attract a new generation of workers, and would force drilling costs higher - perhaps pushing rig rates up to $7,000 a day from the present average of $5,000. **********Geologists as Consultants **********George S. Dotson, president of the international drilling unit of Helmerich & Payne Inc., in Tulsa, predicted that higher oil prices would cure recruitment worries. **********''If I had a 25 percent increase in wages across the board, we would be able to attract good people into the business,'' he said. ''They won't be as effective while we train, but we'll be able to man the rigs.'' **********There are also concerns about professionally educated specialists like petroleum engineers, geologists and geophysicists. **********Fred A. Dix, executive director of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, based in Tulsa, said many geologists laid off in 1986 and 1987 have tried to get by financially as consultants to independent producers. Others took jobs with ground water companies or government agencies. **********''There is no shortage of professional geologists right now to handle an accelerated domestic drilling program,'' Mr. Dix said. ''The immediate supply is very good, but as older people move out of the profession, there aren't going to be enough younger ones to replace them.'' **********Need for a Policy **********Collegiate membership in the geologists' association plunged to 300 last year from a peak of more than 2,000 in 1985. And the number of graduate and undergraduate students in petroleum engineering majors fell last year to 2,000, down from 11,500 in 1982, when oil prices averaged $31.22 a barrel and the rig count was more than 3,100. **********Moreover, the squeeze on bank loans, capital and oilfield drilling equipment that began after the debacle in 1986 will also contribute to a longer wait for more domestically pumped oil. **********''The whole industry has been saying we need an energy policy just for the very reason of what is coming up before us right now,'' said Dillard S. Hammett, a vice president and director of the Energy Service Company, an oilfield service company based in Dallas. ''Experienced rig workers have been in short supply for the last six to eight months.'' **********But some players are ready to respond to casting calls from the industry. Sam Wade, a 40-year-old geophysicist in Dallas who quit his job in offshore exploration at ARCO in 1985 amid a huge layoff program, says he is eager to return to the oil business, even though the three video franchise stores he and his wife bought before he left ARCO have prospered. **********Another hopeful sign is at Texas A & M, where the petroleum engineering department registered its biggest freshman class in five years last month, with more than 300 entering students, compared with 46 last year. Starting salaries for those who received bachelor's degrees last May averaged $37,500, while those with master's degrees were paid an average of $39,500. **********And Harry E. Wingfield, a 19-year-old farm boy from Jasper, Tex., dug into his savings to attend the Abilene roughneck school. ''A derrick man has lots of responsibility,'' he said. ''I want to see the oilfield part of the world, make some money and go to college later on.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/02/business/loophole-to-be-used-to-keep-bailout-afloat.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1990-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 724, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loophole to Be Used To Keep Bailout Afloat", "print_headline": "Loophole to Be Used To Keep Bailout Afloat", "body_text": " **********The Bush Administration said this evening that it would use a loophole in the bailout law adopted last year to borrow money to keep the rescue of the nation's savings and loans from grinding to a halt. The new borrowing would enable the Administration to spend an additional $8 billion to $10 billion to continue the rescue, Treasury officials said. **********The decision by the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout, comes less than a week after Congress adjourned until next year without authorizing any new funds for the bailout, which had virtually been out of money.  'Loss Fund' **********Last year's legislation authorized a \"loss fund\" of $50 billion to cover the losses of failed savings institutions. For working capital, the law enabled regulators to borrow up to 85 percent of the value of assets the Government has taken over from failed institutions. **********If the Government needed more money for working capital, the law required it to charge any additional amount against the $50 billion loss fund. **********Working capital is used for a wide variety of purposes, notably the management of assets and institutions under Government control. Government outlays for working capital are supposed to be recouped through the sale of those assets. The assets held by the Government range from mortgages and securities, to land, buildings, golf courses and uranium mines. **********The regulators had run up against the 85 percent cap on working capital and had been forced to keep in reserves just under $15 billion in the loss fund for more working capital. **********But by deciding today to borrow more working capital, the regulators will be freeing $8 billion to $10 billion in the loss fund, out of the amount that had been held in reserves, for spending to continue the bailout. **********The regulators authorized the borrowing of up to another $18.8 billion for working capital.   Error in the Law **********The decision to borrow was based on a loophole that even the authors of last year's legislation have called a drafting error in the law, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. **********Literally interpreted, the provision enables the Administration to borrow the $18.8 billion, which is in addition to the Treasury's original borrowing authorization of that same amount, even though the report accompanying the legislation acknowledged that such an intepretation was clearly not what was intended by either the Congress or the Administration when the law was passed and signed last August by President Bush. Before today, the Resolution Trust Corporation had consistently declined to interpret the legislation to permit further borrowing. **********A spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corporation said any new appropriation would be used primarily to begin the process of resolving the plight of 18 institutions with assets of more than $30 billion. The spokesman, Stephen J. Katsanos, said those sales would not be completed before January because their sales require a lengthy bidding process involving weeks of advertising followed by fact finding by potential buyers and negotiations with regulators. **********Regulators have warned that the failure to continue the rescue at a sustained pace could ultimately cost taxpayers billions of additional dollars as losses at many institutions still in private hands continue to mount, and as the Government must pay to maintain those institutions already in its possession.  New Interpretation of Law **********The Administration's latest interpretation of the law means that it will now be continuing the bailout without the explicit approval of Congress, a move that could ultimately be challenged in the courts and also subject regulators to criticism for deciding to act without the authority of the lawmakers. The bailout has already been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for being too costly and inefficient. **********Shortly before it adjourned last Sunday for the elections, the Senate by a voice vote passed a measure clarifying the legislation to explicitly permit the borrowing of additional funds, but an identical measure died in the House. **********Administration officials have been saying for days that they might have to resort to using the ambiguous provision to justify the additional borrowing because of the failure of Congress to come up with any new funds. For their part, those lawmakers who opposed new funding have said they were angry at the failure of the Adminstration to appear before Congress to justify the Treasury's request of $40 billion for the next 12 months."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/30/business/japanese-wary-of-toys-r-us.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Wary Of Toys 'R' Us", "print_headline": "Japanese Wary Of Toys 'R' Us", "body_text": " **********Eleven Japanese toy retailers have formed an association to try to protect domestic toy stores from competition by Toys ''R'' Us. **********The Japan Association of **********Specialty Toy Shops will ''provide support'' to local toy stores in areas in Japan where Toys ''R'' Us opens branches, a director of the association said last week. **********Toys ''R'' Us Japan, which is 80 percent owned by Toys ''R'' **********Us Inc. of the United States, said in June that it planned to open about 100 stores in Japan in the next 10 years. **********The Large Retail Store Law, which is intended to protect small retailers, was relaxed in May as part of efforts by Japan and the United States to reduce trade barriers.

He also said the Government was preparing a program to enlarge food production by setting aside more than 10 million acres of land for small-scale farming. **********\"We think we can control the situation,\" the Soviet President told the Parliament, referring to the widespread, long-standing abuse in which state store workers and food distributors pilfer large supplies of food and sell them to the black market or barter them for other goods. **********With the economic crisis and food shortages dominating the public agenda, Mr. Gorbachev found the Parliament ready to enlarge his executive powers and to extend a larger Kremlin role to the restive Soviet republics through a strengthened Federation Council, an advisory board in which the leaders of the nation's 15 republics will have representation.

Ryzhkov, was one of the strong points of initial legislative support for the package when the Soviet leader offered it on Nov. 17 in the face of parliamentary demands for firmer action.

Mr. Gorbachev is revising leadership of the Soviet police and reviving vigilante workers' committees in an attempt to cope with the problem. He is seeking to guarantee, among other things, that newly arriving foreign charity food shipments will not be stolen. **********While some insurgent opposition politicians say worker vigilante groups long have been attempted in the Communist system and long have failed, Mr. Gorbachev promised the new ones \"the right to control plants and warehouses,\" as well as \"premises and transport facilities\" to work with the police. **********The Soviet leader said a wide range of measures to stimulate food production was under consideration, including urban agriculture in the form of new garden plots. The republics, he said, should solve the food question in accordance with local conditions, within the national Government's \"general principle.\" **********The revamped executive system designed by the President is to include a National Security Council to focus on military and security considerations.

Indeed, midway through the synod, a Brazilian cardinal disclosed that the Pope himself had allowed two married Brazilian men to become priests on the condition that they abstained from sexual relations with their wives. **********But without any reference to these exceptions, the Pope insisted in strong language that his position had not changed. The matter of \"viri probati,\" he said, speaking in Latin, \"is too often evoked in the framework of systematic, hostile propaganda against priestly celibacy.\" He did not identify who wasresponsible for such propaganda but added that it \"finds support and complicity from some mass media.\" **********The recommendations that the 238 bishops at the synod sent to John Paul reflected general agreement that priests must be more carefuly selected and educated to overcome the isolation, overwork and low morale that many of them are said to suffer. **********These and other problems have contributed to a shortage of Catholic clergymen in many countries, although the Vatican says the recruitment crisis is behind it. Worldwide in the last 13 years, there has been a 50 percent rise in the number of seminary students.Even so, the 401,930 priests registered by the Holy See in 1988 represented a decline of 31,000 from the early 1970's, and in the United States the number of new seminarians continues to drop. **********The synod, whose formal theme was \"The Formation of Priests in Circumstances of the Present Day,\" serves as an advisory body to the Pope, who eventually will issue a formal response. The assembly was the 11th of its kind held under reforms set into motion by the Second Vatican Council of the 1960's. For the first time, it included representatives from formerly Communist countries in Eastern Europe, where the church had endured decades of repression. **********In effect, the bishops acknowledged that the church had to try new methods to recruit and train young men capable of withstanding the rigors of the modern priesthood. **********They proposed, for example, that a would-be priest go through a year of special theological training even before he entered the seminary. The purpose would be to make up for gaps in basic knowledge because of shortcomings in lower schools and also to \"let the candidate learn what it is all about,\" said Archbishop Jan P. Schotte of the Netherlands, the synod's general secretary. **********Other suggestions included allowing women to teach in seminaries, improving seminary instruction and making sure that priests received continued training even after ordination. Some countries already have procedures that put these principles into effect. **********On the question of celibacy, it was clear almost from the synod's start that there would be no significant change, even though a few bishopsargued that the church had to adapt itself to modern realities. The assembly's response in effect was to leave the rule intact and concentrate instead of culling out those young men who cannot live by it, even by means of psychological testing if necessary. **********\"Chastity in the celibate state of life is a precious gift of God that perfectly suits the image of the priest,\" said Msgr. Henryk Myszynski of Poland, a senior synod official. That was true, he said, \"today more than ever before.\" **********The head of the American bishops' conference, Archbishop Daniel E.

The French in Vietnam had Dalat, and the Dutch in Indonesia cooled themselves in Bogor. There was also Baguio in the Philippines. In the days before air conditioning, vaccines and wonder drugs, the hill stations were considered necessary havens of health and restoration. Fell Into Disuse **********With the nd of colonialism in Asia, the hill stations almost everywhere went into decline. Buildings became dilapidated and wooded hillsides were stripped and eroded. Though still valued for their mountain scenery and refreshing air, most hill stations were no longer the fashionable resorts of the past. **********Murree (pronounced MUH-ree) is proving to be the exception. It is riding a tourist boom that can only get better. A luxury mountain lodge is under construction by Pakistan's Pearl Continental chain in nearby Bhurban, the only new hotel of its class to be built in any subcontinent hill station in more than half a century. **********The large lodge, designed to nestle into a mountainside, will overlook the snowy peaks of Kashmir and the Karakorams. Local tourism officials hope it will further enhance the town as a year-round resort. **********In a tourist information center along the Mall Road, a young man wrapped in woolens was doing a modest business in maps of Murree's labyrinth of hillside hiking trails. **********\"There is no single tourist season anymore like in the old days,\" he said. \"People come here all year, even in the snow. And with the new hotels coming up, we think there will be thousands more.\"  Hotel Makes a Comeback **********Murree's once-grand Cecil Hotel, which had sunk into bleak austerity, is beginning to spruce up -- to judge from an imposing new front door and polished brass in the front parlor. **********The government of Punjab province, in which Murree is situated, has contributed to the boom by building chairlifts and first-class roads into the hills, the latter with guardrails -- tourist attactions in themselves in a part of the world where buses, trucks and cars regularly plunge into ravines or tumble into valleys. **********In colonial days, come about April, the administrations of entire provinces decamped to the hill stations. **********When the most famous one of them all was built at Simla, in the foothills of the Himalayas in what is now the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, the whole entourage of the Viceroy of British India plodded upward, first on elephants and in later years by train or car. The ball gowns, porcelain and silver went along. Judging by diaries of the time, only inhibitions were left on the plains. **********Murree, at an altitude of 7,400 feet, began to develop in 1851 on an expanse of mountain pastureland to serve the administrators of the Punjab, then a unified territory the British annexed in 1849. Murree was Punjab's summer capital until 1876, when offices moved to Simla. Punjab is now two states of the same name, one on each side of the Indian-Pakistani border. Proximity to Duller Places **********Part of Murree's attraction then and now is its proximity to Rawalpindi, a commercial center and military headquarters for first the British and then Pakistan. In the mid-19th century, the trip to Murree from Rawalpindi could be made in less than a day in a horse-drawn carriage. It takes little more than an hour and a half now, with the distant promise of a helicopter service one day that will reduce travel time to minutes. **********Another catalyst in Murree's resurgence was the siting of Islamabad, Pakistan's new capital, about 30 miles to the southeast. Islamabad is having a boom of its own, as rich Pakistanis from the troubled and increasingly violent city of Karachi, and similarly wealthy Afghan refugees, buy houses and open businesses. **********A planned city that took a long time to begin to develop a personality, Islamabad is now pleasantly green with spacious avenues, some fashionable shops and, lately, a new crop of restaurants. But there isn't much entertainment in this Islamic capital. **********That's where a weekend in Murree comes in. The hill lures expensively dressed Pakistanis and diplomats' families, who also visit other nearby resorts known as the Galis. Boutiques and a Brewery **********On the Mall Road, which runs through Murree from Kashmir Point to Pindi Point, young people in Western-style clothes idle away hours in coffee houses and restaurants, or browse in boutiques offering woolens from Kashmir and consumer gadgets from China. **********In its heyday, Murree was known across the subcontinent for its beer and whisky.

Robb, Democrat of Virginia, said the Prime Minister and the Prince would meet. Senator Robb, on a private one-day visit to Cambodia, said he would discuss his findings with Congressional colleagues and Bush Administration officials on his return to Washington. **********At talks in Jakarta last May, Mr. Hun Sen said he thought he had an agreement from the Prince to return as head of state in November, after the scheduled withdrawal of Vietnamese troops at the end of September. But the Prince declined, saying that he was not satisfied with a new, more liberal Cambodian Constitution and that he wanted international monitoring of the withdrawal. **********The posts of President and Commander in Chief are currently held by Heng Samrin, Secretary General of the Cambodian Communist Party. **********Even Cambodian officials said they were not optimistic that the Prince would accept Mr. Hun Sen's offer. But they said the Prince was running out of room to maneuver and now realized that his coalition with the Communist Khmer Rouge had damaged his credibility inside and outside the country. **********Prince's Fifth Resignation **********Before they were ousted by invading Vietnamese forces, the Khmer Rouge presided over a brutal remaking of Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, during which more than a million people died. **********The Prince recently resigned for a fifth time from his post as leader of the opposition coalition, saying he was hurt by Western charges that he was an accomplice of the Khmer Rouge. **********In previous meetings with Mr. Hun Sen, the Prince said he only represented his own faction. Prince Sihanouk's group is part of an awkward coalition with the Khmer Rouge and the followers of a former Prime Minister, Son Sann. The coalition holds Cambodia's seat at the United Nations. **********The Jakarta talks are to include representatives of the Cambodian Government and the three guerrilla groups, as well as officials from Southeast Asian countries, Australia and France. **********Indonesia and France are presiding over an international conference on Cambodia, which has been suspended since the end of August, and the new talks are intended to find enough progress to revive it. Australia will attend as the author of a Cambodian peace proposal that has gained some support and that will be the basis for the Jakarta talks. **********A Wider U.N. Role **********The Australians have suggested dropping the seemingly impossible task of negotiating a four-party coalition government to rule Cambodia before new elections can be held. Instead, they propose an enhanced role for the United Nations, either by supplanting the two rival Cambodian governments or by monitoring their work, with the goal of organizing and supervising a cease-fire, a halt in foreign aid to the combatants and a free election. **********The latest Australian working paper on the peace effort includes three options for an interim arrangement involving the United Nations. Under the first, replacing about 200,000 Cambodian officials with United Nations officials would be required; under the second, senior levels of leadership would be supplanted, requiring about 300 to 500 United Nations officials; under the third, only the top 10 or so officials from each side would be replaced by United Nations officials. **********The second option would preserve the two rival governments but would give United Nations officials authority either above or alongside the current administrations. Mr. Hun Sen has said that to insure fairness he would allow the United Nations to organize and supervise free elections and to monitor his Government's work. But he has rejected any idea of dismantling his administration, saying this would mean chaos and would allow the Khmer Rouge to continue its fight for control of Cambodia. **********Following Namibian Approach **********A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chum Bun Rong, said Mr. Hun Sen had made a significant concession, since in Namibia the United Nations merely supervised an election organized by the South African colonial administration. Although Cambodia is not a colony, he said, the United Nations could organize the election, too. **********In any event, he said, the election in Namibia was fair and the South African-supported party lost. ''Even in Poland,'' he said, ''the Government lost the election it had organized to Solidarity.'' **********Prince Sihanouk, he said, could only gain by breaking with the Khmer Rouge and returning to Cambodia with real power while the Khmer Rouge, knowing it would lose a fair election, would put up any obstacle to block a Cambodian settlement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/24/business/divestiture-by-marriott.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Divestiture By Marriott", "print_headline": "Divestiture By Marriott", "body_text": " **********The Marriott Corporation said that it now controlled more than 50 percent of Basic American Medical Inc. and that it planned to dispose of its holdings in the Indianapolis-based health care concern. **********In a filing with Securities and Exchange Commission, Marriot said that it had acquired the Basic American shares as the result of a default in a loan to a group including three senior executives of Basic American.

Then a mixed choir sang a hymn to ''our heroic martyrs,'' and eight Orthodox priests intoned a prayer. **********This scene was repeated in scores of ceremonies across the country commemorating the time 50 years ago when Romania lost 40 percent of its territory to the Soviet Union, Hungary and Bulgaria in a sequence of dismemberments that took less than 11 weeks. **********The specific occasion marked on Thursday was the anniversary of the so-called Vienna Dictate imposed by Hitler and Mussolini upon Romania, forcing it to cede more than 16,000 square miles of territory to the Hungarian fascist Government of Adm. Miklos Horthy on Aug. 30, 1940. Days of Violence The old people of Ip, a farming community of 30,000, remember it because only two weeks later, Hungarian troops came here and killed 157 townspeople with rifles, bayonets and grenades and by setting their victims afire. The Hungarian border, then as now, is less than 40 miles away. **********The mass grave where the teacher spoke has a tablet with the names of those killed, ranging in age from infants to an 81-year-old woman. One family named Bucovan lost five members - Floare, Vasile, Paulina and two men named Petru, ages 5 to 38. **********Such atrocities were repeated throughout this region, northwestern Transylvania, in the weeks after the Vienna Dictate, leaving 919 Romanians dead and thousands wounded. In the period thereafter, a total of 218,919 people were expelled to the Romanian territory that remained while about 100,000 Romanian Jews were deported to Nazi Germany, where almost all ended in the death camps. **********Hungary had owned this part of Romania, lost it at the end of World War I and thirsted for it ever since. The Hungarian minority here now numbers 2.3 million - 10 percent of the total population - most of it inhabiting Transylvania. Romania's relations with Hungary are bad. **********Prime Minister Arrives **********Prime Minster Petre Roman traveled to Ip on Thursday morning by plane, helicopter, automobile and on foot to lay a wreath at the mass grave bounded by orchards and cornfields rustling in gusts of wind. He was accompanied by Foreign Minister Adrian Nastase and Interior Minister Doru Ursu. **********It was the first time that the annexation of northwestern Transylvania by Hungary and the accompanying atrocities were publicly commemorated here. The Communist Government that ruled after the war until it fell last December forbade such ceremonies in keeping with the Stalinist doctrine of ''proletarian internationalism'' -which meant the denial of ethnic rivalries. **********The party called the Union of Democratic Hungarians, the second largest in the Romanian Parliament, condemned Thursday's ceremonies as ''a diversion to intimidate the Hungarian minority'' that ''threatens an interethnic crisis.'' **********Although showing the Romanian flag here close to the Hungarian frontier, Prime Minister Roman remained low-key in his remarks at the ceremony in Ip and at a second in the Transylvanian village of Traznea, where 86 people were killed by Hungarian troops in September 1940, including members of two Jewish families named Izrael and Weiss. **********No Longer a Taboo Subject **********''We can forgive, but we cannot forget,'' Mr. Roman said, adding, ''never again will we allow Romanian blood to be spilled.'' **********There seemed to be a kind of national sigh of relief over the opportunity after half a century to talk and write openly about events that touched the lives of virtually every Romanian family. **********The sequence of dismemberment began on June 26, 1940, when the Soviet Union annexed traditionally Romanian territories - Bessarabia in the east, which is now an autonomous Soviet republic, and Bukovina in the north, which is now part of the Ukraine. Both were taken with Hitler's blessing, according to the secret protocol of his 1939 pact with Stalin. **********Coercive Arbitration **********This was followed by the Vienna Dictate, the result of a crudely camouflaged ''arbitration'' by Hitler and Mussolini between Hungary and Romania. Hitler favored Admiral Horthy, advising the Bucharest Government that a refusal to cede territory ''would mean Romania's annihilation sooner or later, probably sooner.'' **********Then Hitler compelled Romania to cede a region called southern Dobrogea, a rectangle of territory south of the Danube, to neighboring Bulgaria, on Sept. 5. Both the Bessarabia-Bukovina and southern Dobrogea annexations involved transfers of populations, but no loss of life as in the case of northwestern Transylvania. **********Romanians today, as in the past, consider Transylvania more an integral part of their country than the other territories, which is why the daily Romania Libera called Aug. 30, 1940, ''the blackest day'' in the nation's history."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/business/business-people-ex-gte-colleagues-now-at-fpl-group.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1990-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 377, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Ex-GTE Colleagues Now at FPL Group", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Ex-GTE Colleagues Now at FPL Group", "body_text": " **********James L.

Penney, but the advertising portrays a style-conscious retailer that is sort of a Saks Fifth Avenue for the masses. **********The new $10 million fall television campaign is the biggest ever for Penney. Created by Ayer, it is the first image campaign to emphasize the company's repositioning as a fashion department store. **********It is an abrupt about-face from the giant retailer's previous, workmanlike campaign that stressed the store's sale-priced items with only a nod to Penney's new style. **********The latest campaign, ''Fashion Comes to Life,'' shows fashionably dressed men and women living the kind of good life that is usually pictured in ads for Ralph Lauren or Bloomingdale's. **********One spot is an upscale urban montage: chic young women in funky hats and short skirts are shown clowning around at a hip diner; a painter takes Polaroid pictures of an Irish setter whose portrait she is about to paint; a couple is seen dancing at dawn in an empty restuarant. **********Another shows what appears to be ideal days for some young men. The smiling men - all outfitted in the latest style - are seen working out, playing with their children, goofing off at the office or having a heart-to-heart with dad. **********The five new 30-second television spots will be broadcast on Sept. 9, during network prime time in what is known in the advertising industry as a ''roadblock.'' That is when an advertiser will buy the same time slots on the three networks so its commercials will be seen by all their viewers simultaneously. The idea behind the rarely used technique is to broaden the reach of the advertising and make the introduction of the campaign an event. **********Some retail industry consultants said Penney's strategy was a wise move. During the last decade, the company stopped selling such items as washers, refrigerators, most electronic items and sporting goods. The stores, many of which have been redesigned, now primarily sell clothing and accessories. **********''The company has given itself a new identity,'' said Kurt Barnard, a consultant and the publisher of the Retail Marketing Report. ''Now that it has been transformed, J. C. Penney has to convince fashion-conscious shoppers that it is the savvy place to go.'' **********Because of the sluggish economy and the slump in retail sales, it is difficult to assess just how successful the company's changes have been, some industry consultants said. Retail sales for Penney were up only 5 percent in the first quarter of this year. The figures were disappointing, but Mr. Barnard said that ''if the company had not reinvented itself, the outlook would have been disastrous.'' **********Penney, which will spend about $400 million on advertising this year, has allocated more money to television ads because the company wants to reinforce the growing conception among consumers that the store has drastically changed, said Ronald L. Suhler, the director of marketing communications at Penney. **********''We haven't dropped off the edge in advertising,'' he said. ''We are just using a softer sell.'' **********Penney has also changed its uninspired print ads. For decades, the company has run print campaigns that showed a stiffly posed gaggle of models who sometimes looked like they were in danger of being crushed by the gigantic ''30 percent off'' sale headlines above them. The new ads feature elegant models lounging in beautifully decorated settings and the references to prices, when they are included, are small and discreetly placed. **********To reinforce its with-it image, the company is testing a fashion newsletter called Premiere that chronicles trends in men's and women's clothes. If the test is successful, the newsletter will be sent to the 29 million holders of the chain's credit cards. **********The company has also created a 90-second spot that will be shown to employees at its 1,400 stores during a closed-circuit broadcast by the company's chairman. The broadcast is part of an internal public relations and training campaign to educate employees about Penney's new fashion strategy and to teach them how to deal with more sophisticated customers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/22/business/crude-oil-prices-rise-sharply.html": {"writer_name": "Keith Bradsher", "pub_date": "1990-09-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1002, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Crude Oil Prices Rise Sharply", "print_headline": "Crude Oil Prices Rise Sharply", "body_text": " **********Crude oil prices climbed sharply yesterday, following big jumps for both heating oil and gasoline. **********Traders said a flurry of buying on Thursday afternoon carried over into early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, while concerns remained high about the tense Persian Gulf situation. **********Oil for delivery in November settled at $35.43, the first time that oil has sold for more than $35 a barrel since the start of trading in oil futures on the mercantile exchange in 1983.

For the week, October heating oil was up 14.42 cents a gallon, or 17.4 percent. **********Gasoline for October delivery rose 5.91 cents a gallon, to 97.45 cents, The October contracts for oil products do not expire until next Friday. **********Anger and Investigations **********If heating oil prices stay near $1 a gallon, a homeowner who has spent $1,000 a winter on oil in recent years could end up spending $1,400 to $1,500 this winter, said a New York heating oil executive who insisted that he not be identified. The result would be angry consumers and possible government investigations, he added. But prices would likely fall, he said, if war did not break out in the Middle East. **********The price of heating oil usually overtakes the price of gasoline in the autumn, although the increase is usually spread out over the October and November contracts, said Thomas G. Burns, the manager of the economics staff at the San Francisco-based Chevron Corporation. This week's increase in heating oil prices ''is just a faster-than-normal movement toward that happening,'' he added. **********October gasoline was up 7.09 cents a gallon during the week, or 7.8 percent, while November oil climbed by $4.27 a barrel, or 13.7 percent, to its highest level in nine years. **********Heating oil stocks are fairly high in the United States, and the lack of additional storage capacity has tended to prevent companies and individuals from accumulating large stockpiles to use for speculative purposes. But the availability of extra storage in Europe has sent prices higher there and prompted some eastbound trans-Atlantic shipments of oil, pulling up prices in the United States this week, the New York heating oil executive said. **********'Flows Toward Highest Price' **********Such international movements of oil are common, and some heating oil was shipped from Europe to the United States last winter, when American prices were higher. ''Oil is international, and flows toward the highest price,'' the New York executive added. **********Virginia Wiater, an energy futures broker for United Energy Inc., a New York trading company, said oil and oil product markets remained preoccupied with how high prices might rise if a Mideast war broke out and many oilfields were destroyed. ''People feel at any moment the top may be blown off,'' she added. **********Traders are particularly nervous about repeated hawkish statements by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and one of his ministers, Ms. Wiater said. The Iraqi leaders have threatened to fight a war with the United States lasting for years, and to destroy all Persian Gulf oilfields during such a war. **********Some traders expressed particular alarm about a World Bank estimate this week that oil prices could rise to $65 a barrel if fighting started. **********Disagreement on Contracts **********Some market participants have contended that at least part of the recent run-up in crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange has reflected the type of futures contracts traded there. But experts disagree on the effect. **********The contracts are for light, sweet crude, which consists of 10 grades of oil that are less dense and have a lower sulfur content than other grades, making them easier to refine. **********Iraq and Kuwait exported mostly light, sweet crude before the imposition of a United Nations trade embargo on Aug. 6, four days after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Other countries are producing mostly heavy, sour oil to make up for the shortfall, and some refineries are poorly equipped to handle this lower-quality oil. **********Ms. Wiater said a shortage of light, sweet crude was driving up prices. ''People are now beginning to see that, short term, we're going to have a problem,'' she said. **********Drop in Premium Cited **********But John H. Kingston, the managing editor of Platt's Oilgram Price Report, a daily New York newsletter, said high-grade oil could not be in especially short supply because the premium for the light, Louisiana sweet grade of oil, compared with the slightly heavier and more sour West Texas intermediate grade, had shrunk dramatically in the spot market over the last week. ''That number is absolutely a dead-on barometer'' of light, sweet crude supplies, he said. **********The recent increase in oil prices is based on emotion, not supplies of light, sweet crude, said Peter I. Cardillo, the director of commodities research at Jesup, Josephthal & Company, a New York brokerage. ''As far as fundamentals are concerned, there's no news to account for it,'' he added. ''It's pure speculation based on the Persian Gulf situation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/12/business/finance-new-issues-tva-plans-bond-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "T.V.A.

'We Must Succeed' **********\"We discussed at length our goals for the Uruguay Round and our strong conviction that we must succeed,\" Mr. Bush said, standing in a gray topcoat beside the Rose Garden. **********Mr. Andreotti, who was instrumental in breaking a recent deadlock within the community over farm trade, said there was a \"will to reach a positive conclusion,\" and warned that if an accord was not reached, it would mean \"serious damage in particular to developing countries.\" **********In Geneva today, thousands of angry European farmers, ringing cowbells and riding tractors, protested against reductions in the farm subsidies proposed in the talks. **********Today's Washington meeting was the first of those scheduled for the next 10 days in an effort to generate the political will for fostering an agreement in the 105-nation talks. The talks are aimed at setting new liberal rules not only for agriculture, but also for financial services, investments and intellectual property like patents and copyrights. They will move as well along the more traditional negotiating lines of global tariff-cutting. **********The Administration had been debating whether to walk out as a signal of displeasure with what was seen as a meager European farm trade offer. The proposal has angered not only Washington but other leading exporters of farm goods. Lately, however, European officials have been telling Washington that the offer is negotiable. **********European officials said they understood that Mr. Andreotti and Mr. Delors, both of whom are eager for the talks to succeed, made a similar point in their conversations with President Bush.  Seen by Dutch as Opening Bid **********On Friday, the Dutch trade minister, Yvonne van Rooy, told reporters after meeting with American trade officials that \"it's not a final offer, but clearly an opening bid.\" **********The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said today that she would attend the Dec. 3-7 global trade meeting in Brussels. While attacking the European Community for what she termed its inadequate offer, she stressed at a news conference that \"I want to leave no stone unturned.\" **********\"I do not want to look back and say that if I had made one more flight, or attended one more meeting, or spent one more overnight maybe it could have come off,\" she added. **********Asked what Mr. Bush would tell Mr. Andreotti and Mr. Delors, Mrs. Hills said she expected the President to stress that \"if we are to have a conclusion of the Uruguay Round, which affords the world such a fantastic opportunity for economic gain, for geopolitical harmony and for realizing the economic aspirations of the poorest nations, it won't happen unless the Europeans permit the negotiations to take place in the two areas that they see fit not to permit.\"  New Cuts of 15 Percent **********For the Uruguay Round, the Europeans have offered to cut internal farm income supports by 30 percent over 10 years, using 1986 as a starting date. Since 15 percent has already been cut since 1986, this would mean new reductions of 15 percent. **********The United States and the principal agricultural exporting nations have proposed cuts of 75 percent in farm income over 10 years beginning this year. But a group of exporters of farm goods and the United States are also insisting on action in two other sectors: opening the European farm market and sharp cuts in export subsidies. **********The Europeans are expected to spend $12 billion on such subsidies this year, in effect \"buying market share abroad,\" as Mrs. Hills put it. The United States will spend about $280 million on export subsidies this year. **********Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was concerned about getting approval by Congress if an agreement comes out of the Brussels meeting. **********Mr. Bentsen, whose committee oversees trade matters in the Senate, warned that, hard as it might be to achieve, a Uruguay Round agreement would not be approved unless it \"gives Americans greater access to markets abroad.\"   Backed by 37 Senators **********He said at a news conference that he was particularly worried that a resolution, now backed by 37 senators, could jeopardize passage in Congress of the accord, with its delicate balance of concessions from 105 nations. **********Under \"fast track\" authority, which expires next June 1, the Administration would present the entire package to Congress, and members would either vote for it or against it. This, Senator Bentsen said, was the only way such an agreement could win legislative approval. The resolution by the 37 senators would withhold the fast-track authority from the agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/22/business/the-doughboy-gets-a-streamlined-look.html": {"writer_name": "Eben Shapiro", "pub_date": "1990-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1877, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Doughboy Gets A Streamlined Look", "print_headline": "The Doughboy Gets A Streamlined Look", "body_text": " **********Four years ago, with the roof about to cave in on his head, Jay Morgan still could not get his bosses at the Pillsbury Company to act. Mr. Morgan, who oversees the buildings that house Pillsbury's research and development staff, evacuated a pair of converted livery stables in the complex after an engineer's report confirmed his fears that they were in danger of collapsing. But until recently, he was unable to get authorization to raze the buildings. **********''It was a real source of frustration,'' he said. ''I've been trying to get rid of that building for 15 years. When Grand Met took over, they said, 'Go ahead.' They don't get paralyzed by analysis.'' **********Mr. Morgan is not the only Pillsbury employee whose outlook has brightened since Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. acquired the company for a generous $5.7 billion a little more than a year ago. The British conglomerate's commitment to cut bureaucracy, take risks and spend money to rebuild the food company has revived employee morale and generated enthusiasm among many Wall Street analysts and grocery retailers who stock Pillsbury's products, which include Green Giant vegetables, Poppin' Fresh Doughboy baking products and Totino's pizza. **********Grand Met's strategy is simple. It is returning to those basics abandoned by Pillsbury in the mid-1980's when the company, beset by takeover rumors, turmoil within the top management and earnings problems at its Burger King subsidiary, slashed spending on advertising, research and new product development to prop up earnings. Pillsbury lost market share for its brands. Since Grand Met's Ian Martin was installed as chairman and chief executive, the company has lopped off nearly $1 billion worth of Pillsbury businesses. It turned Haagen-Dazs and Burger King, previously units of Pillsbury, into free-standing operations. Pillsbury and Burger King now represent a large piece of Grand Met, nearly 40 percent of revenues. For the year ended September 30, 1989, Grand Met had sales of over $15 billion and after-tax profits of $836 million. **********To muster more cash for new product development and advertising for its biggest brands, Mr. Martin, who is also chief executive of Grand Met's food sector, cut Pillsbury's overhead. He saved an initial $30 million by hacking away 2,600 employees from Pillsbury's notoriously bloated work force and an additional $163 million in 1989 by streamlining operations and closing plants. In January, the company announced a $140 million plant modernization program that will further consolidate operations. **********As a result, this year Green Giant will be able to introduce 12 new products, while the bakery group will unveil nearly 20 - more than in the last three years combined. Some of them will capitalize on the growing appetite for healthy and nutritious products. **********Advertising spending on most brands will be up 30 percent to 50 percent, while expenditures on Green Giant will double. New television commercials are on the air, including one with the well-known doughboy, whom Pillsbury had let fade in recent years. **********Mr. Martin said the increased brand advertising has already translated into increased sales. While Grand Met does not break out figures for Pillsbury, he said that the company is meeting or exceeding the annual earnings increase of 15 percent targeted by the parent company. **********Still, some in the industry doubt that certain brands can be revived. For instance, Michael G. Spinozzi, a buyer at Jewel Food Stores Inc. in Chicago, says Pillsbury's plans to increase the advertising of its microwave cake mixes may be ''14 or 15 months late at this point.'' **********Though food industry analysts are generally encouraged by Grand Met's moves, some worry about the competition. New products are a key component of Mr. Martin's growth plans, but grocery warehouses in this country are already stuffed to the brim with more new products than consumers want. **********''They are saying the right things,'' said Michael Kennedy, an analyst with IDS Financial Services Inc., a division of the American Express Company here. ''The test will be whether they can execute.'' **********Ronald B. Morrow, an analyst with Smith, Barney Harris Upham & Company, agrees. ''Grand Met management is spending a lot of time, effort and money to get the Pillsbury business turned around,'' he said. ''They have repaired a lot of damage. But we haven't seen the results of it yet.'' **********Grand Met indeed acquired a troubled company. Because of its cash crunch, Pillsbury even lost its dominance in categories that it pioneered, like microwave cake mixes and popcorn. **********For instance, when Pillsbury was introducing its new mixes several years before the takeover, earnings problems at Burger King forced the company to divert money away from the profitable baked goods division. A bungled attempt to integrate the Jeno's pizza acquisition into Pillsbury's existing pizza business put additional pressure on the company's bread-and-butter brands. At the same time, Pillsbury's cross-town rival, General Mills Inc., was rolling out its own line of Betty Crocker microwave mixes. **********''We had limited funds available to defend some of these franchises,'' said Michael J. Paxton, president of bakery products for Pillsbury. **********Betty Crocker soon wrestled away the lead, a position it holds to this day. And the same thing happened in microwave popcorn: stronger competitors emerged and edged out Pillsbury. ''Morale was at an all-time low,'' said Mr. Paxton. **********The company's problems introducing new products were equally frustrating. Before the takeover, Pillsbury had failed twice in its attempts to introduce a new Funfetti frosting, which, with a separate package of decorative candy bits, was designed for birthday and other festive cakes. ''Twice, we pulled back because of insufficient funds or some technical issues,'' recalled Mr. Paxton. **********The frosting was finally released last August, a swift four months after Pillsbury decided to add a companion cake mix. **********Mr. Martin has since restructured the new product development cycle to accelerate the process companywide. He transferred product development experts out of the research and development area directly into the operating units to help speed up the process. ''If you're not careful, the train has passed before you've got your luggage on the platform,'' he said. **********Mr. Martin has forced a significant cultural change at Pillsbury as well. Pillsbury's bureaucracy was legendary, with its more than 3,000 separate forms to keep track of such things as who used which photocopier. **********Grand Met is far more willing than the cautious Pillsbury executives to take risks. Before the takeover, Pillsbury's general sales manager, Tony Scherber, had pushed management to dissolve a longstanding distribution arrangement with Kraft, under which it ''brokered'' Pillsbury's frozen dough products, that is, sold and maintained it on grocery shelves. The two companies were increasingly competing head-to-head in several related areas, and the arrangement was expensive, with Kraft's 7 percent commission crimping Pillsbury's margins. **********''Because of the risk associated with it, the previous management wasn't willing to take that step,'' Mr. Scherber said. ''Grand Met did it.'' **********The change involves increasing the size of Pillsbury's sales force to 800, from 500. ''In the sales organization, this is the biggest thing we have ever done in the history of the company,'' he said. **********The changes have been noticed externally. ''I sense an air of confidence at Pillsbury today,'' said Jeffrey Noddle, senior vice president for marketing with Super Valu Stores Inc., a food wholesaler in Eden Prairie, a suburb of Minneapolis. ''The company is leaner. There is a quicker reaction time.'' Grand Met has ambitious plans for Haagen-Dazs, which Mr. Martin refers to as the 'hidden jewel' of the Pillsbury acquistion. Plans call for the company to more than triple Haagen-Dazs sales, to $1 billion, in five years by undertaking a rapid global expansion. The company is also exploring the risky, but potentially lucrative business of selling fresh vegetables in the United States. And, Pillsbury's troubled pizza unit has aggressive growth plans that center on introducing a variety of pizza snacks and a premium-priced frozen pizza. **********Grand Met's vision has even won over George S. Pillsbury, the 68-year-old grandson of the company's founder who, as a board member, initially opposed Grand Met's bid before supporting a sweetened offer: ''They very definitely have done some things that needed to be done.'' **********POLISHING A 'RESTLESS' COMPANY IMAGE **********There is considerable historical irony in Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.'s attempt to revitalize the Pillsbury Company's wayward fortunes. **********In 1889, the owners of the C. A. Pillsbury & Company sold the Minneapolis flour milling company to a group of English investors. Lax management damaged Pillsbury's reputation, and the company floundered. In 1923, the Pillsbury family repurchased it and began the process of building a modern corporate food giant. **********When the company was again beset by problems in the 1980's, it was the British to the rescue. So far it appears that the current British owners of Pillsbury will have a good deal more success than their predecessors. **********In recent years, Grand Met, which began in the hotel business, has been concentrating on companies with products that it believes have worldwide appeal. Its holdings include Pearle Vision Centers and International Distillers and Vintners, the largest seller of wine and liquor in the world, whose brands include J & B scotch and Smirnoff vodka. Grand Met is now out of the hotel business. **********The company is spending a great deal of energy trying to improve the standing of one brand name in particular - its own. Grand Met's fast-paced management style, which its literature describes as ''restless,'' has made some investors nervous. **********They are worried about Grand Met's propensity ''to turn from buyers to sellers overnight,'' in the words of Martin Hawkins, an analyst with Kitcat & Aitken in London. The discomfort has hurt Grand Met's share price, which is currently trading at the equivalent of $9.54 on the London Stock Exchange. **********Grand Met has made several major acquisitions in the 80's, only to sell them quickly. It sold the Inter-Continental Hotels, after seven years, in 1988, and the William Hill betting shops, which they held for only a year, last year. The sales brought handsome profits, but the strategic reversals raised questions. **********Michelle Proud, an analyst with County Nat West Securities Ltd. in London, said the company's reputation is undeserved. ''It's hard to find a deal that Grand Met has done that's been bad for shareholders,'' she said. **********To try to find a more receptive audience, Grand Met is planning to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange next fall in the form of A.D.R.'s. Kitcat's Mr. Hawkins described Grand Met's shares as ''staggeringly cheap'' in comparison with American companies, based on earnings per share and other financial measures."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/15/business/loss-posted-in-2d-quarter-at-columbia.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 404, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Loss Posted In 2d Quarter At Columbia", "print_headline": "Loss Posted In 2d Quarter At Columbia", "body_text": " **********The Columbia Savings and Loan Association, whose financial troubles have been related primarily to the plummeting value of its ''junk bond'' portfolio, reported a loss in the second quarter because of other factors, including problem real estate, the institution said today. **********Columbia said it lost $136.5 million in the quarter ended June 30, in contrast to earnings of $6.4 million, or 16 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. **********Columbia's deteriorating condition suggests that returning to health and escaping a seizure by the Government will be more difficult than the company had anticipated. **********Three months ago, Columbia reported a first-quarter loss of $293.3 million, but that was caused primarily by a $273.6 million drop in the market value of the institution's high-risk, high-yield bond portfolio.

The final notes echo through the twilight, rolling across the vineyards of the Nahe River valley toward the medieval town center. **********This ceremony may soon end. Since the Bush Administration proposed major troop reductions and base closings in January, it has been widely expected that the 8th Infantry Division would be one of the major units to be withdrawn from West Germany. Just the possibility of its departure is sending economic shock waves through this area's 40,000 people. **********Such tremors are being felt in many West German communities, but particularly in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, known among some in the military as ''NATO's largest aircraft carrier'' because of the high concentration of American air bases there. #1 Out of 10 Could Close Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is already planning to close Zweibrucken Air Base, in the southwest corner of the state about 100 miles from Bad Kreuznach. Of the 800 American military installations great and small in West Germany, the commander of American forces in Europe, Gen. John R. Galvin, estimates that about 80 will be closed in the first round of reductions. **********Many here complain of the annoyances and hazards of having thousands of foreign troops living and training on West German soil. But United States military spending pumps about $8 billion annually into this country's economy. Scores of companies depend on the military for business, thousands of civilians rely on it for employment, and countless German families have boosted their incomes by renting housing to soldiers and their dependents. **********For those people, troop reductions will mean lower incomes, a loss of jobs and wrenching economic adjustment at a time when West Germany's Government and business sector are concentrating their resources on reunification and the enormous task of rebuilding East Germany's decrepit economy. **********The Bush Administration proposed the cutbacks in response to the political changes that have swept Eastern Europe in recent months. But those developments are small comfort to people like Katherina Gruneberg, 70 years old, who works at a snack stand just up the road from Rose Barracks and spent 21 years as an employee at the base commissary. **********'I Want Them to Stay' **********''I want them to stay, not to go,'' Mrs. Gruneberg said. ''They are still a great protection for us. The American soldiers are very nice young rascals. And they account for most of the business at this stand. **********''For Bad Kreuznach, it will be very bad economically, very damaging if they go,'' she continued. ''There is no big industry here, and I can't think of what they will do with the U.S. installations. They are so big only a large company could use them.'' **********The United States forces employ 33,000 civilians, the vast majority of them Germans. About 1,000 of them work for the 8th Infantry in Bad Kreuznach and at Dexheim, an outlying base. The gross payroll for these 1,000 civilians amounts to about $25 million a year, said Maj. Michael Maher, the 8th Division's spokesman. **********Money flows from the military in other ways. The 8th Infantry spends about $2.2 million a month in Bad Kreuznach on a variety of goods and services. In 1989, it awarded construction contracts totaling $6.35 million and spent about $225,000 more on transport contracts with local bus and trucking concerns. It paid $155,000 to local hospitals for services to military staff members and their dependents. **********The 8th Infantry is a mechanized division with about 21,000 officers and enlisted men. About 8,000 are stationed at the Rose Barracks headquarters, and the rest are spread over an area about the size of Rhode Island, with installations in Mainz, Wildflecken, Baumholder, Dexheim, Mannheim and Wiesbaden. **********No Decision Yet **********Major Maher said no decision had been made to move the 8th Division out, and that no such move was expected until a new agreement on limiting conventional forces in Europe is completed, perhaps late this year. **********Until then, it is business as usual. ''We're busy training,'' Major Maher said. **********When the troops are not training, they can part with their pay at the auto dealerships, insurance agents and fast-food restaurants that surround all big American bases in West Germany. Without the troops, these businesses would probably close. **********''All of our business is with the military. If they go, that would be it,'' said Veva Hepler, an insurance sales representative for American International Underwriters, which has an office next to a car dealership just up the hill from Rose Barracks' main gate. ''I guess it was bound to happen anyway.'' **********If the mood is one of resignation in Bad Kreuznach, it is more like disbelief in Zweibrucken, where the 17th Air Force is based. The Air Force is the town's largest employer, providing jobs for 20 percent of the 35,000 residents. **********Groping for New Job Skills **********''My skills and knowledge are all oriented to the military,'' said a civilian clerk in the unit's administration building. ''German businesses have different requirements. They want something else, and that will make it hard for me to get another job.'' **********Zweibrucken city officials said that the town's unemployment rate already stands at 14 percent, well above the national average of about 8 percent. If the Zweibrucken Air Base closes, as proposed, and the 8th Infantry leaves, the state government of Rhineland-Palatinate will face serious economic problems. **********The state government is considering industrial development projects that could at least ease the pain of a military departure. A ministerial working group is examining the potential problems. **********''We think we will have some problems finding jobs for the military workers,'' said Jurgen Dietzen, a spokeman for the state Interior Ministry. ''We want to know what these workers can do, and if there are similar civil jobs they can do.'' **********One proposal is to convert one of the six American air bases in Rhineland-Palatinate into a civilian airport to ease the severe air-traffic congestion at Frankfurt International Airport. But many West Germans working at the Zweibrucken base are skeptical that the lost jobs will be replaced. In their minds, troop cuts mean unemployment. **********''It's good for them because they save money,'' a mechanic working in the Zweibrucken motor pool said of the Americans. ''It's bad for me because I'll lose my job.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/27/business/more-setbacks-for-bolar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 251, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Setbacks for Bolar", "print_headline": "More Setbacks for Bolar", "body_text": " **********Under pressure because of a generic-drug scandal, the Bolar Pharmaceutical Company said on Wednesday that it would discontinue making 14 drugs and recall 4 other drugs. **********Bolar, once a leading manufacturer of low-priced generic drugs, has virtually halted manufacturing since Federal regulators charged that the company had acted fraudulently in gaining Federal approval for some of its most profitable products. **********The company's two top executives resigned in February, one day before securities regulators sued Bolar.

''Sales are continuing steady, but they are off what they were in the first five months,'' said Hank Schmelzer, an executive at The New England, which sells funds through brokers and insurance agents. ''July was a little slower than June, and June was down substantially from May.'' **********In June, the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reported yesterday, the total cash flow into stock funds came to $1.7 billion, down from $4.4 billion in May. Those figures include sales and redemptions, as well as transfers between different funds in the same group, but they do not include reinvested dividends. **********While some fund managers said it was too soon to assess the effects of last Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 100 points in early trading, only to stabilize and close 56.44 points down, others said the effect was small. ''It appears that investors did not take much notice,'' said Steven Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates, which sells fund shares directly to the public. For all of last week, he said, more cash was put into equity funds than was taken out. **********At Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the effect of the fall was noted, but not for long. ''We had a very big redemption day, three or four times normal,'' said Robert Leo, the firm's director of mutual funds. ''But after that, sales returned to normal. It was a one-day aberration, and then we got back into a positive cash flow.'' **********At Fidelity Investments, Michael Hines, a vice president, said there was some cash outflow after the fall, but that by the end of the week there were also signs of ''bargain hunting,'' as investors hoped to buy stock funds before they went back up. **********Fund investors were severely shaken by the 1987 stock market crash, as cash poured out of the funds for more than a year afterward, even as the stock market recovered. But last October's mini-crash was quickly followed by buying from investors convinced that such falls created buying opportunities, and such buying may be happening now. **********Among stock funds, international funds have been the strongest in the last month, some managers said, in part reflecting the fact that many foreign markets did better than the American one in July. Mr. Norwitz of T. Rowe Price said that 57 percent of that company's equity fund sales came from its international funds in July, up from 40 percent for the entire first half of the year. **********In June, the Investment Company Institute said, international stock funds had a net cash inflow of $675 million, up from $622 million in May. **********Global funds, which invest in all markets, American as well as foreign, brought in an additional $79 million in June, down from $114 million in May. Mr. Hines said a new Fidelity global fund, the Worldwide Fund, has been ''phenomenally popular'' since it was introduced at the end of May. **********Several managers said sales of municipal bond funds had picked up in the last month, as talk of a tax increase rose in Washington. But in June, net cash flows into muni funds slowed to $992 million, from $1.8 billion in May. **********United States Treasury bond funds were reported by a couple of managers to be seeing a pickup in interest, too, perhaps reflecting the fact that long-term rates are now substantially higher than short-term ones. ''There is no question we have seen a pickup in our Government securities fund,'' said Ron Lynch, a managing partner at Lord Abbett & Company. **********If so, that pickup would represent a substantial turnaround. In June, the net cash flow out of Government funds was $719 million, a bit more than in May. Not since February 1988 has there been a net inflow into those funds. **********''Junk bond'' mutual funds, which had been dumped for much of the year, seem to have returned to investor favor as prices of many junk bonds have started to recover. Several fund managers said junk bond funds were now bringing in the most cash so far this year. The June figures showed a net cash inflow of $171 million, up from $57 million in May. During the previous 10 months, $6.3 billion was taken out of such funds. **********The professionals who manage stock funds had grown very cautious earlier this year, and they built up cash reserves by not investing the money that was being poured in by investors. At the end of April, managers had 12.5 percent of stock fund assets in short-term money- market instruments, called ''cash'' in the industry. That fell to 11.3 percent by the end of May, and to 10.9 percent at the end of June. **********The managers of aggressive-growth funds, which generally invest in smaller stocks, were among the most aggressive at investing money over that period, with the cash level falling from 13.5 percent at the end of April, to 10.6 percent at the end of June. **********The opposite trend was seen in precious-metals funds, where fund managers seem to have grown discouraged by the decline in gold prices earlier this year. Although there was a net cash inflow of $38 million into such funds, the managers chose to invest none of it and to raise cash by selling shares. As a result, the cash percentages in such funds rose to 10.3 percent in June, from 7.3 percent a month earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/14/business/company-news-intergroup-move-by-centaur-fails.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Intergroup Move By Centaur Fails", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Intergroup Move By Centaur Fails", "body_text": " **********The Delaware Supreme Court ruled that the effort by Centaur Partners L.P. to expand the board of National Intergroup Inc. had failed.

Baghdad, they warned, bears responsibility for insuring peace in the Persian Gulf. **********Looking at its own affairs, the community opened negotiations among its members on redesigning its basic structures, an arduous task that is likely to take months and whose probable results are still unclear. 'A Rendezvous With History' **********\"We really have today a rendezvous with history,\" said Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, the community's executive body. **********The broad goal is to propel the bloc toward eventual political and monetary union, moving well beyond the unified economic market already scheduled for the end of 1992. But this new step may prove far more complex. The various countries have a wide range of opinions on how much sovereignty they are prepared to yield to centralized bodies in the name of a common voice on political, social, diplomatic and possibly defense matters. **********Nonetheless, all 12 agreed at a summit meeting here to get the process under way. Joining the movement was Britain's new Prime Minister, John Major, who made it plain that his country was still leery of a united Europe. But Mr. Major avoided the pugnacious style that ultimately caused his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, to be isolated by the others.  [ Page 24. ] Advancing Monetary Union **********Mrs. Thatcher was abandoned by the other 11 in late October when they ignored her vociferous objections and pressed ahead with a 1994 deadline for creating a central bank that would lead eventually to a single European currency. **********How to advance this so-called economic and monetary union is the focus of one inter-governmental conference that got under way in Rome today and will probably continue well into next year. A parallel conference on \"political union\" also began, but it is expected to follow a thornier path, for it must consider how far to go toward centralizing policies on a kaleidoscope of sensitive issues from the environment to military control. **********In effect, Mr. Major decided that, while he shares many of Mrs. Thatcher's doubts about moving too fast toward a federal Europe, he would wage his battle from within instead of filling his predecessor's self-designated role as perennial outsider. Easing the New Leader In **********To help ease the new British Prime Minister into the fold, the other 11 avoided setting rigid guidelines for the conference on political union, which is charged with rewriting segments of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community in 1957. **********Instead, the community leaders broadly listed topics for their negotiators to consider. That represents a soft approach that also satisfied countries other than Britain, since London is hardly alone in its reservations about giving up sovereignty to a central organization. **********France and Germany, for example, proposed last week that the community develop a regional foreign and security policy, but they have been cool to an Italian proposal that a basic building block be a largely dormant defense group called the Western European Union. **********Some members are convinced that joint security policies would lead inevitably to common military positions, a point that is particularly troublesome to neutral Ireland. In a joint statement, the 12 leaders said that a future defense role for the community ought to be considered, but as a conciliatory gesture to the Irish they added that the traditional positions of member states should not be undermined. Strengthen European Parliament **********The political conference was instructed to study the possibility of strengthening the basically powerless European Parliament, creating a European citizenship and dropping the present unanimity rule to allow a majority vote for decisions. Those favoring the rule change argue that no single country should be allowed to block important policies, especially if the community expands its membership. But Britain, for one, wants to keep the old rule and the protection it provides against being pushed into unwanted actions. **********Mr. Major pronounced himself satisifed with the final summit statement, saying that \"we have a menu\" for the conferences that began today and that \"our favorite dishes are on that menu.\" **********Warming to the metaphor, Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy, whose country holds the community's rotating presidency, observed that in looking at a menu \"you are in a state of grace.\" **********\"The important thing,\" he said, \"is that all 12 guests have sat down at the table.\" Central Government's Role **********Under the loose mandate from the summit meeting, conference negotiators were asked to look into possibility that individual nations could turn over to the community powers to set social, scientific and environmental policies. Immigrations, visas and the battle against organized crime and drugs were mentioned as specific areas that a central government might absorb. **********On South Africa, the summit leaders lifted a 1986 community ban on new investments there as an acknowledgment of recent reforms and as an inducement for Pretoria to dismantle the rest of its apartheid apparatus. In a joint statement, the leaders said that other sanctions would be eased if South Africa drops laws that prohibit blacks from buying land and living in certain areas. **********These would apply only to measures adopted in 1986, including bans on imports of South African iron, steel and gold coins. Mandatory United Nations sanctions that the community accepted in 1985 would remain in force in any event. These include prohibitions on arms deals with Preotria and restrictions on scientific and cultural agreements. **********The African National Congress, South Africa's main anti-apartheid group, was reported today to have urged the European Community and the United States to keep their sanctions intact. But the Italian Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, argued that \"it would be a mistake to lift the sanctions only at the end of the process, and it would also be a mistake to lift the sanctions only when the A.N.C. would have said, 'please.' \" Soviet Food Crisis **********Turning to the Soviet Union's food crisis, the 12 community countries ratified their decision on Friday to give Moscow $1 billion in immediate emergency aid and to authorize perhaps $1.4 billion more in technical assistance in 1991 and 1992. The exact figures for the technical aid were left vague because the summit leaders said they wanted to see what the true needs were before committing themselves for 1992. **********In addition, they endorsed a Dutch proposal to try next ear to create a European energy network that would include the Soviet Union. This would amount to a mutual-benefit society, with Moscow receiving dollars and other hard currencies for its oil and natural-gas exports, and Western Europe getting a stable energy supply. **********Leaders of the 12 nations, which also include Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, Portugal and Spain, made a brief reference to the breakdown last week of a four-year-old round of talks to create a new world trade order under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They expressed their regret, and expressed hope that negotiators would return to the table in January. **********But individually, some of them lashed out the United States for blaming the community for the collapse of the talks because of its inability to devise a common policy on government subsidies to farmers. Mr. Delors was especially angry and said that the fault lay with the Americans for having asked \"too much too soon.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/10/world/reporter-s-notebook-upheaval-east-harvest-grief-georgia-culls-its-pride.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1990-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Upheaval in the East;   From a Harvest of Grief, Georgia Culls Its Pride", "print_headline": "Reporter's Notebook; Upheaval in the East;   From a Harvest of Grief, Georgia Culls Its Pride", "body_text": " **********The Georgian way of grief has always included wine and tears. **********Today, this ancient flow glistened with the modern images of videotapes. The tapes, the wine, the tears shaped a powerful new ceremony across the republic in behalf of 19 Georgian lives that are no more and a Georgian state that is not yet. **********This afternoon, all of Georgia could see on television at home a broadcast of the horrific images taped a year ago, when people in a crowd of gaily dancing and singing protesters supporting independence were suddenly beaten to the ground by Soviet troops attempting to enforce the central authority of Moscow. **********The event is undeniable on the tapes. Those outside Georgia have not grasped the critical nature of that moment, the mass emotional bonding that took place in Georgia's spirit, so long rebellious toward Moscow. **********''There was the last dance,'' said Maya Doksopulo, tremulously watching the screen in a friend's apartment as thousands of demonstrators of a year ago repeated their peaceful protest for independence. **********''They never realized what was coming,'' she said, as the tape cut away to a camera further down the road to show Soviet tanks slowly advancing four abreast, followed by phalanxes of troops brandishing their shovels like scimitars. **********A toast to the lives then lost was offered in the apartment by the hostess, Iamze Machavariani. Georgians once more drank to their dream of independence. **********''Near the end they sang a wonderful song,'' Mrs. Doksopulo said, watching the protesters amid their candlelight and music on television. She recited the lyrics: ''First there was a song and a human being was created for song, and then there was smile, and a human being was created for the smile.'' **********The Soviet troops continued marching across the television screens, finally using their shovels as the songs turned to screams. Georgians wept together in Miss Machavariani's apartment and across the republic. **********Manna vs. Mush **********Out in the street and beyond in the countryside, sunshine poured onto the weathered old porched houses tucked handsomely in vineyard hillsides and riverfront palisades. **********Pedestrians hugged wheels of fresh flat bread like wafers of the sun itself as they headed home through narrow streets from neighborhood bakeries. In the sunshine, a sense of nature's abundance seemed to vie with the memories of the deaths. **********At a cut-rate hotel on the outskirts of the city, busloads of Russian tourists arose, then lined up for the cafeteria fare of communism, a gray mingling of boiled sausage and mashed potatoes. **********Georgians out beyond the treelines that concealed the Russians' hotel brewed hot coffee and broke their fast with the loaves of crusty bread. **********Children Know the Words **********Up in the mountain village of Tskhenet, overlooking Tbilisi, more than a dozen 6- and 7-year-old children scrambled down the stairs of their orphanage to show off by the piano. As a teacher played, they did Georgian dances in miniature and offered a throaty chorus of the lyrics of Ilya Chavchavadze, the beloved Georgian poet: ''A new generation of Georgians will make something fresh of life.'' **********They are abandoned children, some of the 1,500 cared for by the Children's Fund of Georgia, a charity that is very uncharacteristic for the Soviet Union in the enterprise it has shown in raising money from overseas donors and generous Georgians. **********More than the endless polemics of the weekend of mass mourning, the Children's Fund hints at the de facto independence slowly moving across the republic. Officials boldly decided to cut the central Government out of its traditional 40 percent share of all charity contributions raised locally. This has allowed the children here greater benefits. **********This is a riskier step, in a way, than the Georgians' new iconoclasm, the tearing down of Lenin statues. A dozen or more of the major ones have been unceremoniously torn from their pedestals across the republic in the year since the troops killed the demonstrators. **********At some monuments, Lenin is now protected by the police. One Lenin is caged like a go-go dancer, his right hand extended behind a screen, his visionary stare clearly fading. His likeness has been boxed off from an angry public that had taken to peppering him with ink pots. **********Laughter's Longevity **********A man drank his red Georgian wine and, surfeited with cheese and bread and spicy beans and big red tomatoes, burst into song. **********''Lenin is always alive,'' he sang, extending the song's rhythm to make room for his mocking laughter. ''He is always with us,'' he sang, recalling the schoolboy song. **********The man ended fully in laughter, as if all the decades of communism in Georgia, with its documented deaths and still daily resentments, were winding down on a note of absurdity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/business/no-happy-season-for-retailers.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1990-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 845, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Happy Season for Retailers", "print_headline": "No Happy Season for Retailers", "body_text": " **********The Christmas shopping season, which concluded last night with a soft thud, held a number of surprises, but none were very jolly. **********In telephone interviews yesterday, merchants around the country generally expressed disappointment with the 32-day season, which began the day after Thanksgiving. Most said their business was flat, or about equal to their 1989 sales. Some said they had a small decline, and others reported a slight gain. **********But when merchandise inflation of 2 to 4 percent is excluded from their results, almost everyone interviewed had a real decline from the figures a year earlier. \"The poorest Christmas season in years\" was a common expression. **********Perhaps the biggest surprise, merchants said, was that retailers' predictions of a dismal season were not pessimistic enough. Many forecasts called for a 5 percent gain, but it is now expected that when all the numbers are in the industry will probably register a decline.   No 'Cliffhanger' **********Another surprise was that the much-hoped-for \"cliffhanger\" never developed. Increasingly, in the last few years, heavy consumer buying has come later and later in the holiday season. Many merchants this year hoped that a late surge would reverse the season's earlier sluggishness. Although stores were busy over the final weekend and yesterday, the sales were lower than expected. **********And a third surprise was that in some stores higher-priced goods outsold medium-priced items. \"The customer has been clearly value-oriented,\" said Arthur Martinez, vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, \"but the irony is that the bigger-ticket, mostly designer goods sold well, while the real lag was in the more moderate-priced merchandise.\"   Dominated by Price-Cutting **********Both direct and indirect consumer concerns hampered sales. \"Consumers are so bombarded with bad news, the economy, the deficit, the Mideast and so on that it's no wonder they bought less than last year,\" said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis. Price-cutting dominated the season's merchandising. Some of it was done by retailers trying to stimulate a season already in trouble. **********But also, in the big cities and their suburbs, hundreds of stores, run by more than a half-dozen highly leveraged or financially troubled retail chains, slashed prices to raise cash. This brought in many customers, but also caused others to wait for still lower prices elsewhere. **********\"We'll show a gain over last year, but it's been a difficult season because we had to compete with the 'broke' competition,\" said William Dillard Sr., chairman of the Dillard Department Stores of Little Rock, Ark. **********Holiday business was also hampered by unseasonally warm weather in the East and South. This created a huge inventory buildup in cold-weather apparel. Such clothes are both a seasonal item and a holiday gift. This prompted Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's biggest retailer, to advance its usual post-Christmas sale to two weeks or so before Christmas. **********The 30-degree swing in the weather from a cold 1989 to a warm 1990 was also cited as a particular problem by Bloomingdale's in New York and Rich's in Atlanta.  K Mart Stocks 'Under Control' **********\"We'll be flat to 1 percent ahead, despite the extra shopping day this season, unfortunately,\" said Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive of the K Mart Corporation, the nation's second-largest retailer after Sears. \"I wish it were better,\" he added, \"but we kept our stocks under control, so that we are $600 million less in inventory in our K Mart division.\" **********Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson said: \"The season was less than great. We think our same-stores will be flat. But our Target discount stores will be up 1 to 2 percent, our Mervyn's promotional apparel stores will be flat, and our Dayton Hudson department stores will be down by 1 to 2 percent. But all our inventories are surprisingly good.\" **********Bloomingdale's 15 stores will wind up with \"a very small decrease over all -- and a couple of percentage points down in our same stores,\" said Julian Taub, senior vice president for planning. But costume jewelry, Christmas decorations and men's furnishings had a strong season. Still, Mr. Taub said, speaking with a light touch, \"December was our second-best month of the winter; October was a better month with less of a drop.\"   Saks Margins Held Up **********Saks Fifth Avenue will be flat for the month, said Mr. Martinez, its vice chairman. But he added: \"We operated with below-normal expenses so our margins held up. We should have a fine profit.\" He said that the markets in Boston and New York were the chain's hardest hit. Markets in Florida and Texas were strong while California's was satisfactory, he added. **********Roger Farah, chairman of Rich's, said he expected the department store chain to register a slight decline in December because of warm weather and the regional economic slump. But Wilbur A. Fix, chairman of Bon Marche in Seattle, said that despite \"a kick in the pants from a 12-inch snowfall last week,\" in a city that is unaccustomed to snow, \"our business picked up, so we expect a 5 percent increase in our same stores this month.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/13/world/france-offers-troops-to-stop-fighting-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1990-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France Offers Troops to Stop Fighting in Lebanon", "print_headline": "France Offers Troops to Stop Fighting in Lebanon", "body_text": " **********France has offered to send troops to Lebanon's Christian enclave in an attempt to avert intervention by the Syrian army and stop fighting that has killed 450 people, Arab diplomats said today. **********The diplomats said the French Government had sent signals to Christian leaders about its readiness to dispatch military units to work as a peacekeeping force and disengage the fighting Christian factions, led by Gen.

President Hrawi, like General Aoun and Mr. Geagea, is a Maronite Catholic. **********Speculation has been rife in the news media here that President Hrawi is seriously considering an offer from Syria to have its units cross into the Christian enclave in a bid to check the factional fighting. **********The Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad told Mr. Hrawi when they met in Damascus last month that he was placing the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon at his disposal. **********Syria's daily Al Baath, in an editorial today that was quoted by Damascus radio and monitored here, reminded President Hrawi of President Assad's offer and urged him to act ''against renegade General Aoun, who is destroying his own Christian people.''

Lenin understood this to be a complete monopoly by his party, not only of all political processes, but of all organized life in the country, the economy included. All other parties were to be barred from this process on the alleged grounds that they were either counterrevolutionary or did not express the true interests of the working class. Gorbachev seems to call for an abandonment of this policy. He is essentially jettisoning the Communist Party as the ruling organ in the country, casting it adrift and asking it to draw its strength from popular support, such as it can obtain. It is to compete with other parties for a role in the Soviet state. **********My impression is that the Communist Party would receive no more than 5 percent or 10 percent of the popular vote, which would mean that it would become a relatively small minority party in the political spectrum. I believe that in free elections, if such are to take place, the majority of the Russian voters would cast ballots for one of three new parties. One of these I would tentatively call a Social Democratic party, which might absorb a considerable portion of the present Communist Party membership. This party would combine appeals for democracy with a program of socialism, such as we know from England under Labor, or Sweden. The other party would presumably be what I would tentatively call Christian Democratic, which would probably combine democracy with appeals to free enterprise and a strong pro-Western platform. The third major party would be a Russian nationalist party, which would stand on a platform of Russia for Russians and assume a strong anti-Western stance. This sort of party would probably demand very powerful centralized authority of the state. And then in additon there would be nationalist parties in most of the border lands, which would either espouse separatism or demand extensive regional autonomy. And finally my impression is, from what Gorbachev said, that he plans to shift the base of his power from the party to the state and, I believe, to run for President. A model for this could be the recent events in Hungary and Poland, which I think he orchestrated. Then the question remains whether he would really win office in a democratic election, because he is not popular in the country and he gains support from the street primarily when he is assailing the entrenched Communists. Whether he would obtain the same kind of support to carry out a broader program on his own, I am not certain, because there are people who are more popular than he, in whom the citizenry has greater confidence. So, to conclude, this is a historic event, but given the country's lack of experience with democracy, and the existing internal tensions, the future is murky and unpredictable. **********Stephen F. Cohen **********Director of Russian studies **********Princeton University **********The abolition of Article 6 is a step forward, but it's not a decisive development. **********First, Article 6 only appeared in the Constitution in 1977, decades after Communist Party dictatorship was well established. **********The second reason is that there has been de facto multiparty politics in the Soviet Union for the last three years anyway - politics, though not a multiparty system. **********Third, even in a multiparty system the Communist Party is going to retain enormous advantages, much in the way for example that party machines dominated what were in effect various one-party cities and states in America for many years. **********Fourth, the focus of a Soviet multiparty system would be the thousands of local soviets - or councils, or local assemblies - all across the country. Though Gorbachev has promised to shift ''all power to the soviets,'' those soviets remain powerless, in the fullest sense of the word, without their own authority and even revenue. **********And fifth, more generally, dictatorships can be born in one night but durable multiparty democracies take a generation, if not more. **********Ellen Mickiewicz **********Professor of political science **********Emory University **********The Party Congress this spring will ratify the decision of the Central Committee plenum introducing a multiparty system. It has no choice; a number of parties have already come into existence. Besides, the Communist Party is facing rising defections in its ranks: large numbers of Communists, young and old, are turning in their party cards. Exposes of malfeasance, corruption, and incompetence are leading to ousters of party chieftains, as in Volgograd, where the main square was filled with people arguing, ''Down with everybody and everything.'' **********The Soviet party has to try to earn the leadership it can no longer take for granted. There isn't even a single Communist Party any more: the impetus for drastic political change has been generated for the most part by elements within the party itself. And the parties of the republics will be increasingly diverse. **********Can the Communist Party retain its leadership in a system with genuine competition? It has the edge in resources, media control, and organization, but that won't be enough, in my view. The move to a genuine parliamentary system is under way. **********Roman Szporluk **********Director of Russian studies center **********University of Michigan **********I believe that the renunciation of the party's monopoly of power literally means the end of Communism as a distinct current on the left. Lenin's most original contribution to Marxism was his concept of the party. Lenin made the right of the party to rule independent of an actual popular mandate. In Lenin's point of view, a majority vote was not enough to have the right to rule. What really mattered was to be right, and one was right by knowing what was good for the worker and what was good for the peasant without getting their formal approval through competitive elections. So the real, momentous significance of the declaration that the party requires the people's approval through elections in order to remain in power is that it is a repudiation of Leninism. It means that the party does not have a right to rule automatically, as the party. Such a declaration, coming from Moscow, is comprable in its importance for the Communists to a declaration, coming from the Pope in Rome, that there is no God. From now on, Soviet politics will increasingly become an ethnic politics, and people like Gorbachev and others will increasingly present themselves as Russian leaders. **********Zbigniew Brzezinski **********Former National security adviser, **********under President Carter **********Just as Khrushchev's secret speech before the 20th party congress in 1956 marked the beginning of the end of Stalinism, Gorbachev's reform at the just-concluded plenum marks the beginning of the formal break with Leninism. Gorbachev in effect is embracing the prescriptions of Lenin's old ideological rival, Martov, and his Mensheviks. It took years for the struggle against Stalinism to be successfully concluded. It will take years to dismantle the remnants of Leninism, but the battle has now been joined. **********However, it would be a mistake to see the recent decisions as marking a breakthrough to democracy. Much more likely is a prolonged period of democratizing chaos. One will see the rise in the Soviet Union of increasingly irreconcilable conflicts between varying national political and social aspirations, all united by a shared hatred for the existing Communist nomenklatura. One is also likely to see a flashback of a nationalist type among the Great Russians, fearful of the prospective breakup of the existing Great Russian empire. **********The recent developments are the consequence of the progressive polarization of the situation in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev has come to realize that zigzagging increasingly meant a stalemate, and he thus had a choice of either moving dramatically towards democracy or towards repression. He chose the former, because he knew that repression would mean political violence and social stagnation. But the depth of the existing economic crisis in the Soviet Union and the intensity of rising national apirations is such that the plunge towards democracy is likely to produce not an operating democracy, but a prolonged internal crisis, marked by turbulence, some chaos and fragmentation. Gorbachev nonetheless should be admired for his historical boldness. **********Adam Ulam **********Professor of history and political science **********Harvard University **********I think that the present change in a sense is more symbolical rather than realistic. We don't have currently parties in our sense of the word in the Soviet Union, but what we do have is that the Communist Party itself is split into many factions, and in a sense that poses a greater danger to the survival of the Soviet system than the appearance of other parties, I think. The threat of secession by various national republics from the Soviet Union is a much greater threat than the threat posed by the still theoretical possibility of another party. It's much smaller than the threat being actually posed by the threat of secession by the Baltic republics or other republics of the Soviet Union. Of course, on the face of it, it's a welcome change, but it also opens the way, to be realistic about it, to the rise let's say of a right-wing party, let us say which could combine, say ,intense Russian naitonalism, with the stress on russian, with what might be called elements of neo-Stalinism. So, like in any political situation, this kind of reform opens the door not only, from the democratic point of view, to favorable but also to somewhat dangerous developments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/25/business/the-media-business-advertising-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 44, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Van Doren Rubber Co., to Eisaman, Johns & Laws, Los Angeles, for its Vans shoes, with a budget of $3 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/07/business/patents-new-cream-to-combat-wrinkles.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;   New Cream To Combat Wrinkles", "print_headline": "Patents;   New Cream To Combat Wrinkles", "body_text": " **********The quest for relief from wrinkles, a hallmark of aging, goes on. This week, two medical researchers in Madison, Wis., patented a cream they said embodies a natural process for reclaiming skin damaged by sun and old age. **********The cream was developed by Michael R. Schinitsky, a pathologist, and Lorraine F. Meisner, an associate professor of human oncology at the University of Wisconsin. The cream's principal ingredient is something found in medicine cabinets everywhere, ascorbic acid, or vitamin C. Dr. Schinitsky said that ascorbic acid is known to stimulate the growth of fibroblast cells, which are central to the health of the skin, gums and other connective tissues in the body. The patent is based on using ascorbic acid in conjunction with zinc and tyrosine, an amino acid. The inventors say that together the substances help reverse the decline of the skin's fibroblast cells caused by aging and sun exposure. That would in turn reverse the process of wrinkling. **********''This provides nourishment to an area of the body that is undernourished,'' Dr. Schinitsky said. In informal tests, he said, the cream appeared to curb wrinkles after being used for about six weeks.

In Cartagena, he will be joined by Mr. Bush, President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and President Alan Garcia of Peru. **********In their statement today, the traffickers identified themselves, as usual, as ''the Extraditables.'' The organization is believed to be made up traffickers who face extradition to the United States for narcotics offenses, mainly the leaders of the Medellin cocaine organization. One of their main objectives is to force the Government to stop extraditing traffickers. But that would be tantamount to amnesty because the traffickers have defeated all attempts to prosecute them in Colombia by killing and bribing judges and investigators. **********The national police emphasized again today that there had been no threats against President Bush and that they believe the risk to him and the other Presidents is minimal. Still, some 5,000 soldiers, policemen, marines and sailors have set up a defensive wall around Cartagena. **********Colombian officials have said that if there is any threat to President Bush it is from leftist guerrilla groups. On Tuesday, one group, the National Liberation Army, announced that in protest against Mr. Bush's visit it had kidnapped two Americans, David Kent, a teacher from Indianapolis, and James Donnelly, an employee of a company that maufactures water pumps and accessories. The police said that reports that one man had been released were inaccurate. **********After radio stations began broadcasting the traffickers' statement on the laboratory complex this morning, police units, accompanied by other reporters, set out for the jungle site near the town of Turbo on the Gulf of Uraba. **********President Barco and United States officials, who have scoffed at previous peace gestures from the traffickers since mid-January, again reacted skeptically. ''We don't think the offer is sincere,'' said Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national police commander. **********Many Colombians and some American experts on internatonal narcotics trafficking said the latest gesture seemed likely to increase public pressure on President Barco to enter negotiations with the traffickers. **********Terror Bombings Stop **********Colombians who follow the narcotics trade say they doubt that cocaine shipments to the United States would stop as a result of a Government settlement with the traffickers. But they believe that the traffickers would keep their promise to abandon violence. Since the traffickers' latest call for negotiations in mid-January, there have been no drug-related bombings or assassinations, the police say. **********When President Barco stepped up the campaign against the traffickers last August after the assassination of a presidential candidate they retaliated with scores of bombings that killed more than 200 people. **********Rensselaer W. Lee, an expert on international drug trafficking based in Washington, said, ''I think this is something that should be very, very carefully considered.'' **********He said he did not think discussions with the traffickers ''should be ruled out given the shape of Colombian public opinion in which a slight majority seems to support some kind of dialogue as a means of ending the violence.'' **********Mr. Barco says it is morally unacceptable to negotiate with people who are accused of killing scores of Colombians. **********For years, the drug traffickers have been getting their point of view across by sending statements to news organizations. **********A TV Reporter Invited **********One Colombian journalist who traveled to the laboratory site near Panama was Heiner Castenada, a correspondent for the nightly television news program Noticero de las Siete, or News at 7. Colleagues said the traffickers telephoned Mr. Castenada on Sunday morning and asked if he wanted to cover ''something big.'' **********He agreed, the colleagues reported, and was told to go to a certain street corner in Medellin with his crew and wait. Within a few minutes representatives of the traffickers turned up and took the crew to join other journalists and begin the trip to the laboratories. **********United States and Colombian officials said that while the laboratory complex may have had a capacity of 20 tons a month, it was not clear how much was actually being produced there. There are thought to be hundreds of laboratories in Colombia and the experts believe the traffickers shift chemicals and other supplies from one laboratory to another depending on their sense of risk at a particular place. **********The traffickers said in their statement that there were 15,000 drums of chemicals - acetone and ether - that are used in processing cocaine at the laboratory complex. The police noted that no processed cocaine was apparently left at the laboratory and cited this as evidence that the traffickrs were not giving up an active installation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/22/business/tokyo-s-wary-money-managers.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1990-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1756, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tokyo's Wary Money Managers", "print_headline": "Tokyo's Wary Money Managers", "body_text": " **********It takes only one shout of, ''It's the Japanese; they're buying!'' in a Wall Street dealing room to throw traders into fits of nervous activity. It is easy to understand why. **********The Japanese buyers are a group of money managers at Tokyo's big banks and insurance companies who control the largest pools of investment funds in the world today, multibillion-dollar symbols of Japan's economic strength. **********Their buy or sell decisions can send financial markets gyrating in New York, London or Frankfurt. Every time the United States Treasury sells bonds to finance America's huge budget deficits, the anxious question in Washington and on Wall Street is whether the Japanese will buy. If they do not, interest rates are likely to rise. **********Widespread Influence **********While their influence is greatest in the stock and bond markets, these conservative Japanese money managers are also large investors in American real estate, Western works of art and even such American finance houses as Shearson Lehman Hutton and Paine Webber. **********These powerful money men have been called the ''gnomes of Tokyo,'' successors to the ''gnomes of Zurich,'' the Swiss bankers once believed to hold sway over world finance. Like those secretive Europeans, Tokyo's money managers are generally regarded on Wall Street with fear and envy because of their vast influence over the markets. **********But in interviews with the tiny group of managers who make the international investment decisions for two of Japan's largest financial institutions, the Nippon Life Insurance Company and the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, these corporate bureaucrats did not speak of their power. Rather, they talked of how they felt hamstrung by the very size of the funds they control. **********''Bigness itself has become a problem,'' said Kozo Nogami, general manager of Nippon Life's international securities investments division. **********Mr. Nogami and his counterparts at Mitsubishi Trust described how they can move the tens of billions of dollars they have already invested overseas only in tiny increments, because a large move could destabilize the markets, create a panic and end up causing them losses. **********'It Would Be Suicide' **********That concern is a sober counterpoint to people in Japan who have advocated that the Japanese money managers consider dumping their Treasury bonds to punish the United States when it threatens protectionist actions. **********''Those remarks are ridiculous,'' Mr. Nogami said. ''It would be suicide because we would end up losing so much money.'' **********The risks are awesome. Nippon Life, the biggest insurer in the world, has $164.3 billion in assets, with more than $30 billion invested abroad. Mitsubishi Trust, the largest trust bank with $209 billion in total funds, has $14 billion in international investments. **********The money managers acknowledge that they are in the midst of a major shift in their international investment strategies. First, they are putting less money into bonds - largely American - and more into foreign stocks. Second, they are buying more West German stocks, because Germany is expected to benefit from the opening of Eastern Europe and the European Community's move to a single barrier-free market in 1992. **********Shinpei Ohashi, the 39-year-old chief manager of Mitsubishi Trust's treasury and securities division, said that as much as 20 percent of the new capital his group invests overseas goes to West Germany, compared with 5 percent a year ago. Similarly, Nippon Life will put more than half its new capital for overseas investment into West Germany. **********Cautious Newcomers **********Despite the vast sums they control, the money men themselves emerged in the interviews as a distinctively Japanese breed of cautious newcomers to the turbulent global markets, methodical and disciplined in their ways but disconcerted by the volatility of this new realm. **********The Japanese also provided a telling contrast to their Western counterparts. In the United States, the financial markets are regarded as a bastion of individualism, a place where hot-handed money managers can lay down huge bets and reap part of the rewards if they are successful. They are business stars, highly paid and mobile. **********The Tokyo managers are duty-bound bureaucrats in the traditional mold of the regimented Japanese ''salaryman.'' They are means by which the group expresses its will. **********For the Japanese, there is no fast track. They can move only slowly, by seniority, up the corporate ladder of prestige and pay, rather than being rewarded in proportion to the returns they earn with their portfolios. A 45-year-old section chief overseeing the investment of $10 billion or so might earn $100,000 a year, at the most, compared with many hundreds of thousands of dollars for a successful American fund manager, who could be nearly 20 years younger. **********Cadres of Generalists **********An American money manager may dart from firm to firm, selling his specialized skills to the highest bidder. The Tokyo managers typically remain in their assignments only three or four years before getting shuffled to another department. This method develops cadres of strong generalists, but not the kind of specialists that some Japanese executives acknowledge are necessary in an area as tricky as international investment. **********For instance, Makoto Toda, a chunky, amiable man who heads Nippon Life's international planning department, has a law degree from the University of Michigan and has built his career as an international expert. **********But several years ago, he was suddenly appointed head of a provincial branch 60 miles west of Tokyo, managing 800 housewifes who sold insurance door to door. (Insurance is sold almost exclusively by women in Japan.) The job, he noted tersely, ''was not at my request.'' **********Although the Japanese managers put safety above all else and think of the long term, they acknowledge that they have inadvertently become some of the globe's largest risk-takers. They have a conservative buy-and-hold strategy but because their overseas holdings are so huge, they run enromous risks that swings in currency rates will undermine the value of their portfolios. **********''We buy and hold and hope,'' said Shigeru Noma, a short, trim 38-year-old who heads the international stock department for Nippon Life. **********Overnight Losses **********Every night they go to bed with the prospect that if the dollar declines just one yen on currency markets while they sleep, they can suffer tens of millions of dollars in losses in their American investments before they sit down to their first cup of coffee. They have struggled without success to protect themselves from such swings. **********The declines, to be sure, remain paper losses unless the securities are sold. But the concern in Tokyo is that the swings make the value of the overseas portfolios highly unpredictable. **********For example, Japan's life insurance companies suffered combined paper losses on their foreign investments equivalent to an astounding $30 billion from 1985 through 1987 because the dollar lost about half its value against the yen. **********''We are running out of examples to follow because we are the first investor in world history to have $30 billion of currency risk,'' said Keiji Tsuda, a slight, intense man who has a degree from Duke University and heads Nippon Life's international bond portfolio. ''There may be a system for handling that, but nobody has found it yet. I think it's impossible.'' **********Too Big for Most Markets **********Another problem these investors face is that they are simply too big for most of the world's financial markets. Outside of New York, Frankfurt and London, the markets simply cannot absorb the capital the Japanese have to invest. **********''Even if we put all the time needed into researching these other markets, we just couldn't invest enough to make it worth our while,'' said Yuya Saijo, a confident 34-year-old who manages a slice of the $14 billion that the Mitsubishi Trust invests abroad. **********Mr. Tsuda added: ''We're like a big oil tanker. We can't change direction rapidly, and we can only work in the widest area of the sea.'' **********Nippon Life and Mitsubishi Trust are two primary repositories of the spectacular wealth that accumulated in Japan during the 1980's because of the country's huge trade surpluses. **********In addition to collecting premiums from policyholders, Nippon Life manages corporate pensions. Mitsubishi Trust takes deposits, manages assets for both individuals and corportions, and also oversees corporate pension plans. **********Largest Single Stock Owner **********Huge as their assets are, the official figures understate the real value. Nippon Life, for instance, is Japan's largest single stock owner, holding 3 percent of all shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That stake is worth about $125 billion - about three times the value at which the shares are carried on the insurer's books. The books show what Nippon Life paid for the shares. **********It was hard to square the visions conjured up by the unprecedented wealth of these institutions with the scene in the large, open, conspicuously unadorned dealing rooms of Nippon Life and Mitsubishi Trust on several days recently. **********In typical Japanese fashion, the senior executives sat at large metal desks, all the same, at the head of parallel rows of other metal desks facing each other under fluorescent lights. They were occupied almost exclusively by men in blue suits, almost all of them young; it was hard to spot a face that looked more than 45 years old and most seemed in their 20's. Women, who generally dressed in identical company outfits, did clerical work and fetched tea. **********Japan's financial institutions are so new at international investing because during most of the postwar years the Government hoarded capital at home to rebuild and then modernize Japanese industry. **********Markets Awash With Surpluses **********Insurers and trust banks used most of their capital for making loans to industrial concerns. But with Japan's markets awash in surpluses during the 1980's, the Government liberalized its rules and the institutions began looking to foreign markets. **********The executives conceded that they had been remarkably naive in their first big moves overseas. **********''Theoretically, the logic was that we could reduce our overall risk by spreading out investments over many different countries,'' explained Tokuo Banba, chief manager of international investments for Mitsubishi Trust's pension fund division. ''But practically speaking, people just looked at the interest-rate differential and thought this was an easy way to get a higher return.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/15/world/brasilia-journal-brazil-gets-the-picture-a-dynamo-is-taking-over.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1990-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 954, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Brasilia Journal;   Brazil Gets the Picture: A Dynamo Is Taking Over", "print_headline": "Brasilia Journal;   Brazil Gets the Picture: A Dynamo Is Taking Over", "body_text": " **********In Japan, he limbered up with karate kicks.

In this two-man runoff, Mr. Collor won 53 percent of the vote nationwide. **********The Photo Opportunity **********A former journalist, Mr. Collor has shaken up Brazil's old-style politicians with his relentless pursuit of the photo opportunity. **********In the last month, Mr. Collor, a onetime karate champion, has transmitted a dynamic image by being photographed swimming, kayaking, riding a motorcyle, riding a motorized skateboard, and bucking motorboat waves on a jet ski. Or sometimes jogging with a ''Collor'' or a ''Save the Amazon Rain Forest'' T-shirt. **********''Brazilian presidents are usually older people with absolutely no athletic ability,'' said Herbert de Souza, a sociologist who supported Mr. da Silva. ''To see Collor in a kayak is news. He is systematically working the media and the polls.'' **********Mr. Collor also impressed Brazilians with a world tour that for three weeks in January and February produced a daily diet of photos of the President-elect meeting world leaders, including George Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev. After having Mr. Collor and his 25-year-old wife, Rosane, over to the White House for dinner, President Bush wrote an approving note to a friend, describing Brazil's President-elect as Indiana Jones. **********Delegations from about 100 nations are to attend the inauguration on Thursday, an unusually high number for a South American swearing-in ceremony. ''The foreign trip mobilized a large mass of public trust,'' Mr. Jaguaribe said. Indeed, international approval helped to confer legitimacy on a man who won a bitter, sharply polarized campaign. **********Long political negotiations, coupled with table-hopping by the President-elect at political dinners, has apparently culminated in a coveted congressional majority. **********Parties Rally to Him **********Today, a half-dozen center-right parties have closed ranks behind Mr. Collor. ''Coming from a party that practically doesn't exist, he has succeeded in getting a very reasonable base in Congress,'' Mr. Jaguaribe said. **********Always seeking to occupy the front page, Mr. Collor recently doled out Cabinet appointments, spacing them once every two or three days. **********One day he named as Secretary of Sports Zico, one of Brazil's most popular soccer players, whose formal name is Arthur Antunes Coimbra. Last week, he named Brazil's ''supercop,'' Romeu Tuma, to head Brazil's equivalent of the Internal Revenue Service. As director of Brazil's Federal Police, Mr. Tuma won international fame in 1985 when he announced the discovery in Sao Paulo of the skeleton of Josef Mengele, the Nazi death-camp doctor. **********In other unexpected choices, Mr. Collor named a 36-year-old economist, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, as Economy Minister, and the former president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, Francisco Rezek, as Foreign Minister. **********Some Dissenting Voices **********Not all Brazilians have been seduced by Mr. Collor. **********''In my 40 years of public life, I have never seen such a weak, inexpressive and unrepresentative Cabinet,'' said Leonel Brizola, a Rio de Janeiro Socialist who placed third in the November round of last year's presidential elections. **********''How can someone from the elite criticize the elite?'' asked Mr. da Silva, the Workers Party candidate, who won 47 percent of the vote in the runoff. **********On Thursday morning, Mr. Brizola and Mr. da Silva will be absent from the crowd of notables at inauguration ceremonies here. Instead, they will be advancing plans to forge a leftist opposition bloc. **********Under Brazil's electoral rules, the two are to get free air time this month on national network television. If the past is a guide, each will endeavor to snap the media spell that Mr. Collor has woven over his compatriots."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/11/business/foreign-companies-in-us-cited-again-on-tax-record.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1990-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 703, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Foreign Companies in U.S. Cited Again on Tax Record", "print_headline": "Foreign Companies in U.S. Cited Again on Tax Record", "body_text": " **********Congressional investigators and tax officials reported new evidence today that American subsidiaries of foreign automobile and electronics companies have been underpaying Federal income taxes, with at least $13 billion in back taxes now being sought by the Government. **********The disclosures have angered many on Capitol Hill, where legislators are seeking new sources of revenue to reduce the Federal budget deficit. **********''Before Congress acts to raise taxes on the average citizen in order to reduce the deficit, we should be sure that U.S. subsidiaries are paying their fair share of the current tax load,'' said Representative Richard T. Schulze of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight. The avoidance of taxes by foreign-owned companies creates ''unfair competition'' for American businesses, he said. **********In 1987, the subcommittee staff found, eight foreign-owned electronics companies reported almost $14 billion in gross receipts in the United States, but paid no Federal income taxes. That is the last year for which data are available. **********Fred T. Goldberg Jr., the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said that American subsidiaries of Japanese, West German, British and Canadian companies ''may be substantially understating their U.S. income-tax liability,'' through the manipulation of prices paid by the subsidiaries to their foreign parents. **********At a subcommittee hearing today, David A. Lowry, an Internal Revenue Service auditor from Jacksonville, Fla., testified that noncompliance with United States tax laws by American subsidiaries of Japanese car manufacturers ''has been evident for several years.'' **********In a nine-month investigation, the subcommittee staff examined 212 tax returns filed over 10 years by the American subsidiaries of 36 foreign companies. More than half paid ''little or no Federal income tax,'' the staff reported. **********The main reason, according to the staff, was that foreign-owned companies overstated the price of goods manufactured abroad and shipped to the United States, so that profits were transferred out of this country. In addition, the staff said, foreign-owned companies shifted income away from the United States ''through excessive freight, insurance, interest and other fees or charges.'' **********Mr. Lowry said that Japanese auto manufacturers sought to ''remove profits from the United States'' by charging their own subsidiaries more than the price charged for identical vehicles sold directly from Japan to American-owned companies. **********The calculation of prices in transactions between units of the same company has long been a thorny issue for tax lawyers and accountants, but Congress has paid much more attention to the question this year. Companies Challenging I.R.S.  Under Federal tax regulations, a parent company is supposed to charge its subsidiary the same price a buyer would pay an unrelated seller in the open market - the ''arm's length price.'' **********The I.R.S. told the subcommittee that it was trying to collect $13 billion of additional taxes in cases involving sales of manufactured goods by foreign companies to their American subsidiaries. Companies are challenging the proposed levies through administrative appeals and litigation. **********No corporate executives testified at the hearing today. The Organization for Fair Treatment of International Investment, which represents American subsidiaries of about 30 foreign companies, has acknowledged that I.R.S. data show low tax payments in the early 1980's. The organization says, however, that there were legitimate reasons, including the fact that many foreign-owned companies were just entering the American market in those years. **********Mr. Goldberg said that the data were ''certainly cause for concern.'' But he added that the statistics by themselves did not prove widespread violations by American subsidiaries of foreign companies. **********The subcommittee staff reviewed 106 Federal income tax returns filed by American subsidiaries of 18 foreign electronics companies in the last decade. ''On these returns,'' it said, ''the companies reported $116 billion in gross receipts and paid $654 million, or one-half of 1 percent, in Federal income tax. Over 10 years, only nine companies reported positive taxable income.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/business/international-report-developers-in-china-hit-hard-times.html": {"writer_name": "James Sterngold", "pub_date": "1990-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Developers in China Hit Hard Times", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT;   Developers in China Hit Hard Times", "body_text": " **********After a five-year development binge that has dotted Beijing's perpetually hazy skyline with dozens of new office and hotel towers, the Chinese are suddenly learning that the flip side of a boom is a bust. **********With the chill in business and political ties between China and the West during the last year, offices designed especially for foreigners are lying vacant, rental rates are tumbling, loans for many building projects have had to be renegotiated and foreign residents are facing something they never imagined possible during the heady days of expansion - competition for their business. **********As more buildings open in the coming months, the situation, many people here say, will get worse. **********The excesses are in some ways a metaphor for the West's difficult business relationship with China during the past decade. The West's enthusiasm has tended to swing to extremes, and many foreign and Chinese developers are paying a price for the spurt of over-optimism. **********Harsh Austerity Campaign **********When the Chinese Government ended several years of fast growth, openness and economic reform in mid-1988 with a harsh austerity campaign to quell inflation, it was too late for many developers to turn back. Office buildings they had started earlier were already coming on the market. **********The Government's bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement last year only intensified the existing trend and frightened off some foreign corporations, the prospective tenants for the new office space. **********Probably the best illustration of how bad things were before the building boom, and how things have changed, is the story of Shell China Ltd., a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/ Shell Group, the world's second-largest oil company. Seven years ago, when Shell was shopping for office space, the best it could find was half of the sixth floor of the Hepingmen Roast Duck Restaurant building, about a mile south of Tiananmen Square in the center of the capital. **********'It Always Smelled of Duck' **********''All in all, it was quite adequate compared to the other choices, mostly hotels,'' said Christopher Evans, head of administration for Shell's 26-person staff here. ''The real problem was that it always smelled of duck; it was not inferior duck or anything like that, but it's the largest Peking duckery in the world, and so they were cooking them all the time.'' **********Shell moved several months ago to the new China World Trade Center, the largest office complex in the country, which includes two hotels, a convention center, apartments, a shopping complex and much better ventilation. **********''We like it because the telecommunications are a bit better than at the duck, and it's a better location,'' Mr. Evans said. An additional benefit, he said, is he can again enjoy ordering Peking duck at restaurants, something he could not bear while ensconced in the old quarters. **********As one of the premier new buildings in the capital, the China World Trade Center, with 550,000 square feet of space, was expected to be filled by now. But its managers are generally happy to have commitments for about 70 percent of the space, all taken by foreign companies. **********Rental Prices Fall **********The maximum rents being charged are about $3.25 a square foot - less than the top rate of $4.15 a square foot they had expected before China's military crushed the pro-democracy movement last summer. **********Yoshiaki Hashimoto, an administrative officer here for the Mitsubishi Corporation, said that after the turmoil in Tiananmen Square his negotiations with the World Trade Center's management took a decided turn for the better. The rent sought for the 26,000 square feet fell sharply. **********Although he would not give the exact figure, Mr. Hashimoto said Mitsubishi ended up paying about half what it was being charged at its previous site, the Capital Hotel, whose facilities he said were poor. Like many other foreign companies here, Mistubishi had moved into a hotel in the mid-1980's because it was the only space available. **********The granddaddy of hotel-office complexes here is the Jianguo Hotel - an exact replica of the Holiday Inn in Palo Alto, Calif. (The American investor in the joint venture to build the Jianguo Hotel was also an investor in the Holiday Inn and brought with him a set of plans.) It opened in 1982 and enjoyed close to 100 percent occupancy for years, drawing on tourists and companies taking rooms on long-term leases. **********Now it is feeling the squeeze, too. Over the last year the Jianguo has lost about half its long-term corporate tenants and the overall occupancy rate is barely 50 percent, said Peter J. Hierzi, deputy general manager. $2 a Square Foot Some offices in other new buildings built for foreign occupants are being let for $2 a square foot, down from a minimum of about $2.75 just 18 months ago, according to Richard Ellis Ltd., a real estate brokerage firm. That is still high for what many companies regard as a hardship post, but nearly 25 percent below the peak. **********Richard Ellis estimated that earlier this year there was 1.6 million square feet of office space suitable for foreign companies in Beijing, of which only 65 percent was occupied. The broker added that many new buildings have only let about 25 percent of their office space. **********Apartments designed for foreigners - with central air-conditioning and Western-style toilets - have the same problems. A 1,600-square-foot three-bedroom apartment at the World Trade Center complex, a joint venture between a Hong Kong company and a Chinese Government entity, is going for about $4,000 a month -compared with $6,000 a month for the same size unit at the Holiday Inn Lido complex, on the airport road. Those apartments, among the few modern apartments for foreign business executives when they opened in 1985, had been fully rented before they were even completed. **********Apartments Go Begging **********Even with the price drop, most new apartments have gone begging for tenants. According to Richard Ellis, which recently closed its Beijing office because of the slow market, only 75 percent of the 2,400 apartments built for foreigners in the last five years are leased. **********Another 1,270 apartments are scheduled to come on the market this year, with another 150 expected next year. Rents for a 1,600-square-foot apartment could tumble to $3,000 a month. **********Caught in the squeeze are a number of foreign property developers. But the blow has fallen hardest on Japanese companies, which were partners in 12 projects under construction as of early 1988, amounting to several hundred million dollars, according to a study done by the National Council for United States-China Trade. **********The lengthy list the council compiled gave evidence of how Chinese entities had leaped blindly into the development fray. Among the Chinese partners in these projects, many of which have been completed, were affiliates of the People's Liberation Army, the Ministry of Justice, the provincial government of Inner Mongolia, the State Farm Bureau and an aluminum factory."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/06/world/the-iraqi-invasion-syrian-likens-invasion-to-law-of-the-jungle.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Syrian Likens Invasion to Law of the Jungle", "print_headline": "THE IRAQI INVASION;   Syrian Likens Invasion to Law of the Jungle", "body_text": " **********President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, denouncing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, was quoted today as saying Baghdad was following the law of the jungle. **********''If every country were to impose its illegitimate viewpoints through aggression and the use of force, the world would resemble a jungle,'' Iranian television quoted Mr. Assad as saying. **********The Iranian Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, meeting Mr. Assad in Damascus, also criticized the invasion. **********''Ten years ago, when Iraq attacked Iran, we said that if no serious action were taken against the aggression, its dangerous consequences would affect other countries in the future,'' the television station, monitored by BBC, quoted Mr. Velayati as having said. **********Iraq and Iran began an eight-year war in 1980."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/01/business/business-people-financial-newsmakers-1989-six-who-made-headlines-america-abroad-181890.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Berg", "pub_date": "1990-01-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 489, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Exchange Chairman Aims to Polish Image Of Futures Industry: LEO MELAMED, Chicago Merc", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE: FINANCIAL NEWSMAKERS OF 1989 - SIX WHO MADE THE HEADLINES IN AMERICA AND ABROAD;   Exchange Chairman Aims to Polish Image Of Futures Industry: LEO MELAMED, Chicago Merc", "body_text": " **********In the world of commodity futures trading, Leo Melamed is widely considered to be the chief lobbyist, spokesman and public relations man - and an adept one at that.

In addition to producing about 47 indictments and about half as many guilty pleas, the investigation has prompted lawmakers to consider tighter regulation of the futures business. **********That is something Mr. Melamed dreads, having championed the idea of ''self-regulation'' in futures and been a founding chairman of the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory group. **********This is not the first time Mr. Melamed has had to beat back attempts at tighter control. In 1987 the Merc was accused of contributing to the market crash but Mr. Melamed appeared before Congressional committees to give Chicago's version. It was his testimony, experts said, that partly led Congress not to impose a tighter lease on the industry. **********Around the time the indictments were made public, the Federal Government issued a report charging that both Chicago exchanges' systems for policing trading activity were lacking.

The loan would be used to rebuild areas of Iran devastated by an earthquake last summer. **********''If Iran were suddenly to break the embargo on Iraq, then obviously we'd oppose any World Bank lending to Iran,'' an American official said. ''For now, we will not oppose it.'' **********Although the United States does not have veto power on World Bank loans, it could almost certainly round up enough Western support to block a loan to Iran. **********Banking specialists said Iran's request for the loan was an important signal of its intention to resume involvement in world financial markets, and of its desire to improve relations with the United States and other Western nations. **********For the first 10 years after the fall of the Shah in 1979, Iran did not seek international loans, fearing that borrowing from the West could pose a threat to the nation's independence. **********First Since Revolution **********Iran has made requests for loans from private Western banks in the last year. Banking experts said they understood that the earthquake relief loan would be the first major substantial loan to Iran under the Islamic Government from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, the two giant international lending agencies. **********Loans made by the World Bank, a Washington-based agency that is nominally part of the United Nations system and is formally known as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, are largely underwritten by the United States and other Western nations. **********''There is great psychological significance in this,'' said Sharif Ghalib, director of the Africa and Middle East department of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based research organization. ''The loan itself is not as important as the signal it sends that Iran wishes return to a financial and technical relationship with the West.'' **********American officials and banking authorities said they understood that the loan would be approved by the World Bank later this year or early next year. It would be intended for housing reconstruction in a coastal area along the Caspian Sea, which was left in rubble after the June earthquake. Nearly 35,000 people are said to have died. **********Peter Riddleberger, a spokesman for the World Bank, said it had recently sent a delegation to Iran ''to investigate the feasibility of an earthquake reconstruction loan.'' **********''Some of the members of that team are back in town now and are assessing their findings,'' he said. ''It seems like things are moving along at a fairly normal pace and perhaps by the end of the year, there would be a proposal for a reconstruction loan.'' **********He said he could not predict whether the loan would eventually be approved by the bank's executive board. **********Loan decisions are based on a vote on World Bank member nations. The voting is weighted, and each member's share of the vote is roughly equivalent to its economic strength. The United States has about one-fifth of the vote. **********In international financial circles, Iran is seen as a relatively good credit risk, especially after the dramatic jump in the price of oil that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. **********''Iran has a good history of making payments on its debt, even during the Iran-Iraq war,'' Mr. Ghalib said. **********Break From Khomeini Policies **********In a major break from the policies of the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died in June 1989, the Iranian Government announced last year that it would begin borrowing abroad for development projects. **********Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Bush Administraton has sent a number of conciliatory messages to Iran through diplomatic channels and has urged Iran to adhere to the economic and military sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations. **********While the United States has little first-hand information about Iran's intentions regarding the sanctions, the Administration is hoping that Teheran's interest in obtaining Western aid to rebuild its economy will override any impulse to break the embargo. **********The Iranian Government has publicly vowed to support the sactions against the Iraqi Government of Saddam Hussein. **********''The World Bank loan could be another carrot to the Iranians, another sign from the United States that we want to improve relations with Teheran and that we want their help in isolating Saddam,'' an Administration official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/01/business/business-people-harvard-economist-to-join-world-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1990-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 442, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Harvard Economist To Join World Bank", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Harvard Economist To Join World Bank", "body_text": " **********Lawrence H.

Webster, said that Mr. Hussein has managed to smuggle up to three million barrels of oil out of his country, either by truck or by ship, since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. **********No Sizable Leak Seen **********Mr. Webster, in an appearance in Manhattan on Tuesday evening, said the smuggled oil totals only 2 or 3 percent of Iraq's potential production during that period and does not represent a significant leak in the United Nations embargo. **********Before the economic sanctions against Iraq were imposed by the United Nations, Iraq and Kuwait were authorized by OPEC cartel agreements to ship a total of 4.6 million barrels of oil daily, but production for export has virtually ceased since the trade embargo began on Aug. 6. **********Fear Iran Transshipment **********The movement of the Iraqi tankers has raised concerns among Government analysts that the oil they take on is destined for Iran, where it could be moved onto Iranian tankers for sale on the world market. **********United States intelligence officials say they have recently detected a new push by Mr. Hussein to win Iran's help in breaking the embargo, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. **********They said that Iran recently had discussed with Iraqi officials the possibility of linking the two nations' pipeline networks, a project the Central Intelligence Agency believes could be completed in about a month. Such a link could move up to 500,000 barrels of Iraqi oil into the Iranian system each day, C.I.A. analysts are said to believe. **********Iraq and Iran also have discussed an arrangement under which Iran would sell Iraq's oil on the world market in exchange for a share of the profits, one Administration official said today. **********Unloading at Kharg **********Officials say that the three oil-laden Iraqi tankers now anchored in the Persian Gulf could easily sail for Iran's main oil terminal, at nearby Kharg Island, where they would unload their oil for export through Iran's tanker facilities there. **********Those concerns are heightened by the fact that all four Iraqi tankers now off the Fao peninsula arrived there by a circuitous route, hugging the Iranian coast and avoiding international waters where they might be stopped and inspected by foreign warships. **********The United Nations resolution that authorizes military action to enforce the embargo, passed on Aug. 25, does not specify whether that authorization is limited to international waters, but instead ''invites'' member states to cooperate to insure compliance. **********A State Department official said tonight that the United States would not enter another nation's waters to enforce the embargo without first asking permission. It is not known whether Washington did so in the case of the Iraqi tankers. **********The route apparently was approved in advance by Iran. It worked for most of the tankers, but the last of the four, called Al Fao, was stopped by an American warship and inspected before it reached Iranian waters, a senior Pentagon official said today. The inspection found no contraband and the tanker was allowed to proceed. **********A Matter of Sanctuary **********That official and other Government experts said today that the coast-hugging gambit raises questions of whether Iran intends to help Iraq slip the naval blockade by giving its tankers sanctuary while they shuttle between Iraqi pipeline terminals and Iran's Kharg Island terminal. **********The tankers all anchored off Iraq's southern coast in the last three weeks. They are the first to load Iraqi crude oil since the invasion and the blockade that followed it. Al Fao tied up in the same area this week, but has yet to take on oil, United States officials said. **********On Tuesday, after an address to a private group in New York, Mr. Webster said that C.I.A. experts believe that the embargo has stopped 97 to 98 percent of the oil that left Iraq before the invasion. Iraq had been exporting 3.14 million barrels of oil daily. **********Most Going to Jordan **********Mr. Webster said the vast majority of the oil that has escaped the embargo has gone to Jordan in exchange for forgiveness of Jordanian debts to Iraq. Other Government officials said today that Jordan is receiving up to 45,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq, all by truck - the same amount it received before the embargo. **********Jordan has told the United States that none of the oil is being re-exported, one official said today. **********By accepting the oil, Jordan is technically violating the United Nations trade ban, which orders member states to bar the import ''of all commodities and products originating in Iraq.'' **********The rest of the oil that is known to have escaped the embargo was shipped to Yemen shortly after the invasion and is sitting in the Iraqi tankers anchored off the Fao peninsula, officials said. **********U.S. Sharing Intelligence **********In a related matter, Mr. Webster said Tuesday that American intelligence agencies are distributing some of their reporting on the Kuwait crisis to allies around the world, but that they were not exchanging intelligence with the Soviet Union. **********He said the United States ''would be very happy if they'd share some things about their weapons and equipment'' sold to Iraq's military, but that the Soviets appeared unwilling to provide that sort of data. **********Today, Vladimir Kryuchkov, head of the Soviet intelligence service, the K.G.B., told The Associated Press in an interview that his agency would welcome an exchange of intelligence on Iraq. **********The C.I.A.'s spokesman, Mark Mansfield, said today that the agency does not comment on intelligence relationships with other nations. **********Mr. Webster has often said that the United States would not deal directly with the K.G.B. until the Soviet Union is proven to have abandoned its support of terrorism and instituted democratic reforms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/16/business/the-media-business-whittle-says-channel-one-is-on-target.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1990-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 473, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Whittle Says Channel One Is on Target", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Whittle Says Channel One Is on Target", "body_text": " **********Channel One, the daily news service for schoolchildren that has provoked intense criticism because it will include commercials, has signed up more than 2,500 schools and $200 million worth of advertising, Christopher Whittle, the chairman of Whittle Communications, said yesterday. **********Mr. Whittle said Channel One had met the targets he set a year ago, and he attacked critics and competitors who had predicted that Channel One would fail.

If Prices Remain High and Fields Intact", "print_headline": "A Saudi Oil Windfall? If Prices Remain High and Fields Intact", "body_text": " **********Whether Saudi Arabia reaps a windfall from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait depends on two big ifs - if its oilfields are undamaged by war and if oil prices stay high. **********If those conditions are met, the profit is likely to exceed even the substantial new commitments Saudi Arabia undertook after the invasion: subsidies of $1 billion a month to the United States and the Saudis' neighbors in the Persian Gulf that are supporting the United Nations embargo of Iraq; about $1 billion a month in extra operating expenses for the Saudi military, and the purchase of $7.3 billion in American weapons. Much of that equipment has already been sent to Saudi Arabia, although it is not clear exactly when payment will be made. **********Last week, with crude oil selling at $40 a barrel, the Saudis were thought to be able to earn as much as an additional $16 billion in the fourth quarter, which would more than cover those expenses. Oil has fallen in recent days to below $37 a barrel, and should it stay at that level the extra Saudi profits for the quarter might be closer to $14 billion. **********The real windfall could begin in 1991, if Persian Gulf tensions and oil prices remain high and the Saudi Government does not incur additional costs, said Edgard H. Habib, the senior director of the Middle East and Africa service at the WEFA Group, a large consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''What is critical in this situation is how long it lasts,'' he added. $65 Billion Extra Based on the rough-and-ready arithmetic of multiplying expanded Saudi oil production next year by nearly $37 a barrel - which is what Saudi Arabia actually receives when the world price is $40 - analysts estimate that the extra revenues could total as much as $65 billion over the next 12 months. Balanced against that would be continued monthly subsidies and military expenses, the proposed purchase of another $14 billion of American weapons for delivery over the next several years - which has drawn hostility in Congress -and a range of other expenses that are hard to estimate, like the accelerated development of oilfields. **********The estimates of additional annual oil revenues are highly conditional. They assume that Saudi oilfields will not be damaged by military action or sabotage, while tensions nonetheless keep oil prices high. Yet oil traders and analysts say the surge in crude oil prices after the Iraqi invasion reflected, in part, concerns that a Persian Gulf war would destroy some Saudi oilfields, which would limit the Saudi Government's ability to benefit from higher prices. **********If Saudi oilfields continue to produce at full capacity, oil prices may fall, said Fareed Mohamedi, an oil industry analyst at the Petroleum Finance Company. Contracts for delivery of oil next spring are trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange for $29 to $31 a barrel, meaning that the consensus of the market is that there will then be nearly adequate supplies and lower prices, he said. **********Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's former oil minister, said recently that crude oil should drop to $15 to $18 a barrel when the Persian Gulf crisis was settled. Reimposing production quotas may be difficult then for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. **********Long-Term Commitments **********Higher oil prices also represent a two-edged sword for Saudi rulers, producing extra revenues now but increasing the risk that Western nations will look harder for new sources of energy. ''They've got 120 years of reserves - it's not in their long-term interest to have oil-shale production, geothermal energy and other alternatives become economical,'' said Ronald J. Rizzuto, a finance professor at the University of Denver who specializes in the economics of the industry. **********Saudi Arabia has acquired several long-term commitments since the Iraqi invasion, the cost of which may dwarf any oil windfall that lasts only a few months, experts say. **********Countries that have sided with Saudi Arabia are likely to expect economic assistance, said David T. Mizrahi, the editor and publisher of the Mideast Report, a New York newsletter. Saudi officials hinted at such aid when the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia established diplomatic relations on Sept. 17, he said. **********Some Aid Is Halted **********At the same time, Saudi Arabia has cut off its aid to Jordan and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in response to their support of Iraq. Jordan has lost $350 million a year, plus subsidized oil, while the P.L.O. has lost $80 million to $100 million a year. **********The biggest expense to the Saudis may be a permanently larger and better-equipped army. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, said recently that his country had begun a review of the size of its armed forces. Iraq has a little more than twice the population of Saudi Arabia, but its regular army is nearly 10 times as big. **********Prince Bandar and the Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment on how extra oil revenues would affect Saudi Arabia. **********The country has relied more on diplomacy and lavish foreign aid and less on the size of its armed forces to maintain its independence for the last several decades. Since World War II, Saudi diplomacy has emphasized the kingdom's devotion to Islam and its defense of two of the religion's holiest cities, Mecca and Medina, in contrast to the secular Pan-Arab nationalism espoused by President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt in the 1950's and 1960's and Saddam Hussein now. **********The Social Costs **********The average Saudi is unlikely to perceive any dramatic benefit from higher oil prices, said Sharif Ghalib, the director of the Africa and Middle East department at the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based research organization supported by international banks. That is because the Saudi Government had planned to cover a projected deficit this year of $6.7 billion by selling bonds, but may instead keep the additional oil revenues. **********Estimates of Saudi Arabia's financial gains and losses as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait also ignore the social costs to the kingdom of being unable to defend itself and forced to accept more than 100,000 foreign troops. **********The clearest beneficiaries of Iraq's invasion, although not in total dollars received, may be the oil exporters that do not border Kuwait or Iraq and are receiving higher prices for their oil. These countries include Algeria, Egypt, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Yemen. **********''For the countries that have high populations and low incomes, this is a fortune'' because they spent their previous oil revenues and ran up large foreign debts, said Marvin Zonis, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business who studies Middle Eastern politics and business. ''The other countries are living and dying on these barrels,'' he said. Algeria has already said it will devote most of its extra oil revenues to the payment of overdue foreign debts. **********''When the creditors see these windfall gains, they will not say, 'Sow it in your economy and pay us later,' '' Mr. Habib said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/21/world/bulgaria-s-former-leader-to-face-charges.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 247, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bulgaria's Former Leader to Face Charges", "print_headline": "Bulgaria's Former Leader to Face Charges", "body_text": " **********The former Communist leader, Todor Zhivkov, will face trial on charges of misappropriation of funds and abuse of power, Bulgaria's prosecutor general announced today. **********The 78-year-old Zhivkov ruled Bulgaria for 35 years but has been under house arrest since he was ousted last year by former colleagues. **********Prosecutor General Martin Gounev was quoted by BTA, the official press agency, as saying that Mr. Zhivkov would be tried for misappropriation of $3.7 million.

It is only in the last few years that the museum has been able restore to its exhibits the names and faces of historical figures repressed during various epochs of the Soviet state. **********After 50 years of invisibility, Trotsky and Bukharin, the Bolshevik leaders who were among Stalin's most prominent victims, are back on the museum's walls, along with a giant painting of the second Communist International, two thirds of whose delegates were later killed at Moscow's orders. Until a year ago, the painting had been kept in the basement. **********''We had preserved all this material,'' said the museum's director, Olga S. Krivosheina, ''It was just that we could not show it.'' **********Putting Him Into 'Context' **********As history enters another cycle, the task of the museum is shifting again. Once dedicated entirely to Lenin (20 of the big red brick buildings's 34 exhibit halls describe his life and works), the idea now is to turn into it a museum of Lenin and his era. **********''Our main goal is to restore the context for Lenin's ideas,'' said Tatyana Koloskova, a senior researcher at the museum. ''All the arguments that were the backdrop for his theories disappeared with the people who made them. We have to restore the debate as it was.'' **********Her worry is that Russia will again going to try to blot out its past, as it did in 1917. ''Then, using a kind of vulgar Marxism, we tried to destroy our previous history,'' she said. ''Now there are some who are trying to do the same thing to the last 70 years. When I hear people at meetings cry, 'Let's try Lenin,' I say we have had enough trials in this century.'' **********But, she said, it is the Russian character to swing between extremes. ''Lenin, by the way,'' she said, ''warned against this.'' **********The Central Lenin Museum, which employs 250 people, including 50 guides and 22 researchers, is also about to undergo a change in its financing. The museum, which charges no admittance fee, has up to now been subsidized entirely by the Communist Party. Now that it is in the process of a divorce from the state, the party is taking a sharper look at its expenses, including the Lenin legacy. In the Russian republic alone, that legacy consists of 34 museums, 26 of which are places where Lenin worked or slept. **********Museum Attendance Drops **********Even before Lenin came under attack this summer, the number of visitors to the Central Museum off Red Square had dropped from 1.5 million to 1 million. Part of the decline is explained by the virtual disappearance of Eastern European visitors, who are now free to go elsewhere, and by a new apathy among Soviets, who are spending less time at museums, theaters and public spectacles in general. **********But there has also been a sharp decline in Lenin's public stature. Two years ago, it was popular among Soviet publicists to quote Lenin condemning Stalin. Since then Lenin's role has also been re-examined in the harsh light of Soviet history, as new articles are published on atrocities in the pre-Stalinist era. Like the Communist Party and the K.G.B., Lenin is no longer taboo. **********Mrs. Krivosheina, the museum's director, came to work there 21 years ago as an unabashed Lenin admirer, and her feelings have not changed since. But she is among the first to admit that the current debunking is in direct proportion to the idolatrization of Lenin in official Soviet propaganda over the last decades. For purists like her, the endless quotes from Lenin that once sprinkled the Soviet landscape were almost as painful as the blanket accusations now hurled against him at public meetings. **********''Before, they invented ways to dress him up,'' said Mrs. Krivosheina, whose office is free of Lenin memorabilia except for one modest statue on her desk. ''Now, they invent ways to dress him down.'' **********Like 'Blaming Christ' **********She argues that the attacks reflect the ''low cultural level'' of the critics. Historically, she said, it is as justified as blaming Christ for all the sins commmitted in the name of Christianity. **********''There are some forces that have appeared that want to do harm to our party, to socialism,'' she said. ''You read the papers, and every day a new party appears. Yesterday, I was reading about the monarchists who are waiting for the czar's relatives to come back. Now, it is unlikely that these people have good feelings about Lenin.'' **********A staunch party member, Mrs. Krivosheina still believes that Lenin is the role model the country needs. ''It is like a family where children must learn to respect their parents, '' she said. ''It is the same with history. People have to understand that history was made by their own grandfathers.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/12/world/40-killed-in-rebel-offensive-in-colombia.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 530, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "40 Killed in Rebel Offensive in Colombia", "print_headline": "40 Killed in Rebel Offensive in Colombia", "body_text": " **********About 40 people were killed in fighting between the army and leftist guerrillas as the rebels mounted their biggest offensive of the year, the local Governor's office said today. **********The army and the police drove back 1,000 members of two guerrilla groups who jointly attacked the adjacent towns of Taraza and Caceres in northern Colombia on Saturday, the official statement said. **********In Taraza, 250 miles north of Bogota, 500 rebels attacked an army base and the police station with mortar and automatic-weapons fire. **********Nine soldiers and 16 guerrillas died in the five-hour battle, which lasted until the rebels were driven back into the mountains, said the Governor's office in Antioquia state. **********Rebels also attacked the town of Caceres, killing a police officer, destroying the municipal building and damaging the police station.

For the year, however, machine tool orders were down 21.7 percent from their level for 1988. **********Analysts have contended that a slowdown in orders from the automotive industry has been the principal factor in the declining level of new orders for machine tools, which are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in the manufacture of everything from appliances to vehicles. Because of declining auto sales, car makers have scaled back their purchases of new machine tools and manufacturing systems. **********Decline from 1988 **********In a monthly report to be released today, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said new orders in December climbed to $209.7 million, from $184.4 million in November. But it said the December orders were 34 percent lower than new orders in December 1988. **********Economists consider sales and orders of machines tools important indicators of capital spending patterns by makers of large products like automobiles and aircraft. Some analysts said the December increase reflected increased capital spending by many companies. But they also called the increase relatively insignificant. **********''Orders will slow down because there is a great deal of nervousness among manufacturers about whether there is going to be a recession,'' said James J. Paper, an analyst with Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian Inc. in Omaha. ''And fourth-quarter earnings for manufacturing companies are not the best, and that will also have an effect on new orders.'' **********For the year, machine tool orders stood at $2.81 billion, down from $3.59 billion in 1988. While the figures for the year are significantly higher than the $2.1 billion during the industry's slump in both 1986 and 1987, analysts predict that the level of new orders will decline to $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion this year. **********Slide in Foreign Orders **********The December figure included a 21 percent increase from November in domestic orders but a continued slide in orders from foreign customers. Foreign orders, which account for about a sixth of the total number of orders, were down 16 percent in December from November's level, and down 53.1 percent from the level of December 1988, when the dollar was weaker. **********For the entire year, domestic new orders were down 20.3 percent, while orders from foreign customers were down 30.1 percent, the association said. **********Machine tool shipments were up 22.6 percent in December over November, to $384.4 million.

That category usually accounts for three-fourths of the industry's orders. December orders for metal-forming tools were down 8 percent from November's level, to $51 million. **********The backlog of machine tool orders stood at $1.8 billion, down from November's $1.97 billion.

Construction of a colony of such houses will begin next month on the 10-acre site of a former factory in the heart of the city's Greenville section. **********The project, called Franklin Park, will contain 127 detached homes, each with a two-car garage and a lot of 2,500 square feet. It is being developed by the Franklin Building Corporation of Montclair, N.J., and Van Leer Container Inc. of Chicago, a subsidiary of Dutch Royal Packaging Inc. of the Netherlands. The project, which will be built in phases, is estimated to cost up to $38 million. **********Van Leer is the owner of the property and the last operator of the factory, which produced containers for shipping and storage. The factory on Danforth Avenue had been in operation for nearly 100 years until it shut its doors in 1987. A year later the building was razed, providing a rare vacant parcel in the primarily residential neighborhood about a mile from the waterfront in the southern half of this city of nearly 224,000. **********Franklin Park is good news for local officials and area homeowners who felt the old plant had become an anomaly because of the residential nature of the neighborhood. That, plus frequent complaints from residents over the vapors emitted by the factory helped lead to its closing, said C. Jack Smith, who is overseeing the project for Van Leer. **********Recognizing that the property could be adapted for housing, Van Leer joined with Franklin early in 1989 to develop the tract. The city rezoned the property last year from industrial/residential use to residential-only use. **********Robert Cotter, director of urban research and design for the city's Department of Housing and Economic Development, said Jersey City welcomed the project because it meets two important municipal goals: improving the neighborhood and producing much-needed housing that residents can afford. **********Two-family houses, with their income-producing apartments, are ''the key to home ownership'' for many people, Mr. Cotter said. **********A glut of condominiums on the market is another reason for building two-family homes, said Paul DeBellis, a partner at Franklin. ''The time is right to go back to the basics,'' he said, noting that ''the city was built on two- and three-family homes.'' **********Each of the homes, which were designed by Dassa/Richardi Architects, a subsidary of Franklin, will have either two or three apartments. **********In accordance with a city ordinance, the third unit, which can be created from 600 square feet of space behind the garage, may only be rented to someone related to the owner. Otherwise, it can be used for storage or extra living space. **********The developers are also planning to apply for tax abatement from the city. Under a 1989 New Jersey law, municipalities with urban enterprise zones, like Jersey City, can effectively cut taxes in half for five years for the owners of newly constructed homes, thus making the project more economical. **********For its part, the city must still draw up an ordinance to take advantage of the new law. Mr. Cotter said he expects it to be completed in the next few weeks and adopted before the end of the summer. **********To reclaim the property for housing, the developers had to comply with environmental regulations, including the state's 1983 Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act, dealing with tests for toxic wastes. Mr. Smith of Van Leer said several oil tanks buried on the site have been removed, as have minimal amounts of copper, zinc and chromium. **********Providing adequate parking in so cramped a community as Jersey City was another concern. Martin Dassa, a partner at Franklin, said that the houses were pushed back 20 to 22 feet from the street, rather than the typical 5 feet. That yields enough space to park two cars on the driveway as well as build a two-car garage. The developers also agreed with the city's request to widen Lembeck Avenue, a side street, to provide additional parking. **********Franklin Park will join many other housing complexes either fully or partly completed in Jersey City in the last decade, aiding its transition from a gritty manufacturing center to a residential magnet for city dwellers. **********Among the developments are Society Hill at Jersey City, the 1,176-unit condominium community further down Danforth Avenue, and the 9,000-unit Newport project on the Hudson. Mr. Cotter said that between 2,000 and 5,000 residences will be produced in the city by 1995. **********Ground will be broken on the first 25 houses at Franklin Park, including two models, on July 10. They will contain two 1,200-square-foot apartments, each with two or three bedrooms. Mr. Dassa said there will be six traditionally styled models, with either brick or vinyl-siding exteriors, and all will have terraces and decks. **********Prices range from $279,900 to $319,000. Refinishing the space behind the garage to create a third apartment will cost about $6,000 more. **********''What we are providing here,'' said Mr. Dassa, ''are all of the amenities of suburban living in an urban setting.'' Franklin Park is one-quarter of a mile from Route 440, a retail strip, and 35 minutes by PATH train to Manhattan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/21/business/oecd-predicts-us-downturn-in-91.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1990-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 474, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "O.E.C.D.

''It has plundered Kuwait, terrorized innocent civilians, and held even diplomats hostage. Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction.'' [Transcript, page A12.]  A Carrot of Conciliation But he told reporters later that he was not pressing for the idea -raised on Friday by his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft - of another Security Council resolution that might include an explicit mention of military force. And in his speech, which was received with respectful applause, the President offered a carrot of conciliation to Iraq. **********''In the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait, I truly believe there may be opportunities,'' he said, ''for Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently, for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability, and for all the states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.'' **********An Implicit Link **********At the recent meeting in Helsinki with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush brushed off a question about Mr. Hussein's attempt to link the invasion of Kuwait with the dispute over Israel's occupation of land that Syria and Jordan lost in the 1967 Middle East war. He said the solution of the debate over a homeland for Palestinians was a matter ''separate and apart'' from the Kuwaiti invasion. **********But today, in what appeared to be a gesture to Mr. Hussein, the President implicitly linked the disputes by mentioning them in the same sentence of his speech. It could not be determined whether Mr. Bush's new emphasis on a diplomatic solution and his mention of the Arab-Israeli conflict was intended to provide the Iraqi leader with a face-saving opportunity, or, indeed, whether Washington had any reason to believe that Mr. Hussein was seeking such an opportunity. A senior Administration official said that all the President was trying to do today was ''to remind people that the diplomatic option is still our preferred option.'' **********At the same time the official said the Administration was not abandoning its policy of keeping the gulf conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict separate. The official said the Administration was simply trying to signal to the Arab world some of the diplomatic opportunities that would exist after an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. **********Administration officials said the President's speech was written before Mr. Scowcroft unveiled the idea of a new, tougher United Nations resolution on Friday. **********From the beginning of the conflict, Mr. Bush has blended the diplomatic glove with the military fist, seeming sometimes to favor one approach and then the other. **********President Francois Mitterrand of France made a similar link in a peace proposal he offered last week at the United Nations that was designed to appeal to the Iraqi President. **********Mr. Mitterrand suggested that an Iraqi promise to withdraw from Kuwait would be sufficient to start negotiations, which could also deal with the division of Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli conflict. **********On Sunday, Mr. Hussein responded by saying that he would talk to France but that he would not withdraw his forces from Kuwait. He reiterated that before negotiations could begin, all Western forces would have to withdraw from the Persian Gulf and an independent Palestinian state would have to be established. **********Speaking to reporters after his speech today, Mr. Bush said he might have offered a shift in emphasis but denied that it showed any ''flexibility'' in his attitude toward Mr. Hussein. **********Optimism for an Iraqi '180' **********He said his whirlwind round of meetings this weekend with other leaders had given him ''a little optimism'' that Mr. Hussein might ''do a 180 and get out,'' referring to a 180-degree turn. **********He said the rare united stance of nations against Iraq, combined with the economic sanctions, might persuade the mercurial Iraqi President to suddenly change his mind and let Kuwait go, just as he abruptly caved in to Iran by conceding much of what the two nations had fought over for eight years. **********Mr. Bush said he had heard from other leaders here ''rather optimistic words on two points.'' **********''One, that Saddam Hussein is beginning to understand that it is him against the world - he against the world,'' he said. ''And secondly, more optimism in various quarters that the sanctions are really beginning to bite hard.'' **********Thatcher's Comments Raised **********Asked about the comment today by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that Article 51 of the United Nations Charter gives the allies sufficient authority for military action, Mr. Bush said he agreed. But he added that the United States had been careful to seek more specific authorization for halting and boarding ships. **********''You may remember,'' he said, ''that we waited until we got a resolution before interdicting ships that more directly confirmed the right to do that.'' **********In his speech, Mr. Bush tried to assure other leaders that the American presence in the gulf is not permanent. ''We seek no advantage for ourselves,'' he said, ''nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in Saudi Arabia for one day longer than is necessary.'' **********After a 35-minute meeting with Mr. Bush this afternoon, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, echoed Mr. Bush's hopeful note. **********''We and the Administration believe that there is still a chance for a peaceful settlement,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. ''And we are ready to work together to achieve such a peaceful settlement.'' **********House Backs Gulf Policy **********WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (Special to The New York Times) - The House overwhelmingly approved a joint resolution today that supports President Bush's current policy in the Persian Gulf, but stops short of endorsing future military action against Iraq. **********Despite concern expressed by a number of lawmakers about the possibility that the United States might engage in a full-scale war with Iraq, the resolution passed by a 380-to-29 vote. **********Today was the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 that the House or the Senate had put the weight of Congress behind the American deployment in the gulf. **********The measure, which is nonbinding, now goes to the Senate for its consideration, where a similar resolution is pending.

But I think we're dominating it. We're acting together and the region is still functioning.\" **********Sitting beside Mr. Gorbachev in the Moncloa Palace in Madrid, Spain's Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, added that a solution to the gulf crisis should lead to a serious effort to deal with other pressing Middle East problems. \"And on this we also agree,\" he said. **********Mr. Gorbachev's visit here was the first ever by a top Soviet leader, and it was highlighted by the signing of 16 bilateral agreements, including one that committed Spain to opening a $1.5 billion line of credit to finance both the export of consumer and industrial products and the transfer of technology and services to the Soviet Union. **********\"Perestroika is not only of interest to the Soviet Union,\" Mr. Gonzalez said, referring to Mr. Gorbachev's program of change. \"It's also important to my country. The success of this project will largely define the stability of the future. It is in Spain's interest to invest in perestroika.\" Assistance the Primary Theme **********Spanish officials said Mr. Gonzalez would also convey Mr. Gorbachev's urgent appeal for Western economic assistance -- the dominant theme of his brief visit here -- to leaders of the 12-nation European Community who are meeting tonight and Sunday in Rome. **********Echoing remarks he made in a meeting with Spanish Congressmen on Friday, Mr. Gorbachev said today that although some people in the West felt the arrival of a new Soviet system would be accelerated by withholding economic help, he believed others recognized that credits \"would provide us with room for maneuver and make the change less painful for the population.\" **********\"We have counted on Western cooperation in our plans,\" he told reporters. \"But if the West does not help, this will brake our transition to a market economy and make us depend on our own resources. This would mean we will have to rely on our traditional command economy rather than the market.\" **********Mr. Gorbachev said Moscow recognized that it was principally responsible for bringing about change and he mentioned as evidence of this two Presidential decrees signed before he flew here on Friday. One devalued the rouble and the other opened the country to foreign investment. **********But he insisted that it was also of \"strategic interest\" to the West to collaborate. \"We're not asking for charity,\" he said. \"We're asking for credits and we will return the money.\" And then, with a laugh, he added: \"We'll keep a red list and a black list to see how different countries behave.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/30/world/in-managua-new-rulers-and-never-ending-battles.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Uhlig", "pub_date": "1990-05-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1219, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Managua, New Rulers and Never-Ending Battles", "print_headline": "In Managua, New Rulers and Never-Ending Battles", "body_text": " **********When striking Sandinista workers chained themselves inside state buildings this month and set barricades on fire, forcing the new Government to a halt, Yolanda Navarro Castro came to a bitter conclusion about her country. **********''I could see that this was never going to end,'' said Mrs. Navarro, who spent long hours getting to work each day after the strikes paralyzed Managua's bus system. ''The conflicts, the fighting, it won't ever stop.'' **********Like hundreds of thousands of other weary Nicaraguans, Mrs. Navarro, a 39-year-old food vendor, voted in national elections in February in the hope that whatever side won the balloting would mark a clear break with a decade of turmoil and civil war. **********But in dozens of recent interviews, Nicaraguans indicated that their optimism has begun to unravel as political confrontation and economic crisis continue. A month after taking office, the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro faces almost daily protests from the still-powerful Sandinista Front. The economy, despite the prospect of new American aid, has been battered by drastic currency devaluations and inflation. And deadlines for disbanding the contra army have dissolved in a game of perpetual negotiation. **********''We voted so that things would change, but nothing has changed,'' Mrs. Navarro said, watching black marketeers on the street waving stacks of devalued local currency to sell for American dollars. ''We had hope. Everyone had hope. But look what has become of it. Every day, our lives get worse.'' **********Like Mrs. Navarro, many Nicaraguans blame the Sandinista Front for their unhappiness. ''It's like a plot,'' said Eberto Tapia Tapia, a 40-year-old carpenter, referring to the Sandinistas' aggressive tactics of pressure and protest against Mrs. Chamorro's Government. ''They had it planned so that she would never be able to govern. Everyone sees what they're doing.'' **********Government Viewed as Weak **********Although Mrs. Chamorro is usually spared direct criticism, Nicaraguans on all sides are voicing deep pessimism about her Government, calling it weak and without clear direction. Sandinista supporters portray the new Government as a tool of right-wing interests while Mrs. Chamorro's own sympathizers accuse it of failing to hold the line against Sandinista demands. **********Government officials say that their compromises are in the spirit of national reconciliation and that criticisms of their performance are premature, that they need time to put their program in place. But few in the diverse ruling coalition agree on what the new program should be. **********Nicaraguans from the two political camps appear to agree on the one thing that they believe still offers hope of improvement in their lives: $300 million in American aid that was recently approved by Congress after repeated delays. **********''The last devaluations have been too hard on the people,'' said William Antonio Castano Hernandez, a 19-year-old Sandinista supporter who works as a bricklayer in Managua. ''Violeta has promised a lot of things she couldn't fulfill. Maybe if she had the money she could keep her promises.'' **********Sandinistas' New Role **********But most Nicaraguans interviewed appear to harbor little hope that even the greatest foreign windfall can overcome the effects of a political conflict that cuts across the heart of Nicaraguan society. **********Since their election loss on Feb. 25, Sandinista leaders have repeatedly stated their commitment to act as a constructive opposition in rebuilding the country. But in a remark that is now famous, former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has also declared that the Sandinistas intend to ''rule from below'' despite their defeat. **********The strength of that threat was demonstrated this month when the strike by Sandinista-led Civil Service unions forced Mrs. Chamorro's Government to grant broad concessions on wages and job guarantees. **********Sandinista leaders have sharply criticized currency devaluations and inflation under the Chamorro Government, but the Sandinistas' own record in the waning days of their rule has fed a belief that the current crisis was deliberately planned to discredit the new Government. **********A Stop to Devaluations **********Sandinista economists have insisted that no important changes were made in the Government's monetary policy between the February elections and Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration on April 25. But central bank records show that official currency devaluations, which had occurred regularly for years, virtually ceased in that period. At the same time, the amount of currency placed in circulation sharply increased, in what Mrs. Chamorro's advisers have charged was a deliberate move to cause a surge of inflation. **********In the same lame-duck period, the Sandinista-controlled National Assembly approved a series of sweeping new laws on the ground of protecting the ''conquests of the revolution.'' **********One such law, which grants permanent ownership rights to Nicaraguans who had been renting or squatting on Government property, is widely supported. But other measures, like those protecting the jobs of Sandinista bureaucrats or insuring the autonomy of university administrators, have drawn denunciations from many Nicaraguans. **********University autonomy, they note, was largely respected even under the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, but in the last decade it was revoked by the Sandinistas themselves as they extended close control over higher education. **********Strikes Are Criticized **********Nicaraguans interviewed also appeared overwhelmingly to criticize the Sandinistas' decision to press their demands against the new Government by means of strikes, a form of protest that was rarely tolerated by the Sandinistas. **********''The Sandinistas would never have allowed the kind of strikes that they're using now,'' said Rolando Montiel Castillo, an auto mechanic, who noted that the Sandinista Government had used riot policemen and tear gas to break up strikes as recently as last June. ''They're fighting for turf, not for principle. Do they think we can't remember?'' **********Sandinista leaders have made clear their determination to fight on each issue as it comes up. They accuse the Government of trying to dismantle 10 years of change and of reinstituting the right-wing policies of the Somozas. **********In the resulting atmosphere of conflict, the process of demobilizing some 10,000 contra guerrillas now inside Nicaragua had been one of the few signs of concrete progress. But it too has stalled as contra leaders have stopped handing over their weapons and have demanded new concessions from the Chamorro Government. **********In interviews, a striking number of Mrs. Chamorro's supporters said they did not believe the contras should disarm if the political situation was not stabilized. Some went even further. **********''If they tell me, I'll go to the mountains in a minute,'' a 34-year-old man said, referring to the contra army with which he fought before accepting amnesty last year. ''This can't go on.'' **********But most Nicaraguans remain clearly anxious to see the demobilization completed. And to most of those interviewed, the very suggestion of new fighting has only reinforced doubts that their country will ever find its way to lasting stability. **********''Nobody should be talking about force,'' said Ricardo Hernandez Aleman, a 46-year-old construction worker. ''That will just put us back into the same trap all over again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/03/world/el-salvador-lags-in-jesuit-inquiry.html": {"writer_name": "Lindsey Gruson", "pub_date": "1990-06-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 660, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EL SALVADOR LAGS IN JESUIT INQUIRY", "print_headline": "EL SALVADOR LAGS IN JESUIT INQUIRY", "body_text": " **********Despite President Alfredo Cristiani's vow to push the investigation of the killing of six Jesuit priests, the Supreme Court has disclosed that a central piece of evidence in the case was destroyed and that the judge took evidence from the wrong soldiers. **********Whether the judge, Ricardo A.

But several diplomats said the incident would certainly have been avoided if the Salvadoran Army had cooperated. **********''This isn't going anywhere fast,'' said a diplomat monitoring the case, which is increasingly being viewed as a test not only of the judicial system but also of the value of continuing United States support for the Government. ''It's not going anywhere slowly. It probably isn't going anywhere.'' **********In a statement, the Supreme Court said a defendant had burned a logbook that could have provided the names of co-conspirators. The court also said four cadets questioned last week on the assumption that they were on guard duty on the night of the slayings were actually on duty a month after the killings. **********Arrests Called Historic **********The Jesuits, whom many army officers regarded as the intellectual mentors of the leftist rebellion, were slain in November along with their housekeeper and her daughter. In what President Cristiani has called a ''historic'' step, a colonel and seven lower-ranking military men were arrested and charged with the killings in January. **********In disclosing the latest setback, however, the court may have linked the killings to another officer, Lieut.

At the time of the killings, Colonel Hernandez was the acting commander of the military school that was the meeting spot for the accused soldiers. **********The lieutenant in charge of the unit has testified that he received a radio call ordering him to assemble his men at the school. The lieutenant did not say who gave him the order. But at the time, Guillermo Alfredo Benavides, the commander of the base, who has been charged with ordering the killings, was at a meeting of the high command. **********''This means that the radio call was received either from Colonel Benavides while he was still at the meeting of the high command or from someone else,'' a recent United States Congressional study of the case noted. ''If someone other than Colonel Benavides made the call, who was it and why would his instruction have been obeyed?'' **********Two Other Cases Collapse **********The new setbacks in the case come after the collapse of two other prominent cases involving charges of human rights abuses by members of the military. The cases had been viewed as crucial tests of the United States effort to build an independent judiciary here, subject the military to civilian control and foster democracy. **********In the first, a judge in April dismissed for lack of evidence charges against all but 1 of the 11 defendants accused in the massacre of 10 peasants in the hamlet of San Francisco in September 1988. Few diplomats expect the remaining defendant - a major who was not at the scene but has been accused of ordering the killings - will ever be put on trial. **********In the second case, a judge has dropped for lack of evidence charges against six people accused of running a right-wing kidnapping ring, which allegedly included senior officers and close associates of a leader of the governing party.

It would also give some new power to the Federal Reserve Board. **********Would Be Defeat for Brady **********Treasury officials, who acknowledged this evening that compromise language was being discussed between the Treasury and important members of the Senate, insisted that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had not seen the final legislative language and had not agreed to the compromise. They described the negotiations as ''fluid'' and said the attempts to reach a compromise could still break down. **********Congressional aides said that senators were seeking to complete the agreement behind closed doors this evening. **********The compromise would represent a personal defeat both for Mr. Brady and for the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, Richard C. Breeden, who have lobbied hard to wrest regulatory control over stock index futures from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and give it to the S.E.C. **********It would be a victory, however, for Wendy L. Gramm, the commodities commission chairman, who in defiance of the Treasury and the White House has supported the futures industry's position that regulation of index futures should be kept at the commodities commission, on the ground that her agency, as the regulator since the early 1980's, is more capable of regulating stock index futures than the S.E.C. **********Futures Agency Strongly Backed **********Mrs. Gramm, who is up for reappointment, is one of the few agency chiefs to openly oppose the preferences of the Administration. **********The bitter dispute developed between the two commissions over the jurisdiction of index futures because both stocks and the futures, whose values are based on the level of stock indexes, like the Standard & Poor's 500, are seen as part of the same market. Many trading strategies involve both instruments, and the S.E.C. has argued that having one regulator would assure that rules were complementary and that abusive trading tactics could be efficiently investigated. **********Congressional aides said that after months of efforts by the Treasury to persuade members of the Senate that the larger, more widely experienced S.E.C. should oversee trading in stock index futures, they have now realized that the opposition from the futures industry as well as from members of Congress in the Midwest agricultural states is too strong. **********The compromise bill, which is likely to be included as an amendment to the farm bill now under consideration by the Senate, would do three things. **********First, it would give the Fed authority to set broad guidelines on margin levels for stock index futures. The Fed currently has the authority to set margin levels for trading in stocks, but futures margins are now set by the exchanges. At the same time, it would permit the futures exchanges where stock index futures are currently traded to continue to make incremental daily adjustments on index futures margins, as long as they were within the Fed's guidelines. **********New Rule for New Instruments **********Second, the legislation would keep regulation of index futures with the commodities commission. But it would permit new instruments combining elements of a futures contract and stocks to be traded on either a futures or stock exchange, and each new instrument would be regulated by the primary agency overseeing that exchange. That would give the S.E.C. a regulatory authority it does not have now. One such instrument was briefly traded on stock exchanges last year, until it was blocked by a lawsuit from the futures industry. A court ruled that the law that established the commodities commission requires that an instrument with any element of a futures contract has to be regulated by the commodities commission and traded on a futures exchange. The proposed compromise would change that law. **********Finally, the law would mandate that the S.E.C. and the commodities commission work closely to monitor market manipulation. **********Congressional aides said that the compromise was worked out after it became clear that the Treasury did not have enough votes in the Senate to transfer authority over stock index futures to the S.E.C. **********The compromise will carry a sting for Mr. Brady, who has conducted a personal campaign for the change. His view dates from the 1987 market crash, when he headed a study that concluded that the link between the stock markets and the stock index futures markets was so close that they should be considered one market and regulated by one agency. **********Controlling Abuses **********The study argued that trading in stock index futures had immediate and profound effects on the underlying stock market and that abuses of trading could best be controlled if one agency regulated both markets. Mr. Brady has said repeatedly that failure to do away with the split regulatory jurisdiction will eventually result in other wild market plunges. **********Earlier this year, the Bush Adminstration was optimistic that it could get the votes to change jurisdiction, but in recent months lobbying by the futures industry eroded crucial support. **********The compromise under review this evening was hammered out by senators on the Banking and Agriculture Committees, the two panels that have jurisdiction, respectively, over the S.E.C. and the commodities commission. The key members working on the agreement on the Banking Committee include Senators Christopher S. Bond, Republican from Missouri; John Heinz, Republican from Pennsylvania, and Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat from Connecticut, and, on the Agriculture Committee, Senators Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Richard G.

Some Yugoslavs fear the effect of the atrocities now being brought into the open. **********After Yugoslavia was invaded in April 1941 by the Germans, Italians, Hungarians and Bulgarians, the country was torn by guerrilla warfare. An estmated total of 1,700,000 Yugoslavs were killed, both in combat and in atrocities and reprisals by and against civilians. **********The fighting pitted Germans, Italians and other occupation forces, allied with a Croatian fascist movement called the Ustashi, which governed a puppet state, against the Partisans and the Serbian royalist Chetnik movement. **********The Partisans and Chetniks fought against each other as well as against the Ustashi and the foreign invaders. #45 Years of Frightened Silence The evidence of the Partisan atrocities lies in masses of human bones found at the bottom of caves in Slovenia and Croatia and statements by witnesses who, after 45 years of frightened silence, have come forward. **********''I drove a busload of wounded Croatian soldiers from Holy Spirit Hospital in Zagreb to Sosice in the last half of May 1945, after the war ended,'' said Branko Mulic, a 79-year-old ex-Partisan. **********He disclosed the site of a mass grave in a cave near Sosice, a Croatian village. ''I watched Partisan officers line them up and, one by one, bring them to the hole in the roof of the cave, shoot them in the back of the head and let their bodies fall into the pile at the bottom. The officers alternated who did the shooting so their guns would not overheat,'' Mr. Mulic said. **********Bones and Rope Bindings **********Skulls with holes at the back, bullet fragments, crutches and wrist and arm bones bound with rope are all clearly visible in the remains, said Nikola Solic, one of a team of journalists from the Zagreb newspaper Vjesnik. **********They used spelunkers' gear to descend the cave's sheer limestone walls to reach the bones, about 120 feet below the surface. The depth of the pile of bones is still unknown, he said. **********''As far as I know, they came every day for two weeks and from time to time thereafter,'' said Jela Smeciklas, 80, a woman who said that she saw people being transported to the cave in trucks while she was tilling a plot. ''I heard more screaming than shooting, and there was a lot of shooting.'' **********''I could hear the voices of men, women and children,'' she said. ''Night and day they came. We heard the screams at night.'' **********Several Killing Sites Known **********The Sosice cave is just one of several known sites where Communist Partisans settled accounts with members of the Ustasi, who themselves were responsible for mass killings of Serbs, Jews and gypsies during the war. **********But historians and witnesses say most of the Partisans' victims in 1945 were Croats, Slovenes and Serbs drafted into armies allied with the Axis occupation forces amd members of the Cetnik movement. In addition to combat personnel, nurses, nuns and children were killed. **********Since the news of the Sosice cave broke in Croatia last week, people from throughout Yugoslavia have been telephoning Vjesnik to report mass graves and massacre sites, said Silvije Tomasevic, a Vjesnik editor. **********Historians have estimated that the Partisans shot from 70,000 to 100,000 people without trial within weeks of the war's end. **********Reports by anti-Communist emigres that about 500,000 people were killed are exaggerations, said Darko Bekic, a historian in Zagreb whose father narrowly escaped one of the massacres. **********Victims Turned Back by British **********Most of the victims were people who fled or were trying to flee at the end of the war, Mr. Bekic said. They were returned by British troops from detention camps in Austria or were turned back at the border by British troops occupying southern Austria and northeastern Italy, Mr. Bekic said. **********On the basis of the limited evidence now available, the Sosice cave contains 4,000 to 5,000 victims, most of whom were wounded soldiers brought from hospitals in and around Zagreb, Mr. Bekic added. **********He discounted some reports that the cave might contain the remains of as many as 40,000 people. ''Nobody knows for sure,'' he said. ''The Government must excavate it to find out the real answer.'' **********Croatia's new Parliament announced this week that it would form a committee, including foreign experts, to investigate the cave and Croatia's overall casualties. **********While accounts of postwar Partisan atrocities have been published in the West since the war and in Slovenia for the last six months, the issue was made public in Croatia only after the disclosure of the Sosice grave last week. **********''There has been a change in the chief of police and people no longer fear repercussions,'' said Milovan Sibl, a Croatian spokesman. ''It wasn't in the interests of the old regime to expose the caves, not because of Communism, but because the victims were Croats and the Government would then no longer be able to pin the blame for the Ustasi crimes on the Croatian people as a whole.'' **********During the war, nationalist and religious enmity erupted throughout the country, driving members of virtually all the country's nationalities to commit acts of brutality. **********Yugoslavs Killed by Yugoslavs **********Most of the nation's war dead were killed by other Yugoslavs. The Ustashi championed Croatian separatism. while the Chetniks were largely in Serbia, which had dominated the new Yugoslav state during the period between the world wars. Only the Partisans tended to cut across the country's ethnic divisions. **********In the postwar era, Marshal Tito, himself half-Croatian, reorganized the country on a federal basis, in which each republic nominally exercised a wide degree of autonomy. Nevertheless, until his death, the one-party Communist Government kept most real authority in its hands. **********To underpin its legitimacy, it fostered an image of Marshal Tito and the Partisans as humane, heroic liberators of all of Yugoslavia's people from fascism and nationalism. **********''When I heard that Partisans carried out the killings, it made my head spin because it went against everything I heard in school,'' said Nikola Hranilovic, a Sosice resident who said he learned of the killings years ago but kept silent because he feared the police. **********''I always heard that the Partisans fought for our side and for our people. It never became clear to me why they did this to women and men who were forced to join the army.'' **********Both Croatian and Slovene officials and journalists have expressed concern that the disclosure of the mass graves might worsen the already-tense national relations within Yugoslavia, especially between Croats and Serbs. **********Requiem Mass Near Caves **********Today in a clearing in Kocevski Rog, in a mountain region about 45 miles south of Ljubljana, Archbishop Alojzij Sustar, President Milan Kucan of Slovenia and 30,000 Slovenes took part in a requiem Mass and reconciliation ceremony. Two nearby caves contain the remains of as many as 16,000 Slovenes and Croats. Croats conducted similar rites in Sosice. **********Some Partisan veterans have already condemned these commemorations as anti-patriotic. The press in Serbia and other Communist-ruled republics has scarcely mentioned the issue. **********''It would be the worst situation to turn this into another cycle of vengeance,'' said Hido Biscevic, Vjesnik's chief editor. ''Until now, the political system was able to hide it and now it can't be hidden anymore. But we must see that it does not lead to new instability.'' **********''Serbs and Croats will all be better off if they adopt the old Indian practice and bury the hatchet forever,'' Mr. Mulic said. ''They should realize that we are not born as Serbs and Croats, but naked.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/24/world/confrontation-gulf-us-gains-some-support-un-for-resolution-endorsing-force.html": {"writer_name": "Eric Pace", "pub_date": "1990-08-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   U.S. Gains Some Support at U.N. for a Resolution Endorsing Force", "print_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   U.S. Gains Some Support at U.N. for a Resolution Endorsing Force", "body_text": " **********American French and British representatives have agreed on the text of a Security Council resolution endorsing military action to enforce the embargo against Iraq, diplomats said today. **********The text has been sent to the Governments of the Council's five permanent members for review, the envoys said.

In May the estimated borrowing need was $30 billion to $35 billion. **********Linked to Savings Bailout **********Virtually all of the increase is attributable to the financial needs of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency created to oversee the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry. **********Even though the Treasury has not borrowed so much since the fourth quarter of 1985, when it tapped the financial markets for $63.3 billion, ''the numbers shouldn't have been much of a surprise,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''The Treasury has been borrowing at that sort of rate for the past few weeks.

Sullivan Jr. a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds.

Six-month bill rates fell by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.43 percent.

But they were captured, and in the process of repatriating them the Taiwanese authorities are accused of locking them into crowded cabins, where they suffocated before they reached the mainland. **********Chinese indignation over the incident was compounded after a Taiwanese military vessel accidentally rammed and sank a fishing boat on which 50 mainland Chinese were being repatriated. Twenty-one people died in the Aug. 13 incident, and some survivors charged that the rescue efforts were lackadaisical. **********''Facts prove that responsibility for the two incidents should be borne completely by the Taiwan authorities,'' the official New China News Agency said in a commentary published Thursday in newspapers, next to a grisly photo of corpses from the first incident. The Government of Taiwan has not given an explanation of the latest incident, but an officer in the Government Information Office said in a telephone interview on Friday that repatriation is conducted humanely. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun ordered a thorough investigation. **********According to an extensive account by the New China News Agency, the episode began July 21 when Taiwan's military police put 63 mainland Chinese into four cabins of the 57-foot boat. The police reportedly bound the hands of the mainlanders and ordered the boat's crew to seal the cabins with planks. **********''We felt extremely thirsty, and in an hour we were suffocating,'' the news agency quoted Lin Licheng, who lived through the voyage, as saying. ''To survive, we tried to break the door with our heads and hands. But it was useless.'' **********Taiwan repatriates such illegal immigrants on private fishing boats because the Taipei Government disdains formal contact with the mainland. **********While the illegal immigrants were suffocating in the cabins, the crew steered the boat back to the mainland and then apparently fled. Twenty-three occupants of one of the four cabins forced their way out and ran away without releasing others. **********The Chinese police have found 16 of the people who fled, but the authorities have said that all blame rests with Taiwan and there is no indication that those who ran away will be punished. The deaths have focused attention on the thousands of Chinese who sneak into Taiwan to find jobs as construction workers, rural laborers or prostitutes. Illegal migration has soared in the last two years, as political tensions have eased and word has spread of the wages that can be earned on Taiwan, where there is a labor shortage. **********While the Nationalist forces lost the war with the Communists in 1949 and had to flee to Taiwan, they have done far better in the cold war for the hearts and minds of mainlanders. Most Chinese speak with awe and envy of their cousins on Taiwan, and while Taiwan officials find this gratifying, they are alarmed at the consequence: enormous numbers of mainlanders are willing to pay several years' earnings to be smuggled to Taiwan to find jobs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/19/world/evolution-in-europe-emigre-from-canada-running-well-in-poland.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1990-11-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1037, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Emigre From Canada Running Well in Poland", "print_headline": "EVOLUTION IN EUROPE; Emigre From Canada Running Well in Poland", "body_text": " **********A wealthy Polish-born emigre businessman from Canada has suddenly emerged as a dark-horse candidate in the Polish presidential election campaign. **********In just a few weeks, Stanislaw Tyminski, who is 42 years old and operates a cable television system in Peru, has risen from anonymity to a strong third-place showing in the polls, and is threatening to overtake Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who now places second. The latest survey by Polish television, released Friday, shows Mr. Tyminski with 17 percent, Mr. Mazowiecki with 19 percent and Lech Walesa, the Solidarity chairman, holding the lead with 35 percent. **********Under the rules for the 25 election this coming Sunday, a runoff will be held on Dec. 9 unless one candidate tallies more than 50 percent of the votes. Polish law permits Poles living overseas to vote in the coming elections, and Mr. Tyminski is actively campaigning for the support of hundreds of thousands of expatriates in Canada and the United States. **********Political experts in Poland still do not see Mr. Tyminski as having a serious chance to win the presidency. Those same experts two weeks ago saw Mr. Tyminski as nothing more than a footnote, not a legitimate contender for second place in a two-candidate runoff. But the experts also felt that Mr. Tyminski could not defeat Mr. Walesa in a runoff.  Little About Him Is Known **********Mr. Tyminski, who holds Canadian, Peruvian and Polish citizenship, has revealed little about his background to voters here and he refused a request to detail his biography since leaving Poland 21 years ago. **********Business associates and friends recount a remarkable journey in which Mr. Tyminski founded a successful computer company in Canada, lost and made a fortune in Peru and underwent a spiritual transformation after traveling among Indian tribes in the Amazon jungle. **********His political background is similarly eclectic. Earlier this year, Mr. Tyminski was elected President of the 3,500-member Libertarian Party of Canada. The co-author of the book he published this year in Poland with his own money is Roman Samsel, a former correspondent in Mexico for the Communist Party's daily newspaper, Trybuna Ludu. Mr. Tyminski was the only presidential candidate to attend the party given in Warsaw by the Soviet Ambassador to mark the anniversary of the Russian Revolution. **********If Mr. Tyminski's background is elusive, there is no secret about his electoral appeal. His posters, plastered on the sides of Warsaw buses, are an appeal to voters put off by the prospect of a Walesa presidency and uninspired by Mr. Mazowiecki. \"Neither one nor the other: Vote Tyminski,\" they say.  Attractive to Poles **********Mr. Tyminski's self-described success in Western business -- his campaign literature says he is among the richer men in Canada -- make him attractive to Poles looking for a candidate who can rebuild the nation's shattered economy. He frequently criticizes the Government's proposed program for privitizing industry in Poland, saying it would sell assets far too cheaply and invite foreigners to take unfair advantage of low wages in Poland. **********\"He's very appealing to people who would like to live in a rational world,\" said Jadwiga Staniszkis, a sociologist who supports Mr. Walesa. \"Walesa is really rather unpredictable. When Tyminski speaks, he sounds terrible, but his campaign has been brilliant, his documents and television are brilliant. He is a very mysterious man.\" **********His style of campaigning has created a stir. Mr. Tyminski, who speaks Polish with a slight foreign accent, travels around the country in a helicopter. On Saturday, he told an election rally that he would soon release documents proving that Mr. Mazowiecki was guilty of unspecified \"treason,\" and he accused the Government of falsifying its econmic statistics. **********The Government issued a denial. **********According to his campaign literature and book, Mr. Tyminski was born in 1948 and went to Sweden in 1969 because he saw no opportunities in Poland. Neighbors in the small Warsaw suburb where grew up recall that he had a talent for repairing radios. After a brief stay in Sweden, he emigrated to Canada.  Founded Computer Company **********Maciej Bebenek, who works on the presidential campaign, said that after arriving in Canada, Mr. Tyminski studied computer science and took a job at Hewlett-Packard. In 1975, he founded a company called Transduction that found a niche designing computer systems for factories and power plants. Today, Mr. Bebenek said the company has between 10 and 15 full-time employees. **********Frank Ollie, Mr. Tyminski's partner in Transduction, would not disclose the company's sales but said published reports that put the amount between $5 and $10 million were not inaccurate. Mr. Ollie said the company did so well in the late 1970's that Mr. Tyminski \"felt somewhat guilty about all the money he was making\" and began contributing to an orphanage in Peru. In the early 1980's, Mr. Tyminski took a vacation in Peru to get a first-hand look at the orphanage. **********Mr. Ollie said Mr. Tyminski saw a business opportunity and built a large barge to carry fuel to Iquitos, a city in the upper Amazon. **********\"He was a bit naive about all the goings on in this part of the world, with the drug dealings and so on, and had his boat taken over by the Army, which considered it an excellent gunboat,\" Mr. Ollie said. This cost Mr. Tyminski between $800,000 and $1 million in losses and prompted him to journey into the jungle with the local tribes, Mr. Ollie said.  Described Travels in Book **********\"Stan got very close to the people and many of their mystic ways,\" Mr. Ollie said. \"I think Shirley MacLaine talks about these things. Stan was there long before that and participated in all that.\" **********Later, Mr. Tyminski returned to Iquitos and founded a cable television company called TVS which, Mr. Ollie said, \"put him back on the road to personal prosperity. **********He returned to Canada in 1985 and made it a point to employ Poles at a home, a factory and a farm he had in Canada, Mr. Ollie said. Mr. Tyminski was said by several associates to have decided to enter the race after discovering that his book was being quoted by Polish candidates, including Mr. Walesa.

''They threatened to call a van and take away our fax and our word processors.'' **********Such scenes may soon be a thing of the past as Brazil, the world's sixth largest computer market, drops tariffs and liberalizes its economy. To make Brazilian industry more competitive and to fight inflation by making goods less expensive, the new Government of President Fernando Collor de Mello plans to do away with protectionist legislation gradually. **********Booming PC Market **********During the 1980's, such laws hindered joint ventures with foreign computer manufacturers, tightly restricted imports and made this booming personal computer market the largest in the third world and the lucrative preserve of domestic manufacturers. **********''We are effectively very backward because of this senseless nationalism,'' Zelia Cardoso de Mello, the Economy Minister, said Tuesday about Brazil's computer restrictions. ''We will be more pragmatic in this area, more open to foreign capital, to imports and to joint ventures. **********''The computer problem effectively blocked Brazilian industry from modernizing,'' Miss Cardoso told Brazilian reporters last week. ''It does not make any sense to retain this cyst, which is the computer market reserve.'' **********Next month, the Government is to send Congress a bill to phase out gradually the controls on imports and on joint ventures. But the domestic computer industry, which employs 60,000 people, is expected to ally with nationalist lawmakers to fight the opening of the market. **********''We are opening in exchange for nothing,'' Fernando Gasparian, a Sao Paulo deputy, said Thursday. ''An opening could kill our computer industry.'' **********To date, the only concrete step by the Goverment occurred two weeks ago, when it removed a $960 million limit on 1990 computer imports. Last year, the 31 multinational computer companies here had revenues including imports of $1.5 billion. In contrast, Brazil's 324 domestic computer industry companies had revenues last year of $3.6 billion. **********The law cost Brazilian consumers about $600 million a year because of higher domestic manufacturing costs, said Jose Goldemberg, Secretary of Science and Technology. **********Lag in Competitiveness **********The new Government, which took power on March 15, has also been spurred by studies that indicate that during the 1980's, Brazil's industry lagged behind many major nations of the third world in terms of competitiveness. **********In the late 1980's, computer controls became the single largest trade dispute between Brazil and the United States. After investigating Brazil's Informatics Law for ''unfair trade practices,'' the Reagan Administration imposed punitive tariffs on a series of Brazilian exports in 1987. **********The tariffs were lifted last week after Robert A. Mosbacher, the United States Commerce Secretary, visited here. Mr. Mosbacher praised Brazil's ''ambitious program of open markets.'' **********The mood these days is a far cry from that of 1984, when Brazil's Congress overwhelmingly voted to reserve the market for micro- and minicomputers for national manufacturers for eight years. Sovereignty and national security were the bywords of an odd, if effective, alliance forged among the military, left-wing nationalists and businesses seeking protection from international competition. **********In 1986, Jose Sarney, then the President, declared computer restrictions ''fundamental for our survival as a sovereign nation.'' **********In this nationalist environment, the computer police - actually treasury agents - started zealously enforcing restrictions. **********Last year, police seized 20 Apple and Macintosh computers from classrooms at the American School in Brasilia. In May, Federal police conducting an anti-hijacking search of passengers on the Rio-Sao Paulo air shuttle detained one man carrying a Japanese laptop. Last week, Federal police near Brazil's border with Argentina seized a van loaded with fax machines, computers, computer parts and televisions. **********Incentives to Smuggle **********The incentive to smuggle is great. In the United States, a facsimile machine can be bought for $600; its Brazilian-made equivalent costs $4,000. Brazilian personal computers, often made of pirated technology, generally cost double the international prices of their foreign equivalents. **********After six years of limited access to the world computer revolution, Brazilian public opinion is increasingly skeptical about the high domestic prices and about Brazil's ability to match computer research and development going on overseas. Manoel F. Thompson Motta, vice president of the Brazilian Association for the Development of the Capital Goods Industry, complained in a speech two weeks ago about how Brazilian computers were ''excessively expensive and technologically out of date when compared to their foreign equivalents.'' **********''This factor blocks increased competitiveness of Brazilian products in the foreign market,'' Mr. Motta said. **********Relaxed Regulations **********Even without new legislation, growing complaints have forced greater flexibility from the Special Informatics Secretariat, a high court of computer affairs. In the last six months, the secretariat has allowed three American companies - the International Business Machines Corporation, the Hewlett-Packard Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation - to enter into joint ventures with Brazilian manufacturers. **********After a battle with the United States over the Microsoft Corporation's right to sell software here, a law went into effect in 1988 extending copyright protection to software. The Government is now discussing allowing foreign companies to distribute software here. **********And in modern offices where secretaries look through door peepholes to check for computer inspectors, there is growing optimism. **********''I think we are cooked on the fax, but we can keep the word processors,'' John said after the raid by the computer police.

But what did make him feel better was the unlikely interest stirred in Houston by an eight-page document he had prepared on freeing world trade in agricultural products. **********''I was surprised,'' Mr. de Zeeuw (pronounced ''duh-ZAY-ow'') said in an interview squeezed between meetings at the headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade here. ''I didn't realize the paper would be so central to the summit. The entire subject is very detailed and complicated, but they spent five or six hours discussing it.'' **********The fact that they did so, though, reflected their alarm that a bitter dispute over farming subsidies and supports is threatening to ruin four years of trade liberalization negotiations. And with the United States and the 12-nation European Community moving toward confrontation, the seven turned to the ''de Zeeuw text'' as a possible peace formula. **********Although they did not adopt the text, which calls for across-the-board reduction of farm supports, their final communique commended it ''as a means to intensify the negotiations.'' President Bush referred to Mr. de Zeeuw by name in a news conference, while Britain's Prime Minister Thatcher told Parliament that the report by ''a Dutchman called de Zeeuw'' would be the basis for future talks. **********The first real test of the suddenly famous text will come Monday in Geneva when a 96-nation Trade Negotiations Committee begins to draft final agreements on agriculture and a range of other trade issues. Without rapid progress, there are doubts whether the December deadline for completion of what is known as the Uruguay Round of GATT-sponsored trade negotiations can be met. **********Mr. de Zeeuw was made chairman of the agriculture negotiating group, because the Netherlands stands roughly midway between the free-trade stance of the United States and the more protectionist position of most Community countries. After traveling widely and listening intently, it was his job to present a compromise plan on July 2. **********Yet Mr. de Zeeuw - both as drafter and ''referee,'' as he calls himself -has now assumed still greater importance because of the disproportionate weight that agriculture carries in the trade talks as a whole. ''We all know that we can expect no real result from the Uruguay Round without an agreement on agriculture,'' he said. **********The Uruguay Round, the seventh in a series that began 30 years ago, aims to reduce trade restraints in 15 areas, ranging from textiles and tropical goods to services and intellectual property. At present, existing GATT agreements cover $1 trillion of a total annual world trade of around $3 trillion. If successful, the Uruguay Round will liberalize an additional $1 trillion worth of international sales. **********Many governments, including that of the United States, have warned that they will not accept any package that excludes agriculture. Some developing countries have also indicated that unless they obtain concessions on agriculture they will not endorse draft accords in, say, services. **********The clash between the United States and the European Community over agriculture dates back to the early 1960's, when the community -at the time, still a six-nation common market - began what became known as the Common Agricultural Policy. Justified as a way of insuring ''food security,'' it sought to protect millions of small farmers, mainly in France and West Germany, through a system of direct subsidies, import barriers and export incentives. **********The United States, which failed to have agriculture included in previous GATT rounds, complains that this policy enables European countries to keep out cheaper foreign food products at the same time they are dumping their surpluses abroad at below-market prices. As a result, the United States claims to have lost $11 billion in agricultural exports in 1989 alone. **********The United States itself plans to channel $8.5 billion in subsidies to its 2.2 million farmers this year, with other assistance hidden in Federal irrigation programs, low-interest credit and price supports. But Washington argues that the community's program of export subsidies has an immediate and disruptive impact on world trade. And it is these subsidies that it most wants reduced. **********In contrast, while Washington often bows to pressure from the American farming lobby, the European policy is defended as the ''economic cement'' binding the community together. Europeans pay dearly to shield 11 million farmers, 7.5 percent of the work force, from market forces. In 1990, $45 billion in tax revenues will be channeled through the community as subsidies, while consumers will pay $54 billion extra for food because prices are fixed above market rates. **********The debate is further complicated by bitter charges of protectionism against the United States, the European Community and Japan by the 13-nation Cairns group that represents leading agricultural exporters, including Australia, Canada, Argentina and Brazil. For them, the answer is a total liberalization of trade in farm products so that their cheaper exports can find markets. **********Mr. de Zeeuw's Targets **********In drafting his text, Mr. de Zeeuw identified four areas in which protectionism should be reduced: domestic supports, like subsidies; nontariff barriers, like quotas; export subsidies, and plant, animal and human health controls that serve to restrict trade. He did not suggest when and by how much the reductions should take place, although he asked governments to provide a list of all their farm supports by Oct. 1. **********But, to the distress of the community, Mr. de Zeeuw did express his belief that priority should be given to reducing export subsidies, which happens to be the United States' view. ''Export subsidies are the most trade-distorting measures,'' the 66-year-old agricultural economist said. ''Therefore we have to do more here than in other areas.'' **********The community, though, favors ''aggregate measures of support,'' meaning that all farm supports should be looked at as a package. And it points to a recent report by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing that total producer subsidies for each farmer were worth $8,000 in community countries and $20,000 in the United States. **********Mr. de Zeeuw brushed off the suggestion that his recognition at Houston had increased his responsibilities. ''I don't decide these things,'' he insisted. ''Governments do. I'm just a mediator; I don't count.

They said it was also important to keep the Chinese people informed about events abroad. **********Miss Chai said a ship that will soon be used for broadcasting news into China from off-shore international waters would bring great encouragement. The ship, the Goddess of Democracy, set sail from the French port of La Rochelle on March 17 with several exiled Chinese dissidents on board. **********Secret Groups Aid Dissidents **********Beijing was rebuffed this week when it asked France to outlaw A Boat For Democracy, the foundation that is financing the broadcast ship. China also formally protested the French Government's decision to allow Miss Chai and her husband into this country. Their request for asylum is under consideration. **********Miss Chai said she went into hiding immediately after the Tiananmen Square movement was crushed, staying first in Beijing and then moving to places she refused to identify. ''All this time, I had the support of lots of people,'' she said. ''People who had their own problems of family and work to worry about, but who helped and protected us with their own resources.'' **********She said secret organizations sprung up after June to help the dissidents, while those who hid her always knew her identity and assumed the risks. She said the same people helped her and Mr. Feng to leave the country, although she would not disclose how they escaped or where they first arrived. **********Speaking in Chinese through a French interpreter, Miss Chai said her worst moment was when she thought her husband had been captured. ''My friends said I had to move places, but I felt very bad,'' she said. ''I thought I would never see him again. If at that moment someone from security had found me, I would not have had the strength to react. I saw the limit of my will.'' **********'We Did Not Go Far Enough' **********After one week, she said, she learned that Mr. Feng was safe, but she did not see him again for four months. She said that occasionally she was accompanied by other fugitive students and dissidents, but that ''most of the time I was hidden alone and I had lots of time to reflect on what happened in Tiananmen Square.'' **********''Today my feeling is that I am not 100 percent satisfied with what we did,'' she said. ''We did not go far enough, take our actions far enough. For example, we were not in contact with people abroad and had little understanding of the impact we had. But I think that, after 40 years of repression, this was the most pacific and reasonable revolt imaginable.'' **********She is believed to have been in charge of protests in Tiananmen Square during the final days of the movement, but she was unable to cast much light on the continuing debate over how many people died when the army tanks and troops moved in shortly before dawn on June 4. **********''I was in the center of the square, but all around I heard shots being fired and ambulance sirens,'' she said in response to a question noting that the Chinese authorities assert no one died in the square. ''We sent out observers and some came back with blood stains on their clothes.'' **********Darkness of Tiananmen Square **********Mr. Feng said that since all lights were switched off in the square, it was difficult to know what was happening. ''Those who were in the square can only testify to what they saw around them,'' he said. ''I don't think even the army or the Communist Party know how many people died.'' **********It is now generally accepted that most of the killings in the crackdown took place not in the square but on the north side, along the Avenue of Eternal Peace, and in other parts of the city. **********Miss Chai said that she would continue the fight to emancipate China, but that first she needed time to adjust. ''I feel very disturbed,'' she said. ''Every time I close my eyes, I see nightmarish scenes that prevent me from sleeping. I feel the souls of the dead are seeking my help. I need time to recover.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/25/business/executive-changes-799790.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVE CHANGES", "body_text": " *********** Audits and Surveys Inc., New York, a marketing research company, promoted William Liebman to senior vice president and senior administrative officer, and Anthony Timiraos to senior vice president for finance, chief financial officer and head of the company's legal matters. *********** First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C., a financial holding company, named John R.

About 11,000 schools use the weekly in the classroom, and over all the paper has nearly 434,000 readers, mostly children. **********Each issue of the broadsheet newspaper has three pages of national and world news and a fourth page with comics, jokes, contests and mail. The paper is also brimming with graphics and cartoons.   'Children Want More' **********\"I was inspired to do this after I saw children trying to understand their parents' newspapers,\" said the paper's founder and editor, Beatrice Dufourcq. \"Children want more than just television. Here they have a newspaper that arrives with their names on it. It is important that they consider the paper their own.\" **********Recent issues explained why student protests in Paris dissolved into riots, sorted through tribal divisions in Rwanda and tried to make sense of the United States budget crisis. Illustrations are lively and meticulously multiracial, reflecting Ms. Dufourcq's strong editorial stand against racial politics. **********Charging 3 francs a copy or 115 francs (about $23) a year, the paper has been profitable since 1988, and it earned about $1 million last year without a line of advertising. **********\"We start with the notion that a child is a serious reader,\" Ms. Dufourcq said in her office in this mill town in northeastern France. \"We don't want to dilute our paper with a hodgepodge of publicity.\"  Profitable Niche **********Le Journal des Enfants began after Ms. Dufourcq (pronounced doo-FOORK) gained the support of the leading daily newspaper here, L'Alsace. Its publisher, Gilbert Klein, was swayed by her insistence that there was a profitable niche for a paper that spoke to children without speaking down to them. **********He agreed to print the weekly if 6,000 subscribers could be found, and his initial investment was a few thousand dollars in desks and telephones. In exchange, the emblem of L'Alsace appeared at the top of each issue. Le Journal des Enfants has since gone national and international, with a bureau in Paris and a publishing deal with the Swiss daily L'Express. **********If the circulation of Le Journal des Enfants grows just a bit more, to around 130,000, it will surpass that of the daily that wet-nursed it. **********\"She's hard-working and hard-headed,\" Mr. Klein said of Ms. Dufourcq. \"I can't convince her to run ads, even though it would mean a bigger paper, with more color pages.\" **********Le Journal des Enfants receives 100 fan letters a day, and they are usually exultant. **********\"Everytime the paper arrives, I jump on it,\" wrote Franck Nombret, a 13-year-old from Grenoble. \"My brother and I don't read it; we eat it up. Le Journal des Enfants is super!\" **********But children are not the only ones who appreciate the short, crisp, easy-to-digest articles. **********\"We have many older readers, because they find the type size easier to read,\" said Francoise Itamard, one of the paper's seven staff members. \"And, frankly, we're a lot easier to understand than Le Monde.\" **********\"It's true,\" Ms. Dufourcq said. \"Parents often tell me that they look forward to reading us after their children are done.\"  Death Threats Are Received **********But having adult readers has pitfalls. Ms. Dufourcq has not hesitated to criticize Jean-Marie Le Pen, the French rightist who has made a rapid political career of militant anti-immigrant statements. **********This has led to death threats against Ms. Dufourcq, who writes under the pseudonym of Beatrice D'Irube. **********\"I won't hesitate to speak against the parts of French society that I don't like,\" she said. \"Maybe I'm overreacting, but for now, I'll keep the pseudonym.

So when Mr. Greenwald appeared before the board yesterday morning he was largely empty-handed and could only offer various plans to obtain cash and financing. **********UAL's stock closed at $88 a share, down $3.25, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, People at the board meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was businesslike and at times cordial, with Mr. Greenwald complimenting the board and Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman and chief executive, for the consideration they had given the bids. Mr. Greenwald would have replaced Mr. Wolf if the takeover by the pilot, machinist and flight attendant unions had succeeded. **********The board, which began deliberating yesterday at an airport hotel and then moved to the board room at UAL headquarters in a suburb of Chicago, was presented with two proposals. **********The first, with a potential total value of $205 a share, included $70 in cash, $31 in senior secured notes, and $74 in various types of trust certificates backed by airplanes. The additional $30 would have depended on the future profitability of United. On Monday, those involved in the bid had said that it would total about $160, excluding the money that depended on future profits. **********The second included no cash but was made up of $178 a share in secured notes and $25 of preferred stock, for a total of $203 a share. **********''The board did not have much to consider,'' said Edward Starkmann, an airline analyst with Paine Webber Inc., considering that there was no financing to back up the bids. **********The United Employee Acquisition Corporation, which represents the unions, said it would continue to pursue employee ownership of UAL. But the group also urged union members to return to their more traditional role of seeking new labor contracts. **********''The three unions are working under open contracts and must now also return to traditional trade union activities while continuing to pursue employee ownership,'' the group said. **********Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the pilots, said that United's pilots would seek to get increases in their contract similar to those won by pilots at Northwest, Delta and USAir. He added that the union would also seek retroactive increases to cover the two and a half years during which the pilots kept their contract open to pursue the buyout bid. **********The negotiations with the unions could be turbulent, with Mr. Wolf having become a focal point of hostility among some union leaders who believed that he was trying to undercut their takeover efforts. **********''A labor war is going to break out between the unions and Steve Wolf,'' said Joseph Blasi, a professor at the Institute of Management and Labor at Rutgers University. Mr. Blasi, a specialist on employee buyouts, has advised the unions in their takeover efforts. **********Mr. Wolf received a strong endorsement yesterday from the board in a statement by Richard P. Cooley, the chairman and chief executive of the Seafirst Corporation, and a longtime UAL director. He said one key ingredient in building United was ''an able, experienced and dedicated management team led by Steve Wolf, whom we unanimously support.'' **********To get contract talks moving, the board said it had asked the National Mediation Board, a Federal agency, to begin talks with the three unions. Bargaining in the aviation industry is governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides for certain procedures in reaching a new contract before either a management or union can take certain actions. **********Huge Order for Planes **********The board also asked the management to resume negotations with aircraft and engine makers to put together a huge new order for planes that would total about $10 billion. The board had put off completing the order to give the unions time to put their bids together. **********An unknown faced by the board is what will be done by Coniston Partners, a New York-based investment group that owns 11.8 percent of UAL's shares, which it acquired at an average of about $160 share. With the stock now at $88, Coniston faces huge losses. **********Coniston said yesterday that it was reviewing its options. One that the group had threatened to use in the past was to seek to get the board replaced by soliciting support from shareholders to vote for a new slate. **********Hefty Sum for Greenwald **********Mr. Greenwald will walk away with a hefty sum even though the effort failed. He was paid a $5 million fee by the unions for leaving Chrysler and leading the union drive. He will also collect a $4 million fee from the unions and part of what would have been his annual salary of $1.2 million. **********United's future will depend on how the unions react to their defeat. They had been willing to grant wage and work-rule concessions in return for owning United. Now they will face a Mr. Wolf who will be asking for concessions to help cope with the current grim period, with fuel prices almost doubled and traffic low. **********In the past the unions, particularly the pilots, who spearheaded the takeover drive, have displayed considerable power. They were largely responsible for the ouster of Richard J. Ferris as UAL's chairman after he was tough in negotiations and sought to blunt their drive to win control. **********''Until now, the unions' bargaining position has been pretty much predicated on ownership,'' said Robert Decker, the airline analyst at Duff & Phelps Inc. ''There will be a lot of hard feelings after the lost deal.'' **********The pilot union has said that its members are owed hundreds of millions of dollars in wage increases and that they will want raises similar to those recently granted to Delta and Northwest pilots. The pilots also have the power to cripple United's operations if there is a strike. **********Possibility of Resignation **********Some analysts have raised the possibility that Mr. Wolf could voluntarily resign. He is a wealthy man, having received millions of dollars from the buyouts of Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger Airlines, where he was also chairman and chief executive, and from his recent exercise of United stock-appreciation rights. **********''Wolf could take the funds he got in this most recent round and seek greener pastures,'' said Kevin Murphy, the airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. **********The position of the unions is that largely outside events caused their offers to collapse. One year ago the pilots could not complete the financing for a bid of $300 a share because banks and investors had become concerned about the amount of debt that huge leveraged buyouts were adding onto acquired companies. **********In the current bid of $201 a share, those involved in the negotiations said the union effort to get financing faltered when the Middle East crisis caused banks to become reluctant to commit huge amounts. Thus the drive to acquire the airline could revive when the industry enters more stable times."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/29/business/technology-molar-movies-and-other-dentists-aids.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1096, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Technology;   Molar Movies and Other Dentists' Aids", "print_headline": "Technology;   Molar Movies and Other Dentists' Aids", "body_text": " **********Lights, camera, open wide! The ongoing miniaturization of video technology is bringing tiny cameras into the dentist's office and right into a patient's mouth. **********It's all part of the new world of dentistry, in which the general public's oral hygiene has improved, leaving dentists to spend less time filling cavities and derive an ever greater percentage of their incomes from elective and cosmetic work. **********No bigger than a dentist's mirror, an intraoral video camera sends a high-resolution image to a standard color monitor screen, where it can be viewed by the dentist and patient simultaneously. Primarily intended - and used, so far - as a patient education and awareness tool, intraoral cameras are also beginning to find a place in operations, such as root canals. Dentists say the magnified image makes their job easier. **********Fuji Optical Systems Inc., a Los Gatos, Calif.-based subsidiary of the Fuji Photo Optical Company Ltd. of Japan, introduced the first such system about three years ago and remains the market leader. Also in the field are DentSply International Inc. of York, Pa., and Lester A. Dine of Farmingdale, N.Y. **********Fuji's DentaCam, similar in shape and size to a dentist's mirror, contains a light source to enable visualization of any part of the mouth. The highly magnified image is displayed on a monitor or color television screen. **********Using video processing technology Fuji developed for broadcast cameras, the DentaCam's two fiberoptic light guides strobe a sequence of red, green and blue light across the viewed surface. When the sequential images are combined in the monitor, they provide higher resolution and better color fidelity than images produced by a single full-spectrum light source, according to Fuji. **********A wide-angle lens mounted in the instrument's tip allows it to focus as close as 5 millimeters from a tooth, and a built-in air jet prevents fogging and keeps debris from collecting on the lens. Using foot pedals, the dentist can freeze the display on any view, and can record any image on video floppy disks or print out an instant picture on a video printer. The system also maintains a database of patients' records and images. **********Although sales have been relatively slow so far, the Fuji device and its competitors are beginning to find broader acceptance. **********''I was very skeptical initially because it seemed like just another expensive gadget, but as I used it I became more and more impressed,'' said Gordon J. Christiansen, a Provo, Utah, dentist who is senior consultant to Clinical Research Associates, which reviews and rates dental equipment. **********Dr. Christiansen said he sees intraoral cameras' main benefit as providing better information to patients, which would increase their acceptance of treatment plans. But, he added, after becoming accustomed to using the DentaCam, ''I am at the point where I can actually operate on the screen.'' With its built-in light, the camera can provide better views of rear molars and other difficult areas than a mirror can. **********Others see the new technology more as a sales aid than a diagnostic or educational tool. ''Anytime you can show a patient they have a problem, they say, 'O.K., fix it.' '' said Tom Jow, a San Francisco dentist who has investigated the cameras but does not use them. ''Just another way to get a sales pitch in there.'' **********In any case, at $35,000 for the complete system, DentaCam is out of reach for most dentists, Dr. Christiansen said. What's needed to develop a broader market is a lower-priced camera with similar capability. **********And a much lower-priced camera is just what Michael Williams, president and founder of the AcuImage Corporation in San Carlos, Calif., plans to offer beginning next month. Rather than borrowing from broadcast technology, Mr. Williams has used parts normally found inside the small camcorders popular with home video enthusiasts. ''I'm taking consumer electronics technology and making a medical device out of that,'' he said. Price: about $12,000 for a system. **********Using a color-processing chip developed by Toshiba for camcorders, AcuImage's AcuCam can operate with natural light, as opposed to the red-green-blue light used by Fuji and others. It can also be attached to the halogen light sources and fiberoptic cables used for dentists' drills. Mounting the lens directly on the processing chip reduces the device's complexity and cost, and AcuImage will offer snap-on mirrors and other attachments. **********Mr. Williams explained why price is a bigger factor for dentists than for other medical professionals. **********''Dentists have to buy their own technology, unlike a heart surgeon affiliated with a major hospital,'' he said. ''This is the perfect time to go into the market with a lower-priced camera because Fuji has spent the money to develop it.'' **********AcuImage is billing its camera primarily as an educational device and a sales tool. **********''When a patient's stained front teeth are magnified 18 times and displayed on a bright color screen,'' said Ronald Asti, a San Carlos dentist and co-founder of AcuImage,'' ''it is easier to sell bonding operations, which cover the tooth surface with hard enamel.'' **********An even more advanced technology, oral radio visiography, combines X-rays with video technology. In this technology, a small electronic sensor replaces paper-lined X-ray film. **********Some dentists believe oral radio visiography will be a more important development for serious diagnostic and therapeutic work than the dental video cameras. Like a conventional X-ray, radio visiography can show the interiors of teeth, but it does so instantly, without film, development time or chemicals. And because it requires only 20 percent of the radiation of conventional X-rays, patients and technicians suffer less exposure. **********Trophy U.S.A. Inc., the Atlanta-based subsdiary of the French manufacter Trophy, received Food and Drug Administration approval for the device at the first of the year, and has sold 12 systems since. Depending on configuration, complete systems, including video monitor and printer, sell for $20,000 to $27,000. **********One early user is Michael J. Melde of the Valley Dental Group in Phoenix. He uses the system during root canal operations, but said he finds it primarily aids in diagnosis and in communication with patients. ''If I do see a problem, I can enlarge it on the screen and they're right in there diagnosing with me,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/30/business/forum-why-schools-belong-in-offices.html": {"writer_name": "Victoria Dodd", "pub_date": "1990-09-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 505, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Why Schools Belong in Offices", "print_headline": "FORUM;   Why Schools Belong in Offices", "body_text": " **********The preliminary census results remind us once again that America is not an agrarian society. Probably less than a quarter of the population lives in rural areas, and even fewer toil in the amber fields of grain. Why is it, then, that the American educational system continues to be based on an agricultural model? A respite during the summer and short school days made sense when children were needed at home during harvest and chore times, but currently it is competitiveness that counts, not cows. **********As is well known, the Japanese spend many more hours per year in school than our students. Perhaps less appreciated is that the West German school year is also two months longer than ours. The American educational clock should be switched to the industrial mode: year-round activity, approximately eight hours per day. **********With 65 percent of all mothers working outside the home, it's logical to place schools in or very near the workplace. The purposes behind ''neighborhood schools'' cannot be fulfilled if there is no one at home in the neighborhood. **********Although it may seem odd to suggest putting our schools on a work place schedule and calendar, locating them by our places of work would address some of our most pressing social concerns. **********Recent educational reports, for instance, bemoan the lack of parental involvement in a child's learning and in school activities. Work place schools would enable parents to attend parent-teacher meetings and after-school events and even to eat lunch with their children. Commuting could be done together. **********Placing schools in working areas would also be an efficient use of resources. The current glut of downtown office space throughout the country is a convenient match with educational needs, particularly because the present baby boomlet reaching school age may be too transitory to justify building traditional schools. **********As for funding, businesses might be willing to lease space at advantageous rates or even donate space for limited, experimental periods. True, a workplace school system would spell the demise of the local property-tax funding mechanism, but other notable trends - such as constitutional challenges to this system in at least 12 states point toward state-based funding for schools. **********There are a handful of American companies that have established such schools, both public and private, but such efforts are not well-publicized nor applauded as a trend. The dismantling of American family life may date from the Industrial Revolution, when the work place and the home became separate. Better to see if bringing education into the workplace will restore an aspect of unity to life than to leave education stuck on ''Old McDonald's Farm.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/04/world/france-stops-issuing-lebanese-visas-citing-army-blockade.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 408, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "France Stops Issuing Lebanese Visas, Citing Army Blockade", "print_headline": "France Stops Issuing Lebanese Visas, Citing Army Blockade", "body_text": " **********France stopped issuing visas to Lebanese today, apparently because of President Elias Hrawi's refusal to lift a blockade intended to end the rebellion by Gen.

The Syrian-backed Mr. Hrawi was elected President on Nov. 24 with a mandate to enforce an Arab League-brokered plan to end the 15-year-old civil war between Muslims and Christians. **********Mr. Hrawi's mainly Muslim 20,000-man army last week closed all crossings and prevented essential supplies from reaching areas controlled by General Aoun in an effort to pressure the general into submission. **********On Monday night thousands of General Aoun's supporters demonstrated to protest the blockade. The rally was raked by gunfire, and police said at least 30 people were killed and 100 wounded. **********Aoun Blames Militia **********General Aoun blamed the massacre on the Christian warlord Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, which shares control of the area near the bridge with Mr. Hrawi's soldiers. **********Mr. Hrawi's Government said its troops did not fire on the demonstrators. Mr. Geagea accused General Aoun of engineering the killings to win sympathy. **********Earlier this year, General Aoun and Mr. Geagea fought a four-month war for control of the 300-square-mile Christian area in central Lebanon. The confrontation, which took more than 1,000 lives, left the area partitioned. Mr. Geagea's 6,000-strong militia hold about 80 percent of the region."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/01/business/insider-charges-are-settled.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Insider Charges Are Settled", "print_headline": "Insider Charges Are Settled", "body_text": " **********The former chairman of Modulaire Industries and the wife of Modulaire's former president settled Federal charges today that they had violated the anti-fraud provisions of Federal securities laws by tipping off friends about a pending merger between the company and Waste Management Inc. in the spring of 1987. **********In a civil complaint filed in Federal court in San Francisco, the Securities and Exchange Commission contended that Waste Management officials met repeatedly with Joseph Behar, Modulaire's co-founder and chairman, and David Wailes, Modulaire's co-founder and president, in April and May 1987 to discuss a possible acquisition. **********Modulaire, based in San Francisco, sells, rents and services nonresidential modular structures.

[Excerpts from the two speeches appear on page A12.]  Despite Mrs. Chamorro's victory, and President Ortega's seeming acquiescence in defeat, there remains skepticism that Mr. Ortega, a lifelong revolutionary and politician, will be able to persuade the Sandinista Front to accept a Chamorro government. Mrs. Chamorro is scheduled to be inaugurated on April 25. **********The vote lays the groundwork for the first democratic transfer of power that this country has known, a turnover that parallels to some degree the changes in Eastern Europe, where Communism has little by little given way to democratic change. **********Lead of 14 Percentage Points **********Mrs. Chamorro, 60 years old, is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, the newspaper publisher whose assassination touched off the rebellion that led to the Sandinista takeover. She ran as the candidate of the 14-party National Opposition Union, a coalition of leftists, rightists and other Nicaraguan parties. **********The official voting results, supervised by a large contingent of international observers, including former President Jimmy Carter, gave Mrs. Chamorro a lead of 14.4 percentage points. Her vote total with 82 percent of the ballots counted was put at 633,357, or 55.2 percent of the presidential vote. Mr. Ortega of the Sandinista National Liberation Front received 468,040 votes, or 40.8 percent of the total. **********Small parties received the rest of the votes as Nicaraguans elected a President, Vice President and National Assembly, which the opposition will now control. **********Across the country, beginning in the early morning, there was the almost surreal sensation of imminent change. Nicaraguans shared a widespread sense of awe at the power of their own votes, and disbelief that something so pervasive and apparently entrenched as the Sandinista Front had suddenly been swept aside. A huge rally planned near Sandinista headquarters slowly dissolved into a mournful gathering, while opposition loyalists whooped it up at the restaurant that has become their staging ground. **********The Chamorro victory has stunned many political analysts, and American officials also appeared to be caught off guard by the depth of the Sandinista defeat. Polls by outside groups consistently suggested that the Sandinistas would sweep to victory, and just last week the Government mounted a rally of at least 300,000 people, dwarfing similar opposition demonstrations. **********But reporters and other outsiders who spent hours interviewing average citizens in working-class neighborhoods became convinced that the polls were misleading. Their view was that the electorate of about 1.7 million in this country of 3.5 million was articulating support for Mr. Ortega while secretly looking to oust the Sandinistas after a decade of civil war and economic ruin. **********In recent days the White House softened its line toward the Sandinistas, suggesting that after an expected Ortega victory, Washington would try to mend relations with the Government, against which it has waged a civil war by proxy for about eight years. Today, President Bush exulted in the opposition's victory. **********Threats to Orderly Transition **********But an orderly transition is far from certain. In recent weeks, Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who controls the secret police and is considered one of the most rigid members of the nine-member Sandinista National Directorate, has repeatedly suggested that the election of Mrs. Chamorro would make Nicaragua ''ungovernable.'' **********Tonight, truckloads of Interior Ministry riot troops clashed with crowds of youthful opposition supporters in Managua. Using tear gas and truncheons, the police repeatedly charged at the youths, who responded by throwing sticks and pavement stones and taunting the officers. **********In the ranks of the Sandinista People's Army, which is headed by Mr. Ortega's brother, Humberto, and in the Interior Ministry, virtually all officers and most enlisted men are subject to Sandinista political training. And Mr. Borge has pointedly said that attempts to change the current leadership would be met by insubordination and even violence from Sandinista forces. **********The military is particularly suspicious of members of the opposition coalition who have longstanding ties to the United States-armed contra rebels. The civil war has killed 30,000 Nicaraguans since it began in the early 1980's. **********''Given the existence of revolutionary armed forces,'' the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada said, describing Mr. Borge's views, ''how could the officers obey the wild orders of those who were named Minister of Defense and Minister of the Interior?'' **********No Comment From Borge **********Aides to President Ortega said he was speaking for all Sandinista party members and officials, including Mr. Borge, in his promise to respect the election results. But Mr. Borge did not appear at the gathering, and he has made no public comment on the defeat of the Sandinista Front, of which he is the last surviving founder. **********The election results appeared certain to produce a dramatic improvement in deeply strained relations between Nicaragua and the Bush Administration, which gave political and financial support to Mrs. Chamorro's candidacy. They were seen as a virtual guarantee of an end to the American-sponsored insurgency. And they promised to deal a powerful blow to American adversaries like the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, and to the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador, both longtime allies of the Sandinista Government. **********Mr. Ortega, who said in an interview on Friday that Mrs. Chamorro did not have ''even a hypothetical possibility'' of victory, compared his party's defeat to the bitterest moments of the Sandinistas' long guerrilla war to overthrow the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. He said the party would accept without malice the prospect of leaving power. **********''We were born poor and are satisfied to die poor,'' said Mr. Ortega, who remained composed as he spoke to journalists and cheering supporters at a large, modern Government convention hall here. ''We worked in these elections to emphasize a project which has become a challenge to the intelligence, the imagination, the creativity of the people in their permanent struggle for their liberation.'' **********The Associated Press reported tonight that Mr. Ortega briefly visited Mrs. Chamorro at her home to offer his congratulations. Accompanied by several foreign observers, including Mr. Carter, he hugged the victorious candidate, who spoke to him affectionately. **********Mr. Ortega reportedly said, ''You know that I respect you, and that I love you and congratulate you on your victory,'' adding, ''I am ready to contribute to the national reconciliation.'' **********Effort to Reassure Military **********Seeking to allay fears of possible retribution or wholesale dismissals from the military and security forces, Mrs. Chamorro and her advisers have repeatedly emphasized that they will remove only high-ranking Sandinista officers, and will not take abrupt or arbitrary action against soldiers or other social or political groups. **********''This is an election that will never have exiles, or political prisoners, or confiscations,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in her acceptance statement. ''Here we have neither victors nor vanquished.'' **********There was no immediate word on how such a policy might be received by the estimated 10,000 remaining members of the contra army. Nor was there a clear sense of how contra fighters who return to the country under an expected total amnesty would be received by former Sandinista military units, or integrated into those units. **********But both issues promised to add to the burdens of the diverse and frequently divided opposition leadership, which has never shown the success at internal politics that it showed in Sunday's balloting. **********Results Were Delayed **********Although election results were promised to reporters and international observers beginning just two hours after the 6 P.M. close of voting, initial returns were abruptly discontinued at mid-evening on Sunday. Official radio stations stopped broadcasting news reports, playing only a stream of music. **********Questioned by reporters, election officials attributed the problem to slow receipt of information from outlying districts and inexperienced computer technicians at the large convention center, where hundreds of special phone and telex lines were installed to process the election results. **********Several diplomats suggested that the counting had been stopped to give international officials time to persuade Mr. Ortega and other Sandinista leaders to accept the vote. But that version of events was denied by Mr. Carter, who said the announcement was held up by a previous agreement among the political parties not to release incomplete results. So far, independent election observers have reported few if any irregularities, and appear ready to judge the voting fair. **********At the barn-like Managua restaurant that has served as an opposition meeting place during the campaign, hundreds of cheering, dancing, crying opposition supporters arrived to celebrate Mrs. Chamorro's victory, yelling loud chants and signaling ''No. 1'' with their fingers. The coalition's acronym, UNO, means ''one'' in Spanish. **********Across town at a large fairground that had been reserved for a Sandinista victory celebration, crowds began appearing before the scheduled start of the midnight rally. In place were giant sound systems, spotlights and the other equipment that has become a standard feature of mass Sandinista rallies. **********But as the news of Mr. Ortega's defeat filtered through the crowd, preparations for dancing and drinking gave way to silence and ashen faces. **********In the working class neighborhood of Batahola North, 25-year-old Lorena Sanchez Barrios sat with her child and wept openly as she listened to Mr. Ortega's speech accepting the results. **********''I can't believe it,'' she said, expressing an emotion shared by supporters of the Sandinistas and the opposition alike. ''I just can't believe it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/13/business/business-people-door-revolves-again-at-top-of-winnebago.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1990-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 473, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Door Revolves Again At Top of Winnebago", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Door Revolves Again At Top of Winnebago", "body_text": " **********The revolving door at Winnebago Industries turned again yesterday, and out went Richard D.

While the police stood by, protesters broke into the offices of the Liberal Party, forcing its leaders to flee, and pasted pro-council slogans in the second-story windows. **********The president of the Peasants Party, Corneliu Coposu, left the headquarters building in an armored personnel carrier, together with the council-appointed Prime Minister, Petre Roman, in an effort to guarantee his safety against the crowd of several thousand. **********The chanting demonstrators demanded that Mr. Coposu be driven from the country; he agreed to leave to make a statement on television, but none was broadcast. **********Small groups continued to gather on the city's dimly lit streets into the evening.

''They have put themselves in the absurd position of holding all the levers of power, and they want to run in the election,'' he said. Mr. Coposu said he had proposed a broader coalition that would include representatives of the three main opposition parties, the Peasants' Party, the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party. **********The council's counter-offer was to expand itself to include all registered parties, which now number about 18. Mr. Coposu said this was unacceptable because all but four or five parties were ''phantom organizations, invented as diversions.'' **********Mr. Brucan said today that the council would refuse to limit participation in the roundtable talks. ''We will never again meet with just those three parties, never,'' he said. ''We have had it with them up to here.'' **********The latest round of demonstrations, which took on a more threatening tone, reminded many Rumanians of the Communist era, when local party organizations dispatched crowds to drown out dissident voices. **********Workers Replace Students **********The demonstrations today and Sunday seemed to split along class as well as political lines. Whereas the demonstrators on Sunday were mostly young students and professionals, today's protesters were mostly factory workers who came and left the city in large Government-owned trucks. **********One political division is between those who see the revolution as a revolt against 24 years of Ceausescu rule and those who see it as a rejection of Communism. **********At a rally of the pro-council demonstrators today at Victory Place, the Rumanian President, Ion Iliescu, repeatedly said the revolution was still not over.

For most of history, the emperor has held little power, and since the end of World War II he has been defined as a mere \"symbol\" of the state. **********But the daijosai -- last performed by Hirohito in 1928 -- was an extraordinary moment in Japanese cultural history, for the first time transporting the ancient origins of the world's oldest monarchic dynasty into the glare of modern publicity.  Criticism of Government **********Before the ceremony, the top Government spokesman dismissed criticism that the attendance at the Shinto rite by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and his Cabinet violated the separation of religion and government as provided in the Constitution. **********\"This does not mean that politics is meddling in religion, or that religion is increasing its influence in politics,\" said Misoji Sakamoto, the chief Cabinet secretary. **********Indeed, the daijosai came two days after the Cabinet approved what it said was the Government's view that the ceremony was not -- as maintained by many Christian and Buddhist leaders and constitutional scholars -- a Shinto religious rite that traditionally rendered the emperor into a deity. **********The issue is a sensitive one because a handful of militant nationalists still espouse emperor worship, the credo used to justify Japanese military aggression in World War II. The polls show that only about five percent of Japanese believe in the divinity of the Emperor. 'Special Conditions' Cited **********Acknowledging that pre-war Japanese textbooks stated that the Emperor was united with the spirit of the sun goddess in the rite, the Cabinet said in a statement, \"We consider the text as written that way because of the special conditions of the time.\" **********Scholars say that the daijosai, which has its origins in harvest festivals, has been conducted in one form or another since prehistoric times, although it was suspended for more than two centuries before Japanese reunification in the 17th century, and that much of the meaning of its traditions was lost. **********After a ritual bath, the Emperor, wearing white silk robes symbolizing purification, marched solemnly surrounded by courtiers. **********After his entrance, the Emperor went out of public view and, inside two shrines, offered food and rice wine to the spirit of his mythical ancestor, the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami. He then consumed some of it himself while praying for the well-being of the nation and for peace on earth. **********He carried out this ceremony twice, first in one specially built shrine of rough-hewn pine logs and grass mats from 6:30 P.M. to 9:30 P.M. Thursday, and then in another from 12:30 to 3:30 A.M. this morning.  Spectators See Little **********The ceremony ended at 3:33 A.M. By then the near-freezing weather had persuaded almost a third of the spectators in a separate open building, who could only see glimmerings of the ceremony in the dark, to leave. **********By contrast to the more formal enthronement ceremonies last week, no statements were made and no foreigners were allowed at the rites today, and 980 Japanese dignitaries led by Mr. Kaifu were kept in a separate room. **********The Government has also drawn criticism because it budgeted about $20 million for the ceremony, insisting that it is primarily secular. **********On Monday, representatives of 14 Christian denominations, including the Catholic and Episcopal Churches, presented a petition from 130,000 people opposing the Government's transformation of \"a ceremony of one specific religious sect into a state function with the use of public funds.\" **********The Socialist and Communist Parties boycotted the ceremony today, charging that it violated the constitutional ban on state support of religion.  'Public Is Very Interested' **********But Mr. Sakamoto, the chief Cabinet secretary, said it was legitimate for public funds to be used to pay for the rites. \"The public is very interested in the ceremony, so it is natural to pay for them with public funds,\" he said. **********Christians make up less than one percent of the Japanese population, but polls show that as many as a third of Japanese are opposed to the $20 million public expenditure for the daijosai. **********Left-wing opponents of the rite have firebombed several Shinto shrines in protest, causing heavy damage. **********Meanwhile, the daijosai has been the focus of intense news coverage. Many articles, for instance, have put forth various theories of scholars about the function of a matted bed and coverlet in the inner sanctum. Some experts have suggested that the Emperor lies on the bed and transforms himself into a god or in some fashion communes, perhaps in a symbolically sexual way, with the spirit of the sun goddess. **********In response to these theories, the ritualists of the Imperial Household Agency have said that the bed is used as a resting place for the sun goddess but that the Emperor never touches it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/business/withholding-cut-in-belgium.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Withholding Cut in Belgium", "print_headline": "Withholding Cut in Belgium", "body_text": " **********In an attempt to stem a flight of capital, the Belgian Government approved plans today to reduce its rate of withholding tax on investors' interest income. **********The Finance Minister, Philippe Maystadt, said that if legislators passed the measure, the tax would be cut on March 1 to 10 percent, from 25 percent, for interest revenues from new fixed-rate securities and bank accounts. **********Mr. Maystadt blamed the 25 percent rate for an increase in the flow of capital from Belgium, to some $3.6 billion last year, mainly to Luxembourg, West Germany and the Netherlands, which have no such tax. **********He said a shortfall in tax revenues because of the cut would be recouped by limiting certain business tax breaks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-ameritech-consolidates.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1990-02-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 116, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Ameritech Consolidates", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   Ameritech Consolidates", "body_text": " **********Ameritech, the Chicago-based parent company of five Bell telephone companies and of other information technology companies, announced that it was consolidating $30 million to $35 million in spot broadcast media buying with Bayer Bess Vanderwarker in Chicago, which handles Ameritech's corporate advertising.

''But they come here and to the rest of China because they want to know if it has changed in the last 40 years.'' **********A Long Separation Ends **********Taiwan allowed its citizens to come here only in late 1987, breaking a forced separation lasting nearly 40 years after the Nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan on their defeat in the Chinese civil war. **********Now its citizens travel here in large groups and fill the seats in Chinese planes and tour buses. They are far more noticeable now than last year, partly because their numbers are increasing at the same time those of other foreign tourists have dropped. **********Chinese tourist officials welcome the influx from across the Taiwan Straits as a way to help compensate for the losses suffered after the military crackdown on the democracy movement last June nearly caused the tourism industry to collapse. **********Asked about their occupancy rates recently, major hotels in Guilin, Shanghai and Xian said they were higher than last year, but still only 27 percent to 45 percent. It is the Taiwan visitors who are causing the statistics to rise throughout the country. **********''There's no question that without the Taiwan groups we would be in a terrible situation,'' said Paul Hung, business manager at the Sheraton Guilin Hotel. The hotel has seen its occupancy rate climb from an average of 26 percent in January to 66 percent in March, with hardly any Americans. **********Special Routes Added **********China's main tourist organization, the China Travel Service, says 540,000 Taiwan citizens, or 2.7 percent of the island's population, came to China in tour groups last year, 90,000 more than in 1988. The numbers do not include Taiwan business executives and individual travelers. Other foreign tourists, mostly Western, numbered 1.5 million last year, down 300,000 from 1988. **********Tourist officials estimate that at least 200,000 more Taiwan visitors will come to China this year, partly because of a marketing effort by hotels and Chinese tour agencies, who have added special routes through China for Taiwan tourists. **********The phenomenon is influencing the habits of local communities. Although tour guides find it easier to speak their mother tongue, many stuttered a bit with their first few Taiwan groups because they had memorized most of the legends and histories of the tourist sites in English and had to translate them back to Chinese. **********Taiwan Money Accepted **********Hotels have also had to adjust. The Holiday Inn Guilin, a joint venture hotel, exchanges the New Taiwan dollar for local foreign exchange certificates and street vendors accept Taiwan money. **********Vendors in Guilin used to blanket the roadsides, selling silk embroidered tableclothes and T-shirts to Western tourists. Now those goods have been stashed away to make room for Chinese herbal remedies, preserved fruits and traditional silk pillows - Taiwanese favorites. **********Many hotels offered Taiwan tour agencies rates as low as half those offered to individual travelers, and the Government gave discounts, too. In Xian, hotel managers report that the authorities issued circulars stipulating discounts for Taiwan groups, including a full-course Chinese breakfast for the equivalent of $2.50 and lunch and dinner for $5 each. The Guilin Tourism Bureau says Taiwan travelers receive a discount of up to 15 percent on tour arrangements. **********Not all hotel managers are entirely happy with the new business. Their new clients have different habits from previous customers, sometimes altering the atmosphere of the hotel as they walk around the halls in pajamas or banter loudly among themselves. They also spend much less in the hotels. **********''The Europeans and Americans are bigger spenders, and they like to drink at our bar or eat at our coffee shop,'' said Zhang Fuxi, chairman of the Sheraton Guilin Hotel.

Francis as they tried to shepherd Americans through a land of raging uncertainty and also report on the events. **********Mr. Summers, who, George F. Kennan, the former diplomat and historian, has said was one of the most astute diplomatic observers, was surprised bythe final Bolshevik takeover.

In addition, Mr. Fink said this was the one time of year when the public service announcements were guaranteed to be shown on prime-time network television. **********Taking advantage of this seasonal good will, the Harvard School of Public Health has started a separate campaign against drunken driving in which President Bush tells viewers that during the holiday season they can become the life of the party by simply volunteering to be a designated driver. **********In another of the segments filmed at the White House, the President tells viewers that more than 20,000 lives are lost each year because of alcohol-related auto accidents. **********Organizations are beefing up their public service campaigns against drunken driving because they have found their efforts effective.

Earlier efforts told people that friends do not let friends drive drunk. **********It was an easy message for the public to understand, but a hard one for many people to put into practice. \"Our research showed that people understood it is necessary to intervene to keep someone they knew from driving while drunk,\" Ms. Pastre said. \"But people also said they are reluctant to intervene because they did not want to risk embarrassing a friend.\" **********The new spots point out the high price of being timid.

The Japanese budget for supercomputers is so low that successful bidders have had to offer discounts of up to 80 percent of the list price. **********The United States is continuing to try to persuade Japan to buy American-made commercial satellites and to open up the Japanese market to American wood products, two other areas in which Washington has accused Tokyo of unfair trade practices. The satellite talks are reportedly stalled and the talks on wood products may resume next month. **********The agreement on supercomputers, reached here late Thursday night and announced today, has not been signed and is subject to review and approval in Tokyo and Washington. **********Supercomputers are used by scientists and engineers to forecast the weather, to design aircraft and automobiles, to explore for oil and to predict the behavior of the economy and financial markets, among other tasks. **********American computer companies like Cray Research Inc. and the International Business Machines Corporation cautiously welcomed the agreement but said they did not know whether it would result in additional sales, as the American negotiators intended. **********Members of Congress also welcomed the agreement, but said they wanted to see results. **********Empty Promises **********''Japan must recognize that promises without performance are simply unacceptable,'' said Senator John C. Danforth of Missouri, the ranking Republican on the Commerce Committee. **********Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Finance subcommittee on trade, said that in the past ''American trade negotiators have fallen in the trap of declaring success too soon.'' **********The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, looked on the positive side: ''American supercomputer manufacturers already compete successfully in the Japanese private sector. The real test of this agreement, therefore, will be the actual success of our companies in the Government procurement market.'' **********The new agreement ''should give us full and effective access to that market,'' Mrs. Hills said. **********Four Purchases Planned **********The pact does not require Japan to buy a specific number of machines from the United States. But the Japanese Government plans to buy four supercomputers this year, an American trade official said. Such machines cost $7 million to $30 million each, he said. **********The agreement appears to be one of the first fruits of meetings in California three weeks ago between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, trade negotiators said. The talks were prompted by a sense of alarm among officials in both countries that a continued impasse in trade negotiations would permanently damage their alliance. **********An American trade official said the Japanese negotiators came to the talks on supercomputers, held here Wednesday and Thursday, ''with instructions to make a deal.'' As a result of high-level political pressure, he said, the Japanese showed a more forthcoming attitude. **********Meeting Called Helpful **********The Bush-Kaifu meeting definitely helped, he said. The Japanese negotiators ''said O.K. more often.'' **********A 1987 agreement between the United States and Japan called for an open, ''nondiscriminatory procurement process.'' Nevertheless, in May 1989, President Bush charged that Japan was maintaining an array of unfair trade barriers, and supercomputers were one of three areas chosen for special investigation. Japan faced the prospect of retaliatory trade sanctions, including high tariffs, if it did not relax the retrictions identified by the United States. **********Mrs. Hills said it was ''too early to say'' whether the pact would resolve the case against Japan, filed last year under the so-called Super 301 section of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. **********Dennis McGrath, a spokesman for Cray, said: ''We haven't had a chance to study the initial draft of the agreement. We just hope it will contain the provisions we need to open up the Japanese market.'' **********'The Real Test' **********''The real test,'' he said, ''is whether this agreement, unlike the one signed in 1987, actually results in true competitive equity. By that, we mean actual sales and market-share increases for the American supercomputer industry.'' **********Mr. McGrath said Cray had 80 percent of the world supercomputer market outside Japan but only 66 percent when the Japanese market is included. **********In 1988, 31 supercomputers were sold in Japan, 26 by Japanese manufacturers and 5 by American companies, according to Dataquest Inc., a market research concern in San Jose, Calif. **********American companies supplied only 6 percent of the supercomputers bought by the Japanese Government and publicly financed universities in Japan, the United States trade representative's office said. **********Under the agreement, the Japanese Government accepted the American contention that it should buy supercomputers on the basis of a combined assessment of price and value. In the past, American officials said, Japan bought the cheapest supercomputer that met its specifications, turning down superior American machines that were slightly more expensive. The main Japanese computer manufacturers, which all produce supercomputers, are Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and the NEC Corporation. **********Bursts of High Speeds **********In addition, an American trade official said, Japan agreed that it would no longer use ''theoretical peak performance'' as a factor in buying supercomputers. Japanese companies have designed computers to meet such standards; as a result, some Japanese supercomputers can reach extremely high speeds, but only for a fraction of a second. **********American negotiators argued that supercomputers should instead be judged by their overall performance in solving practical problems. **********Under the agreement, the Japanese Government is supposed to throw out ''excessively low bids.'' These are below-cost bids sometimes offered by Japanese companies that hope the deals will give them prestige and influence, and perhaps access to new software. Japan is to publicize the names of companies that submit such bids. American trade officials said such publicity would embarrass Japanese companies by indicating that they had engaged in unfair trade practices. The agreement, however, does not define excessively low bids. **********American companies can file complaints with an ombudsman in the Prime Minister's office if they think they have been shut out of the market as a result of excessively low bids. **********The American delegation in the talks was led by William Piez, a deputy assistant trade representative, who had been an economic officer at the American Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese delegation was led by Mitoji Yabunaka, an official at the Foreign Ministry.

Call to Americans in Kuwait **********In a call sent out on Voice of America short-wave radio broadcasts, the United States urged Americans in Kuwait to assemble at the country's international airport to meet the special Iraqi Airways charter flight, an official at the American Embassy here said. **********Reports reaching Baghdad from the besieged American Embassy compound in Kuwait indicated that the Ambassador there, W. Nathaniel Howell, was confident that 90 percent of the Americans in hiding in Kuwait had been notified of the evacuation plan by tonight. American officials hoped that others would hear of the plan during the night through the clandestine communication networks still functioning in Kuwait. **********United States officials here did not know tonight whether Mr. Howell, his deputy chief of mission, Barbara Bodine, and several other diplomats who have been holding out without electricity or municipal water supplies in the embassy compound since August would leave on Sunday, the embassy official here said. **********The departure time of the flight from Baghdad on Sunday depends on how rapidly the Iraqi authorities process exit visas for all of the Americans who wish to leave. American officials are hoping the flight can leave as early as 3 P.M. **********Hostages will be offered medical and other assistance in Frankfurt before they board flights there for other destinations, the embassy official said. .  Exit Visas Issued **********Iraq began processing exit visas this afternoon for other foreign residents wishing to leave. A number of Canadians and Britons successfully obtained exit documents, an indication that Baghdad wants to remove the hostage issue in its confrontation with the international coalition seeking to bring Iraq's occupation of Kuwait to an end. **********Tonight, Iraq's Foreign Ministry summoned the deputy chief of mission of the American Embassy, Joseph C. Wilson 4th, and presented him with a counterproposal to President Bush's plan to exchange foreign ministers' visits. **********The crucial round of diplomacy is supposed to take place before the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face the use of military force. **********The United States had proposed that the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, come to Washington next week, and that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d travel to Baghdad the following week or no later than the first week in January.  Date for Baker Visit **********But Mr. Wilson was told that Iraqi officials could not receive Mr. Baker in Baghdad before mid-January. Baghdad television and radio broadcasts tonight suggested that this new timing had been accepted by Washington, but a American official here said this was not the case. **********[ Administration officials said in Washington that after the United States proposed Dec. 10 for the Aziz visit, Iraq countered with Dec. 17. The Americans agreed on the condition that Mr. Hussein meet with Mr. Baker on Dec. 20, 21 or 22 or Jan. 3. The Iraqi response was that Mr. Hussein was so busy he could not see Mr. Baker before Jan. 12, three days before the United Nations resolution authorizing force takes effect. ] **********Dozens of Americans who had expected to be on today's flight organized by Mr. Connally and Mr. Wyatt were angry and disappointed that they and their relatives were not allowed to leave, since more than two-thirds of the 175 seats on the charter flight were empty. **********One man who got on the flight, Charles Keegan, 57, of Des Moines, Iowa, said that during the last 24 hours, \"half the time I was choked with emotion and half the time I felt like choking somebody.\" Relatives in Turmoil **********A large group of hostages' relatives who arrived here this week in a self-described \"Coming Home\" mission was in turmoil throughout the day as various unofficial spokesmen seeking to assist them inadvertently gave them erroneous information that they would be able to depart as a group. **********On Friday night, Scott Nelson of Los Angeles, an unofficial hostage negotiator associated with Mr. Connally's mission and with the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist group, met with the 17 \"Coming Home\" hostages, their wives and their relatives at a downtown Baghdad hotel and told them they all would be allowed to leave on the Connally flight. **********Mr. Nelson also told American Embassy officials that he expected to fill as many as 100 seats on the plane with additional Americans, including diplomats and others who had taken refuge at diplomatic residences in Baghdad. **********In a brief interview, Mr. Nelson said he had sat in on a meeting between Mr. Connally and Mr. Hussein this week in which the Iraqi President authorized a hostage evacuation mission that Mr. Nelson indicated might fill the 175-seat Boeing 707.

It is no secret, though, that some companies simply pay lip service to the idea, while others do an extraordinary job of keeping customers happy. Unfortunately for corporate customers, it is often difficult to discover which is which until after the equipment is purchased. **********Now there is help, in two surveys of business computer users -- one by Dataquest Inc., a market research firm in San Jose, Calif., and the other by PC Magazine, published in New York by the Ziff-Davis Company.

Price cuts will get customers in the door, but to make the sale, computer companies are emphasizing product reliability, service and support.How long will this computer run before something goes wrong? How painless will repairs be? Where can a user get help? **********In both the PC Magazine and Dataquest studies, mail-order companies made their customers happier than the big-name companies, with a few exceptions.

Joel Kocher, a senior vice president at Dell, said the impressive showing by some mail-order companies underscored a major shift in the personal computer industry. \"PC buyers are moving away from traditional retail stores and to distribution channels that are tailored to their particular needs,\" he said. **********In its survey, PC Magazine, whose readership is heavily weighted toward computer buyers in the corporate community, received nearly 20,000 responses to its questionnaire on customer satisfaction. Those readers also said direct-order companies provided superior service and support. **********Swan Technologies Inc. of State College, Pa., had a remarkably strong showing in the PC Magazine survey, finishing first in three of four categories: overall repair service, overall technical support and percentage of respondents who said they would buy more computers from the same company. But PC Magazine editors noted that Swan, a small company formerly known as Tussey Computers, had relatively few responses in the survey, which did not provide as reliable a statistical base as the other companies. In the fourth category, overall reliability, Hewlett-Packard was first, echoing its impressive standing in the Dataquest survey. Close behind Swan in overall satisfaction were Dell and Northgate Computer Systems Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn. **********In what is perhaps the most telling category of the PC Magazine survey -- the percentage of those who said they would buy more computers from the same company -- Swan was followed by Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Northgate. **********Unlike Dataquest, PC Magazine reported the worst performers in each category. The mail-order companies PC Brand Inc. and Austin Computer Systems were rated worst in overall reliability, followed by Packard-Bell, Wyse and Gateway 2000. Commodore Business Machines of West Chester, Pa., finished last in both technical support and repair service. It also had a small number of responses in the survey, which may have skewed the results. **********The loser in the PC Magazine poll was Compaq, which has a longstanding policy of referring all customer inquiries and problems to its dealers. Compaq finished next-to-last in technical support and fourth from the bottom in repairs. For a company whose prices are typically the highest in the industry and whose reliability rating in the survey was only average, those results are striking. **********Michael Berman, a Compaq spokesman, said the company had not seen the Dataquest survey, and he challenged the PC Magazine findings. \"Our information is very different from what PC Magazine reflects,\" he said.  Compaq did its own survey of management information service executives who typically oversee large corporate computing systems, he said, \"and they said Compaq was unsurpassed in overall satisfaction.\" **********Compaq recently announced that it was beefing up its training of authorized dealers. \"Our research shows that the dealer channel is the way to go for distributing and supporting our products,\" Mr. Berman said. **********In contrast to customers' experience with Compaq, Dell and Northgate customers report that their calls are occasionally answered by the chairmen of the companies.

Now, as the company contemplates investing $100 million in a new satellite television venture, the answer seems clear. **********Robert J. Wussler, president of Comsat Video Enterprises and formerly the second-in-command at Turner Broadcasting System Inc., wants do with satellites what his former boss, Ted Turner, did with cable television. Mr. Turner, who owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team and Atlanta Hawks basketball team, has used his franchises as a cornerstone for sports programming over the TBS and Turner Network Television cable channels. **********\"Just as VCR and cable television were methods of distribution for the 1980's, we think direct-broadcast satellite is the technology of the 1990's,\" Mr. Wussler said in an interview. **********But even the most charitable securities analysts are reserving judgment. Comsat's record is littered with earlier, botched attempts to enter new businesses, from satellite antennas to telephone equipment, that have cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars since 1980. **********Based in Washington, Comsat serves as the Federal Government's representative to Intelsat, the international satellite consortium owned by 119 governments, and its core business has been providing international communications through Intelsat. It is a strong business that earned $105 million on revenues of $280 million last year. **********But with both its rates and profits are determined by the Federal Communications Commission, Comsat has repeatedly tried to move into less regulated areas. **********A year ago, the company paid $18 million for a 62.5 percent stake of the Denver Nuggets. Company officials say the move was primarily intended to give them an entree in negotiating broadcast rights with other teams and leagues. **********Comsat is now weighing an investment of $100 million to $125 million in a new direct-broadcast satellite company, the Skypix Corporation, of Seattle, its officials confirm. It wants to broadcast about 80 channels of programming, including 40 to 50 movies and a rich array of sports events, directly to households around the nation using antennas less than 2 feet in diameter. Viewers would be charged for each program they watch. **********Skypix has spent $20 million developing its technology and estimates that it needs $200 million to $300 million more to bring the system to market. Comsat is reported to have signed a memorandum of understanding to invest a big chunk of the capital, provided Skypix can line up other investors and get the F.C.C. to approve its transmission technology. \"We have made no firm commitments yet,\" a Comsat spokesman, Richard McGraw, said. **********Mr. Wussler thinks satellite broadcasting has considerable appeal. He likes that direct-broadcast satellites can reach rural viewers who cannot be connected to cable television. Also, by using new transmission technologies, Skypix and other companies hope to send multiple channels of programming over a single satellite transponder, offering the promise of lower costs and greater variety in programming. **********Two large rivals are developing their own satellite systems: Sky Cable, a joint venture backed by NBC, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Hughes Communications Inc. and the Cablevision Systems Corporation, and K-Prime Partners, a venture backed by several large cable television companies. **********But analysts are dubious about Comsat's plans, given its record. At Comsat Video Entertainment, losses on a \"pay per view\" movie service for hotel rooms that began several years ago climbed to $18 million in 1989 from $5 million in 1987 and are expected to reach at least $25 million this year. Part of the trouble is that a software glitch allowed some customers to watch movies without being billed. But the more enduring problem is that Comsat Video lags the industry leader, Spectradyne Inc., in signing up hotel chains that cater to business travelers. **********Also, in the early 1980's, Comsat sank $193 million into building two direct-broadcast satellites, only to stop the project amid poor market prospects. There have been other dead ends in manufacturing: Since 1987, the company has sold off or abandoned operations that made satellite dishes, earth stations, microwave amplifiers and a host of other equipment. **********After all this, some analysts contend that Mr. Wussler should stay closer to Comsat's core business, where demand is growing. \"We urge our clients to sell their shares now, before Comsat management buries them even more with their next fiasco,\" wrote James M. McCabe, an analyst at Normura Securities, in a recent report. **********Mr. McGraw of Comsat responded that his company would not make a rash move. \"This is not a fly-by-night decision that Comsat is trying to make,\" he said, noting that it has been looking at direct-broadcast satellite for more than a year. \"When we do make a decison, it will be one based on good market research and a good business plan that provides a good return for our shareholders.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/29/world/disaster-zone-is-urged-after-soviet-nuclear-blast.html": {"writer_name": "Francis cli", "pub_date": "1990-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 696, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Disaster Zone Is Urged After Soviet Nuclear Blast", "print_headline": "Disaster Zone Is Urged After Soviet Nuclear Blast", "body_text": " **********The Soviet republic of Kazakhstan asked the central Government today to declare an ecological disaster zone around the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk, saying that an explosion at a nuclear fuel plant there had spewed ''extremely harmful'' gas across inhabited areas. **********No loss of life or evacuations were reported in the republic's complaint, which described widespread contamination in eastern Kazakhstan, near the Soviet borders with China and Mongolia. **********Only skimpy details have been reported. Soviet news accounts said that an explosion on Sept. 12 at the Ulba metallurgical works released a ''poisonous cloud'' across the region, which is about 2,000 miles southeast of Moscow. **********Soviet accounts said the plant's process involved beryllium, a heavy metal that is an element used in fuel for nuclear power reactors. Beryllium is not radioactive but is a toxic chemical. **********Explosion Leaves Residue **********The local Soviet authorities, who are reported to have waited four days before announcing the nature of the explosion to the public, have said that it left a residue variously reported as an ''insignificant increase,'' an amount double the normally permissible level of beryllium contaminants in the air. A quantitative measurement of this was not reported, nor was there any description of how harmful this might be to human health. **********President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan said in his message to the Kremlin that the local authorities had already declared the region an ecological disaster area, Tass reported. The Soviet press agency is the only source of information about the explosion so far because the region is closed to foreign correspondents. **********''The Kazakh public and the town's population demand urgent measures and compensation for their damaged health,'' Mr. Nazarbayev was quoted as saying. **********Beryllium is used as a source of neutrons, subatomic particles needed to begin chain reactions in nuclear fuel. **********Tass said the plant was among the major suppliers of the nation's nuclear fuel. ''Unfortunately it is located in a densely populated area of Ust-Kamenogorsk,'' its dispatch said. **********The 1985 census reported a population of 307,000 in the city, with more people living in the surrounding region. Kazakhstan, a land of desert and rocky plateaus, is second only to the Russian republic in area. **********President Nazarbayev's message to the Kremlin clearly reflected the heightened concern of the Soviet public about the ecological risks of nuclear fuel. That concern is rooted in the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion of 1986, which caused the deaths of more than two dozen people and contaminated vast areas of Byelorussia and the Ukraine. Many villages were evacuated and abandoned. and much of the land still has not been cleaned up. **********The Kazakh authorities called on the Kremlin to act urgently and dispatch experts to the region to determine whether the nuclear fuel plant should be closed. They asked that an ecological study of the accident's effects to be carried by a commission that would include international experts. **********Traffic Stirs Contaminants **********On Sept. 17, Izvestia, the Government newspaper, reported that the situation around the plant had returned to normal. But the paper's correspondent said that four days after the cloud passed over the region, contamination appeared in scattered land areas, indicating that road traffic was stirring contaminants that had falled from the sky. **********Izvestia said the city's authorities wanted to wash the city streets four times a day to protect against fallout contamination, but were unable to do so because of a shortage of gasoline for the Government water and work trucks. **********There are many chemical plants in the Ust-Kamenogorsk region, and there has long been a ban on street sweeping so as not to stir potential contaminants into the air, the newspaper reported. **********The Izvestia dispatch said the regional government and Communist officials had for four days denied the local authorities permission to go on television and inform the public."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/26/business/company-briefs-959790.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 257, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Bowne & Co., New York, a financial and corporate planning firm, said it would buy the Packard Insurance division of Basix Corp., New York, a holding company.

The spokesman declined to say when the quarterly report would come out. **********Assessing the Damage **********Such a charge would be one of the largest in the firm's history. In 1987, Merrill had a gross loss of $377 million that resulted from a single day's trading in mortgage-backed securties. Wall Street executives said that the current revamping should not cost Merrill more than that episode. **********In addition to the charge, the firm might have other losses in the fourth quarter, such as any resulting from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing of the Lomas Financial Corporation. Merrill underwrote Lomas securities and still holds some of them, analysts said. They added, however, that Merrill might spread any loss from Lomas over several quarters. **********Analysts said yesterday that a decision by Merrill to take the full charge for its reorganization would be a positive move. **********Stock Is Up Slightly **********''That would help them get the costs out of the way as soon as possible,'' said Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services. Mr. Long added that he did not expect such a charge would have a significant impact on the firm's stock price. Yesterday, Merrill's shares rose 25 cents, to $24.75, in New York Stock Exchange trading. **********Merrill is expected to dismiss between 2,800 and 3,200 employees as part of the reorganization, and a large number of employees have been told in the last two days that they are being dismissed. **********Merrill officials said that the firm's work force had been reduced by about 1,500 in the last three weeks. Merrill had employed more than 40,000 people at the end of last year. **********Wall Street executives said yesterday that Merrill dismissed about 10 percent of its investment banking division this week. About 70 professional employees and 70 support workers were dismissed in all, with both New York and London operations affected, they said. A number of people from the equity research department have also been dismissed. **********A 'Siege Mentality' **********The staff reductions have created a ''siege mentality'' at the firm, some employees said. Rumors have swept Merrill that all of the planned dismissals will be made by the end of next week. But Merrill officials yesterday denied those rumors. **********Nevertheless, the speed of the reductions and changes indicate that the efforts at streamlining could be more extensive than Merrill officials had previously indicated. Merrill executives originally said that as many as 1,000 people would be laid off. **********Merrill has also reduced its employee roster this month by selling off some assets, including its Canadian retail securities brokerage business. **********In addition, some of the firm's executives have left. People at Merrill said that Mario J. Nigro, a top executive in the firm's operations and systems division, had resigned as part of the reorganization plan and left the firm Thursday. **********Departure Confirmed **********A spokesman for the company confirmed yesterday that Mr. Nigro was no longer an employee. The spokesman said that Mr. Nigro had resigned to pursue other interests, but that he would serve as a consultant during the reorganization. A telephone call to Mr. Nigro was not returned. **********Merrill has long been criticized by analysts for not sufficiently cutting its operations after the stock market crash of October 1987 and for continuing in some of its weaker businesses. **********In a letter to employees late last year, Merrill executives said they intended to cut operating costs, overhaul or eliminate unprofitable lines of business and place greater controls over commitments of the firm's own capital. **********In addition, Merrill said it would modify its compensation system, reducing the bonuses for many of its investment bankers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/06/business/bush-said-to-have-chosen-interim-savings-regulator.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1990-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 550, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bush Said to Have Chosen Interim Savings Regulator", "print_headline": "Bush Said to Have Chosen Interim Savings Regulator", "body_text": " **********President Bush plans to name an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury who has a reputation as a tough enforcement official and strong manager as an interim successor to M.

''The time has come for intergovernmental negotiations between Lithuania and the Soviet Union.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev did not attend the rally, but in his encounters today with Lithuanians, the first time a Soviet leader has visited Lithuania in the 50 years since it was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union, he underscored the interdependence between Moscow and Lithuania. **********''Over 50 years, we have become tied together whether we like it or not,'' he said to a crowd of people lining Lenin Square this morning. **********He emphasized the importance of the region's ports and communications lines for Soviet defense, saying, ''Our security lies here.'' **********Lithuanian Losses Asserted **********In his walkabout at Lenin Square and in visits to a factory and a Lithuanian press club, the Soviet President said repeatedly that with secession, Lithuania would lose billions of rubles of subsidies it receives in the form of Soviet raw materials and products, and would founder in the cruel competition of the outside world. **********''Let's give you independence, and establish world prices, and you'll bog down in a swamp immediately,'' he told the crowd in the streets. **********Mr. Gorbachev was dispatched to Lithuania by the Soviet party's governing Central Committee in response to a decision by Lithuanian Communists to bolt from Moscow's control and form an independent party. He is to address the Lithuanian party on Saturday. **********But his more urgent mission is to head off the powerful popular movement for restoration of the Lithuanian independence that existed between the two world wars, before Stalin annexed Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia under terms of a secret agreement with Hitler. **********The Kremlin sees Lithuanian secession as a first step toward a potential fragmentation of the Soviet Union. Certainly fears of such breakup were not lessened by the presence at the rally here of flags of Estonia, Latvia, Moldavia, Georgia, Armenia and the Ukraine, republics where separatist and nationalist sentiments have been asserted to varying degrees. **********Lithuania's two neighboring republics on the Baltic coast, Latvia and Estonia, are also home to strong independence movements. Latvia's Parliament became the second in a Soviet republic to legalize non-Communist political parties. Lithuania voted in december to abolish the Communist monopoly on power, and Estonia is expected to follow suit soon. **********The Baltic separatist movements are the most urgent examples of nationalist challenges that have arisen in almost every republic of the country. **********But Mr. Maslyukov's comments to factory workers were the most authoritative evidence to date that the Kremlin intends to keep the Lithuanians on board by persuasion, not force. **********Law on How to Secede Urged **********Noting that a law on secession is now being drafted in the Soviet Parliament, Mr. Maslyukov said separation would require a referendum of all the republic's residents, and should be preceded by ''an honest explanation of the consequences of such a step.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev also cited the need for a law explaining how a republic might put into effect the right to secede, which is embodied in the Constitution but has never been translated into a working law, although he was not so direct in endorsing a republic's freedom to leave. **********''We need to discuss the time frame for leaving, defense, communications and an entire series of questions,'' he said in remarks carried on Lithuanian television and reported by Reuters. **********Mr. Maslyukov said that if Lithuania seceded, the republic should be responsible for compensating and relocating any residents who do not chose to go along. **********Lithuanians Confront Gorbachev **********''It is difficult to imagine that the collective reason of the Lithuanian nation could decide on such a step,'' he said. **********But after citing statistics that he asserted represented Lithuania's dependence on other republics, he said: ''I have had a chance to observe how residents of the republic react with irritation to outside speculation about how much their freedom will cost them in rubles or in convertible currency. And obviously, they are right. It is for them to determine their own fate.'' **********From the time Mr. Gorbachev arrived here this morning, he met head on the swelling desire for freedom and self-determination, and some of his encounters were broadcast tonight on Soviet television. **********''People have the right to decide their fate,'' one man shouted at the Soviet President as he mingled with a throng after laying a wreath at a monument to Lenin. **********Mr. Gorbachev turned to the man and replied: ''Nothing will be decided without you. We will decide everything together.'' **********''Independence'' has a range of meanings for different people here, from greater freedom within the Soviet Union to outright secession, and some political leaders in the republic say they hope a compromise can be found short of separation."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/02/business/fidelity-raises-spartan-fee.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fidelity Raises Spartan Fee", "print_headline": "Fidelity Raises Spartan Fee", "body_text": " **********Fidelity Investments announced yesterday that it would raise fees on its Spartan money market funds.

Far more than the others, it became a melting pot of Europeans and Indians, so that today nearly 90 percent of Mexico's 81 million people are mestizos, descended from both groups. Even people whose features make them appear to be mostly of European descent acknowledge -sometimes with pride, sometimes reluctantly - that they have at least some Indian blood. **********A Troublesome Holiday **********''There was much talk, in the 16th century, of separate republics, one Indian and one Spanish, and of co-existence,'' said Silvio Zapala, a historian. ''But trying to perpetuate such a black and white difference denies the mestizaje that actually took place.'' **********This mestizo sense of themselves makes the quincentennial of Christopher Columbus's landfall, on Oct. 12, 1492, a particularly troublesome holiday in Mexico. It is one that requires, in Mr. Muria's view, an exploration not only of the Indian and Spanish contributions, but also of the African influence. Tens of thousands of slaves, brought mostly to the Gulf coast, also intermingled with Indians and Spanish, so much so that Mexico today does not have a separate black minority. **********Elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere, where intermarriage was not as commonplace, the anniversary celebrations are shaping up to be mostly splashy odes to Columbus and the world he opened to European culture. Replicas of his ships, the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, for example, will visit more than 40 ports in the United States in 1992. And even in Peru, with its huge Indian population, the emphasis is not on mourning the destruction of the Inca empire, but on celebrating the Spanish discovery. **********Peru is less troubled about its Spanish heritage than Mexico, perhaps because mestizaje never took hold and Peru's small, powerful upper middle class still traces its bloodlines back to the original Spanish families. A bronze statue of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, who decimated the Incas, occupies a prominent spot in Lima's central plaza, while in Mexico City, Pizarro's counterpart, Hernan Cortes, conqueror of the Aztecs, is hidden from view. **********Just One Statue **********In all the city, only one Cortes statue is on display, a bust placed in a passageway of the Hospital de Jesus, which Cortes founded in 1524. The Paseo de la Reforma, a broad, historic central avenue, on the other hand, is punctuated every few blocks with statues of Aztec chieftains and Mexican heroes. Only a single statue of Columbus, near one end of the avenue, acknowledges the debt to Spanish culture, and that statue has become a staging area for periodic anti-Spanish protests. **********The protagonists of these protests are representatives of Mexico's most important minority: seven million Indians whose ancestors failed to be included in the mestizaje. Although Mexicans honor their Aztec heritage, the big Indian minority lives in poverty in rural communities and Oct. 12, 1992, is essentially an opportunity for Indians to protest their hardship. It is to be a day of ''dignity and resistance'' to the colonial murderers of 60 million Indians, an Indian rights group declared in a recent newspaper advertisement. **********But the Indians represent an enduring minority view in a nation that every few generations shifts its appraisal of its heritage and identity. In 1892, the 400th anniversary, for instance, the emphasis was on Mexico's Spanish roots, which seemed a proper antidote to the 19th-century incursions of France and the United States. **********After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, the Aztec heritage became the ideal, although the Indian minority remained in poverty. And today, as the 500th anniversary approaches and Mexico becomes more industrialized, a new appraisal is under way. **********Two Opposing Views **********Edmundo O'Gorman, a historian at the University of Mexico, represents one extreme, arguing that the New World was not discovered, but was invented by the Spanish to fulfill their various expansionist and utopian needs. In this view, the native Indians become secondary to the Spanish creation. **********Mr. O'Gorman's opposite is Miguel Leon Portilla, another University of Mexico historian, who argues that, absent the European intrusion, the Indians would have developed along their own rich path and that their contributions to the Mexican heritage have to be listed alongside those of the Spanish. **********Homer Aridjis, a poet and novelist, offers such a listing in support of his argument that 1992 should be thought of not as the anniversary of Spain's discovery of a New World or its conquest of that world, but as the Spanish and the Indians ''mutually discovering each other.'' **********His list of comparative contributions includes, on the Spanish side, the Spanish language, printing (in 1539), horses, dogs, wheat, candles and measles. From the Indians came an enrichment of the language with numerous new words and expressions, along with corn, tobacco, tomatoes and dozens of other foods, and the introduction into Europe of various new diseases, the most famous being syphilis. **********A version of the Mexican ''mutual discovery'' approach rubbed off on the Spanish, Mr. Muria says. Spain, eager to increase its ties to Latin America, had started out viewing 1992 as the anniversary of a great Spanish discovery. But Mr. Muria says that the Government of Spain altered this approach after officials from that country met with himself, Mr. Leon Portilla and other Mexicans. The official Spanish theme for 1992 soon became ''the encounter of two worlds.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/21/business/nbc-affiliates-getting-slot.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NBC Affiliates Getting Slot", "print_headline": "NBC Affiliates Getting Slot", "body_text": " **********Starting next fall, NBC will give its affiliated stations an hour of its weekday daytime schedule for their own programming, the network announced yesterday. **********John Damiano, senior vice president of affiliate relations, said many stations already use their own programs in the early part of NBC's daytime schedule, so no program the network could provide would succeed. **********NBC is a distant third in the daytime television ratings, averaging a 3.1 rating to 5.5 for CBS and 4.6 for ABC.

But he anticipates no more than $550 million from countries with financial constraints of their own. ''I can't fulfill my mandate,'' he said in a recent interview at his headquarters here. ''Levels of care are falling. I have only half the resources per refugee today that we had in 1980.'' **********Others share Mr. Stoltenberg's concern. Roger P. Winter, Director of the United States Committee for Refugees, told the House Committee on Hunger last month that the number of refugees rose 50 percent in the last five years but that the United Nations refugee agency's budget increased only 25 percent, while the United States' share fell to 22 percent from 27 percent. ''As a result critical services have been cut back in refugee camps throughout the world,'' Mr. Winter told the House committee. **********The number of refugees in the world climbed from about 7 million in 1980 to about 10 million by 1985 before reaching 15 million today, largely as a result of continuing civil strife and the exodus of boat people from Vietnam. **********As the refugee crisis has grown, the High Commissioner's budget has risen, but never by enough to meet the new demands. The agency gradually drew on a reserve of about $85 million. **********By 1988 this fund was exhausted. The High Commissioner's budget fell $7 million short of requirements in 1988; the deficit rose to $38 million the next year, and it is expected to reach $150 million to $200 million in 1990, said John Horekens, the head of fund-raising services. **********As a result, the level of help and protection offered refugees is being steadily cut back. An internal memo of the refugee agency dated Nov. 30, 1989, notes that ''150,000 to 225,000 refugee children are suffering from acute malnutrition. All of these children need nutritional rehabilitation. All are in danger of death.'' **********The agency's Head of Program Management Services, Gerald Walzer, told the House Hunger Committee last month that he had to reduce teaching of refugee children, reduce the quality of water in some camps and restrict ''basic items such as blankets, tents, shelter material, cooking utensils, heating and cooking fuel.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/18/world/confrontation-gulf-israelis-assert-palestinians-plan-terror-attacks-for-iraq.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1990-08-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 907, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Israelis Assert Palestinians Plan Terror Attacks for Iraq", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   Israelis Assert Palestinians Plan Terror Attacks for Iraq", "body_text": " **********Israeli intelligence has learned that several Palestinian terrorist organizations are actively planning attacks on behalf of Iraq against American targets in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, officials said today. **********''These people are offering services free to Iraq,'' a senior official said in a private briefing with several American journalists. ''There is the will, and there is the planning, and they are now collecting information. After this phase all they need is the order.'' He referred to an order from Baghdad. **********Israeli intelligence monitors Middle East terrorist organizations more closely than anyone else since their most frequent target is this nation. The Israelis say they believe that the terror groups are of the view that American resolve might be broken by successful terrorist actions against United States forces in the Middle East - just as it was when United States Marines were deployed in Lebanon seven years ago. **********In a matter of more direct concern to Israel, the senior officer also said Israel was watching with concern as Jordan mobilizes its armed forces and places them on high alert. **********'It Smells Like War' **********''In the air there, it smells like war,'' the official said. ''They are blowing up the balloon, and we don't know why.'' **********Israel has little concern that Jordan is preparing to attack this nation. ''But they are just not behaving as before, and it's very strange,'' he said. **********Considering the close relationship King Hussein of Jordan has with Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President, ''maybe they know something we don't know,'' the official said. **********Because the normal political order of the Arab world has been turned on its head by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, it is not clear where all of the terrorist groups now stand. But it is certain that most Palestinian organizations support the Iraqi President, as do the vast majority of Palestinians in the occupied territories and the rest of the Arab world. **********'More Potential Targets' **********Israeli intelligence officials say they do not believe that the terrorist groups have chosen targets or planned specific attacks at this stage. And, the official said, attacking American military or diplomatic installations - by now well versed in facing Middle Eastern terrorism - ''is not going to be an easy task.'' **********''But more and more potential targets are arriving here every day,'' the official said. **********During the United States military deployment in Lebanon from 1982 to 1984, terrorists twice detonated car bombs at the American Embassy in Beirut. They also exploded a huge truck bomb in the Marine headquarters at Beirut International Airport in 1983, killing 241 servicemen. It was those incidents, more than anything else, that prompted the United States to withdraw. **********Today, ''most but not all of the Palestinian organizations are involved'' in planning the possible attacks, the officer said. Another senior Government official involved in monitoring Arab countries said the intelligence showed that three principal groups are of concern. **********Abu Nidal in Baghdad **********Abu Nidal, who heads the Fatah Revolutionary Council, is known to have been in Baghdad in the last two weeks and is believed to be trying to lead the terrorist campaign on behalf of President Hussein. **********In addition, Palestinian analysts say Abul Abbas, whose attempt at a terrorist raid on a Tel Aviv beach in May caused the United States to suspend its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, also appears to be involved. Support from Baghdad would strengthen his position against the more moderate elements in the P.L.O. **********And, the senior Government official said, Ahmed Jabril of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, is also an aspiring participant. His organization is known to possess sophisticated technical abilities to build bombs and stage terrorist attacks. **********The Israelis say they have provided the information to the United States and point to that as an example of the intelligence sharing that has come to be Israel's role in the current crisis. **********No Special Israeli Steps **********Israel remains on high alert against terrorism all the time and has not taken special protective steps, officials said. This morning, Israeli forces patrolling Israel's self-declared ''security zone'' in southern Lebanon shot and killed two well-armed guerrillas who, the army said, were trying to cross into Israel.

Yeltsin, the maverick politician who has spent three years fighting the Communist Party establishment, today became President of the Russian republic, overcoming a last-ditch effort by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to block his election before departing for visits to Canada and the United States. **********Mr. Yeltsin, whose popular following makes him a clear threat to Mr. Gorbachev's authority as leader of the Soviet Union, won the presidency of the nation's largest republic on a third round of balloting in the republic's Parliament with a final tally of 535 votes, 4 more than the required majority. His opponent, Aleksandr V. Vlasov, the choice of the party and Mr. Gorbachev, trailed with 467 votes. **********Standing Ovation in Parliament **********When the final count was announced this afternoon to the tense and excited gathering at the Grand Kremlin Palace, deputies rose to their feet to give a standing ovation to Mr. Yeltsin, the former Moscow Communist Party chief who was thrown out of the leadership after a disagreement with Mr. Gorbachev over the pace of change. **********Outside the Kremlin gates, hundreds of Yeltsin supporters, waving red-white-and-blue prerevolutionary Russian flags and carrying pictures of the new President, gathered to wait for a glimpse of the tall, 59-year-old Siberian, a popular hero who has become a symbol of the promise of real change. **********Speaking to reporters after his election, Mr. Yeltsin said he wanted to build relations with Mr. Gorbachev ''not on confrontation, but on a businesslike basis, dialogue and talks, on a principled basis, not to the prejudice of Russia's sovereignty and interests.'' **********Gorbachev to 'Wait and See' **********Mr. Gorbachev, on his arrival in Ottawa for a stop en route to Washington, was asked about the election. The Soviet President said he applauded reports that Mr. Yeltsin had said he was willing to ''work fruitfully with the President of the Soviet Union,'' and then added: ''If, however, he is indeed playing a political game, then we may be in for a difficult time. So we will wait and see. Life is richer than any teacher.'' [Page A8.]  Mr. Yeltsin, asked if he expected to receive a message of congratulation today from his longtime foe, said after a dramatic pause, ''Yesterday I could not imagine it, but today it would be the politically correct step.'' **********In a brief acceptance speech, Mr. Yeltsin offered to put together a government drawn from different political groups in Parliament, including the conservative Communists who fought so hard to keep him from power. **********Members of the Russian Parliament and several journalists in Moscow said that on Monday night, a group of several hundred members of the Communist Party hierarchy were summoned to a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev and other members of the Politburo for final instructions on maintaining party discipline in the face of Mr. Yeltsin's candidacy. The failure of this final appeal, delivered on the eve of Mr. Gorbachev's departure for North America, served to underscore the party's loss of authority and the rise of Mr. Yeltsin as an alternative force. **********Mr. Yeltsin's open challenge to Mr. Gorbachev marks the first time that differences have been aired in public by political leaders in the Soviet Union since the 1920's, in the aftermath of the death of Lenin in 1924. Until Stalin consolidated his power in the late 1920's, there were frequent clashes between factions in the party. **********Personal Attack Last Week **********Mr. Gorbachev made a surprise appearance last week before the Russian Parliament and delivered a forceful, personal attack on Mr. Yeltsin, whom he accused of attempting to break up the Soviet Union. **********The depth of the obvious antagonism between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin, dating back to Mr. Yeltsin's break with the party hierarchy in October 1987, could lead to a dangerous political stalemate, some Soviets and foreign observers said today. **********One battleground is the Soviet Government's latest program of economic change, which relies heavily on drastic and unpopular price increases. Mr. Yeltsin has criticized the plan, and today he referred to the ''unpopular proposals by the Soviet Government to step up economic reform.'' **********Mr. Yeltsin's own economic program is not well defined, although many of his supporters are banking on the competence of new Russian President's advisers, a group that includes prominent market economists and liberal intellectuals. **********His politics, however, continue to worry some members of the Russian intelligentsia. ''The fact that Yeltsin reduces everything to social-political issues is very alarming to me,'' said Dmitri S. Likhachev, the unofficial dean of Russian literary historians and head of the Russian Cultural Foundation, in an interview in Washington. **********Mr. Yeltsin's victory, which three days ago seemed a long shot given the strength and resources of his opposition, was attributed by many deputies today to the surge of popular support that came pouring in over the weekend. **********Force of Popular Opinion Cited **********''The deputies had to take popular opinion into account,'' said Nikolai Vorontsov, a member of Parliament and the Soviet Minister of Environmental Protection. ''There could be no doubt that Yeltsin was supported by a majority of the people.'' **********Outside the main hall, in the ornate czarist chambers of the Grand Kremlin Palace, members of Democratic Russia, the liberal group that led the lobbying for Mr. Yeltsin, greeted each other with giddy jubilation. ''We won,'' said a delighted delegate from the western Siberian oil capital of Tyumen. **********Some Yeltsin supporters also attributed his final success to their candidate's public efforts at conciliation. ''Boris Nikolayevich showed he is ready to move towards a compromise, to take other points of view into account,'' said Anatoly Medvedev, a deputy from Moscow, referring to Mr. Yeltsin by his name and patronymic, in the Russian style. **********Others said the Communist Party's misguided tactics had granted Mr. Yeltsin success. The party first put up a hard-liner, Ivan K. Polozkov, a party boss from the region of Krasnodar in southern Russia, in the first round of voting, then switched to Mr. Vlasov, the current Prime Minister of the Russian republic, on the final ballot. **********Mr. Vlasov had withdrawn in the first round because of a poor performance in delivering a report on the situation in Russia, politically the most significant of the Soviet republics. **********''Mr. Vlasov showed in his report that he is not material to be even Prime Minister,'' said Mr. Medvedev, ''while Mr. Polozkov is, I am sorry to say, a demogogue, more of the Russophile type.'' **********Besieged by Supporters **********As Mr. Yeltsin left the Kremlin today, he was besieged by hundreds of supporters, who had kept up a vigil outside the nearby Rossiya Hotel, where many deputies have been staying. Chanting, ''Victory! Victory!'' the crowd swarmed around the new President, who pledged to press forward for ''the renewal of Russia.'' **********''If he hadn't won, the results would been unpredictable,'' said Alla Podlesnova, a 51-year-old doctor from Moscow. ''Yeltsin is the pride and honor of Russia.'' **********But many in the crowd disputed the notion that Mr. Yeltsin is a rival to Mr. Gorbachev's power. Instead, they said he would provide a needed counterweight to the Soviet leader, a prod toward more rapid change. **********''This is not a defeat for Gorbachev,'' said Sergei Shiskin, a 37-year old translator from Siberia. ''It is a lesson.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/15/business/tokyo-stocks-close-higher.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 301, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tokyo Stocks Close Higher", "print_headline": "Tokyo Stocks Close Higher", "body_text": " **********Tokyo stocks closed higher today on a stronger yen and firmer bond prices, as investors bought up domestic demand-linked issues that were seen as benefiting from the Japanese currency's rise.

The talks were complicated by the death of Mr. Henson in May after a bout of pneumonia. No price for the purchase was ever disclosed, but Wall Street and Hollywood analysts valued the deal at $100 million to $150 million. **********When the acquisition was announced in August 1989, Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, described the purchase of the Muppet characters and an accompanying agreement on future joint productions as \"a business association made in family-entertainment heaven.\" But the negotiations dragged on, and Mr. Henson's death at the age of 53 led to a series of basic disagreements on how to proceed and at what price, entertainment industry executives and analysts said. Allure of a Lively Imagination **********For Disney, the allure of Henson Associates came not only from the Muppets and the films and television programs in which they were featured, but also from gaining access to Mr. Henson's lively imagination. The original agreement was to include a long-term contract for his \"creative services,\" and Disney's willingness to pay a premium probably diminished with his death, entertainment executives said. **********Henson Associates is family owned, and several of Mr. Henson's five children have been actively involved in its various projects. When it came time to renegotiate the deal after Mr. Henson's death, they are said to have balked at any change that would have meant a decrease in the company's value. **********\"We're hearing that the kids kept wanting more and more,\" one industry executive said. \"Finally, Eisner said enough is enough and backed out.\" **********A spokeswoman for Henson Associates in New York declined to comment on the reason for the breakdown. A statement issued this afternoon in the family's name said, \"Unfortunately, after 18 months of negotiating, the companies could not reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.\" **********Though negotiations had been stalled for several months and rumors of the deal's collapse had been circulating in Hollywood, Disney was proceeding as if the Muppets were already as much a part of their gallery of cartoon characters as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Roger Rabbit. In June, a new Disney children's publishing house announced plans to publish books featuring the Muppets; broadcasts of \"Jim Henson's Mother Goose Stories\" began on the Disney Channel this summer, and joint development of a three-dimensional film attraction for Disney's Florida theme park was also under way. **********\"It's disappointing that Disney didn't get these properties,\" said David J. Londoner, an entertainment industry analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Company in New York. \"They are clearly very valuable, and properties like this don't come on the market very often. But apparently Disney reached the point where they couldn't justify the price that was demanded.\" Future of Some Projects Unclear **********It was not immediately clear what would happen to projects that Disney and Henson had already begun developing. This afternoon's announcement said the two companies were working together on a situation comedy about dinosaurs for ABC-TV but did not specify whether that program would continue and, if so, under whose aegis. **********The original Disney-Henson deal included publishing and licensing rights to all Muppets except those created exclusively for the Children's Television Workshop program \"Sesame Street,\" for which Henson Associates receives licensing royalties. The characters that were not to be acquired included familiar names like Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Oscar the Grouch, Bert and Ernie, and the Count. **********Despite Disney's apparent withdrawal from the deal, the Henson characters remain a valuable franchise, and entertainment industry executives and analysts said they expected other bidders to step in.  Other Possible Contenders **********Mentioned as possible contenders were Warner Brothers, which has a large stable of cartoon characters but would like to strengthen its roster, and Paramount Pictures, which has not been a major force in the animated film field but has been looking for new acquisitions. **********Another logical possibility, studio executives speculated, is MCA Inc., which agreed late last month to be sold to the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company in a deal valued at more than $6.5 billion. MCA is Disney's principal rival in the highly competitive area of theme parks, in which cartoon characters are a big lure, and its linkage with Matsushita would give it access to cash reserves unavailable to any other top American entertainment company. **********Entertainment industry executives assume that the Henson family will seek a new partner rather than try to go it alone. \"They don't have enough capital themselves to be able to fully exploit the values of the characters as sole owners,\" one studio executive said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/25/business/company-news-mercury-capri-to-cost-12588.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 234, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Mercury Capri To Cost $12,588", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Mercury Capri To Cost $12,588", "body_text": " **********The Ford Motor Company today set $12,588 as the base price for its new Mercury Capri two-seat sports convertible, a model that Ford hopes will emulate the success of the Mazda Miata. **********The Capri's base price is about $1,200 less than the Miata's.

She stressed that many laws have not stopped deforestation, either at the hands of businessmen or villagers.

Petrie of Petrie Parkman & Company, a Denver brokerage that specializes in oil stocks. \"There is no excess of optimism or expectation,\" he said. \"It is important to maintain a sober attitude, but not to block well-crafted reinvestment plans for the cash flows now being generated.\" **********Mr. Petrie said the stock market shares an assessment that high prices cannot last. When Iraq invaded Kuwait and the price of crude oil took off from the low $20's it was trading at then, oil company stocks outperformed the market. But when the price got above $30 a barrel at the end of August, the market soured on the stocks. Stock prices of five of the six biggest international oil companies have since fallen, as have 10 of the 11 big domestic companies, while one is unchanged. **********Independent oil producers are not burdened with refining or marketing operations that can become unprofitable in times of rising crude prices, but even among that group the stocks of 21 of 30 companies have declined. **********The market's reading, Mr. Petrie said, is that \"this is too much of a good thing, and in fact could be described as a bad thing.\"  Potential for a Glut **********The potential has emerged for a glut of oil once the Persian Gulf crisis ends, with any post-embargo exports by Iraq and Kuwait likely to end up as a surplus on the world market. **********\"If production from Iraq and Kuwait comes back, which is a real possibility, OPEC will be back in the problems very similar to what they had early this year, except there has been a change in OPEC,\" said John B. Boatwright, an economist with Exxon. **********Oil analysts presume that after the crisis ends, Iraq will no longer be in a position to enforce production limits by bullying its neighbors. As a result, Mr. Boatwright said, \"a future production agreement would be even more difficult.\"  Finely Balanced Market **********Even without an end to the standoff over Kuwait, production will eventually outstrip demand, experts here said. Several described the current market as finely balanced, with oil production and especially refining capacity strained to the limit. But Mr. Boatwright said that by next summer \"demand will be 1.5 million barrels a day less than OPEC capacity.\" **********\"You can make your own conclusion about what that will do to prices,\" he added. **********James H. Ross, the president and chief executive of BP America Inc., the United States subsidiary of the British Petroleum Company P.L.C., said demand for OPEC oil in the first quarter of next year would run 20.5 million barrels a day, while production is now 22.5 million barrels a day and Saudi Arabia is planning to pump even more. Prices will stay high while there is a fear of war, he said, but if the perception took hold that the price would plunge, that is exactly what would come to pass, because purchasers would delay buying to wait for a bargain, demand would fall and prices would drop in response. \"OPEC needs to get its act together, whoever OPEC is,\" Mr. Ross said.  The Role of Iraq **********The chief economist of the Amoco Corporation, Theodore Eck, said, \"Everyone knows Iraq's going to come back into the market, and clearly Saudi Arabia's going to make a place for them, but how it fits together I don't know.\" **********Discussing the difficulty of predicting future market conditions, an executive of one big oil company said that every year he presents his board with a proposal for capital spending, prefacing his remarks by saying, \"We face an uncertain situation.\" This year, he said, he would say the same thing but would pound the table as he said it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/24/business/all-about-recreational-vehicles-will-motor-homes-and-trailers-tempt.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-06-24", "snippet": "LEAD: A few miles south of Disneyland on Interstate 5, in Irvine, Calif., lies what some consider to be the real Magic Kingdom: Traveland U.S.A., billed as the world's largest sales lot for recreational vehicles.", "word_count": 1626, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "All About: Recreational Vehicles;\n\nWill Motor Homes And Trailers Tempt A New Generation?", "print_headline": "All About: Recreational Vehicles;\n\nWill Motor Homes And Trailers Tempt A New Generation?", "body_text": " **********LEAD: A few miles south of Disneyland on Interstate 5, in Irvine, Calif., lies what some consider to be the real Magic Kingdom: Traveland U.S.A., billed as the world's largest sales lot for recreational vehicles. **********A few miles south of Disneyland on Interstate 5, in Irvine, Calif., lies what some consider to be the real Magic Kingdom: Traveland U.S.A., billed as the world's largest sales lot for recreational vehicles. **********Spanning 35 outdoor acres - as much as eight Manhattan blocks - Traveland has more than two dozen independent dealers selling motor homes, travel trailers, converted vans and other recreational vehicles costing several thousand to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Itasca Windcruisers and Georgie Boy Cruisemasters gleam in the California sun, beckoning to those who dream of an open highway ahead, a loved one at their side and a shower and bed in back. **********Even as RV makers vie for customers with conveniences like videocassette recorders and microwave ovens, the crowds at the RV lots have thinned. Sales peaked at 427,300 in 1988, slipping to 395,700 last year. Analysts say a slowing economy deserves much of the blame. Some also criticize RV marketing and design, which seem to advance as slowly as a motor home chugging up the Continental Divide in a gale-force headwind. **********Motor homes - large, self-propelled coaches - are the most expensive recreational vehicles, starting at $35,000. Then come trailer units, including folding campers, and converted vans, which accounted for half of all RV's sold in 1989. Some classify the vans as a separate industry, because they are sold through different dealers and often lack the amenities of other RV's. **********The typical recreational vehicle customers are like Clarence Callear, 69, and his wife Gloria, 47, of Simi Valley, Calif., with cash to spend and time to spend it. They are planning to drive all the way to Alaska. **********''We like to go traveling and this is like having a little house on wheels,'' Mrs. Callear said after inspecting a Rexhall on the Traveland lot. **********William J. Rex, president of Rexhall Industries Inc., a small California manufacturer, knows his customers well. They tend to be affluent blue-collar families, known in the industry as ''Mr. and Mrs. Folks.'' As Mr. Rex puts it, ''We're talking Middle America; a good old guy and his wife who have some grown kids. The average buyer of a motor home is over 50, and over 50 percent of the time they pay cash.'' **********The Industry Leader **********Still Susceptible To Economy's Whims **********In a fragmented business with hundreds of manufacturers, Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. of Riverside, Calif., stands out like a motor home parked among motorcycles. The company, the industry's largest with about 29 percent of motor home and trailer sales, competes in almost every RV category but vans. Fleetwood has grown much more rapidly than the industry through financial might - it also has a large manufactured home business - and a strong dealer network. ''They've been innovative in design, adding new features, and they have been successful in holding down their costs,'' said Robert Curran, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. **********But Fleetwood is not immune to industry gyrations. The company's sales depend heavily on the economy and the availability of fuel. Sales plunged in 1974 during the oil embargo and again in 1980 during the Iranian Revolution. They hurtled upward as the economy boomed in 1984, but fell when consumer confidence weakened in 1986. ''These cycles are a combination of economics, gasoline shortages, high interest rates, consumer sentiment and satisfying demand,'' said David R. Marriner, Fleetwood's treasurer. **********Fleetwood's sales set a record of $1.05 billion for the year ending in April 1989, then declined 7 percent to $978 billion for the most recent year. ''For two years people have been just flat out expecting a recession,'' Mr. Marriner said. ''So they backed off. We expect the industry to be flat this year and probably for the first part of 1991.'' **********Fleetwood has fared much better than the second-largest RV maker, Winnebago Industries Inc., which has less than half Fleetwood's revenues. Analysts say that Winnebago has been troubled by frequent changes of command and a troubled foray into satellite communications. **********The industry as a whole has hit a major slowdown in the last year and a half as consumers delayed major purchases. Almost 8.5 million recreational vehicles cruise the nation's highways, with as many as 400,000 more, worth $9 billion at retail, shipped to dealers every year. But according to the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association, shipments through April of this year fell 6.7 percent. **********A Transition Time **********Reaching 'the Folks' And Baby Boomers **********The new decade may bring a record number of potential buyers. The Recreational Vehicle Industry Association predicts that the prime RV-buying age group of 45-54 year olds will increase 23 percent by 1995, another 18 percent by 2000. ''With the Baby Boom reaching its 50's in huge numbers in the next 10 years, we are really going to have some opportunity,'' said Fred G. Emmert, senior vice president of marketing at the Holiday Rambler Corporation, a subsidiary of Harley-Davidson Inc. **********But will all these new 50-year-olds buy? Maybe not, says Morton J. Marcus, director of a center at the University of Indiana School of Business to study the state's industries. Today, when both spouses work, vacation time is precious, and inexpensive airfares make it more convenient to fly, he said. Most of those born after the war have spent less time outdoors than their parents. ''Many of the people who bought RV's in the '50s and '60s bought on their experiences as children,'' he said. **********Then there are all the other competing forms of recreation. ''There is the boating industry, the hotel destination resort industry, even things like large home entertainment systems,'' said Elden L. Smith, a senior vice president at Fleetwood. ''You aren't going to spend $3,000 or $4,000 and then leave home on the weekends.'' **********The market is changing, but the sales pitch isn't, say some analysts. The Recreational Vehicle Industry Association's major marketing effort is a travelogue show on cable television's Nashville Network. Fleetwood has forged marketing links with Walt Disney World, a favorite RV destination. Many manufacturers sponsor owner clubs, and local dealers hold weekend RV shows. **********But manufacturers have made few attempts to entice younger buyers. Most of their mass-market advertising is in RV magazines, with almost no national advertising to convince a new generation that the open roads can be as exhilarating as a Club Med. **********''It is quite true that baby boomers are different types of consumers,'' said Dr. Richard Curtin, a University of Michigan professor who studies RV ownership. ''But the market is at an awkward time, when the primary buyers of new RVs are not yet part of the baby boom generation. The industry has to walk a tightrope and not alienate mainstay customers. The marketing transition will be slow.'' **********RV executives themselves say members of this generation are more active and affluent than their parents, and likely to be better customers. The trick will be convincing them to regard an American RV as a status symbol equal to a plush imported car. Mr. Rex says the new generation can have it both ways: ''I've heard that baby boomers want BMW's, not motor homes, but I think they'll just tow that BMW behind it.'' **********A Lack of Innovation **********Sticking With That Boxy Shape **********Recreation vehicle research and design progress as slowly as RV marketing. RV designs are likely to remain boxy because a squared-off configuration offers the most storage space and the chassis the industry uses allow little flexibility. All manufacturers buy chassis, complete with engines and steering wheels, primarily from Ford, General Motors and John Deere, then build frames over them, mostly by hand. **********Most manufacturers content themselves to improve on the basic, recognizable RV design. The most recent breakthrough came a while ago, in 1985, after John Crean, Fleetwood's chairman, drove a company motor home across the country. He decided to create a basement storage area by raising the interior floor a foot above the chassis. Competitors quickly copied the idea. **********Recreational vehicle designers say that besides a lot of storage, most buyers crave conveniences like microwave ovens and energy-efficient power sources. ''Ten years ago, a standby generator could make all the noise it wanted,'' said Mr. Emmert of Holiday Rambler. ''You didn't worry about heat dissipation or how precise the frequency of electricity was. Now the RV industry has demanded that these generators be quiet, fuel-efficient and their frequency response be narrow. We've got VCR's and TV sets and computers on board and they can't stand the energy spikes.'' New features, but in the familiar, reassuring, RV settting. Said Mr. Emmert, ''That's the kind of gradual change the industry is experiencing.'' **********The Comforts Of Home **********The price of a Ferrari, the size of a bus - top-of-the-line motor homes are mansions on wheels. **********Take the $300,000 Marquis, made by Beaver Coaches Inc. of Bend, Ore. Forty feet long and diesel-fueled, it is built expressly for people who spend at least half their lives on the road. Inside are two television sets, a full kitchen, a bedroom with queen-sized bed and jacuzzi. No major engine work should be needed before a quarter-million miles, says Marcus Vucinivic, Beaver's sales manager. The company sells 90 a year. **********Not good enough? Try the Beaver Coach, a $450,000 recreational vehicle that is actually a converted bus. Favored by rock stars and other entertainers, the Coach has a huge 450 horsepower engine. Every vehicle's interior is custom designed. Satellite dishes, skylights, marble counters and oak flooring are popular options. Beaver sells 18 a year.

Baker 3d struck with Moscow last week, dismissing as groundless criticism from the Republican right wing that Mr. Baker made too many concessions. **********A senior Administration official, briefing reporters in the White House before next week's summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, focused in particular on criticism of the Administration's handling of the question of how to limit Soviet SS-18 heavy missiles. **********In his talks in Moscow last week, Mr. Baker and the Soviets resolved most of the other key differences holding up the proposed treaty limiting long-range nuclear weapons, leaving only the problem of SS-18 modernization and a few others to be worked out. But the fact that on SS-18's, the most dangerous in the Soviet arsenal, Mr. Baker proposed a limited concession to Moscow in hopes of tying up the treaty now, has enraged some Republican conservatives. **********''We are strong, and just at the moment when we are strong, we are making concessions.'' said Richard N. Perle, who served as an Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, and has added his voice to that of the Wall Street Journal editorial page and several conservative columnists in attacking the deal being negotiated by Mr. Baker. ''Any American official making concessions to the Soviets today has to explain himself, as much as would any corporation which made a deposit in a crumbling savings and loan.'' **********Reductions Agreed **********The Soviets have already agreed to reduce by 50 percent their arsenal of SS-18's - each of which carry 10 warheads - from 308 missiles to 154. The Kremlin, however, has been insisting that no restrictions be placed on its ability to modernize the 154 that would be left. Critics of the Administration point out that since the negotiations began in 1982 the Soviets have already modernized their SS-18 arsenal - they are currently deploying the SS-18 Model 5 - in a way that has made the missiles so accurate that they can get by with half the number, without any serious dimunition of their overall firepower. **********Therefore, they argue, the treaty must make certain that their existing SS-18's cannot be upgraded, and for years American negotiators did insist that the Soviets freeze modernization as part of the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. **********For the first time, the Administration official confirmed today that Mr. Baker in Moscow offered a minor compromise on SS-18's that would allow for limited modernization, but, he argued, it would be so limited as to not allow the Soviets to ever seriously upgrade the missile from its present capabilities. **********Called a Minor Incentive **********Considering the concessions to Washington Moscow has already made on SS-18's - accepting a 50 percent cut with no similar cut by the United States - what Mr. Baker offered was a minor incentive for the Kremlin designed to help lock in the treaty right now, the official said. **********''It is a truism that agreements can only be reached if they are acceptable to both sides,'' the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said. ''So the bargaining process, especially in the final phase, will inevitably involve tradeoffs in which we take steps to meet Soviet concerns in return for their acceptance of our requirements. **********''We are not making concessions in arms control as a means of 'helping Gorbachev.' We are making sound proposals, fully examined in Washington and supported by our military leaders, aimed at closing out agreements very much in the United States interests.'' **********On SS-18's, the previous American position, the official said, ''is to ban all production, all modernization, all flight testing of heavy ICBM's.'' What Mr. Baker indicated in Moscow was some flexibility in that position which would allow the Soviets to build a limited number of their modernized SS-18's and to conduct a limited number of flight tests. **********'So It's a Cap' **********If the Soviets can be induced to agree to this - and thus far they have not -the official said, ''that would mean that instead of being able to go on and produce something beyond the Mod 5, it would be Mod 5 and no more; stop.'' **********The official continued: ''If you can get the Soviets to agree on a limit on flight tests so you can only do one or two or three or some number like that a year, what that says to the Soviets is, 'Okay, you can do enough flight testing to preserve the reliability of your current SS-18's, but you can't do enough flights that you can go off and develop yet another one.' So it's a cap. **********''Remember where we already are,'' the official concluded. ''The Soviets have 308 heavy ICBM's. They have agreed to unilaterally cut that number in half, to 154, okay? We've got that nailed; that's in the can. What's at issue now is what else we can get on SS-18's.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/19/world/evolution-europe-lithuanians-say-moscow-has-cut-main-oil-pipeline-growing.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1512, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Growing Pressure", "print_headline": "EVOLUTION IN EUROPE: LITHUANIANS SAY MOSCOW HAS CUT MAIN OIL PIPELINE;   Growing Pressure", "body_text": " **********After a confusing day of threats and denials, Lithuania reported tonight that the Soviet authorities had cut off the principal supply of oil to the republic as part of the Kremlin's campaign to force Lithuania to retreat from its declaration of independence. **********The Lithuanian information office said the pipeline supply of crude oil to the Mazeikiai refinery in the northwest of the republic was cut off at 9:30 P.M. Vilnius time, five minutes after notice was telephoned to the plant in the name of Kremlin officials. On Tuesday, Lithuania said it had been warned that the supply would be halted today in keeping with an ultimatum issued by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last Friday. **********Search for a Solution **********Even as the announcement came, it was clear that attempts to find a solution to the crisis were continuing. During the day in Vilnius, the Lithuanian Parliament offered a conciliatory gesture to the Kremlin by voting to refrain from enacting new laws for two weeks if Moscow agreed to begin preliminary consultations on the independence campaign. **********But the Parliament also said that it ''confirms its loyalty to the acts of March 11,'' when the Parliament declared independence and suspended the Soviet Constitution. [Text of the Parliament's resolution and letter to Mr. Gorbachev, page A10.]  There was no confirmation in Moscow tonight that the ultimatum threatening an oil cutoff had, in fact, been carried out. **********Signs of Pressure **********Its enactment would signal a far higher level of pressure from Mr. Gorbachev than has previously been seen in the five-week-long sovereignty crisis and would also increase the calls in other nations for retaliatory economic measures against the Soviet Union. [In Washington, the Bush Administration said that until it could confirm reports of the cutoff it would not have any response. The reports came only a few hours after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told a Congressional committee that the United States would consider severing certain commercial arrangements with the Soviet Union if Mr. Gorbachev continued tightening a economic noose around Lithuania. Page A10.]  Soviet officials denied earlier today that orders for a cutoff had yet gone out. But managers at Mazeikiai, the sole refinery in Lithuania, said tonight that the pipeline supply from the city of Polotsk in the republic of Byelorussia in the western Soviet Union was finally stopped tonight. **********Resolve Called Deeper **********''The Soviet Union, being unable to find a humane solution, is resorting to economic coercion against a neighboring country,'' the Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, said after receiving the news and vowing that the pressure would only deepen the republic's commitment to independence. **********There was no immediate indication of how long the reported cutoff might continue. The struggle between the Kremlin and the republic has been marked by steady psychological pressure and changing Kremlin tactics, with alternate waxing and waning of the sense of crisis. **********The reported cutoff of oil itself would presumably mean no immediate industrial hardship or shortage of refined oil in the republic, because Lithuanian officials estimated earlier this week that there was a stockpile of up to four months of crude oil with which to continue operations in the event of a cutoff. **********Plant officials confirmed tonight that work was continuing after the pipeline inflow fully stopped, about an hour after a decrease was first evident. **********Lithuanian officials quoted plant officials on the night shift as reporting that the authorizatiofofor the toppage was gngned by uhe Soviet Primeininister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, under a resolution of the Council of Ministers. **********A 48-Hour Ultimatum **********On Friday, just before the long Easter weekend, President Gorbachev issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the Landsbergis government to repeal a series of independence laws or face reductions in supplies from the rest of the Soviet Union. On Monday, the Lithuanians had responded to the ultimatum with an offer of talks on central issues mentioned in the ultimatum. **********Before the cutoff, a Soviet deputy oil and gas industry minister, Aklim Mukhamedzyanov, said in a telephone interview that ''allegations that these supplies have been terminated are completely groundless. **********''We have received no instructions from the Council of Ministers to implement such measures,'' he said. **********Republic Dependent for Energy **********With no fuel resources of its own, Lithuania is completely dependent on the crude oil, natural gas and petroleum shipped in from the Soviet Union, and panicked citizens have been lining up daily at gas stations around the republic to fill up their cars and trucks. There was no sign today of a cutoff of natural gas, which had also been threatened. **********The Mazeikiai refinery processed almost 13 million tons of oil last year. About 7 million tons of that was used in Lithuania, while the remainder was sent to the other Baltic republics and elsewhere. Small amounts also are sold into northwestern Europe through Hamburg, West Germany. **********Lithuania imports 97 percent of the fuel it consumes, with nearly half of the total supplied by oil produced in other Soviet republics that is used to heat and power Lithuanian factories. Factories and other industrial activities also run on coal. Homes are heated mainly by natural gas. Lithuania does produce some energy at a nuclear power station at Ignalina and in some small hydroelectric stations. **********Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Ryzhkov threatened Lithuania on friday with a cut-off of critical supplies if the Parliament there did not revoke within 48 hours recently passed legislation, including a call to boycott the Soviet spring military call-up and the introduction of mandatory citizen identity cards. **********The ultimatum from Moscow did not include a demand that the republic revoke its declaration of independence, made March 11, a move the republic has repeatedly rejected. **********A Gesture to Moscow **********Lithuania's Parliament, in a conciliatory gesture to the Kremlin, voted unanimously today to refrain from passing new laws for two weeks if Moscow agrees to begin preliminary consultations about the republic's drive for independence. The Parliament's resolution did not specifically mention the status of laws passed since the independence declaration, except to say the Parliament supports a statement made Monday by the Lithuanian Prime Minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene. **********In that statement, the first sign that the republic was willing to compromise with Moscow, Mrs. Prunskiene sent a telegram to the Soviet leadership saying that Lithuania would not stand in the way of Lithuanian men willing to serve in the army and would not take action against Soviet citizens choosing to stay in the republic while maintaining their soviet citizenship.

The delegation is to be led by Bronius Kuzmickas, deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Parliament. **********In the one critical note raised in the letter, the Parliament says it ''regrets the position and methods chosen by the U.S.S.R.'' during the current crisis. **********Mr. Gorbachev issued his ultimatum to Lithuania after a month of steadily increasing threats and warnings that Lithuania must rescind its declaration and all subsequent legislation. Moscow has maintained that Lithuania and all other Soviet republics are free to secede from the Soviet Union provided they follow guidelines recently adopted by the national Parliament in Moscow, which include a referendum requiring a two-thirds vote to approve secession, a transition period running a minimum of five years and approval by the Congress of People's Deputies, the full Soviet Parliament. **********Lithuanian officials insist that they are seeking not to secede, but rather to re-establish the independence that was lost in 1940, when Lithuania and the neighboring Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union by Stalin. **********As the Parliament worked today on a political solution to the stalemate with Moscow, Mrs. Prunskiene and the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Algirdas Saudargas, left for a trip to Norway, trying to find practical help for the fledgling republic through foreign investors and economic aid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/29/business/talking-deals-group-may-gain-control-of-penrod.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1990-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1031, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Talking Deals;   Group May Gain Control of Penrod", "print_headline": "Talking Deals;   Group May Gain Control of Penrod", "body_text": " **********WITH the Hunt brothers of Texas removed from any role in the Penrod Drilling Corporation, a syndicate of 10 banks and an investor group headed by Richard E. Rainwater are expected to decide soon who will control the world's largest offshore oil and gas driller. If events work out, the group led by the Fort Worth investor may end up controlling the company for far less than rival bidders have offered to buy it outright. **********Several bidders for Penrod have emerged: The Tisch family has offered $450 million; the Rowan Companies, a Houston-based driller, offered $325 million; a Norwegian group has made a bid, and others higher than $500 million have been reported. But the Rainwater group may find that after negotiating with Penrod's creditors, its $95 million investment for a 27 percent stake in the company is enough to give it operating control. **********The Rainwater-controlled Energy Service Company, a drilling company that is part of the Penrod investment group, is pushing for a recapitalization of Penrod that might include a public sale of common shares. Other drillers, including Odeco and the Western Company of North America, have been successful in selling stock in the last year, and a Penrod offering could draw a large crowd. **********Penrod's lenders, headed by Manufacturers Hanover and First Chicago, could thus avoid new write-offs, recoup some past losses and have a role in whatever recovery unfolds in the coming years in the drilling industry. **********Values for used drilling rigs are up more than 50 percent in the last year, to $16 million for models operating in 250 feet of water. Penrod has 39 offshore rigs, and 45 more rigs used for drilling on land. With oil prices firming, drilling budgets rising at big oil companies and prospects for further increases in the rigs' value, many Penrod lenders are unwilling to sell their notes at a discount, people close to the situation said. **********Founded more than 60 years ago by H.L. Hunt, who was considered the world's richest man when he died in 1974, debt-laden Penrod has been starved for cash since oil prices plunged four years ago and leading oil companies pulled the plug on their drilling budgets. **********At first, three of Mr. Hunt's sons who controlled Penrod, William Herbert, Nelson Bunker and Lamar Hunt, filed costly lawsuits to stall the banks' attempt to seize rigs to cover more than $750 million in unpaid loans. In a partial truce two years ago, the banks wrote off $250 million of the loans in exchange for 50 percent of Penrod's stock. **********Last week, with a March 31 deadline looming for the first of 32 consecutive quarterly principal payments on $525 million in remaining principal and accrued interest, and Penrod's cash flow still depressed, the Hunts handed over the rest of their holdings. **********The note holders, including the Rainwater group, agreed to drop a potential claim on up to $300 million in future profits from the Placid Oil Company, which the brothers still control. **********The lenders' improving prospects at Penrod made their claim on Placid profits less important than removing the Hunts from the bargaining table at Penrod, said Russell E. Miller, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore. **********The Rainwater group, a partnership consisting of Energy Service; Goldman, Sachs; Mr. Rainwater, and others, had paid $95 million to acquire $135 million of the Penrod bank debt, or 27 percent of the total, before the Hunts' departure last week. The Rainwater group's stock holding in Penrod has now doubled, to 27 percent. **********Mr. Rainwater, once the principal deal maker for the Bass family, also of Fort Worth, entered the industry three years ago when he acquired a large stake in Blocker Energy. Blocker's debt-laden balance sheet was later restructured and the company's name was changed to Energy Service, or Ensco. Mr. Rainwater owns 21 percent. **********Ensco operates in the Middle East, South America, Canada and the United States and has five offshore rigs and 24 land rigs. The company, which is listed on the American Stock Exchange, earned $2.6 million on $158.5 million in sales last year. It is also a supplier in the growing market of horizontal drilling equipment. **********Does Mr. Rainwater intend to use the 27 percent stake in Penrod to squeeze more money from other Penrod bidders eventually? Or is he trying to become a catalyst for a reshaping of the world's offshore oil industry? **********Mr. Miller of Alex. Brown said the Rainwater group was bargaining with each bank, searching for agreements either to acquire the debt or for the banks to ease the 1988 repayment terms and allow Ensco to take command of Penrod operations. **********Others in the industry are not so sure. Two years ago, a Rainwater group delayed for several months the takeover by Halliburton Inc. of Gearheart Industries, a cash-short maker of gauges and other equipment used in testing well sites. Halliburton eventually paid $67 million for Gearhart debt that the Rainwater group had acquired for $33 million. **********Still, control of Penrod could prove far more lucrative. Unlike most sectors of the oil industry, offshore drilling did not contract through bankruptcies, mergers and takeovers after prices collapsed in 1986, said James L. Carroll, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc., in New York. Many companies still have more debt than future revenues are likely to cover, he added. **********''Whatever happens to the Penrod assets is very important to the whole offshore industry,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''If it ends up in the hands of other operators, you could see the beginnings of a major consolidation. This means whoever gets Penrod is going to be in an instant leadership position.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/14/business/patents-using-a-gene-to-prevent-crop-spoilage.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1990-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents;   Using a Gene To Prevent Crop Spoilage", "print_headline": "Patents;   Using a Gene To Prevent Crop Spoilage", "body_text": " **********A biotechnology company in New Jersey won a patent this week for a method of preventing fruits and vegetables from spoiling by using genetic engineering to enhance their natural defenses against fungus. **********Developed by researchers at the DNA Plant Technology Corporation in Cinnaminson, N.J., the method is designed to protect crops during the long trip from farm to market.

The officials, who were interviewed in the last three weeks, insisted on anonymity. **********Discussions about the future of those outposts are already under way, the officials said. American intelligence officials and private experts said a decision on the installations could come within one or two years. **********Reunification Speeds Changes **********United States officials have said for some time that the easing of tensions in Eastern Europe would lead to changes before the end of the decade in the American intelligence presence along the postwar frontier between East and West. But the changes are being forced much more quickly than had been anticipated by the rush toward reunification of the two Germanys. **********West Germany is the locus of American espionage operations along the old dividing line in Europe. Some American eavesdropping posts in Berlin exist under a postwar military agreement between the four victorious powers that presumably will be repealed before the two Germanys merge politically. **********Other American intelligence operations inside West Germany are conducted under agreements between the two nations that are expected to survive reunification. But many of the operations are aimed at East Germany or at Soviet troops based there, and West Germany already has made it clear that most if not all of those operations must cease once unification is achieved. **********''Their cooperation with us is based on the idea that across the inter-German border is a hostile power and a hostile intelligence establishment,'' a Bush Administration official said in an interview. ''Now they're realizing that doesn't exist anymore. And the first thing to disappear is our targeting against that territory.'' **********Effect of German Elections **********The retrenchment could be speeded if West Germany's Social Democrats score a political victory over Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Conservative Party in national elections in December, American officials indicated. **********The Social Democrats would be far less sympathetic to United States operations against the Soviets or against Communist elements within the old Warsaw Pact alliance, those officials noted. **********But a German official said that some joint operations will probably continue indefinitely, including those ''against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, as long as it exists.'' Operations against nonpolitical targets like terrorists and drug dealers may well expand. **********Some American electronic listening posts will also be recycled to monitor arms-control agreements and to collect data from new, mutually chosen targets, the German official added. **********''I don't think anyone knows what parts can be used as before, and what parts have a need for new targets,'' he said. ''You can use these facilities in different ways - to look more at developments on a political level, and to focus more directly on military things. **********''Some of these techniques will not work because of our legal situation,'' he said, referring to West Germany's strict controls on domestic surveillance, which are similar to those of the United States. **********Americans Debate the Haste **********In the United States, officials differ over whether the discussions on dismantling surveillance posts are a natural result of improved international relations or an overly hasty reaction to political developments that, while promising, are still in flux. **********The bulk of American operations against the old Eastern bloc are aimed at penetrating Soviet military operations or detecting preparations for a Warsaw Pact invasion. As that threat recedes, some American officials say, the need for a large intelligence presence should also diminish. **********But some United States officials are said to fear that operations may be shut down before the military dangers have ebbed. Officials at the National Security Agency, which controls electronic intelligence gathering, were said to be among those most troubled by that prospect. **********''Their only concern is to keep the information flowing,'' an Administration official said. ''If you come to the conclusion that these facilities that they've obviously worked so laboriously to create aren't going to be needed, well, they don't even care to think about that.'' **********Sophisticated Eavesdropping **********Although the National Security Agency's most productive eavesdropping operations are largely conducted elsewhere, some of the German posts at issue are among its most sophisticated anywhere. **********The primary post, a United States Army facility called Field Station Berlin, is said to monitor Warsaw Pact military operations throughout East Germany and in parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia. It is also a testing ground for new eavesdropping equipment and techniques. The Air Force runs operations for signals gathering and reconnaissance from Tempelhof Air Base in Berlin. **********Other United States facilities in West Germany are said to monitor Soviet activities deep inside Eastern Europe. **********West German and American officials acknowledge that the United States has collected information, by electronic and other means, on some West German targets that Washington regards as a threat to national security. **********The talks on listening posts presage a much broader debate over the future role of American intelligence in Europe should the Soviet conventional military threat continue to fade. **********Old Relationships Cooling **********Intelligence officials in other Western countries are already questioning whether the United States needs an intelligence presence on their territory now that the Eastern bloc threat appears to be receding, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma, said earlier this month. **********American officials say the United States expects its unusually close intelligence relationship with West Germany, carefully fostered since the end of World War II, to cool as the Germans become a European superpower with interests separate from those of the United States. **********Almost from the moment of Hitler's collapse in 1945, Germany has been an arena for the world's major espionage services. Their first tasks after the war included rounding up suspected Nazi war criminals, recruiting rocket scientists and competing for the members and dossiers of Germany's intelligence agencies. **********With the political division of Germany and Berlin between Western and Communist forces in 1949, that competition increased. Germany was viewed as the likeliest theater of combat between the Soviet bloc and the West, and intelligence services were considered the first line of Western defense. **********Scene of Swaps and Betrayals **********An official history compiled by the Senate indicates that in 1952, the Central Intelligence Agency was conducting 40 covert operations simultaneously out of West Germany, most of them directed against targets in East Germany. For the last four decades, many of the most spectacular East-West espionage stories involving spy swaps, defections and betrayals have been set in Germany. **********The United States and West Germany have long conducted joint intelligence operations against the Warsaw Pact and shared much of the intelligence on Eastern Europe that each nation gathered separately. **********But with East Germany and the Soviet Union assuming new roles, the interests of the United States and West Germany in gathering and using intelligence against the old Eastern bloc are about to diverge, a senior American official said in a recent interview."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/21/world/israel-halts-us-radio-relay-to-study-negev-environment.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 509, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israel Halts U.S. Radio Relay To Study Negev Environment", "print_headline": "Israel Halts U.S. Radio Relay To Study Negev Environment", "body_text": " **********Israel has decided to suspend work on a Voice of America radio relay station in the Negev for two years to allow completion of an environmental study, causing the United States to express disappointment in a statement today. **********On Tuesday night, Israel's National Planning Board voted not to approve plans for the powerful relay station until a study to determine the effect of its electromagnetic waves on migratory birds is finished, even though Israel and the United States agreed to build the station two years ago. **********Thousands of birds from Europe migrate to Africa across the Arava Valley in the Negev. **********A brief statement released by the United States Embassy in Tel Aviv today said that the American Government was ''disappointed in Tuesday's decision by the planning board.'' **********Goals Are Questioned **********''The reasons for implementing the V.O.A. agreement signed by our two nations in 1987 remain valid,'' the statement added. **********Opponents of the relay station say the station's original goal - to boost broadcasts of Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe - is irrelevant, given the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. **********But the American statement said ''events in Eastern Europe and elsewhere have underscored the major role international radio can play in fostering democracy.'' **********Ground-breaking ceremonies for the station were held early this year, and workers have spent months rerouting a highway that cut through its designated area.

Federated is based in Cincinnati. **********''We have 45 days in which to evaluate whether the details of time spent and activities involved in the retainers are adequate,'' Mr. Morgenstern said in a telephone interview from Cleveland. ''This is a novel issue in our view because it hasn't to our knowledge come up before in bankruptcy situations.'' **********Mr. Morgenstern was said to have been instrumental in pushing for a detailed breakdown by investment bankers. His findings on the lists, according to lawyers involved, will be influential in any disputes in the matter. **********''Each lawyer must keep a daily record specifying service time spent on as many as 30 different categories of matters involved in the Federated bankruptcy,'' Mr. Rosenbloom said. Such categories include the question of whether litigation involving the debtor company before the bankruptcy can be renewed afterward; consideration of store leaseholds under the bankruptcy code, and payment for professionals in bankruptcy cases. **********Shearson Lehman reported the highest fees in the Federated case, about $250,000 a month, Mr. Rosenbloom said. Lazard Freres, which represents the bondholders of Allied Stores (a division of Federated Stores), gets $150,000 a month. And Smith Barney, representing the pre-merger bondholders, gets $100,000 a month. **********Both Allied and Federated were acquired by the Campeau Corporation, the Toronto-based developer, in 1986 and 1988, respectively. The American arm, known as Campeau U.S., which operated both Allied and Federated stores, was renamed Federated Stores Inc., several months ago. **********In a separate issue, the question of whether Shearson Lehman Hutton should be allowed to continue to advise Federated arose before Judge Aug, who ruled that the New York-based investment banker could be retained. The issue was raised because Shearson had been a lead underwriter of 11 issues of securities before the Federated acquisition by Campeau. **********But Mr. Morgenstern, exercising the trustee's responsibility, is contesting Judge Aug's decision and has filed an appeal. ''The Bankruptcy Court erred in approving Shearson's employment,'' Mr. Morgenstern said in his appeal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/21/business/company-news-lotus-continues-suit-on-software.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lotus Continues Suit on Software", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Lotus Continues Suit on Software", "body_text": " **********The Lotus Development Corporation went to trial against Mosaic Software, a small company accused of imitating Lotus's 1-2-3 business spreadsheet program. **********The case marked an extension of a trial Lotus won earlier this year against Paperback Software International of Berkeley, Calif.

But the President also hinted that if Jordan cooperated with the embargo, the United States would help compensate it for the economic suffering that sanctions would cause. **********Seeking Aid for Jordan **********American officials said Tuesday that the United States was also pressing West Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia to help offset financial losses by Jordan and by Syria. **********The stated purpose of the Presidential news conference was to talk about the Federal budget, and Mr. Bush lambasted Democrats on Capitol Hill for their attitude in negotiations on the Federal deficit. [Page A21.]  But the focus shifted to the Middle East. King Hussein is under domestic pressure to keep Aqaba open. Amman imports 90 percent of its oil from Iraq and sends 40 percent of its total exports to Iraq. In addition, Jordan's large Palestinian population is sympathetic to the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, whom they see as a champion of the have-nots. **********Doubts on Workable Formula **********Reports in several Middle Eastern capitals said the King was carrying a letter to Mr. Bush from President Hussein, whom he met in Baghdad on Monday. **********ABC News, in a report from Baghdad, said that Foreign Ministry officials said the letter conveyed that President Hussein would like direct contact with United States officials and a sign that negotiation remains a possibilty. CBS News, citing unnamed Jordanian sources, said the message called for an international conference to discuss terms for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait in exchange for a freeze on the buildup of United States forces in Saudi Arabia, which has passed the 20,000 mark. **********But two ranking Administration officials said they had no reason to believe that a workable peace formula would be produced by Mr. Bush's meeting with King Hussein, scheduled for Thursday at the President's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me. The King arrived at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington early today. **********Mr. Bush himself, speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday as he took a brief hiatus from his 25-day holiday, said he saw no prospects for a diplomatic solution to the crisis until sanctions had bitten deeply enough to convince the Iraqis ''that they've got to get out of Kuwait, and they've got to let the rightful rulers return to Kuwait.'' Iraq annexed Kuwait last week. **********Although the President deflected questions on the subject, aides said he had agreed to try to work out a plan under which American warships and those of other nations, some already committed to the blockade and others not, could operate under United Nations auspices. **********Idea Discussed at Meeting **********The idea, first broached several days ago by the Soviet Union, was discussed at a meeting at the State Department among officials of the five nations with permanent seats on the Security Council - the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. **********Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d were said to see the plan, which could involve a joint command or ships under separate commands all flying the United Nations flag, as an opportunity to involve Moscow in concerted international action, if complex problems of coordination could be resolved. **********With American paratroopers moving into joint positions with Saudi soldiers to defend crucial oilfields, Pentagon officials said the Administration was considering a partial mobilization of the reserves. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a veterans' group in Atlanta that the President had the authority to call up as many as 200,000 members of the National Guard or reserve forces. **********Mr. Bush is to meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other officers at the Pentagon today before returning to Maine, and the question of the reserves could come up then. **********U.S. Focuses on Aqaba **********Although rules of engagement have not been issued for the blockade of Iraqi commerce, which the Administration prefers to call an interdiction, Mr. Cheney said that ''we are watching all traffic that may be headed for Iraqi ports or may have cargo intended for Iraq.'' Among a handful of ships under surveillance, officials said, is the Iraqi-flag Balqees, believed to be carrying a cargo of tanks, engines and other military equipment from Gdynia in Poland to an unknown port in the Middle East. **********The biggest worry for those trying to complete the economic encirclement of Iraq is the port of Aqaba, which lies at the head of an arm of the Red Sea. It is linked to Baghdad by a highway and a small pipeline, the last functioning outlet for Iraqi oil. **********During the Iran-Iraq war, much of Iraq's war materiel and food flowed through Aqaba. It is easily accessible to the Mediterranean Sea through the Gulf of Suez and the Suez Canal, which Egypt declined today to close to Iraqi shipping, although Cairo is the leader of the group of Arab nations that have sent troops to Saudi Arabia to deter an Iraqi invasion. **********A dozen ships were berthed at Aqaba on Tuesday or anchored offshore. While it was impossible to establish the destination of all the cargoes, John Prescott, a London shipping specialist, said he had been told that at least three of the ships carried goods bound for Baghdad. **********The Associated Press reported from the Ruweishid border post, on the main highway linking Baghdad and Aqaba, that an unusually large number of heavy trucks and tankers were crossing from Jordan into Iraq. Military officials in Washington confirmed that Iraqi trade through Aqaba appeared to be proceeding at a brisk pace. **********Mutasem Belbeisi, an under secretary at the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, said that although the United Nations sanctions voted on Aug. 6 were binding on all member states, ''every country whose economy can be severely affected can consult with the Security Council to see what measures could be adopted and what sanctions could be imposed, if any.'' He said such consultations were under way in New York. **********Israel to Take No Action **********Israel, whose port of Eilat also lies at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, just a few miles down the coast from Aqaba, said it would take no action to interefere with Iraqi shipping through Aqaba. Only if Iraqi troops move into Jordan, officials said, will Israel become involved in the crisis. **********So far, the blockade, to which American, British and Australian vessels have been committed, has not had a significant test. Arab harbormasters in the Persian Gulf turned away two Iraqi freighters, and a British warship stopped a third merchant ship but released it when an inspection showed it to have no cargo. **********The buildup of forces in Saudi Arabia accelerated further with the arrival of the vanguard of Syrian troops. The Syrians joined about 5,000 Egyptians, and contingents from Morocco and possibly Pakistan are expected within a week or so. **********A total of at least 100,000 American ground troops is expected to reach Saudi Arabia in the next month or two, and Mr. Cheney said today that an Iraqi force of 200,000 was now deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq. **********In Kuwait and Iraq, at least 3,000 Americans, by the State Department's estimate, remained trapped. **********Iraqi officials made conflicting statements about the status of the Americans and thousands of other foreigners. ABC News reported that a senior Foreign Ministry official in Baghdad called the Americans in Iraq ''restrictees'' who would have to remain until the crisis was over. And Iraq's Ambassador to Greece said in Athens that they could leave only when ''the threats from the United States and its allies have been eliminated.'' But the Iraqi Ambassador in Washington indicated that the release could come much earlier than that."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/25/world/mideast-tensions-poles-voting-for-a-president-who-can-face-up-to-the-ordeals.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Engelberg", "pub_date": "1990-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1107, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Poles Voting for a President Who Can Face Up to the Ordeals", "print_headline": "MIDEAST TENSIONS; Poles Voting for a President Who Can Face Up to the Ordeals", "body_text": " **********There is wide agreement here that the winner on Sunday in Poland's first direct presidential elections will immediately face difficult political and social choices in the struggle to rebuild the devastated economy. **********The front-runner is Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader, who has been drawing more than 35 percent in public-opinion polls, a showing suggesting that he will win less than the majority of the vote required to avoid a runoff of the top two finishers on Dec. 9. In second place with roughly 25 percent is Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Walesa ally. Running a strong third with somewhat less that 20 percent is Stanislaw Tyminski, an emigre businessman with Canadian and Peruvian citizenship who has emerged as a dark-horse candidate. There are three minor candidates. **********The winner is to succeed Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist general who ordered martial law to crush the Solidarity labor movement and imprisoned Mr. Walesa and Mr. Mazowiecki in December 1981. President Jaruzelski has been eclipsed in the upheaval sweeping Eastern Europe beginning late last year, and he has agreed to step down after just over a year of his six-year term as Poland moves toward full democracy. **********Politically, the new president faces the task of assembling a Government that can hold a working majority in a Parliament that still contains many former Communists. Over the next few months, he will also take part in important decisions as Poland's radical economic-reform program continues, including how much longer to keep alive the huge, money-losing state enterprises that employ thousands of people.  'An Ocean of Problems' **********Nascent political parties will be maneuvering for advantage in next spring's parliamentary elections even as the lawmakers draft a new Constitution that redefines the powers of the presidency. **********\"We are heading into an ocean of problems,\" declared Jacek Merkel, a respected economist who is campaign manager for Mr. Walesa. **********Political analysts say that with their choice of president, Poles will be setting a course for its future. **********Mr. Walesa, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, has said Poland needs a president with broad powers who can intervene at all levels of national life. **********Mr. Mazowiecki, a soft-spoken former journalist who was Mr. Walesa's ally in the Solidarity movement for 10 years, envisions a chief executive whose powers are balanced by other branches of Government. Mazowiecki Urges 'Tolerance' **********Mr. Walesa often touches the chords of Poland's religious and national history. Mr. Mazowiecki has spoken of moving toward Europe and of \"tolerance\" for minorities. **********Many uncertainties will confront the new president. **********At present, for instance, his powers are defined by the existing Constitution, drafted under the Communists, which allows the president to veto legislation and appoint a prime minister. There are also provisions for issuing emergency decrees. Mr. Walesa has made conflicting statements about how he would use these powers. **********The Constitution is now being rewritten and will probably be approved by the new Parliament elected next spring. **********Supporters of both candidates agree that whoever wins the presidency will soon be asking Poles to swallow further bitter economic medicine. Government economic forecasts predict a doubling of unemployment from one million to two million by the end of 1991.  'Shock Privatiization' Urged **********Walesa strategists seem to want the process to go even faster. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a top Walesa lieutenant, said in an interview recently that Poland needs \"shock privatization\" even if this causes deeper social unrest. **********The new president will face a nation that is becoming increasingly disillusioned. Labor unrest is rising, and veterans of the Solidarity movement see the success of Mr. Tyminski as evidence of how far people's spirits have fallen. **********Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, Poland's last Communist Prime Minister, agrees, and he contended in a recent newspaper interview that Mr. Walesa's courtship of the workers had created unrealistic expectations. \"The Communist dream about the dictatorship of the proletariat is about to come true,\" he asserted. **********Supporters of Mr. Walesa argue that the Solidarity chairman is uniquely positioned to say no to the wage demands of the urban working class and to exhort them to search for new jobs as their state-run employers are restructured. **********\"Of all the leading Polish politicians, I think Walesa has the best chance of giving Polish society this spirit of activation,\" Mr. Merkel said.  Challenge of a Premier **********The first challenge for the new president will be to choose a prime minister who can appoint a cabinet that will have majority support in Parliament. Sixty-five percent of the seats in the lower house are held by former Communists or their allies under an arrangement negotiated between Solidarity and the Communist Government last year before Eastern Europe's upheaval gathered force. **********It will be a delicate, perhaps impossible task. Mr. Walesa recently likened the position of prime minister to a bumper on a car, and he predicted that Poland would need a lot of them in the next few years. **********Mr. Mazowiecki's Government survived in Parliament by forging a shaky alliance with some members of the Peasant's Party and by retaining the united support of the legislators elected under the Solidarity banner. **********With the Solidarity legislators now divided between adherents of Mr. Mazowiecki and Mr. Walesa, it seems clear that the new prime minister will have to look elsewhere for support, possibly by offering the Peasants' Party a stronger voice in the Government. **********Some supporters of Mr. Mazowiecki believe that while they may lose the presidential race, they could regain power in a few months with a strong showing in the coming parliamentary election. Mr. Walesa's backers are also planning to secure an independent political base from those elections.  'It Will Be Very Difficult' **********Mieczyslaw Gil, a pro-Walesa delegate who was recently elected chairman of Solidarity's Citizens' Parliamentary Club, said that for the next few months an alliance supporting Mr. Walesa could be formed with the Peasants' Party and independent lawmakers. \"It will be very difficult,\" he said. \"It will require a lot of political and parliamentary skills.\" **********Mr. Gil recently replaced Bronislaw Geremek, the first chairman of Solidarity legislators, who has been a supporter of Mr. Mazowiecki. **********Rumors are rife in Warsaw about who might become prime minister. One possibility mentioned by both Mr. Walesa and supporters of Mr. Mazowiecki is Leszek Balcerowicz, the current Finance Minister and author of the economic plan. **********Mr. Walesa himself has promised to \"air out\" Warsaw, a statement generally taken as a promise that he will sweep out most of the Mazowiecki Cabinet and bring into prominence such figures as Mr. Merkel. **********Poland has had several free elections in the 20th century in which voters picked members of Parliament who in turn elected a president. Sunday's ballot will be the first time, however, that the president is chosen in an election in which all Poles can vote."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/02/world/typhoon-kills-48-in-china.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Typhoon Kills 48 in China", "print_headline": "Typhoon Kills 48 in China", "body_text": " **********Forty-eight people have been killed and 250 injured by a typhoon, the New China News Agency reported today.

Proponents contend the rule will end trading monopolies that are outdated and inefficient. But some exchange executives say it will only increase costs and confusion for investors. **********A handful of new stock options were listed today on several markets to permit so-called multiple trading, as the exchanges reluctantly began complying with the new S.E.C. regulation. An option gives someone the right to buy or sell 100 shares of a certain stock at a specified price during a specific time period. **********Allowing options to be listed on more than one exchange will increase competition and lower prices to investors, Richard C.

''It is going to build a layer of costs that is totally unnecessary into the marketplace,'' said Alger Chapman, chairman of the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the world's largest options exchange. ''Investors will pay that cost.'' Under the old system, exclusive trading privileges in new stock options were allocated to one of the different exchanges on a rotating basis. With the abolishment of the allocation system, all exchanges are eligible to trade newly listed options. **********Next year, there will be a further easing of restrictions - on trading in existing stock options, not just newly listed options. On Jan. 21, 1991, the Securities and Exchange Commission plans to eliminate all exclusive trading privileges for options. Currently, multiple listing is allowed in over-the-counter stock options. **********''In the long run, it will be beneficial,'' said Tony Miliote, first vice president of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s options department. ''Anything that brings some competition will be good.'' **********New Options **********The American Stock Exchange added four new stock options today, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange added seven. Not all options were listed with different exchanges. **********Both exchanges began trading options in Biogen Inc., Racal Telecom P.L.C. and Sotheby Holdings Inc. The Pacific Board of Trade also began trading in Sotheby options. Of the New York Stock Exchange's five new listings, only one, the Sundstrand Corporation, was a multiple listing. Sundstrand was also listed on the Pacific Board of Trade. **********The Philadelphia Stock Exchange added two new companies, but they were not listed on any other exchanges. **********The S.E.C. is expected to relax standards on new listings within the month, creating dozens of additional new stock options and providing the first real test of the impact of multiple listings. **********Mr. Chapman of the Chicago Board Options Exchange conceded that in the short-term multiple listings would ''tighten the spread'' between the bid and asked price for options with less volume. But Mr. Chapman added, ''The competition doesn't last forever.'' After a month or two, one exchange generally emerges as the dominant market for a specific issue and then the spreads widen again. **********As part of the phase-out of exclusive contracts, exchanges are also permitted to begin trading up to 10 contracts already traded by another exchange.

The goal is to embed such structures with smart-skin technology: networks of fiber-optic sensors that use light pulses to measure the often invisible signs of cracking, bending, stress and overheating. **********A ''smart'' airplane fuselage, for example, would detect microscopic internal cracks and relay signals to a computer that would alert pilots and ground crews. A smart bridge might produce reports on any failing girders, and pipelines would allow gas transmission companies to monitor the ground shifts caused by seasonal changes in remote Arctic regions. **********''You have the opportunity to do vehicle health monitoring that you couldn't do otherwise,'' said Eric Udd, senior staff manager of fiber optics at McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Company, part of McDonnell Douglas Corporation. **********Researchers also believe smart skins could improve the research on and manufacture of structural parts made with advanced composite materials. Engineers could bury sensors in experimental materials while they are being constructed, then plug the samples into signal-processing equipment to search for any internal weaknesses. As envisioned now, the sensors would consist of hair-thin optical fibers - like those now used in long-distance communications - that would relay light signals through a particular structure. If the fiber underwent some form of stress or change in temperature, the light signals would change in measurable ways. Using this principle, optical fibers could register minute changes in position, pressure, temperature, strain and vibration. **********Ultimately, proponents of smart skins would string hundreds or even thousands of such sensors in complex grids covering an entire fuselage or wing. The signals from these grids would then be interpreted by computer to produce up-to-the-second portraits of the structure's health. In an even more advanced system envisioned by some aerospace engineers, on-board computers would identify problems, calculate the necessary adjustments for pilots and even carry out some corrections automatically. **********But even the most enthusiastic proponents agree that smart-skin technology is still embryonic. ''We are just scratching the surface,'' said Donald Bartlett, chief engineer for Boeing Company's two-year-old smart-skins program. Sensors are still quite crude and the development of proper signal processing systems has barely gotten under way. Prototype systems for aircraft are easily five to ten years away, and utilities and gas transmission companies are only beginning to express interest. **********Still, the basic ideas have been demonstrated in laboratories and have attracted serious interest. All of the nation's aerospace companies have launched research efforts in the field, as have the Pentagon, the Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Southern California Edison has decided to install a prototype smart system to monitor stress and fatigue on a steam boiler that drives its electric turbine generators. **********''The proof of principle has been established,'' said John Kreidl, a fiber-optic consultant in Cambridge, Mass. ''The issue is how badly do you want it and how much are you willing to pay for it?'' **********In theory, it has long been possible to build nerve-like systems using existing electronic sensors that measure strain and temperature. But electronic systems have been impractical. Because of their sensitivity to electromagnetic interference, they would require shielding and be too heavy for aircraft. Beyond that, copper wires have only a fraction of the data-carrying capacity of optical fibers. The new sensors can solve many of these problems. Optical fibers are excruciatingly sensitive to changes in pressure and temperature and they can relay volumes of data. And because they use light pulses rather than electrical signals, electronic interference poses no problem. **********Prototype devices are making progress. At Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., a leader in the field, researchers recently rigged a wooden model plane with sensors. In table-top tests, they were able to distinguish between signals associated with a damaged propeller, a loosened strut and simulated ice on the wings. The researchers are now building a model that would transmit signals by radio to a ground-based controller. The G2 Systems Corporation, a start-up company in Pacific Palisades, Calif., is now preparing to mount optical sensors on a boiler owned by Southern California Edison. It is also working on proposals to develop pipeline monitoring systems and is working on aircraft sensors for both McDonnell Douglas and the United States Air Force. **********To be sure, developing smart skin's systems requires overcoming a slew of challenges. Boeing's Mr. Bartlett noted that no existing sensor is mature enough to implant in a working system. Much remains to be learned, moreover, about the best method for imbedding sensors in structural materials, as well as for stringing sensors into complex grids. **********Perhaps the biggest challenge, however, is developing the computers and software that can convert blizzards of optical signals into meaningful information. That means developing standards for normal stress and vibration and for signals associated with particular problems. ''It will be the middle or the end of the decade before the technology is mature enough for practical use,'' said Mr. Udd of McDonald Douglas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/23/business/business-people-expert-on-turnarounds-needs-loan-to-win-job.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1990-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 419, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Expert on Turnarounds Needs Loan to Win Job", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   Expert on Turnarounds Needs Loan to Win Job", "body_text": " **********Kenneth C.

Steven Burrill, national director of high technology industry services for Ernst & Young. **********Deal Could Be Model for Others **********Some analysts and industry executives said the arrangement, in which Genentech will keep its present management and operate autonomously, might provide a model for other such deals. **********Other analysts, however, argue that a buying binge of biotechnology companies is not in the works. One thing that protects many biotechnology companies is that they have established alliances with other companies, like licensing larger companies to sell their products. **********Buying a company whose products are already promised to others would not be attractive to a large drug company, analysts said. Genentech, which was intent on selling its own products, had fewer such relationships. **********A similar wave of buyouts was predicted in 1986, when Eli Lilly & Company bought Hybritech and the Bristol-Myers Company purchased the Genetic Systems Corporation. But no trend developed. **********But since 1986, several factors have changed. The market valuations of biotechnology companies have been low since the 1987 market crash, making them less expensive. The promise of biotechnology has turned to reality. And the drug industry is going through its own consolidation, making it hard for even well-established companies to remain independent. **********Interest From Abroad **********Foreign companies are also becoming interested in biotechnology, as shown by Roche's deal with Genentech and Chugai Pharmaceutical's purchase late last year of Gen-Probe Inc. of San Diego. Analysts also expect more biotechnology companies to be bought by other biotechnology companies, like Ingene was by Xoma Corporation. **********In the Genentech agreement, Roche Holding, the parent of Hoffmann-La Roche, said it would pay $36 a share in cash for half the outstanding shares of Genentech. It would also pump an additional $492 million into the company for new shares, bringing its total ownership to 60 percent. **********The remaining 40 percent of the shares will be exchanged for special redeemable shares that will continue to trade publicly. Roche will have the option of buying the remaining shares for a price that starts at $38 a share this year and escalates to $60 by 1995. Genentech's management will continue to run the company. **********The arrangement generally drew praise from industry executives and analysts. ''It is good for both of them,'' said Viren Mehta of Mehta & Isaly, a pharmaceutical industry consulting firm. **********But others said the purchase represents the end of the dream of Robert A. Swanson, Genentech's co-founder, to build a large independent pharmaceutical company. ''If you listened to what Swanson said over the last few years, being part of a big drug company wasn't part of the common narrative,'' said Mr. Burrill of Ernst & Young. **********Independence at Risk **********Mr. Swanson said the capital infusion from Roche would allow Genentech to realize its potential while retaining its independence. But analysts say Mr. Swanson has essentially put the company's independence at risk, since Roche can buy the rest of Genentech any time it wants. **********To some, the fact that Genentech would risk its independence was discouraging for two reasons. One, if Genentech could not go it alone, what hope is there for the many other, less prosperous biotechnology companies. **********Further, they said, the agreement was another reflection of how difficult it is for biotechnology companies to raise money at favorable rates in the American financial markets. ''There is a sad message here, one that the United States should listen to,'' said Robert Fildes, chief executive of Cetus Corporation, another biotechnology company. **********The purchase price of $36 a share is far higher than the $21 or so Genentech's shares were selling at before the deal was announced. That could please Genentech shareholders, who will be asked to approve the purchase in April. **********Still, Stuart Weisbrod, biotechnology analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, said the deal also puts an effective price ceiling on the remaining shares. No one will pay more for the Genentech shares this year than $38, knowing that at any time Roche could buy those shares for that price, he said. ''I think shareholders have been left in the cold,'' he said. **********Mr. Weisbrod said that reaction among Genentech's scientists, who are considered the core of the company, was also mixed, based on the conversations he had with a dozen of them. **********Some scientists like the deal because it will provide more money for research and will shield Genentech from the Wall Street pressures that had been forcing the company to curtail some of the researchers' freedom. But others were worried. ''Some people think the company has sold out,'' Mr. Weisbrod said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/22/business/business-people-jack-of-all-trades-named-to-chairman-s-job-at-boots.html": {"writer_name": "Marion Underhill", "pub_date": "1990-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 333, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  'Jack of All Trades' Named To Chairman's Job at Boots", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE;   'Jack of All Trades' Named To Chairman's Job at Boots", "body_text": " **********The Boots Company, the British retail and pharmaceuticals group, has appointed Sir Christopher Benson chairman.

Other proposals include technical help on private banking, a stock market, management training, accounting programs, various forms of entrepreneurial advice, and support for Soviet membership in the International Monetary Fund. **********The Administratioon is also adopting a more tolerant attitude toward West Germany and other European countries that are prepared to grant or loan Moscow some of the $15 billion to $20 billion it is seeking. **********Behind the Change in Attitude **********Behind the Administration's shift, officials said, are pressures from West Germany to give Moscow economic aid in return for its accepting the idea of a united Germany joining NATO and pressures from other European allies for the West to back its professions of good will for Mr. Gorbachev's liberalization program with cash. **********Mounting concern in Washington that a collapse of the Soviet economy could weaken the fledgling democracies of Eastern Europe has also contributed to the Administration's change in attitude, the officials said. **********Last March, when the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, suggested that the United States consider economic aid to the Soviet Union, President Bush dismissed both the proposal and Mr. Gephardt by saying, ''Maybe he'll come on a good idea one of these days.'' Three months later, though, the Bush Administration is no longer dismissing such proposals out of hand. **********'The West Can Help' **********The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said today, ''We believe the success of perestroika depends fundamentally on Soviet choices, but the West can help the Soviets through this difficult period.'' **********The West, she said, shares ''a common interest in the success of political and economic reform in the Soviet Union.'' **********''We expect there will be a discussion on this subject'' with the European Community and at the July 9 economic summit meeting in Houston, she added. **********With that in mind, discussions have begun within the Administration on whether the Western allies can reach understandings that allow West Germany and France to give financial aid or credits to Moscow while the United States and others limit their help to technical assistance. **********Administration officials want to avoid a split within the Western alliance on this issue and take the attitude that if the Germans are prepared to give cash aid in return for Soviet backing for their membership in NATO, then why not? as one official put it. **********A senior Administration official remarked, ''The United States cannot be in a position of being isolated on this issue'' or it could lose its leadership position in the alliance. **********Differences in Attitude **********There already appear to be subtle differences among senior Administration officials on the issue. **********Secretary of State James A. Baker and the President have cited the political and economic difficulties of granting aid to Moscow, but have clearly gone out of their way not to rule anything out. On the other hand, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has emphasized that as long as Moscow is spending ''enormous amounts of its national wealth on military hardware'' it would be a mistake for the West to give economic assistance. **********The Germans and French disagree. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany asked his 11 colleagues in the European Economic Community Tuesday to consider a $15 billion Western aid package to help Mr. Gorbachev get through his current political and economic crisis. He was backed by President Francois Mitterrand of France, but strongly opposed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. **********The European leaders decided to study Soviet needs and make proposals for short-term credits and longer-term support for economic restructuring. **********In the United States, however, there is less political support for aid at a time when the Administration is under pressure to hold down spending.

Since Friday, when a draft of a bill that would only mildly regulate the industry was made available, cable stocks have suddenly taken off, rising roughly 10 percent in the last three trading days. **********''The stocks had bottomed out,'' said James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association, during the industry's annual meeting yesterday in Atlanta. ''Institutional investors have been waiting for some signal to go back into the stocks, and now they have it.'' **********What has investors somewhat reassured is a draft of a new bill from the House Energy and Commerce Committee that proposes only limited regulatory measures. It would let the Federal Communications Commission regulate the broadcast channels that are carried by the cable companies but would leave cable operators free to determine what they charge for cable services. **********The comparable Senate committee draft, reported out some weeks ago, was significantly more stringent and would have given the Government the right to regulate all cable services. **********''The ball is rolling in favor of cable because the industry has the momentum of a compromise going,'' said Sharon Armbrust, a media analyst at Paul Kagan & Associates. ''And cable's opponents - that is the telephone companies, the broadcasters, regulators and movie companies - have not developed a competing consensus.'' **********The response to the new draft was evident in many cable share prices. Tele-Communications Inc. the nation's largest cable operator, closed at $15.15 yesterday, up from $13.875 last Thursday. Time Warner Inc. rose to $100.875 from $92.625 on Thursday. Comcast Communications closed at $14.50, compared with $12 on Thursday. American Television and Communications Inc. has gone up to $38.25, from $34.875 on Thursday. **********Despite the higher stock prices, executives and investors remained concerned over the continued illiquidity in the cable deal market. Because banks are treating cable deals as highly leveraged transactions and refusing to finance them, there have been almost no deals in recent months. **********''Transactions validate the value of the assets, and therefore the value of the stock,'' Ms. Armbrust said. ''Without them, it is hard to keep the stock prices up.'' **********In recent weeks, there was only one transaction. First Carolina Communications sold 100,000 subscribers to Falcon Communications, a Los Angeles cable operator, for about $1,867 a subscriber. The original pricing on the deal a year back was higher by about $100 a subscriber. While the subscribers in the deal were not in a fast-growing market, the pricing does reflect the difficulties in cutting and closing deals in the current environment. **********Tele-Communications' president, John Malone, said yesterday that he anticipated that deals would begin to pick up in six months to a year, in part because if American bankers do not get back into the business, foreign bankers will play a bigger role. **********Others, however, disagreed. One investment banker who declined to be named said the pickup in activity would come only if American bankers again became active in the market. **********Meanwhile, attention remains focused on the activity in Washington. Privately, a number of cable executives said that the House draft was acceptable, and they appeared relieved that the committee had not made it tougher. There was also relief that the House draft did not provide for letting the telephone companies into the cable business. Although such an amendment could still be introduced, one industry executive who declined to be named said that he found it unlikely. **********Ideally, of course, the industry wants to operate unregulated. But if there is to be legislation, several executives agreed that the House bill would be viable. Moreover, it might relieve some of the uncertanity that has impeded cable deals, and in turn diminished the value of cable television stocks. **********Some companies have already positioned themselves to offset the impact of legislation as much as possible. Tele-Communications, for example, recently reorganized its program services so that a basic cable subscriber would get only the broadcast channels in his market as well as a handful of other services including C-Span. Tele-Communications took five services including Turner Network Television, USA Network and ESPN and put them on a separate tier. **********Mr. Malone said that his company could not control the programming costs of those services and therefore wanted to treat them separately. **********For now, the consumer has not felt the impact. Instead of charging the full price for basic services and the five advertiser services as it had, Tele-Communications now charges slightly less for the basic services and adds a charge for the five additional services. But were reregulation as it stands in the House bill to become law, the company would be able to raise its prices at its discretion for the second tier of services."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/05/business/alliance-is-formed-by-fiat-and-french-company.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1990-10-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 624, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Alliance Is Formed by Fiat and French Company", "print_headline": "Alliance Is Formed by Fiat and French Company", "body_text": " **********Fiat, Italy's largest industrial group, and Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, France's largest electronics group, announced today that they were forming a far-reaching strategic alliance and that C.G.E. would acquire control of Telettra, Fiat's $1.4 billion-a-year telecommunications subsidiary. **********With some analysts suggesting that this alliance was formed to counter Germany's growing industrial might, Fiat and C.G.E. announced that the two companies had agreed in principle to combine their railroad equipment operations, which will expand C.G.E.'s lead as the world's largest rail equipment producer.

Several products invented this way are being developed. And for the agency, the point of the game is quite serious: new billings in a stagnant ad market. **********Ad executives are fond of saying the best growth comes from existing clients. Not only are such new assignments a vote of confidence in the agency's work, but they arrive without the agency having to prove its mettle in an expensive and time-consuming new-business presentation. **********To enhance their chances of grabbing new accounts from old clients, several agencies have put together formidable new-product units. The most successful belongs to FCB/ Leber Katz Partners in New York. In the last 18 years, its marketing planning department has developed products like Prego spaghetti sauce for Campbell Soup and More and Now cigarettes for R. J. Reynolds. **********Like Leber Katz, Saatchi boasts as clients a raft of giant consumer-products companies, like Procter & Gamble and General Mills. Saatchi also has one of the industry's more innovative research departments. Led by Penelope Queen, it has helped legitimize the role of cultural anthropologists in advertising, and has worked to move large clients to accept other forms of emotional and cultural research, to supplement the more conventional research into consumers' conscious motivations. **********New products have traditionally resulted from technological breakthroughs at client companies - like a new process for making tissues softer - rather than a perception of a consumer need or desire. Increasingly, however, large consumer-products companies are becoming technological equals, forcing them to distinguish themselves through their insights into customers' minds. **********New-product consultants have arisen to help companies along this otherwise unfamiliar road. Saatchi, with funneling and a daylong meeting it calls the Creative Resources Workshop, says it is taking the invention process a step further by bringing its own advertising experts together with its clients' marketing experts. **********''The important thing is we will gain consensus among decision-makers as to the best ideas to bring forth,'' Ms. Queen said. ''In a day's time, we'll come out of a session with ideas that make sense in terms of marketing, research and development, and an understanding of the consumer.'' **********To prepare for a workshop with Johnson & Johnson, Saatchi sent several executives, including brand managers in its sanitary protection division, as well as to its own personnel, an umbrella with various products dangling from it. These included a body sponge, Odor Eaters for shoes and a travel toothbrush.

Indeed, many apparently fear that the proletariat would take to the barricades before accepting the loss of guaranteed employment and cheap bread, or tolerating the rise of self-made millionaires in their midst. **********But pathbreaking survey research by Robert J. Shiller, an economist at Yale and expert on the psychological underpinnings of economic behavior, suggests that the Kremlin is behind the times: Not only did Mr. Shiller discover that Muscovites were reasonably open to capitalism, but also, the survey shows, in some ways they were more open than their counterparts in New York. **********The research, done with a Soviet economist, Maksim Boiko, and a Soviet sociologist, Vladimir Korobov, and being presented today at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference in Cambridge, Mass., will not be easy to brush aside. Like a few other pioneering analysts, Mr. Shiller has used opinion polling to gauge Soviet resistance to capitalist ideas. But unlike others, he has created a controlled scientific experiment, asking the same questions of Soviet and American citizens, and comparing their responses. **********The telephone survey, conducted in May, covered some 360 people in each country with similar age, sex, employment and education profiles. The poll included 36 questions crafted to minimize spurious differences linked to language or culture. A few of the questions explored attitudes toward capitalist institutions head on - i.e., ''What inheritance tax rate for really wealthy people do you think we should have?'' A few asked about current behavior: ''Did you save any money from the income you earned last year?'' But most set up hypothetical situations and asked individuals how they would react, or whether a given result was fair. **********One question, for example, asked whether they would accept a 10 percent increase in working hours in return for a 10 percent pay increase. Another asked whether they would charge market-rate interest to a friend who needed a six-month loan to buy a summer house. Yet another asked whether it was fair for a furniture factory to raise the $200 price of kitchen tables by $20 if it could not meet demand at the current price. **********In a few cases, responses divided along the anticipated ideological fault lines. Soviet respondents were generally more suspicious of business success: Some 54 percent agreed that ''people who try to make a lot of money will often turn out to be not very honest,'' compared with just 37 percent of the Americans. And Soviet answers showed more reluctance to mix arm's-length business with friendship. Fives times as many Americans (though still a minority) would charge interest on the summer house loan. **********In most cases, though, Soviet and American attitudes were quite similar. Roughly the same proportion would be ''tempted to invest a substantial portion of their savings'' in a risky enterprise that might make them rich. Nearly identical percentages thought it fair to buy vegetables from farmers and resell them in the city at a large profit. Most Soviet respondents (64 percent) thought it unfair to raise the price of those scarce kitchen tables - but so, too, did a majority (70 percent) of Americans. **********Some answers suggested that Russians are actually more willing capitalist tools than Americans. Just two-thirds as many Soviet people believed that speculation would cause more frequent shortages of bread. More Soviet respondents (49 percent versus 30 percent) would be willing to tolerate the tripling of incomes for a lucky minority to gain a 1 percent increase for everyone else. And a higher percentage in Moscow were ready to tolerate 30 percent inflation as long as their own incomes rose by more. **********The survey results may not be entirely representative of attitudes in the two countries. Muscovites with sufficient clout to rate working telephones may be relatively confident they would emerge as winners in the capitalist lottery. New Yorkers, inured to rent control, may be less market-oriented than other Americans. **********But such considerations hardly explain away this striking research. At the very least, the results shift the burden of proof to those who view this generation in the Soviet Union as inflexible followers of the socialist god who failed. **********An obvious question, then, is why Robert Shiller seems to know better than Mikhail Gorbachev -why the Kremlin is so reluctant to ask people to take a chance on another economic revolution. The good Marxist answer is that the primary beneficiaries of the old system can hardly be expected to remain in the vanguard of change for very long."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/14/business/real-estate-cinemas-blossoming-in-manhattan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Cinemas Blossoming In Manhattan", "print_headline": "REAL ESTATE;   Cinemas Blossoming In Manhattan", "body_text": " **********THE collective message blaring from the marquees of all the new cinemas in New York might well be ''Movie Mania Grips Gotham.'' **********In just two years, 43 movie screens have gone into operation in Manhattan, while at least 32 more are in various stages of development, some of them in neighborhoods that had not seen a new theater in more than 50 years. **********People in the movie theater and real estate businesses attribute the boom to a record - and unexpected - public demand for new films despite the competition of television and home videos.

Another factor in local expansion is the opening of theaters to keep pace with population shifts to such areas as the Flat Iron District and the East Village.

Now, more than 20 screens have gone into operation there. **********The association has no count of how many movie theaters the city has. It is known, however, that the city has lost many since World War II, and that many old large theaters have been divided into multiscreen complexes.

''These will be the first new screens south of Canal Street in many, many years and we know they are going to be well received.'' **********Battery Park City officials said the theaters, which will be in the basement of the main building, had been sought as part of the development deal to provide a community amenity to residents. **********The City Cinemas Corporation, which went into operation three years ago, has been acquiring existing properties, then expanding them by adding as many as six screens.

Suddenly the country is facing the issue of whether Japan is psychologically or legally prepared to use military forces to protect its vast economic interests abroad, even in noncombat roles as part of a United Nations or international force. **********''This may be the most heated and emotional debate since the end of the war,'' said Masashi Nishihara, a professor at Japan's leading military college and an influential figure in the country's struggle to define a role that goes beyond that of economic superpower. ''It is a question that Japan has never faced squarely. But this may be the moment.'' **********The issue has taken on a particular urgency within the Government because it seems bound to come up later this week when Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu prepares to go the United States for a United Nations General Assembly session and a meeting with President Bush. **********But just as the Prime Minister is leaving, his initial proposal - to create an unarmed, civilian ''United Nations cooperation force'' to provide behind-the-lines support to American and other forces in Saudi Arabia - has begun to collapse, under attack from opposition parties, the Japanese military establishment and even leaders of Mr. Kaifu's own party. **********Socialists Are Opposed **********The largest opposition party, the Japan Socialist Party, has never recognized the legitimacy of the Self-Defense Forces, contending that their existence is a violation of the Japanese Constitution. **********The party has said it will oppose any effort to send Japanese abroad into a war zone, charging that Mr. Kaifu's ''peace cooperation team'' is simply a guise for sending military forces. Indeed, under Mr. Kaifu's original proposal many members of the team would be soldiers from the Self-Defense Forces, though the others would include police officers, firefighters and doctors. In theory, they would provide communications support, surveillance and medical treatment, but stay out of the front lines. **********Because the Liberal Democrats lost control of the upper house of Parliament a year ago, the Socialists and smaller opposition groups could bottle up Mr. Kaifu's ''U.N. Cooperation Law'' for months. **********Moreover, they could probably win popular support along the way. Polls show that more than 60 percent of the Japanese public opposes sending Japanese personnel to the Persian Gulf. Opposition is even higher among older Japanese, who blame the military for the chaos and ruin brought on by the war. **********In conversations, many Japanese of all ages question whether the United States is being foolhardy or trigger-happy; many say they would prefer to pay more for oil than be pressed by Americans to send Japanese personnel to the gulf to protect sheikdoms. **********But the bitterest criticism of Mr. Kaifu's proposal has come not from the left, or from the public, but from within the Liberal Democratic Party's own leadership. With support from the military establishment, many are arguing that Mr. Kaifu's unarmed force, without military training and discipline, would be ineffective and vulnerable to slaughter. **********''It is nonsense,'' a senior officer in the Self-Defense Forces said a few days ago. ''We would be laughed at as a toy army. Frankly speaking, I think if I asked my troops to go under those conditions, many would refuse.'' **********No Longer on the Sidelines **********Japan took up a similar issue once before, in 1987, when it was under pressure to send minesweepers to the gulf to rid the area of mines believed to have been planted by Iran. But the debate was far less intense, and in the end the minesweepers never left port. **********Now the country fears that inaction could lead to international condemnation of Japan, which is heavily dependent on Middle East oil. **********''What we are doing is wasting time,'' said Moto Shiina, a former member of Parliament and a leading defense expert. ''We have to identify our national interest in this post-cold-war era and make ourself available to our allies. The political structure, though, is not prepared to deal with it. At least not yet.'' What separates the current debate from past discussions about the scope of Japanese power is that this time the military is hardly sitting on the sidelines. **********Technically, neither the uniformed officers nor the civilian heads of Japan's military have any role in debating defense policy. When Mr. Kaifu was first formulating a response to American demands for help, he pointedly kept the Defense Minister, Yozo Ishikawa, out of the meetings. But both the civilian bureaucracy and the uniformed services have deep ties to the Liberal Democratic Party, and already their efforts to head off Mr. Kaifu's hopes for a nonmilitary force are showing results. **********The military has also been insisting that any personnel sent to the gulf carry sidearms, at the very least. ''It is a matter of definition,'' a senior officer in the Maritime Self-Defense Forces said. ''If you are carrying a pistol or a rifle, that is essentially unarmed. But to this country, unarmed means completely unarmed.'' **********The other day Mr. Ishikawa backed away from his earlier contention that Japan could do nothing, and publicly termed Mr. Kaifu's proposal a ''half-measure.'' He urged a reinterpretation of the law, which would not require parliamentary action. **********On Saturday, Noboru Takeshita, the former Japanese Prime Minister and one of the governing party's most powerful figures, told reporters that the Government should push through a revision of the Self-Defense Law that would permit military personnel to be sent to the gulf, in uniform, as part of the multinational force. **********Ichiro Ozawa, the secretary general of the party, split with Mr. Kaifu by arguing that it made more sense to revise Japan's Self-Defense Law and enable Japanese forces to take part in multinational peackeeping efforts rather than to draw up a new law. **********That is exactly what Mr. Kaifu and Japan's Foreign Ministry have been trying to avoid for fear that any revisions of the Self-Defense Law would give Southeast Asia exactly what it is often looking for: evidence that Japan seeks a new regional role beyond its borders. **********''Southeast Asian countries, which suffered during World War II, have shown a serious interest in this issue,'' warned Taro Nakayama, Japan's Foreign Minister. ''It is extremely important to draw up a flawless bill.'' **********Even in Japan there is an unspoken fear that someday the Japanese military could once again spin out of control, and that it is unwise to set a precedent for overseas ventures. It is a fear that some Japanese say the country must finally get over. **********''What is the use of elections, of a democracy, if you do not think it will enable you to control the country's policy?'' Mr. Shiina asked. **********The issue is ambiguous enough, however, that the one country with the biggest stake in the outcome - the United States - is remaining silent. The constitutional ban on offensive forces was formulated by Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, who commanded the American occupation of Japan. Now it is the United States that, warily, is seeking greater help from Japan. **********''It is something for the Japanese to decide,'' a senior American diplomat here said the other day.

Instead, it has been relegated to a side courtyard, on public display but trapped behind glass in a small room where temperature and humidity levels are controlled. **********And there, local officials say, he will remain until they settle one of the burning issues before them: whether to return Marcus Aurelius and his horse to their old pedestal, as many here demand, or keep them under glass, confined but free of the corrosive air of modern Rome that threatens to destroy them. In a sense, it is a battle of tradition versus pollution, and for now pollution is winning. **********Warning of a Rail Strike **********For the last few days, Romans have celebrated the Emperor's return in tandem with other important events. Today was given to commemorating the day 45 years ago when Italy was freed from the last vestiges of Nazi occupation during World War II, and the country noted the occasion in familiar style, with ceremonies and warnings of a national rail strike 24 hours later. **********Last Saturday, April 21, was the date set aside to mark the legendary founding of the city by Romulus in 753 B.C., and there were traditional fireworks and speeches. But the real star was Marcus Aurelius, whose two-ton likeness is the only equestrian statue from ancient Rome known to have survived. **********Ten days earlier, he had returned to the Capitoline in a latter-day version of an imperial victory procession. **********Riding in a specially designed truck, while his horse rode in another, he traveled three miles through the streets of Rome, from an institute across the Tiber River, where they had been scrubbed clean, to the hill that is the seat of municipal government. Hundreds of loyal Romans on foot escorted them along the slow march, a tiny fraction of the many thousands that turned out on Rome's birthday last Saturday for the statue's first public display since 1981. **********It is so popular a symbol of the city's link to its glorious past that on that day alone, starting in the morning and continuing until 11 P.M., a reported 40,000 people trooped into the small side courtyard to view it in its glass cage. Yes, they said with satisfaction, Marcus Aurelius sparkled, in civil robes instead of a warrior's armor, his right hand extended in what some see as a gesture of peace. **********Rome Is Divided **********But how to keep him sparkling has divided the city council, art restorers and ordinary citizens. **********Some traditionalists insist that he be speedily returned to the marble pedestal in the heart of the square, designed in the 16th century by no less than Michelangelo, who had the Emperor in mind as the centerpiece. The empty pedestal there now is plain wrong, these people say. **********But others respond that it borders on madness to expose Marcus Aurelius once more to Rome's notorious pollution, which is bearable only to those who do not trust air that they cannot see. They say it is wiser to keep the original statue safely indoors and to put a faithful bronze copy out on the main square. **********Certainly, there is ample precedent for that in Italy. Michelangelo's David, standing in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, is a copy; the original statue has been in the city's Accademia di Belle Arti since 1873. In Venice, the famous Greco-Roman bronze horses above the entrance of St. Mark's Basilica are also copies, the originals having been moved indoors long ago. **********Just One More Falsehood **********The debate over Marcus Aurelius is expected to continue for a long time, possibly years. For what it is worth, a journalist's informal survey this week of Italian visitors to the statue, an endeavor utterly devoid of scientific pretense, suggested that most thought it made sense to leave the sheltered Emperor where he now is. **********The director of the Capitoline Museums, Anna Mura Sommella, agreed that it was pointless to put Marcus Aurelius back on his pedestal until a substance has been found that can truly protect the bronze from acid rain and other corrosions.

Gorbachev and his program of market-oriented economics and political pluralism. **********Gorbachev Opening Congress **********The congress is opening with a report by Mr. Gorbachev, who seems assured of re-election as general secretary. **********But on its eve, the event shows little sign of being the climactic showdown on the future that many expected. **********The radical reformers who once hoped for a purge of the hard-liners and fresh commitments to reform now say they believe that Mr. Gorbachev will settle for much less to appease the newly aggressive conservative wing of his party. **********The officials who speculated that Mr. Gorbachev would hand over management of the party and devote himself to the presidency now say the party is still too conservative - and too powerful if only as a force of resistance - to be freed from his direct control. **********An Illusion of Unity **********The analysts who once predicted that the party would cleave into two or three factions, giving birth to parties of the left and right, believe that Mr. Gorbachev will try to paper over the differences as an illusion of unity. **********If he succeeds, the party will continue to shrivel. But rival parties will have to be built the hard way. **********The 28th congress is the first one since the Seventh Congress in 1918 in which the party is not confident that it is the dominant political force in the country. In February, the Central Committee agreed to surrender party monopoly on political power, which was guaranteed in the Soviet Constitution. **********Nothing the congress does is likely to restore the party's credibility, which is lower than it has ever been after five years without an improvement in the standard of living. **********Party Is Pulled and Pushed **********And the changes originated by Mr. Gorbachev are being propelled less from within the party than from the increasingly assertive elected government bodies, especially the Russian republic's Parliament, headed by Boris N. Yeltsin, the independence-minded Baltic republics and the democratically controlled city councils in centers like Moscow and Leningrad. **********In Moscow today, the approaching congress was a topic of great popular indifference compared with the latest City Council sensation: a decision that all of the millions of state-owned apartments in the city are to be turned over to their occupants free of charge. The policy, announced Friday night, has yet to be put into effect by Moscow's several regions and the details remain unclear. **********''If the Communist Party was the only force defining the fate of perestroika, as it was five years ago, the congress would play a great role in the country's life,'' said Gavriil K. Popov, chairman of the City Council. ''But now the party is struggling just to keep up.'' **********Fate of the Party at Stake **********''The congress is important, first of all, for the fate of the Communist Party itself,'' Mr. Popov continued. ''Will it be able to change itself enough to remain one of the organizers of the movement?'' **********The makeup of the delegates suggests that a majority will be conservative but not necessarily rebellious. **********About 2,700 of the delegates, more than half, represent the Russian republic. They are the delegates who attended the founding congress of the Russian party organization, where the tone was resoundingly conservative. **********Ivan K. Polozkov, head of the Russian party, is so widely regarded as a reactionary that the Moscow party leader, a centrist, Yuri A. Prokofiev, broke party etiquette to describe him in Pravda as ''an odious figure.'' **********More telling are these estimates published by Moscow News: 48 percent of the delegates will be full-time party functionaries, and 20 percent are government ministers, industrial directors or other high-ranking officials with a vested interest in the status quo. **********Reformers Threaten to Walk Out **********Only about 100 delegates represent the Democratic Platform, a reformist faction that threatens to leave the party unless sweeping internal changes are enacted. **********This group wants the party to end stringent discipline and allow organized factions, to withdraw party cells from the military, K.G.B., law enforcement agencies and other organizations, and to surrender much of its property. **********The Democratic Platform is so outnumbered that its only leverage is the threat to leave the party, possibly taking with it prominent and popular Communists like Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Popov and Anatoly A. Sobchak, chairman of the Leningrad City Council. **********Pavel Voshchanov, a delegate and writer for the Communist Youth daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, said Mr. Gorbachev's struggle in the congress would be be to avoid a repudiation of what he has already done. **********Fight for Reform 'Already Lost' **********''The fight for radical changes in the party, for radical reform, will not be won this time,'' Mr. Voshchanov said in an interview. ''It is already lost. The main problem is to save what has already been achieved.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's nightmare would be something like the 12th Party Congress, in 1923, which became a revival meeting of reactionaries. The hard-liners of the time, led by Stalin, curbed Lenin's private-enterprise economic liberalization, denounced nationalist ''deviators'' and invoked firm discipline against budding factions. **********Lenin was too ill to attend and died the following January. **********But Mr. Gorbachev is not nearly so enfeebled. And unlike the recent Russian congress, which was organized in large part by conservative insurgents, the groundwork for the nationwide congress is in the hands of the Central Committee apparatus, which answers to Mr. Gorbachev. **********Selection of New Leaders **********Probably the most important event of the congress, which party officials predict will last about 10 days, will be the selection of new leaders. **********Mr. Gorbachev is expected to stay on in the role of party chairman, a new position whose occupant would be less involved in daily party affairs than he is as general secretary. **********Current decorum tends to require some competing candidates to lend a democratic gloss to the affair, and a serious challenge is posible. But the leader of the conservatives, Mr. Polozkov, has endorsed Mr. Gorbachev. **********The conservatives seem to have decided they will have more influence over Mr. Gorbachev if he remains party leader as well as president. **********A more serious fight is likely over the governing bodies of the party. Draft documents call for the Politburo to be replaced by a larger, policy-making Presidium, incorporating the leaders of the Communist parties in all 15 republics, as well as others. **********A Leaner Central Committee **********The Central Committee is to be largely replenished, and perhaps trimmed by a third, to about 200 members. Mr. Gorbachev has operated for five years with a conservative Central Committee and some of his supporters say it has prevented him from moving as quickly as he would like. **********Finally, probably soon after the congress, the Central Committee is to elect a Secretariat, made up of the heads of commissions that oversee such specific policy areas as foreign policy, ethnic affairs and ideology. As the Presidium is expected to be larger and more diffuse, this body could gain importance, and its leader, or first secretary, will wield a lot of power. **********The party's platform, a document once studied by Western Kremlin-watchers as a blueprint of Soviet policy, has receded considerably in importance. Many of the issues in the draft program that the party will debate -such as private property - have already been overtaken by new laws and it breaks no new ground. **********The transition to a market economy is only alluded to. The document makes no mention of ''depoliticization'' of the security police, the army and the courts, although the Russian Parliament has already embraced it as the basis for a new Constitution. **********No party gathering can now be fully choreographed or reliably forecast. But many participants say the most likely outcome is that the congress will be inconclusive, even a bit confusing. **********The party, they say, will not die, nor will it veer sharply in any direction."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/world/two-algerian-army-deserters-surrender-in-jet-s-hijacking.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Algerian Army Deserters Surrender in Jet's Hijacking", "print_headline": "Two Algerian Army Deserters Surrender in Jet's Hijacking", "body_text": " **********Two army deserters who hijacked an airliner and held dozens of hostages during a two-day standoff surrendered today after freeing all passengers and crew members, the Algerian press agency reported. **********The hijackers were taken into custody in the eastern city of Annaba after releasing the pilot and co-pilot of the Air Algeria Boeing 737.

Kimmitt, the No. 3 official at the State Department, is unlikely to produce a reversal of longstanding American policy itself. But Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visits Moscow early next month, and officials are clearly analyzing all the options on Afghanistan. Among the possibilities are a cutoff of arms from both superpowers, a coalition government, or a larger role for the United Nations. **********The Kimmitt trip comes as the United Nations is also stepping up the pace of its Afghan diplomacy with a visit to Moscow by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who is to meet on Monday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. [Page 15.] **********Mr. Kimmitt will meet in Pakistan with Afghan guerrilla leaders and Pakistani officials. He also plans to visit Saudi Arabia, which helps finance some Afghan guerrilla groups. The delegation will also visit India, where Mr. Kimmit may meet the new Prime Minister, V. P.

But Afghanistan will be high on the agenda when Mr. Baker meets Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow on Feb. 6 and 7. **********Among the policy options are a larger role for the United Nations, simultaneous termination of arms deliveries by both Moscow and Washington, and the creation of a coalition government including Afghan guerrillas and some Communists not closely identified with the current Government. Another option is to ask the exiled King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, to return to Afghanistan and help unify the country. **********A Hard-Liner's Softer Views **********The United States insists that Najibullah, the Afghan President, resign as part of any political settlement. But the Soviets refuse to abandon him and note that he has shown much more staying power than Washington expected. In February 1989, American officials were predicting that the Najibullah Government would crumble within a few months. **********Representative Charles Wilson, a Texas Democrat who is a staunch supporter of the Afghan rebels, visited Moscow this month at the invitation of the Soviet Government, and he came back saying he would no longer insist on military victory for the Afghan guerrillas. **********Mr. Wilson once explained that he wanted to help the rebels in Afghanistan because ''it's the only place in the world where we are killing Russians.'' But in an interview this week, he said: ''The trip to Moscow softened me. I got a better understanding and appreciation and sympathy for the Soviet position. I saw what a God-awful mess they're in. My No. 1 objective now is a negotiated solution.'' **********''The mujahedeen have got to be more flexible,'' Mr. Wilson said, using the Arabic word for holy warriors, as the Afghan rebels style themselves. ''It's not desirable now for anybody to be hanging from lampposts.'' **********The Congressman said he detected ''some flexibility in the Soviet position'' and ''an extreme desire on their part to get this irritation out of the way.'' **********Objections to Najibullah **********Richard N. Haass, director of Near East and South Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said the Afghan guerrillas ''will not sit down and talk with or work with Najibullah'' because he is ''seen as being responsible for too much destruction and devastation.'' Mr. Najibullah is associated with the Soviet invaders of Afghanistan and ''has lost political legitimacy,'' he said. **********''The Soviets have only departed Afghanistan in form, not fact,'' Mr. Haass asserted. ''What enables Najibullah and his associates to hang on is Soviet military and economic assistance, now estimated at $250 million to $300 million a month,'' or $3 billion to $3.6 billion a year. **********American military aid to the Afghan guerrillas is estimated to have totalled $600 million last year, but the exact figure is a secret. **********The departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan ''does not provide much opportunity for cheering,'' Mr. Haass said. ''The fighting and the suffering continue. Afghans continue to die. More than three million Afghans remain refugees in Pakistan.'' **********Mr. Haass said that ''Najibullah and his closest associates will have to agree to transfer political power as part of a process leading to a settlement.'' Beyond that, he said, ''we are not wedded to any single political course or political outcome.'' **********Inflexibility Is Assailed **********Selig S. Harrison, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has followed Afghanistan for 35 years, said he was disappointed with the Administration's position, as described by Mr. Haass. ''It does not indicate any flexibility on a key issue: support for the U.N. as a vehicle for bringing about a political settlement,'' Mr. Harrison said. **********Nor, he said, does the Administration show any willingness to halt arms deliveries to the guerrillas in return for Moscow's willingness to halt military aid to the Kabul Government. **********The United States supports the rebels' government-in-exile based in Pakistan. **********''In effect,'' Mr. Harrison said, ''the United States is hostage to Pakistan's policy, which is to stall movement toward a political solution until the Afghan interim government becomes capable of prosecuting the war more successfully. That means indefinite American involvement in the Afghan civil war because the interim government was created under Pakistani sponsorship and is seen by many Afghans as a Pakistani tool.'' **********State Department officials said they were encouraged by reports of serious rifts in the Afghan armed forces and the recent defection of more than two dozen Afghan Army officers. Such reports emerged last month after many officers, including several generals, were arrested for plotting against the Kabul Government. **********But the Washington policy suffered a setback this week when France announced plans to reopen its embassy in Kabul, becoming the first Western power to be represented in the Afghan capital since the Soviet pullout last February.

''We are not interested in overthrowing this Government,'' Mr. Ortega said. ''On the contrary, we are interested in stability. But the President is acting in a unilateral fashion, not taking the people into account but instead acting against them.'' **********In declaring their strike last week, the Sandinista-led Government workers' unions demanded salary increases of 200 percent and restoration of a disputed law that would give sweeping job protections to the Government work force. **********Protection for Workers **********The law, which was suspended last week by Mrs. Chamorro, was approved by Sandinista leaders after their election defeat but before their departure from office on April 25, and would protect even high-ranking Sandinista bureaucrats from dismissal from their jobs. **********Mrs. Chamorro's Minister of Labor, Francisco Rosales Arguello, declared the strike illegal and threatened to dismiss any workers who did not return to their jobs by Tuesday morning. But striking workers ignored the ultimatum, locking Government ministers out of their offices and paralyzing everything from telephone service to state-run banks, airports, border crossings and public transportation. **********On Tuesday, riot policemen were deployed near Government buildings as the Government apparently considered whether to try to dislodge the strikers. But in the settlement announced Wednesday night, the Government ultimately chose to placate the strikers by accepting significant concessions on virtually every major issue. **********Under the terms of the accord, the Government agreed to approve an across-the-board salary increase of 25 percent, which, when applied after an earlier raise of 60 percent approved early last week, amounts to a total increase of 100 percent in Government salaries in the month of May. **********The agreement stipulates that the Government must immediately reinstate any workers dismissed in violation of the suspended Civil Service law. The Government is also obliged to proceed with enforcement of the law on the basis of new negotiations between the Ministry of Labor and the Sandinista unions. **********Mr. Rosales and other Government officials defended the accord as a victory of negotiation over confrontation, asserting, in the words of the Labor Minister, that Nicaragua's fledgling democracy ''is not a fiction.'' **********Aid Bill Advances **********WASHINGTON, May 17 (Special to The New York Times) - Congress made progress today toward approval of a bill that provides emergency aid for Panama and Nicaragua. House and Senate negotiatiors agreed to remove abortion and death penalty provisions from the bill, clearing the way for a final compromise on the measure. **********The bill, which provides $420 million for Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua, has been delayed for months while lawmakers debated those two provisions and more than $1 billion in unrelated spending for domestic programs. **********The negotiators hope to complete their work on Friday, but final passage of the bill still depends on resolution of yet another dispute involving military aid to El Salvador."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/business/the-executive-computer-will-next-inc-s-new-machines-find-a-place-in-the-market.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1990-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1089, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Executive Computer; Will Next Inc.'s New Machines Find a Place in the Market?", "print_headline": "The Executive Computer; Will Next Inc.'s New Machines Find a Place in the Market?", "body_text": " **********TWO years after its first machines generated a lot of light but little heat, Next Inc. has completely overhauled its high-performance, Unix-based personal computers. The new machines will be available next month, with color versions delayed until early next year, and Next showed them off earlier this month at the Seybold Seminars electronic publishing exposition in San Jose, Calif. **********The heavy crowds at the Next booth were evidence that the company retains its exotic cachet, even though analysts say fewer than 10,000 Next machines were sold in the company's first two years. Yet whether these new computers have a chance of capturing a significant share of the business computer marketplace is far from clear. **********\"The real question is, 'What are the chances for Next as a company?' \" said Patricia Seybold, chief executive of the Patricia Seybold Office Computing Group of Boston. \"The information community is somewhat skeptical at this point.\" **********The skepticism arises from early disappointments, all the more striking because expectations were unrealistically high, it is now clear, in part because of the reputation of Steven P. Jobs, Next's founder and chief executive, who had been a founder of Apple Computer Inc. The original Next computer was a dazzling technical showcase, featuring optical disk drives, multimedia integration, digital signal processors, a beautiful graphical interface that hid Unix from the user and other \"gee whiz\" components. But it simply did not work well enough or have enough uses to attract corporate customers. Many companies bought a Next machine, praised it for its potential and good looks and spent their big dollars on other computers. **********The problems with the first Next machine were that it was too expensive, lacked color, was slow, had nonstandard disk drives and was difficult to integrate into existing PC networks. What is more, there were no compelling software applications to entice potential business customers to buy more than one. **********Mr. Jobs is typically portrayed as a charismatic but tempermental genius who clings zealously to his design ideals. But the new Next work stations reveal him to be a pragmatist above all else. He and his engineers have addressed each shortcoming of the original Next computer. **********The new Next machines are very aggressively priced, starting as low as $4,995. The 16- and 32-bit color options with high-resolution color screens promise to be dazzling. The new Motorola 68040 microprocessor, as well as a revved-up version of the system software, greatly improve performance. The optical drive of the original is now an option, and magnetic diskette and mass storage drives are now standard. Industry-standard 10BaseT Ethernet networking is built in. And new software fromthe Lotus Development Corporation and the Wordperfect Corporation finally gives the Next machines a practical use in businesses. **********Some major customers apparently believe the machine is worth buying. Mr. Jobs said Next had already received orders for 15,000 new computers, more than twice its installed base. Among the companies identified as customers were Bozell, the New York-based advertising agency; the First Boston Corporation, which plans to use the machines for an equities trading system; O'Connor & Associates, a Chicago options and futures trading firm, and several small universities. **********The new computers have a floppy disk drive, although, in keeping with the exotic image of the machine, these are 2.88 megabyte drives, in contrast to the 1.44 drives used by all other high-end personal computers. The new drives will be able read data written on the more conventional 720K, 1.44 MB, MS-DOS and Unix-formatted disks. The machines are the first to use the new Motorola 68040 microprocessor, a powerhouse that is reported to be in short supply after manufacturing problems. While Apple Computer declared its plans to incorporate the 68040 into its line next year, Next got a head start. **********The familiar black \"cube\" design of the Next computer is still in the line, but there is also a sleek new \"pizza box\" design called the Nextstation. Next says the Nextstation performs 15 million instructions a second, and 2.8 million floating point operations a second -- performance that would put it on a par with the Sun Microsystems' Sparcstation 1+. And those two machines would be a level ahead of the new computers that use the Intel Corporation's 80486 microprocessor, like those made by Advanced Logic Research, Northgate Computer Systems and AST Research, as well as the most powerful personal computers made by I.B.M., Compaq and Apple. **********The Nextstation comes with eight megabytes of random access memory, a 105-megabyte magnetic hard disk and the high-capacity floppy disk drive (the optical drive is optional). The list price of $4,995 includes a 17-inch Megapixel monochrome display that has a resolution of 1,120 dots horizontally by 832 vertically. With all that, the Next machine is thousands of dollars less expensive than its closest rivals. **********For those who want color, the Nextstation color system uses 12 megabytes of memory and a 16-inch color display, also with a million pixels. It will cost $7,995 when it becomes available early next year. The original cube computer has been officially named the Nextcube; it also boasts the 68040 chip and the new floppy drive. Owners of the original cube can upgrade their machines to 68040 power for $1,495. **********But for all the impressive features, \"it may be too little too late,\" said Ms. Seybold. \"The people I talk to in large corporations are in charge of establishing information superstructures and enterprise-wide computing. Yes, they have Unix work stations, but the Next machines never come up in any of these strategic discussions.\" **********Next's problem is that in the two years that the company spent revising its product line, Sun, International Business Machines, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and others have been pushing ahead, and they may well be hot on the heels of Next's new machines. **********The key to acceptance is probably software. Of all the applications demonstrated at the Seybold show, Lotus's Improv was the most impressive. Promised for delivery late this year or early next year, at a price of $695, Improv allows the user to deal with the spreadsheet in English-language formulas that are separate from the data.

One of the three leaders, Wynand Malan, resigned from the party in July. Another, Denis Worrall, a former South African Ambassador to Britain, decided not to run for the leadership, although he remains a Member of Parliament. **********Gains in 1989 Vote **********The Democratic Party picked up 11 seats from the National Party in the parliamentary elections held among whites last September for a total of 33 seats in the white chamber of Parliament, the House of Assembly, with 21 percent of the white vote. **********As Mr. de Klerk shifted his party closer to the Democratic Party, some Democratic voters moved to support him, if only to fend off the right-wing Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the white vote and remain the official opposition in Parliament. **********In a by-election in June, the National Party retained the Natal blue-collar constituency of Umlazi because voters crossed over from the Democratic Party to defeat the Conservatives. **********Saturday, Mr. de Beer said the party would ask the Government to ''open up the negotiation process more widely to include us'' and would also renew a separate dialogue with the African National Congress. **********Dual Membership Forbidden **********But the party amended its constitution to forbid any member from belonging to other political organizations without the consent of the party'e policy-setting National Council. The decision, which angered some delegates, appeared intended to stop white party members from joining the African National Congress, while leaving the option open for those of other races who joined the Democratic Party. **********''Discipline in a party is not reconcilable with dual membership,'' Mr. de Beer said on Saturday. ''We may be able to live with a few who join other parties, but not with those who advocate different policies to ours.'' **********While both organizations oppose apartheid, the Democratic Party believes that change can be achieved though parliamentary means, while the African National Congress has rejected Parliament as currently constituted because it excludes blacks. The Democratic Party also endorses a free market economy with a role for big business; the Congress's economic platform has called for the nationalization of major economic sectors and redistribution of wealth. **********Mr. de Beer also said that the Congress's longstanding alliance with the South African Communist Party ''simply has to be clarified and indeed terminated.'' **********David Dalling, a Member of Parliament from Sandton in Johannesburg's northern suburbs, proposed that the party look beyond its white membership to forge a multi-racial pact with the African National Congress, the foremost black anti-apartheid group. **********But Harry Schwartz, who represents the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville in Parliament, expressed his concern that ''we do not at this stage of our party's history sacrifice the principles for which we have walked in the wilderness, for the sake of being winners.'' While he knew and liked Nelson Mandela, Mr. Schwartz said, ''that does not mean I must join the A.N.C. or form a pact with the A.N.C.'' **********Excerpts from the debate were circulated by the South African Press Association."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/29/world/mine-wounds-10-gi-s.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mine Wounds 10 G.I.'s", "print_headline": "Mine Wounds 10 G.I.'s", "body_text": " **********A mine exploded during a United States Army training exercise today, and 10 American soldiers were wounded, two seriously, a military spokesman said.

Gorbachev swept confidently to re-election as head of the Communist Party today, after confronting the party's hard-liners with a militant defense of the changes he has ignited in his society. **********The party's nationwide congress chose Mr. Gorbachev, who is also President of the Soviet Union, overwhelmingly over the only other candidate who stayed in the race, a Western Siberian party official best known for helping lead a coal mine strike a year ago. **********Before the voting today, Mr. Gorbachev shed his conciliatory tone and lashed out in a fighting speech at hard-liners who had vociferously criticized his economic and foreign policies at the congress. **********'No Way to Bring Back the Past' **********Either they must learn to live with liberty and the free competition of ideas, or the party is doomed, he declared, adding that the party is now in crisis because it has moved too slowly toward democracy and a market economy. **********''There is no way to bring back the past, and no dictatorship - if someone still entertains this crazy idea - will solve anything,'' he thundered. **********Although the congress is to continue for a few more days, Mr. Gorbachev seemed to have it now firmly in hand and appeared to have headed off for now any danger of a major split in the party. **********He has forcefully tamed the hard-liners and then, with his speech today, reached out to party radicals who want even faster change in hopes of keeping them from deserting the party in huge numbers. **********Holding Two Posts Criticized **********Senior party leaders said today that there was little doubt Mr. Gorbachev's choice for the important new post of deputy party leader would be elected. He is said to have settled on Vladimir A. Ivashko, the centrist leader of the Communist Party in the Ukraine, the second largest Soviet republic. **********Despite outspoken criticism and some calls for him to step down, in the end Mr. Gorbachev easily won his new term as General Secretary - the first time the post has been filled by a nationwide party convention rather than by a secretive circle of top leaders. **********The main argument used against him today was that it was time for him to chose between the two important jobs he holds - President of the country, and General Secretary of the party. **********Mr. Gorbachev and his supporters conceded that the combination of jobs should eventually be phased out, but not until the more democratic new government structures are firmly in place. **********Elected With 3,411 Votes **********He was elected with 3,411 votes, to 501 votes for Teimuraz G. Avaliani, a party official from the mining center of Kiselyovsk in the Kuznetsk coal basin. Voting against both candidates were 615 other delegates. **********Six other candidates were nominated from the floor, most of them close associates of Mr. Gorbachev, but they withdrew. **********Mr. Avaliani, a self-educated mining engineer, was summoned by the K.G.B. in 1978 and accused of slander after he wrote a letter to Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was then the Soviet leader, condemning his handling of the economy. **********Mr. Avaliani, who was not identified with either the hard-line or radical factions, was elected a local party official after helping lead the strike that made coalfields idle last summer. **********Sympathetic Toward Miners **********Today he expressed sympathy with the miners, who have scheduled a one-day protest strike Wednesday to demand better living conditions and the resignation of the Government. But he also warned: ''The endless rocking of our already leaky and unstable boat -and I mean the economy - will get us nowhere.'' **********Neither the hard-liners or the party radicals put up a candidate to challenge Mr. Gorbachev. **********Leading conservatives in the party had already endorsed Mr. Gorbachev, fearing that otherwise he would swing to the radical camp and leave them with nothing. **********Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost hard-liner in the Politburo, had hinted that he might be available for some senior party post, but no one nominated him for the top job. Senior party officials said that, at 69, Mr. Ligachev's political career was probably now over. **********Radical Faction a Minority **********''Rumors of the conservativism of the delegates were a bit exaggerated,'' said Yuri A. Prokofiev, the Moscow party leader. **********The faction calling for more sweeping moves toward democracy and free markets was a tiny minority of the congress delegates from the outset. After their favorite, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a close ally of Mr. Gorbachev, declined to be nominated, some of the more radical delegates voted for Mr. Gorbachev while others scratched out the names of both candidates. **********Anatoly A. Sobchak, the chairman of the newly democratized Leningrad City Council, said he voted against Mr. Gorbachev on the theory that if he lost, he could devote himself to the presidency without being held back by the party. **********''The fact that Gorbachev will still keep the position of party leader will not speed up this process of transfering power to the Governement and re-creating a state, but it will slow this process down,'' he told reporters. ''It will keep this party in power, along with its traditional forms and methods of working.'' **********Mr. Gorbachev's fiery speech today was clearly designed to prevent the defection of popular figures like Mr. Sobchak, which could further diminish the party's electoral appeal. **********Rejects Slow Approach **********Mr. Gorbachev said that while many party leaders were stunned and confused by the new liberties, the party's greatest failing was that it was too slow to recognize the need to abandon the centralized economy and the danger of long-suppressed ethnic grievances. **********Echoing a warning issued last week by Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist president of the Russian republic, Mr. Gorbachev said the congress had shown how many Communist leaders are out of touch with the times. **********''If any of the delegates, and going by the speeches there are some such delegates among us, came to the Congress hoping to take the party back to the old conditions of commands and orders, I must say they are deeply mistaken,'' he said. **********He called on them to stop using authoritarian methods to frustrate the work of elected Government bodies, and to enter coalitions with non-Communist parties and political organizations. **********'Do You Want Tanks Again?' **********''We must put an end to sectarian moods, put an end to this monopoly forever, erase its vestiges from the mind of party workers and all Communists,'' he said. **********''Believe me, the party's success depends on whether it realizes that this is already a different society. Otherwise it will be pushed to the margin by other forces, and we shall lose ground.'' **********Implicitly confronting the military officers who have challenged his handling of foreign policy, Mr. Gorbachev warned that those who work for the state must carry out Government policies or resign. **********''People ask if our policy not to interfere in the processes in Eastern Europe was correct,'' he added. ''Well, do you want tanks again? Shall we teach them again how to live?'' **********Questions on Policies **********Answering charges that he had let allowed Communism to founder in Eastern Europe, Mr. Gorbachev issued a blunt warning to ''those who occupy important posts in the state and are directly related to our international activity.'' **********''The President and the Government cannot have one policy and someone else has another and pursues it,'' he said. ''This does not happen in any state. All officials must be loyal to the Government. And if they are decent people and they disagree with Government policy, they must resign.'' **********Party officials said today that Mr. Gorbachev's remarks would not prevent a continued drop in membership, but the party would weather this decline. **********''Is it necessary that the party consist of 19 million members?'' said Mr. Ivashko, the leading candidate for the new number two post. ''And what if there were only 15 million?'' **********Mr. Sobchak, one of several prominent public figures who are contemplating leaving the party, said: ''His speech today was great, but it should have been made a year ago.'' **********Party officials said the congress, scheduled to end Thursday, might spill over to Friday or Saturday. Besides electing Mr. Gorbachev's deputy, who will shoulder much of the day-to-day management of the party, the congress is to adopt a platform and elect a new Central Committee, the party's regular governing body."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/22/world/upheaval-in-the-east-east-germany-east-german-party-purges-ex-leaders.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1990-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Upheaval in the East: East Germany;   East German Party Purges Ex-Leaders", "print_headline": "Upheaval in the East: East Germany;   East German Party Purges Ex-Leaders", "body_text": " **********Faced with growing rebellion and defections in its ranks over the slowness of internal change, leaders of East Germany's Communist Party decided after an emergency session that ended early today to purge several more former leaders, but rejected calls that it dissolve altogether. **********Those expelled included Egon Krenz, who took over as party chief in October after Erich Honecker fell and was himself replaced in December, and 13 other former Politburo members. **********No sooner was the meeting over than the party was rocked anew, this time by the defection of 40 party members in Dresden led by Wolfgang Berghofer, the liberal mayor and a vice chairman of the party since it ousted its old leadership in December. The group said it would support social democracy but would not run in the May elections. **********A Liberal Communist **********Mr. Berghofer, a close ally of Prime Minister Hans Modrow, was one of the liberal Communists who had led the movement for change last fall. Though he subsequently declined the party leadership, he played a major role in trying to change it and was a leading figure in the round-table talks between the Communists and the opposition. **********In a letter to Gregor Gysi, the lawyer who took charge of the Communist Party in December, Mr. Berghofer said he had concluded that the party could not get rid of its past and so could not be a credible source of renewal. Any attempt to take a new path with the old party would only increase the popular suspicion that it was trying to get back to power, he said. **********Mr. Gysi acknowledged the resignation with ''deep regret.'' **********New Wave of Discontent **********The buffeting of the party reflected a new wave of discontent that has swept the country since the New Year, prompted by revelations that the Communist-led interim government had tried to revive the security apparatus under a new name and by accusations that it was trying to undermine opposition movements and parties. **********The disaffection has been demonstrated in the resignation of more than a million members of the party, reducing its strength from 2.4 million to about 1.2 million. In the general public it has found expression in wildcat strikes, increasingly angry demonstrations and a continuing flight of almost 2,000 East Germans daily to West Germany. **********The Communists called the weekend meeting after dissident members from East Berlin's Humboldt University, the Academy of Sciences and other institutions called for the party's dissolution on the grounds that it had become a ''security risk.'' The meeting was closed, but the fact that it lasted 15 hours and ended only after midnight indicated a heated battle between dissident members and Mr. Gysi. **********Decision Not to Disband **********At the end, Mr. Gysi acknowledged that the party had failed to rid itself of its Stalinist past in the five weeks since he took charge. But he said that ''after long, mature and sometimes controversial debate, the party's ruling council decided that disbanding would lead to greater social tension, not less.'' **********At the same time, the leaders agreed to several measures intended to satisfy the internal critics. Most significant were the purge and a proposal that Prime Minister Modrow, a Communist, offer to give the 15 seats the party now holds on the 27-member interim Cabinet to the opposition. **********There was no immediate comment from Mr. Modrow, and it was not likely that the ill-organized opposition would agree to take charge of the Government until after elections scheduled for May 6. **********The party also announced plans to move up a party congress, now scheduled for mid-March, and at that time to change its name from Socialist Unity Party-Party of Democratic Socialism - the clumsy double title assumed in December - to simply Party of Democratic Socialism. **********The announcement of the expulsions of former party leaders was published without explanation by the official press agency, A.D.N., which said only that ''every decision was conscientiously examined.'' **********But it seems clear that the party leadership was trying to answer charges that it has been slow to cleanse its ranks, especially of those who had run the country until street demonstrations and mass emigration forced the old guard to surrender power last October. **********'New Image' Leaders Ousted **********Those ousted included several former Politburo members who had led the first effort to present a new image of the party and had gone so far as to open the Berlin wall to convince the nation of their good intentions. **********Most notable among these was Mr. Krenz himself. The 53-year-old politician, who had been charged with overseeing the security apparatus under Mr. Honecker and was considered the former leader's preferred heir, had tried in his two months in power to portray himself as the leader of a reformed party. **********In an interview with the West German tabloid Bild, Mr. Krenz complained that he had been given no credit for leading the change. ''What I did for the change counted for nothing,'' he said. ''We were all measured with the same yardstick as Honecker.'' **********Mr. Krenz has said he initiated the change of direction in East Germany by personally countermanding an order by Mr. Honecker for the police to fire on a demonstration in Leipzig on Oct. 9. The demonstrators were not interfered with, and soon Mr. Honecker was toppled. **********Mr. Krenz's future remains uncertain. In the Bild interview, he was quoted as saying: ''Finding another job is difficult. I will probably become a writer.'' **********Those ousted with Mr. Krenz included Gunter Schabowski, the East Berlin party leader who announced the opening of the border on Nov. 9, and Heinz Kessler, the former Defense Minister. Mr. Gysi said he expected more party members to be purged. **********The turmoil in East Germany was not limited to the Communists, as other parties also began to position themselves for the May 6 vote, the state's first free election. **********One persistent threat was that the interim government under Mr. Modrow could fall if some of the smaller parties traditionally associated with the Communists pulled out to assert their independence. **********Last week, both the Liberal Democrats and the Christian Democrats considered pulling out but decided against it. The Christian Democrats in particular have been under pressure to assume a new image and then to seek support from their namesake in West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-people.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1990-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;   People", "body_text": " *********** Irwin Gotlieb has been promoted to worldwide director of broadcast and programming at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, and Rino Scanzoni to director of national broadcast for the agency's United States division. *********** Hugh Trenkamp has been appointed an executive vice president of the J.

In several of Central America's five main countries, the unexpected costs total one-fifth of public spending. **********\"We have several choices to make, but obviously we have to increase revenues, which may result in less growth,\" said Ernesto Altschul, an economist and El Salvador's Vice Minister of the Presidency. \"We will have to raise taxes and make some cuts. But we have just barely kept up, nominally kept up with social programs, so our room to cut is very limited.\" **********One after another, the region's five governments have been forced to impose strict austerity programs. All have sharply raised gasoline prices, provoking an immediate inflationary surge and widespread protests. Honduras and Costa Rica have also announced plans to lay off thousands of public employees and have warned of further cutbacks, like gas rationing. Guatemala, the only country in the region to produce any crude oil, has restricted firefighters to responding \"to urgent emergencies\" and despite rising crime has cut back on national police patrols and other operations. **********\"There is no question they will be hit hard,\" said Alfredo Milian, a former Salvadoran diplomat who is now an associate at International Business and Economic Research Corporation, a Washington-based business consultant group that specializes in Central America. \"It will hit everything from cement plants to sugar processing to transportation.\" **********The jump in oil prices comes at a particularly difficult moment for Central America. Throughout the region, revolution, counterrevolution, civil war and incompetent leadership have led to a decade of uninterrupted recession and a plunge in the standard of living. **********In the last two years, center rightists have been elected in all of the region's five countries. They have promised economic reform through privatization and the free market. But now their plans have run aground because of the gulf crisis. One after another, the region's governments have been forced to delay or cut back on plans to remove subsidies, balance their budgets and control inflation. **********The effect of the oil price increases is aggravated by widespread energy inefficiencies. Most third world countries produce much less per unit of energy than industrialized nations. A Costa Rican refrigerator, for instance, uses four times as much electricity as the average Japanese unit. As a result, growth is very expensive -- a 2 percent increase in oil imports for every one percent jump in gross domestic product, Mr. Dobles estimated. \"We need oil for economic growth, but we cannot afford to pay for it,\" he said. **********The Salvadoran Government estimates the crisis will add almost 5 percentage points to the rate of inflation. Honduras has estimated that it will increase inflation by 10 points to almost 35 percent. **********Already the Honduran Government has doubled the price of fertilizer, raising the cost of food, and raised cement prices by 70 percent, a blow to the vital construction industry. The Government now says it will soon be forced to close some schools and cut back on other essential services. **********\"We are going to have to make many sacrifices for an economic recovery,\" said Ramon Medina Luna, the Minister of the Economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/27/world/mideast-tensions-fear-enters-israeli-city-after-a-terrorist-attack.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1990-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1048, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fear Enters Israeli City After a Terrorist Attack", "print_headline": "MIDEAST TENSIONS; Fear Enters Israeli City After a Terrorist Attack", "body_text": " **********In some ways, this city has been an optimist's vision of Israel's future in the midst of its present: a growing Jewish community, sharing quiet borders with Jordan and Egypt, untroubled by political strife or nationalist bloodshed. **********But events seemed to catch up with Eilat when Kathy Waxman's 8-year-old son left school on Sunday. The boy's teacher told the pupils to run straight home because an Arab gunman had killed four Israelis just outside of town that morning and might still be at large. **********\"The kids put rocks in their pockets to throw in case an Arab came near them,\" Mrs. Waxman recalled this afternoon. Selling newspapers in the downtown bookstore where she works, she shook her head. \"That's unbelievable,\" she said. \"That's so strange for Eilat.\"  Distrust and Fear **********Most people in this small resort on the Gulf of Aqaba have for years marveled from afar at the suspicion and animosity between Arabs and Jews that is so common elsewhere in Israel. But now, for the first time, many of them have their own small stories of distrust, anxiety and fear. **********Eilat was quiet, calm and sunny today, and groups of lean athletes jogged around town preparing for the city's annual triathlon. Still, everywhere in this community of 28,000, Israelis were talking about the Arab gunman's infiltration from Egypt and the four local men he killed. **********It was the first attack of its kind in the Eilat area. All the victims, three army officers and a public bus driver, lived here. They died when the gunman, believed to be an Egyptian, crossed the border about 10 miles from Eilat and opened fire with an assault rifle on vehicles that came along the highway near the border, killing the 4 and wounding 26 Israelis.   Comments From Shamir **********Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today that Israel would \"demand from the Governments of our border states -- Egypt and Jordan -- to insure that these types of attacks do not recur.\" **********But the Government also took pains to indicate that Egypt was not to blame for the attack. Mr. Shamir said: \"We are sure that this action was not done with Egypt's consent. It was done in opposition to Egyptian policy.\" **********This afternoon, Israel agreed to allow a group of Egyptian Army officers investigating the shooting to come to Eilat and interview witnesses. The Egyptians will also visit the site of the shooting on the highway outside of town. It will be the first time Egyptian officers conduct such an investigation in Israel.  Far From the Uprising **********Eilat is separated from most of Israel by the vast Negev desert. There are no indigenous Palestinian communities anywhere nearby. For three years, Eilat has calmly watched from afar as the Palestinian uprising raged in the occupied territories and Jerusalem residents became accustomed to political stabbings, arson and revenge attacks by both Palestinians and Israelis. **********The city has been so removed from Israel's political problems, in fact, that local Government and tourism officials promote it in Europe as \"Eilat on the Red Sea.\" They deliberately omit Israel's name from advertisements so the resort will not be associated with the turmoil elsewhere. **********Eilat's Mayor, Avi Hochman, continued to insist today that the bloodshed on the outskirts of the city had nothing to do with Eilat. **********\"It didn't happen in Eilat,\" Mr. Hochman averred. \"It happened on the road between Taba and Rafia. If the men killed had not been Eilat citizens, this would not have affected Eilat at all.\" **********Other Eilat residents were not so blithe. They were concerned and upset by the deaths and the introduction of terrorism to Eilat. **********\"One of the men who died came in every day to buy a newspaper,\" Mrs. Waxman said. There was a run on papers this morning by Israelis eager to read about the attack. **********The bookstore is on Hamaterim Street, the main commerical avenue running through the middle of Eilat. City Hall is on the same street, and opposite it are a department store and cultural center.

Sandinista leaders created an elaborate empire of official dollar-based stores and enterprises to help keep their cash-starved government afloat. **********Now, with the war years presumably behind it, Nicaragua's new Government is attempting to break free from the economic legacy of that chaotic era - not by breaking the country's addiction to the dollar, but by embracing it. **********Gradual Introduction **********Backed by $900 million in foreign commitments to help shore up the country's foundering economy, economic advisers to President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro have inaugurated an entirely new, convertible hard currency that is to be pegged permanently to the value of the American dollar. **********The new money, known as the gold cordoba, is being introduced gradually as a complete replacement for the current inflation-battered cordoba. Government officials say it is to be backed on a strict one-to-one basis with official dollar reserves, making it, in effect, a direct local substitute for the American bills that Nicaraguan black-marketers now wave at potential buyers on street corners throughout the country. **********In contrast to the old cordoba, which does not circulate internationally and is thus considered a ''soft'' currency, the gold cordoba is to remain freely convertible with American dollars. **********Economic Straitjacket **********The rigid, one-for-one structure would have the effect of imposing an economic straitjacket on the new government, eliminating its ability to finance its future deficits simply by printing money. But Government economists assert that such a radical, self-imposed solution is the only reliable means of choking off annual inflation that has reached as high as 36,000 percent in recent years. **********''What we want to do with the gold cordoba is to erase the memory of hyperinflation in the people's minds,'' said Francisco Mayorga Balladares, the new president of Nicaragua's central bank, who has been the driving force behind the new currency. ''No one will believe a promise to allow just a little inflation. If you want to convince people in a country like this, you have to have a firm commitment that inflation will disappear.'' **********The introduction of the new currency, which was first suggested by Mr. Mayorga in his capacity as chief economic adviser to Mrs. Chamorro's election campaign in February, began in May with the introduction of the gold cordoba as a unit of account for Government bank credits. **********Transition Produces Hardships **********Beginning July 1, the Government began calculating taxes in the new currency. The new bills themselves then began appearing on the street last month, and the new money now accounts for $2.5 million of the $50.7 million in national currency now in circulation, according to the central bank. **********The switch to accounting with the gold cordoba has produced an immediate crisis for hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans who are paid in old cordobas and must pay for electric power, telephone services, gasoline and other necessary purchases in the new currency. The old cordoba floats against the new currency in the same way as it did for years against the dollar on the black market. **********Since May, inflation has already stripped the old cordoba of five-sixths of its value relative to the new currency. The resulting hardships have produced a sharp political backlash that has been reflected in Sandinista slogans and widespread graffiti declaring that ''The cordoba of gold is the cordoba of hunger,'' and ''We aren't paid in gold; we don't pay in gold.'' **********Officials Discount Opposition **********''It is not possible to tranquilize an entire people with the fetish of a new currency, one that today scarcely exists and that tomorrow will inevitably be devalued,'' declared the official Sandinista newspaper, Barricada, in a recent editorial. **********Government officials discount the opposition to the new currency, arguing that some degree of public shock was inevitable, and that economic indicators show that the country is quickly adjusting to the new money. **********Supporters of the gold cordoba say its ultimate effect will be to move Nicaragua's economy closer to the model of Panama, which uses the American dollar as its official currency. **********Praise From Other Countries **********Nicaragua's public sector deficit has been reduced from $35 million a month in May to $11 million in August, largely through the effect of the new currency in eliminating indirect subsidies that had been created through exchange rate fluctuations. Savings in the new cordoba have grown rapidly with each passing month, according to central bank figures. **********The new currency has also received strong praise from foreign countries, including the United States, which has pressed the Government to speed up the transition to the new currency. Government officials have insisted that a full transition must follow, not lead, other progress toward economic recovery, and have set no firm date for achieving it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/06/world/baker-reports-progress-on-strategic-arms-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1990-10-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Baker Reports 'Progress' on Strategic Arms Talks", "print_headline": "Baker Reports 'Progress' on Strategic Arms Talks", "body_text": " **********The United States and the Soviet Union have revived the stalled strategic arms talks and may be able to complete a pact reducing long-range arms before the end of the year, Secretary of State James A. Baker said yesterday. **********The talks on cutting strategic nuclear weapons have languished for months, jeopardizing the Bush Administration's goal of completing a treaty this year. **********But after two rounds of talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Mr. Baker said ''good progress'' had been made on some of the remaining strategic arms questions. **********''With the progress that should follow now in the strategic arms talks, it is still very possible that we would be able to complete a strategic arms agreement during the balance of this calandar year,'' Mr. Baker said. **********Nonetheless, the progress cited by Mr. Baker today fell considerably short of the sort of breakthrough on conventional arms announced on Wednesday, when the United States and the Soviet Union said they had reached an agreement in principle on nonnuclear forces in Europe. Today, Mr. Baker said they had resolved some remaining issues so that the conventional arms pact could be signed in Paris next month. **********Other Issues Discussed **********They agreed on ceilings for NATO and Warsaw Pact aircraft, limits on helicopters and the question of what regional ceilings should be established on conventional forces in Europe. **********Mr. Shevardnadze generally echoed Mr. Baker's positive assessment of the progress made on strategic arms. But the optimistic notes sounded today have been heard from American and Soviet officials before; completing a strategic arms treaty was a goal of the Reagan Administration. **********In addition to arms control, the meetings between Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze also dealt with the Persian Gulf, Angola and Ethiopia. **********On the Persian Gulf, Mr. Baker said that Washington and Moscow agreed that ''partial solutions should be avoided,'' a reference to the American position that Iraqi troops must unconditionally withdraw from Kuwait. **********Three Major Issues **********Mr. Baker said the two sides had not discussed the possibility of additional United Nations resolutions, which some observers have said might be sought to authorize military action against Iraq. **********''The important thing today is to see that the resoutions already adopted are implemented,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. **********Three issues have been the main barriers to a strategic arms pact - ''noncircumvention,'' limits on the Soviet ''Backfire'' bomber and Moscow's ''heavy'' SS-18 missile. **********The ''noncircumvention'' issue has centered on Moscow's demand that the United States agree to limit its nuclear weapons cooperation with Britain. Specifically, Moscow has proposed a provision that would limit American cooperation with Britain to submarine-launched missiles. **********Without such a provision, Soviet officials have asserted, Washington would be able to compensate for cuts in the United States nuclear arsenal by helping to build up the nuclear weapons of its allies. Bush Administration officials have countered that Washington has no intention of undercutting the spirit of a strategic arms pact and have viewed the Soviet demand as meddling in American-British relations. **********The Most Accurate Weapon **********Mr. Baker said that progress had been made on the non-circumvention question but added that it had not been resolved. The Secretary suggested that the resolution of a number of other issues were contingent on the 'non-circumvention'' question. **********On the ''Backfire'' bomber, the two sides have had differences over the number of planes that Moscow should be allowed, a question that Mr. Baker suggested has now been largely worked out. Moscow has stoutly rejected Washington's demand that the Soviet military limit the number of flight tests of its SS-18 missile and thus restrict efforts to maintain and improve the weapons. The SS-18 is the most accurate weapon in the Soviet arsenal. **********Even though Moscow had already agreed to cut its force of 308 SS-18 missiles in half, the inability of the United States to get Moscow to agree to a total ban on flight tests has made Mr. Baker a target for conservative critics of arms control. And there was no public indication of a change on this question. **********Bush Administration officials said earlier this week that Soviet leaders had been channeling all their energy into the conventional arms talks. They said that the Soviet Government seemed to be unable to focus on strategic arms issues or perhaps was unwilling to overrule the Soviet military, which has already seen Moscow make a series of concessions in the strategic arms talks."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/15/business/important-intel-chip-improved.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1990-10-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1045, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Important Intel Chip Improved", "print_headline": "Important Intel Chip Improved", "body_text": " **********In a significant advance for the production of small ''notebook'' computers, the Intel Corporation said today that it had developed a vastly shrunken, power-saving version of the chips that form the processing power of some of the most advanced personal computers. **********The introduction marks the first time Intel has announced a new microprocessor in Japan, an acknowledgement that virtually none of the new generation of notebook and ''palmtop'' machines, which weigh less than five pounds, are produced in the United States. **********But by consolidating nearly a score of separate chips into a three-chip set that includes the microprocessor, Intel will essentially be taking over some of the key elements of designing notebook-computer systems. **********Made in Japan **********Intel executives said they expected the first of the new computers, equal in power to a machine using the Intel 80386 microprocessor, to be announced by Japanese manufacturers by the end of this year. The Japanese makers who dominate the business today - primarily the Toshiba Corporation and the NEC Corporation -are expected to embrace the new chips as a way to reduce the weight of their next-generation machines and greatly extend the life of the batteries that power them. **********At a news conference here this morning, Andrew S. Grove, Intel's chief executive, said the new chip set would solve a vexing problem facing the computer industry: Notebook machines have been unable to run some of the most powerful software available for larger personal computers. **********''Now, the same richness that is available on a desktop can be achieved in a notebook computer without sacrificing battery life or size,'' Mr. Grove said. **********A Force Overseas **********Though American chip makers have long complained that they have a difficult time breaking into the Japanese market, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has been a notable exception. Almost all of the leading Japanese personal computers -those made both for export and for the Japanese market - are based on Intel processors. **********NEC is now Intel's third-largest customer, after the International Business Machines Corporation -whose adoption of Intel chips made its line of processors an industry standard - and the Compaq Computer Corporation. Intel estimates that 10 percent of its roughly $4 billion in annual revenues now comes from Japan. **********The key to Intel's new chip set is the 386 SL microprocessor, a project code-named Genesis during its development. It allowed the circuitry for a ''clone'' of an I.B.M. PC/AT to be placed on a board about 4 by 6 inches, integrating many crucial ''support'' chips into one. The two key chips in the set have more than 1.1 million transistors. **********Solving a Big Problem **********More important, the new 386 SL solves a big problem retarding the development of truly capable notebook computers: Ordinary Intel 386 processors consume large amounts of power. The new chip has a ''clock'' that shuts off automatically when not in use, one of several power-saving features. **********But in the process of integrating several functions into a smaller group of chips, Intel is now competing head-on with a relatively new group of competitors: companies that have marketed ''chip sets'' used to build clones of the I.B.M. personal computer line. **********Small companies like Chips and Technologies Inc. have carved out an enormously profitable business by combining the functions of many chips onto three or four and selling them to computer makers for use alongside Intel microprocessors. Intel is betting that it can take back that business and expand it as the notebook computer market takes off. Intel's two-chip set will be sold for $221 initially, but in time the price is expected to fall sharply. A third chip that will control a high-resolution color screen will soon be introduced. **********Somewhat surprisingly, growth of the market for smaller computers has been much faster in Japan -where computer developments usually lag the American market - than in the United States. With Japan's cramped offices and homes, notebook computers, instead of bulkier desktop models, have become the preference of many Japanese. From the offices of Toyota to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, midlevel managers keep their computers under their desks. **********Furious Competition **********In the last few months, the competition to bring out new laptops has been furious - two or three new models have been announced in some weeks. Also on Monday, NEC is expected to introduce a palmtop computer not much larger than a checkbook and Compaq is expected to introduce a more powerful laptop model, also using an Intel microprocessor, the 386 SX. The Sony Corporation introduced notebook machines for industrial uses earlier this month. Fujitsu, Matsushita and Hitachi all have new products in the works. **********For the United States, however, the growth of the notebook market has created a serious competitive threat. Historically, the American personal computer industry has been relatively impervious to Japanese competition. That is changing quickly, as the technology of portability moves the competition onto Japanese turf. American makers are turning to Japan to produce their notebook models: Compaq's is made by the Citizen Watch Company, and Apple Computer Inc. is talking to Sony and Toshiba about a laptop Macintosh. **********Tough Licensing Policy **********The new Intel chip set will insure that an important element of the machines is made in the United States: Intel has no manufacturing plants in Japan. Nor does the company seem likely to license the manufacturing of the chip set to Japan, a policy that has angered some of Japan's biggest electronics companies. **********But Japan continues to strengthen its abilities in what may be the most vital component of the notebook computer: the flat, liquid-crystal display screen. The screens themselves are essentially chips, and manufacturing them in high volume requires much of the same process technology that has given Japan its huge success in memory chips. **********''In an ordinary personal computer, the display is a relatively small part of the system's cost,'' Mr. Grove said. ''In a notebook, it is relatively large.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/10/business/late-drop-sends-dow-down-28.37-to-2766.html": {"writer_name": "Phillip Wiggins", "pub_date": "1990-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Late Drop Sends Dow Down 28.37, to 2,766", "print_headline": "Late Drop Sends Dow Down 28.37, to 2,766", "body_text": " **********Stocks ended sharply lower yesterday as trading accelerated near the close of the session.

Investors had moved out of such funds in January for the first time in seven months. **********''The public is beginning to realize what the stock market did in 1989, and it is much easier to sell these funds,'' said Edward M. Mahoney, the president of Amev Advisers Inc., whose funds are sold through brokers and insurance agents. ''Our net sales in February are 30 percent better than in January.'' **********Michael Hines, a vice president of Fidelity Investments, said: ''Every time the market has dropped in the last several months, our investors have seen it as a buying opportunity. I think they are viewing equities as a long-term investment.'' He said Fidelity's giant Magellan Fund, managed by Peter Lynch, had attracted especially strong interest. **********The January figures, released by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, showed a sharp split in attitudes toward stocks. Over all, including sales, redemptions and net exchanges among different types of funds, $241.6 million came out of mutual funds in the month, the first net loss since June. In the intervening six months, $7.4 billion came into the funds. The figures do not include reinvested dividends. **********The January withdrawals were entirely accounted for by the so-called ''hot money'' - money that is ferred among different types of mutual funds in an effort to time market moves. A total of $2.3 billion was transferred out of stock funds in the month, the heaviest outflow for any month since the market crash in October 1987. Long-term bond funds also had net transfers out, as money poured into safe money market funds. **********Excluding transfers, and looking at only sales less redemptions, a very different picture emerges. Net sales of stock funds came to $2 billion in the month, the best performance for any month since August 1987. **********The market timers, as a group, have a hard-won reputation as poor investors. ''They've been wrong four times in a row,'' said Greg Melvin, the manager of the Federated Growth Fund. ''The last of the hot money went out about two weeks ago, just when the market bottomed.'' **********Perhaps for that reason, fewer investors are trying to time markets through mutual funds. Mr. Hines said the percentage of assets being moved between mutual funds at Fidelity is ''less than half what it was three years ago.'' **********As a group, the managers of stock mutual funds were thoroughly scared in January, when the Dow Jones industrial average declined 5.9 percent. The managers raised the percentage of stock fund assets invested in short- term money market securities, called cash in the industry, to 11.5 percent, from 10.4 percent at the end of 1989. **********That figure is the third-highest for equity funds in the 29 years that the institute has been keeping track. Only in September 1974, when 11.8 percent of stock fund assets were in cash, and in June 1982, when figure hit a record 12.2 percent, has the cash level been as high. Both those levels came late in major bear markets, and preceded the beginnings of bull markets by only two or three months. By conmajor bear markets, and preceded trast, the Dow hit a record high in early January before dropping. **********While sales of stock mutual funds have been generally rising for more than a year, until recently much of the strength had been concentrated in funds that are sold directly to investors, often without a sales charge. But now some funds that are sold through brokers and insurance agents are also reporting good sales. **********''Over all, net cash flow in equities is up 30 percent over January,'' Henry L. P. Schmelzer, an executive vice president of New England Securities, which sells mutual funds for The New England, a large insurance company. ''It's really heavy in our growth fund.'' **********Massachusetts Financial Services also reported cash coming in this month. ''In equities, we're on the plus side,'' John Reilly, a spokesman, said. ''Investors are going for the most conservative funds.'' **********There was a more mixed report from the direct-marketers, who see the most switching between funds. ''In January, the conservative stock funds did well, but they seem to have tapered off,'' said Jane Nelson of T. Rowe Price. But she said that over all, money flowed into that group's equity funds. At the Janus Group of no-load funds, ''we are still experiencing tremendous growth,'' said Chrissy Snyder, a spokeswoman. She said cash flow for the group's three equity funds was a positive $49.7 million for the first three weeks of February, compared with $35.6 million for all of January. **********The cash continued to pour out of ''junk bond'' mutual funds, but once again some managers saw signs the flow was abating. ''Most of the people who wanted to get out, I think, have done so,'' said Mr. Hines of Fidelity. **********In January, the net flow out of such funds was $829 million, up from $664 million in December. But the figure was below the ones recorded in September and October. ''It's a little heavier than in January,'' said Mrs. Nelson of T. Rowe Price, regarding the February outflow from junk bond funds, ''but not back to the darkest days of the fall.'' **********Since money began leaving the junk-bond funds in July, $4.9 billion has been withdrawn, according to the institute. Total assets of junk funds have fallen 24 percent, to $26.7 billion at the end of January, from $35.2 billion at the end of June. **********Funds that buy tax-free municipal bonds drew in $678 million in January, but other long-term bond funds saw money leave as interest rates rose. Excluding muni-bond funds and junk-bond funds, $218 million came out of debt funds in January, the worst performance since September. **********While investors seem thoroughly scared of taxable junk bonds, fear of so-called high-yield bonds does not seem to have spilt over into the tax- exempt market. At Massachusetts Financial, a high-yield muni fund was opened to new investments for two days, then promptly closed when $218 million poured in. And Mrs. Nelson of T. Rowe Price reported a ''nice inflow'' into a similar fund there. She emphasized that the fund had only about one-third of its investments in bonds rated below investment grade, making it ''a better quality fund'' than one that invests only in junk bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/23/world/un-and-us-reach-accord-on-arafat.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1990-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

Smith, the chairman of General Motors and head of the panel, ''that if a man loses $100 and calls up his broker to ask about it, the broker will say, 'Maybe it's those index arbitrage guys.' '' **********The Big Board survey asked 150 people who said they owned stock in their own accounts, to indicate how concerned they were about a variety of factors, on a scale of one, for not concerned at all, to five, for very concerned. **********More than half of those who responded, 58 percent, said they were very concerned with the ''honesty and ethics of brokers,'' and 18 percent ranked their concern at the fourth level. The percentages were similarly high for other groups polled, including those who do not own stock directly but are investors in stock mutual funds, investors who are stock investors only indirectly through pension plans, and people who own no shares at all. **********A total of 560 people were interviewed, with an accuracy of plus or minus four percentage points for overall results, and plus or minus eight points for different investor categories. **********The level of concern expressed about broker honesty was greater than for any other item listed in the survey. At least a third of shareholders said they were very concerned about five other problems: interest rates, inflation, insider trading, recession and corporate bankruptcies. **********And program trading? Only 11 percent of shareholders said they were very concerned about that. Of the 13 categories in the survey, program trading drew the least concern except for index futures and options trading, which was of great concern to just 9 percent. Ranking third from the bottom was volatility, of great concern to 18 percent of shareholders. **********The lesson of those results may be that the public is not much worried about the items that have produced great handwringing on Wall Street. That should not be a great surprise. The Dow Jones industrial average set a record high last week, and investors have flocked into stock mutual funds for the last year. Last October individual investors were heavy buyers following the 190-point drop, assuming that the market would soon regain its losses. **********The Big Board also asked both investors and financial executives of companies whose shares were publicly traded what they knew about program trading. Of the individual shareholders, 53 percent said they had never heard of it, but most of the rest seemed to think it was not an especially good thing when asked direct questions about it. Of the 200 financial executives of publicly traded companies, 51 percent said they did not know what program trading was, and many of the rest gave answers that indicated they did not know much about it. **********But 45 percent of the executives said they were very concerned about program trading, and 28 percent expressed serious concern. In other words, many executives conceded they did not know what program trading was but nevertheless said they were worried about it. **********Program trading, as defined by the Big Board, includes any investment strategy that involves the simultaneous sale or purchase of 15 different stocks. Index arbitrage is a form of program trading, involving the sale or purchase of stocks in an index, and the simultaneous offsetting purchase or sale of stock index futures or options. **********The other survey released yesterday was conducted by A. G. Edwards and Dean Witter Reynolds, two retail-oriented brokerage firms. Asking leading questions, and not including any questions about broker honesty, those firms found evidence that program trading was of great concern to almost every group. **********For example, one question asked if investors agreed with the statement: ''I will be more likely to invest in individual stocks if market volatility is once again attributable to the underlying value of the stocks rather than to program trading.'' Having been told that program trading was a problem, 79 percent of shareholders agreed, while 90 percent of retail brokers agreed that their customers would be more likely to buy. **********Some Big Board officials are not persuaded by that study. ''When you're dealing with the public on a question that they don't fully understand, the wording of a question can be very important,'' said James L. Cochrane, the Big Board's chief economist. ''The question itself can provide the information for the public.''

Zhivkov, and it has benefited from that accident of birth, especially in the latter part of Mr. Zhivkov's 35-year rule. **********''This was definitely a privileged town,'' said Tzanko Marinov, a local official of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, as the Communist Party is now known. There was more food, more clothing and a better variety of both, he and others say.

But rules change, and so do other things. **********The old Zhivkov house, with its thatched roof, is untended now behind a tile-topped wall. The town where he was born 79 years ago has fallen from grace, although its residents insist that their lives were not as gilded as many Bulgarians think. Now, they say, they definitely are living as well, or as badly, as the next fellow. **********They have fresh political leadership, too. More of them voted last month for the Socialists than for the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, but the faces of the new local leaders are different and decidedly younger. **********Old Zhivkov cronies were swept from power and some are reported as likely to join their old boss in facing criminal charges of abusing power. **********It is nice, Mr. Dankov said, to be able to tell political jokes in public for the first time. Still, this is a small and conservative town and freedom of expression has not landed with both feet as in Sofia, which culturally seems considerably more than 45 miles away. **********Protesters Occupy Sofia Square **********There, hundreds of anti-Government protesters have camped out for a week in a central square and seem to be in no danger of being clubbed into submission, Romania-style, by the authorities. **********Street enterpreneurs are suddenly thriving, selling everything from pocket calculators to cans of coffee in a park and on a downtown corner, under the gaze of a 20-foot statue of Lenin. **********Newspapers are crisper than in the dreary days of not long ago, when the latest tractor reports were considered sexy stories. And television, though still under state wraps, has tried to respond with genuine news and public affairs programs. It has even dug up old Hollywood films long buried in its archives, treating viewers this week, for example, to classics like ''Casablanca'' and ''Suspicion.'' **********But many Bulgarians say that after decades of repression and acquiescence, they still lack a full sense of what democracy means. The Socialists, who are flailing about despite having won the June elections, acknowledge that they have not made it any easier to figure out. **********Challenge of Alien Concepts **********''There is very little cultural comprehension of the notion of compromise,'' said Georgi Pirinski, the party's deputy chairman. ''There is little understanding of the need to engage in a process. All these are notions that are not in the national psyche.'' **********Economic hardship, including a rising foreign debt of $10 billion, only makes the task of producing change more difficult. **********In Pravets, Mr. Marinov said, the problem is not just poor food deliveries but also inadequate housing, bad roads and supply shortages at cotton processing plants and even at the computer plant. **********The situation is likely to get worse, people say, and if next winter is a hard one everyone will be pulling their belts tighter. **********''I think there will be a period of sickness,'' said Angel Georgiev, who is in charge of the consumer cooperative.

Many economists say that if any Eastern European country can make a relatively smooth metamorphosis, it is Czechoslovakia. But other economists - and some Western investors - complain that Prague's perfectionist officials are becoming bogged down in haggling over the fine points of a reform package and are moving too slowly toward change. **********Cushioning the Shocks **********The move to the free market will certainly push up prices and throw people out of work, but the Czechoslovaks are confident that they have several important advantages over other Eastern European countries that will cushion the shocks. Their nation of 15.5 million has a stronger industrial base, lower debt burden and a more skilled labor force than in most other Eastern European countries. And the country's inflation rate is a modest 7 percent, its stores are well stocked and it has the second-highest per capita income in the region after East Germany. **********''We have a much better chance to go through this unhappy period than some other Eastern European countries,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, who also heads the State Planning Office. **********Czechoslovaks are fond of reminding visitors that before World War II they ranked No. 10 among nations in per capita income and were called the ''Yankees of Europe'' because of their industriousness and pluck. **********But officials in Prague admit their efforts to build a market economy will take longer than East Germany's, mainly because West Germany's large aid to East Germany means less money for their country. Even so, Czechoslovakia's shift will probably be less painful than East Germany's because German currency unification is expected to cause a violent shakeout for East German industry and an explosion of unemployment. **********The Case for Fast Action **********Many economists are prodding the Government in Prague to move faster with reforms to prevent the heavy hand of central planning from further dragging down the economy. ''People feel they are in a vacuum'' said Jan Klacek, an economist with the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. ''They feel that the old system has been abolished and that there is not yet a substitute for it.'' **********The main force behind the drive to speed up reforms is the hard-charging Finance Minister, Vaclav Klaus, who is urging Czechoslovakia to avoid the mistakes that threw Poland and Hungary into crisis. **********Poland's old Communist government let its money supply run wild, and prices went haywire. To avoid Poland's high inflation, Mr. Klaus says that before removing price controls, Prague should clamp down on the money supply, which will restrict demand and make it hard for companies to raise prices. Mr. Klaus, who at age 48 has become a star in national politics, pushed through a tight budget that aims to produce a surplus and to fight inflation. **********The Finance Minister said he abhorred half measures like the modest reforms undertaken by Hungary over two decades. ''Partial reform of a distorted economy is much worse than non-reform,'' he said. **********Mr. Klaus said Czechoslovakia should avoid a ''reform trap'' and implement changes in a careful sequence so they do not undermine each other. For example, price controls should not be removed before competition has been created. **********For months, Mr. Klaus and his team battled with First Deputy Prime Minister Valtr Komarek, who argued that a slower reform strategy was preferable because it would produce less pain. But officials in Prague say Mr. Klaus has won that dispute, thanks to the backing of President Vaclav Havel and Prime Minster Marian Calfa. **********Novel Reforms **********Under Mr. Klaus, Prague is undertaking several novel reforms: *********** Over the past three months, the Government has gone further than other Eastern European countries to break monopolistic conglomerates into smaller units to help create competition. In a nation where 70 percent of the enterprises had more than 1,000 employees, officials say this will help hold down inflation once price controls are lifted. *********** To move prices toward less distorted levels, the Government plans to raise prices on 30,000 food items by an average of 24.6 percent on July 9. To cushion the blow, the Government said it would give every citizen an additional subsidy of $10 a month. Mr. Klaus hopes to remove all price controls on Jan. 1. Food subsidies are so large that farmers use bread as fodder for their animals, and consumers pay only half of what farmers receive for milk. *********** Recognizing that Czechoslovaks have little money to buy corporate stock, Mr. Klaus wants to distribute stock-buying vouchers to the public for free. People could then use the vouchers to acquire stock in the companies of their choice once state-run enterprises are privatized. **********Dusan Triska, the senior adviser to the Finance Minister, whom Mr. Klaus wants to head a state privatization office, said new profit-minded owners would press enterprises to be more efficient. He said he hoped to sell 1,000 companies in the first round of privatization scheduled for this fall. **********Prague has also disclosed plans to make the currency, the crown, convertible beginning Jan. 1. Convertibility is expected to help attract much-needed Western investment and technology and increase trade with the West. It will also make it easier to import goods, thereby heightening competition for long-insulated industries. **********Government officials say the nation would never tolerate the huge price increases that Poland experienced during its shock therapy to develop a market economy. But many economists say that because its economy is stronger, Czechoslovakia does not need shock therapy. **********''Reforms in Czechoslovakia won't create the very high inflation that Poland experienced because there is much more balance in the economy,'' said Zdenek Lukas, an economist with the Vienna-based Institute for Comparative Economic Studies. **********Resentment Over New Wealth **********Deputy Prime Minister Dlouhy said he was not scared of inflation, but did fear that the move to capitalism might make some people very rich very quickly and cause resentment among others. **********Despite the overall optimism about Czechoslovakia's prospects, it faces some daunting challenges. Huge investments are needed to clean up the environment and more than 70 percent of its trade is with the nation's of the fragmenting bloc once centered on the Soviet Union. **********Czechoslovakia is dangerously dependent on heavy industry - it produces more than one ton of steel per capita, one of the highest levels in the world. About 70 percent of its exports involve machinery and heavy engineering, and with the Soviet economy in crisis, exports to its biggest customer will probably plummet. In addition, crucial oil imports from the Soviet Union are falling. **********Although some economists say Czechoslovakia's heavy industry is too backward to quickly increase exports to the West, some officials are optimistic. ''There is demand for not only super-top quality,'' said Frantisek Nevaril, the Prime Minister's chief economic adviser. ''The world is also buying many standard products. We can shape up so that we'll do well in a year or two.'' **********During last December's revolution, many economists were confident that, with its skilled labor force and low wages, Czechslovakia would be a magnet for Western investment, especially from neighboring West Germany. But economists now say investment is being hurt by the nation's slow pace of reform and by West Germany's preoccupation with East Germany. Yet West Germany is expected to be the No. 1 foreign investor. **********Mr. Nevaril, the Prime Minster's aide, is optimistic about the transition to a market economy. ''If we don't make any big mistakes, then there is not much we can lose,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/16/business/agency-votes-to-sell-houses-owned-by-savings-units.html": {"writer_name": "Gregory Robb", "pub_date": "1990-03-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 522, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Agency Votes to Sell Houses Owned by Savings Units", "print_headline": "Agency Votes to Sell Houses Owned by Savings Units", "body_text": " **********The Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency managing the bailout of the nation's savings and loan industry, today approved its first program to sell the housing stock of failed savings institutions to low- and medium-income families. **********The board approved a joint financing program between the trust corporation and the State of Texas under which the Texas Housing Authority would issue $140 million in tax-exempt bonds to provide financing for low-rate mortgages for the low- and moderate-income families. **********The trust corporation will select the private lenders and the mortgages will be used exclusively to buy half of the 5,200 housing properties for sale by the agency in Texas. **********No Borrower Fees **********The agency will be allowed to spend up to $6 million in commitment fees for the new mortgages.

The remaining public shares have tumbled to $37.75, after falling $2.375 yesterday. That is 35 percent less than the promised price, reflecting growing doubt that the merger will ever be completed. **********Yesterday, West Point-Pepperell disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the banks that made a $1.03 billion bridge loan to the company had agreed to extend the loan, through March and perhaps through June, in return for additional fees and higher interest rates. Instead of paying 1.5 percentage points over the prime rate, West Point-Pepperell will now pay 2.5 percentage points over the prime. **********In return for the new fees and higher interest rates, the banks, led by the Wells Fargo Bank and the Bankers Trust Company, gave permission for West Point-Pepperell to advance money to the West Point Acquisition Corporation, the company owned by Mr. Farley that owns 95 percent of West Point-Pepperell. Without such cash infusions, it appears that West Point Acquisition might run out of cash and default on the interest payments it owes on more than $1.4 billion in debt it took on to buy the West Point-Pepperell stock. **********Whether the bank agreement removed all the obstacles for such cash infusions, and whether they were made, could not be determined yesterday. Mr. Farley did not return phone calls and other West Point-Pepperell officials declined to answer questions. **********A key part of Mr. Farley's strategy called for selling a major West Point-Pepperell subsidiary, Cluett, Peabody & Company, and using the money to pay down debt. But that sale has been delayed, and a lower price is likely. **********In October, it was announced that the Biderman Group, a privately held French company, had tentatively agreed to pay $600 million for most of Cluett's assets. Gene de Nicolais, a spokesman for Biderman, said last week that the negotiations were still under way, and said a closing was expected in the middle of January. A closing was originially expected in November. **********''The price has been an issue,'' he said, declining to give details. One person, with second-hand knowledge of the talks, said a price of around $500 million, not all in cash, was possible. **********A spokesman for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which played a major role in financing the first part of the takeover - and owns some of the securities issued to finance the deal -said last week that it hoped to raise the money to enable Mr. Farley to complete the acquisition by the middle of 1990 but cautioned that doing so depended both on the sale of assets and on an improved ''junk bond'' market. The plan had been to sell more than $1.6 billion in junk bonds both to pay for the remaining shares and to refinance debt taken on in the first round. **********If the money cannot be raised, it is unclear what will happen. To get access to substantial cash from West Point-Pepperell, West Point Acquisition would have to complete the merger and take over the remaining public shares. Revising the terms of the takeover would need the consent of two of the three West Point directors who were on the board before Mr. Farley took over and might not be forthcoming. **********Until the merger is completed, the only asset that West Point Acquisition has is its shares in West Point-Pepperell. They pay no dividends and have a deteriorating market value. To pay interest on the loans, it needs money from West Point-Pepperell itself. **********It is conceivable that Mr. Farley will have to give up substantial equity in West Point-Pepperell to arrange financing, and possible that he will lose control. There has been speculation that to raise cash, Mr. Farley might put Fruit-of-the-Loom, another company he controls, on the block. **********The losers now are those public shareholders who, for whatever reason, failed to sell their shares to the first tender offer, and have seen their value plummet. But there are other probable losers. **********Mr. Farley himself could end up a big loser. He has sunk more than $170 million into West Point-Pepperell stock, not counting the money borrowed by West Point Acquisition, and could lose it if the deal cannot be completed. Those who lent money to it could also wind up with substantial losses, reflecting the current view that if West Point-Pepperell went on the block again, the top bid would be well under $58 per share. **********Mr. Farley's problems were not brought on by a sudden change in fortunes of West Point-Pepperell but by a financial community suddenly less willing to risk money on junk bonds to finance takeovers. For him, the music stopped at a very inappropriate time. **********''This is a kind of one-act play in financial leverage,'' said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a critic of junk bond financing, about the West Point saga. ''It is about optimism and debt and disappointment, and we have not yet come to the end of it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/08/world/standoff-in-the-gulf-un-puts-off-move-on-mideast-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1990-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 561, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.N.

But they do not want the Bush Administration to throw away the opportunity its Arab alliance against Iraq offers to promote a wider Middle East settlement.

But many economists questioned whether unforeseen obstacles would prevent the bank's establishment so soon. **********The idea of a single European currency has long been a dream. And with a date on setting up a central bank fixed at the European Community's summit meeting in Rome over the weekend, some European officials say a single currency could become a reality by the end of this decade. The resounding support of 11 of the 12 community members -- with only Britain opposed -- to form a central bank in 1994 could bode well for a decision three years later on a single currency. **********But numerous economists predicted that an economic crisis or widely disparate inflation rates within Europe could discourage community nations from forming such a bank in early 1994, thereby delaying any progress on the currency issue. **********\"In the next three or four years, a lot of things could happen on the international scene that would make moving ahead with this plan much more difficult,\" said Eric Taze-Bernard, senior economist with Banque Indosuez, the Parisian investment bank. **********At the same time, many economists said they doubted that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's outspoken opposition to setting up a central bank so soon would keep the 11 other community nations from going ahead with the plan. **********Mrs. Thatcher has said that a single currency would mean too much a sacrifice of national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the economists said she might eventually be persuaded to join a European central bank, just as she ultimately came around to joining the European Monetary System. Besides, they add, she will not be Prime Minister forever. **********\"It's partly a game of brinkmanship,\" said Richard Reid, chief European economist for UBS Phillips & Drew, a London-based brokerage. \"If the other 11 say you cannot prevent the rest of us from moving ahead, then that's a big stick to beat over the head of the U.K. to join the group.\" **********In the debate over if and when to set up a European central bank, the key vote was cast by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who overrode the objection of Germany's powerful Bundesbank in backing the Jan. 1, 1994 date. The bank's officials, led by the president, Karl-Otto Pohl, have repeatedly objected to fixing a date, arguing that inflation rates and economic policies within the community must first be harmonized.  Need for 'Harmonization' **********Following the Rome meeting, however, it appeared that many community leaders had decided that the convergence of inflation rates could come after the so-called Eurofed bank was established. Indeed, such a bank, by creating a community-wide monetary policy, could promote convergence. **********Even so, some economists said that if the spread between inflation rates of the member nations remained vast as Jan. 1, 1994, approached, then European leaders might balk at pushing ahead with creating the central bank. **********\"Even the politicians know that you cannot only fix a date, but you have to reach some degree of harmonization of the economies,\" said Peter Pietsch, a senior economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. **********Bundesbank officials fear that forming such a bank when some nations have high inflation rates and others have low ones could cause the central bankers to settle on an inflation rate higher than the Bundesbank's inflation fighters would like. At the same time, if low-inflation forces dominate the bank, they could force high-inflation countries, like Greece and Portugal, to crack down on inflation brutally, perhaps causing politically unacceptable domestic economic crises. **********Before the Rome meeting, Jacques Delors, president of the community's Executive Commission, had pushed for fixing early 1993 as the date to create the central bank. He was backed by France, Italy, Belgium and Denmark. **********However, several nations -- for the most part, those in southern Europe with high inflation -- wanted a later date. They feared that they could not reduce their inflation rates quickly enough and that some nations wanting to move quickly might decide to set up a European central bank without them. **********Spain's Finance Minister, Carlos Solchaga, proposed starting the central bank on Jan. 1, 1994, to give his and other high-inflation nations time to bring inflation down. The compromise was clinched when Chancellor Kohl, eager to show that German unification would not impede European unification, backed that date.  Questions Remain **********But there are still questions about whether that date is writ in stone. \"The community leaders,\" said Mr. Taze-Bernard of Banque Indosuez, \"showed they really don't want monetary union at two speeds, but do they really want to include those southern European countries with high inflation rates?\" **********In recent months, German, Dutch and Danish officials have raised some of the reservations expressed by Mrs. Thatcher, although in a less strident way. However, when Italian officials, who headed the Rome meeting, forced a vote on the bank's future, these nations felt compelled to show their commitment to a united Europe. **********The statement issued by the community's leaders said that three years after the central bank is formed, the bank would issue a report on how well convergence is going. If it is going well, the community might move to the next phase of economic union, which would include permanently locking exchange rates and perhaps setting up a single currency. **********At the same time, community leaders left open the door to the British idea of having not a single currency, but a supplemental, common currency based on the European currency unit. **********In their agreement, the leaders also said the central bank would be formed in early 1994 after several conditions had been met. These included ratifying a new community treaty; establishing a barrier-free Europe; giving independence to members of the new central bank; prohibiting community members from the inflationary practice of financing their deficits by printing money, and having the greatest number of nations join the European Monetary System."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/16/business/finance-new-issues-commonwealth-edison-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 158, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Commonwealth Edison Offering", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Commonwealth Edison Offering", "body_text": " **********The Commonwealth Edison Company of Chicago priced a two-part issue of first mortgage bonds totaling $350 million yesterday through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. **********A $125 million issue of noncallable mortgage bonds due in 2000 was given a 9 3/8 percent coupon and priced to yield 9.445 percent, or about 102 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity. **********The remaining $225 million of bonds due in 2020 were given a coupon of 9 3/4 percent and priced to yield 9.94 percent, or about 146.5 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.

''Who would have thought,'' Mr. Uys has said each night, strictly deadpan, ''that a faceless man with a fax machine could run the country from a prison?'' **********The predominantly white audiences have needed no help identifying the reference to Nelson Mandela, who is the country's and perhaps the world's most famous political prisoner. **********Lately, Mr. Mandela has added to his renown as the symbolic leader of millions of blacks a curiosity value of a highly unusual kind, since he has been negotiating, with the aid of a fax machine and a group of white prison officers who appear to act as much as assistants as captors, not only the terms of his own release but the outlines of what could be the future of South Africa. **********With quickening intensity, South Africans everywhere from the plush northern suburbs of Johannesburg to the dusty back alleys of Soweto have been snapping up the final editions of newspapers at street-corner stands, silencing gatherings to listen to the television news, and collectively sitting on the edge of their seats for news of what everybody seems to regard as one of the most momentous events in South African history: the release of Mr. Mandela, who has been continuously in South African jails since Aug. 5, 1962. **********Midnight Vigil **********On Saturday night, editors of the country's biggest newspaper, The Sunday Times, sat edgily in their offices until after midnight. They were waiting for a call from reporters with mobile telephones stationed outside Victor Verster Prison 40 miles northeast of Cape Town, and at other spots along the route that Mr. Mandela is expected to take back to his home in Soweto, the black satellite city outside Johannesburg, when the country's white rulers finally decide to let him go. **********When the editors finally let the reporters go home, it was because of a further twist in what had already become an enticingly improbable saga. **********According to officials close to President F. W. de Klerk, a move to release Mr. Mandela immediately, two weeks before the most widely predicted date in mid-February, was halted when Mr. de Klerk and other top officials decided that conditions they had set for the release of the 71-year-old black leader had not been met. **********Primarily, these involve a ''commitment to peace'' from Mr. Mandela's exiled associates in the African National Congress, a pledge that they will halt, or at least suspend, the sporadic guerrilla attacks against Government and other targets that they have conducted since Mr. Mandela went underground to lead an armed struggle against domination by the country's white minority in 1961. **********But Winnie Mandela, the black leader's wife, implied after visiting Mr. Mandela on Saturday that the delay came at her husband's behest, after the Government failed to meet his terms. **********These include the ending of the ban on the African National Congress and dozens of other proscribed black groups, the lifting of a state of emergency declared by the Government during anti-Government turmoil in 1986, the release of about 300 political detainees and an end to all ''political'' executions, by which Mr. Mandela means the hanging of blacks found guilty of murder and other capital crimes while engaged in anti-apartheid protests. **********Whether Mr. de Klerk is ready to meet some or all of Mr. Mandela's terms, and to announce a firm date for the black leader's freedom, is expected to be known on Friday, when the President addresses the opening session of Parliament in Cape Town. **********In the meantime, the suggestion advanced by Mrs. Mandela - that her husband might yet refuse to take his freedom, after more than a quarter century in jail that included years spent working in a lime quarry, picking seaweed and building roads - has added intrigue to a situation that has no obvious parallel in the annals of political detention. A Shadow Government?  As Mr. Uys's remark at the Market Theater in Johannesburg suggested, many South Africans are bemused by the idea that a man long presented to them as a Communist and a terrorist has emerged, while still in prison, as a sort of one-man shadow government. **********But perhaps the most striking thing of all is that many whites appear as excited by the situation as blacks, and that the feeling is detectable in some improbable places. **********A visitor who met last week with a high-ranking officer who was previously head of the widely feared Security Police reported that the officer, until recently charged with hunting down and prosecuting members of the African National Congress, compared the situation with the Boer War, the most traumatic event in the history of South Africa's ruling ethnic group, the Afrikaners. ''He seemed absolutely fascinated,'' the visitor said. **********For the moment, many whites and blacks have their attention fixed on the unusual details of Mr. Mandela's continuing incarceration. **********For more than a year, he has been living in a spacious bungalow home about four miles from the main prison building outside Paarl, in the mountainous wine country behind Cape Town. The bungalow was previously the home of the white man who was the prison's deputy governor, and Mr. Mandela has the use of a swimming pool on the bungalow's grounds. He is also helped in his communications with his associates outside the prison, and in greeting a stream of visitors, including high-ranking Government ministers, by three white prison officers. Newspapers have noted that the officers are confined to using the servant's quarters at the home, cramped outbuildings that have been converted to offices and temporary sleeping quarters. **********As described by The Sunday Times, Mr. Mandela has developed relationships with his white captors that seem more like those of equals than of those between a prisoner and his guards. The paper said that visitors to the home have reported that the white guards refer to Mr. Mandela with respect, and call him by his first name, and that one of them, identified as Warrant Officer Greg Gregory, has developed a particularly close relationship with Mr. Mandela, having been transferred with the black leader through three prisons: the notorious Robben Island fortress off Cape Town, Pollsmoor jail outside the city, and finally to Victor Verster. **********Still a Prisoner **********But other aspects of Mr. Mandela's situation make it plain that that in many respects he is still treated as a prisoner. Visitors are searched, letters and other documents passing in and out of the bungalow are read by prison staff, although not censored, and Mr. Mandela has a radio and television set that can pull in South African broadcasts, but nothing from abroad. **********This means that much of what he hears has passed through Government censors, since the South African Broadcasting Corporation, which dominates broadcasting, is under tight Government control. The black guards at the home are armed, and the facsimile machine is situated in the main prison, not in the bungalow. **********Another paradox is that Mr. Mandela has become one of the most widely quoted political figures in the country, second only to Mr. de Klerk, although South Africa's Prisons Act makes it an offense to quote a prisoner or to give any details of his incarceration. **********Another oddity, captured in Mr. Uys's remark about Mr. Mandela's being ''faceless,'' is that none of the photographers covering the story have yet been allowed to take a current photograph of the black leader. The editor of one major newspaper said that he had been told that major international photo agencies have offered sums of up to $300,000 for pictures of the black leader in prison. **********For his part, Mr. Mandela, who is said to be fit, but white-haired and slimmer than he was when he was imprisoned for life, is said to have been amused, while taking a stroll on the prison grounds recently, to have gone unrecognized by photographers gathered outside the gate. **********''He was enormously tickled,'' one of the black leader's lawyers said. ''There he is, the center of world attention, and these hawk-eyed newspapermen didn't even recognize him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/03/business/business-and-health-most-want-us-to-pay-the-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1990-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 943, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business and Health;   Most Want U.S. To Pay the Bill", "print_headline": "Business and Health;   Most Want U.S. To Pay the Bill", "body_text": " **********A LARGE number of Americans say they would gladly exchange their health-care system for one in Canada, which is entirely financed by the Government. **********Surveys by The Los Angeles Times in March, NBC last year and Louis Harris & Associates in 1988 all showed that majorities of at least 61 percent of those polled favored a comprehensive national health plan. In the Harris poll, respondents chose the Canadian way in preference to both the American approach and the British system of Government-controlled doctors and hospitals. The choice in The Los Angeles Times poll was between the American and Canadian systems only. **********Canadians go to their own doctors, who practice independently but are all in the system. All medical bills are paid with tax money. **********The surveys worry employers and insurers. Many employers believe that higher taxes would outweigh their savings under a Canadian-style system (although American auto makers with plants in Canada have not found this to be so). And health insurers fear that their business would be decimated if the Government took over. But health-insurance experts say the Canadian system is not really the issue and that most Americans know little about either its strengths or its weaknesses. **********''The issue is financial insecurity,'' said Robert J. Blendon, chairman of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Harvard School of Public Health. Even people who have health insurance worry that their coverage may be cut back or eliminated and that they may be unable to afford medical care, he said in an interview. Americans pay 26 percent, on average, of their own health-care bills. At least 16 percent do not have either private or Government insurance. **********''When a lot of people think about health care, they see a dollar sign, they see risk, they see catastrophic danger,'' said John Erb, a managing consultant in New York with Foster Higgins, an employee benefits consulting firm. In a new study of the public's feelings about health care, Dr. Blendon, along with Robert Leitman, a senior vice president with Harris; Ian Morrison, an economist with the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif., and Karen Donelan, a Harvard research associate, looked at 10 countries. They found that the degree of satisfaction with the system was highest in Canada, followed by the Netherlands, West Germany, France, Australia, Sweden, Japan, Britain and Italy. Satisfaction was lowest in the United States. The United States and South Africa are the only major industrial countries that do not have Government-paid health-care systems. **********But the low approval rating and widespread preference for Canada's system did not mean that Americans were dissatisfied with their doctors and hospitals, or even that they believed national spending on health care was too high, the researchers said. ''Rather, this response indicates the high level of public frustration with our current health financing arrangements,'' the Blendon group said in Health Affairs, a quarterly journal. **********Businesses of all sizes are also frustrated, said Karen Berg Brigham, health-care policy manager with the United States Chamber of Commerce. They have all been hit by rapidly growing health costs, and many small employers have had difficulty getting affordable coverage. In a survey last winter of 1,101 small-business executives for the Chamber of Commerce, 21 percent said the United States should adopt a Canadian-style system, while 56 percent opposed the idea and 23 percent were undecided. **********But Ms. Brigham said the demonstration of interest in the survey should not be seen as an endorsement of Government health insurance. She noted that many foreign systems were largely financed by payroll taxes. ''This is of great concern to business, especially small businesses, she said. ''The payroll tax is one of their largest costs.'' ''The majority of employers would find their costs increasing under a Canadian system,'' said Mr. Erb of Foster Higgins. ''But for Rust Belt manufacturers with huge numbers of retirees who have expensive health-care needs, spreading the risk to the Government might lower an employer's costs.'' **********The health insurance industry has also found that people are concerned about losing their insurance, said Edward Neuschler, director of policy studies with the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group. But in a survey last year for the insurers by the Roper Organization, the overwhelming percentage of respondents ''were pleased with their current coverage and benefits,'' he said. The insurers group has proposed changes in state laws and a privately financed reinsurance plan to make it easier for small-business employees to get and keep affordable coverage. **********The Blendon article said the United States spent $2,051 per capita on health care in 1987, or 28 percent more than Canada, which was second with $1,483. Sweden was next, at $1,233; then France, $1,105; West Germany, $1,093, and the Netherlands, $1,041. Australia spent $939; Japan, $915; Italy, $841, and Britain, $758. **********But the Canadians also have problems with health care. Costs are rising as rapidly there as in the United States, said Mr. Neuschler of the Health Insurance Association. And when Americans are told that Canadians often must wait for long periods for certain complicated operations, like a coronary bypass or hip replacement, ''they do not at all like the notion,'' he said. Indeed, Americans are largely uninformed about the Canadian health system, Dr. Blendon said. He added, ''If it weren't for the high costs in the U.S., the world would probably be discussing why Canada is so expensive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/05/world/in-a-tribute-chile-reburies-allende.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1990-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In a Tribute, Chile Reburies Allende", "print_headline": "In a Tribute, Chile Reburies Allende", "body_text": " **********The Allende family, led by one of the former President's daughters, Isabel Allende, organized the funeral with the help of the Aylwin Government, which sought to soften the effect of the funeral by not declaring national mourning or asking for military honors. **********The remains of Dr. Allende, who died as the presidential palace was under attack from the armed forces on Sept. 11, 1973, were disinterred this morning from an unmarked grave in a cemetery in Vina del Mar and driven to Santiago. **********The Alameda Bernardo O'Higgins, the widest thoroughfare in Santiago, was lined with people waving Chilean and Socialist flags as the caravan made its way to the Cathedral, where Archbishop Carlos Oviedo Cavada presided over a religious ceremony ''to present his soul to the Lord.''

In that frontier state, mining is the last source of employment and the largest source of tax revenue. **********As police reinforcements started to arrive early this month, demonstrations by miners broke out almost daily in Boa Vista's central square. The square holds the city's only major monument, a cement rendering of a man in a broad brimmed hat panning for gold. **********''The People of Roraima Back the Miners'' read one banner at a demonstration at which prospectors applauded speakers who alternately attributed the Government's evacuation policy to multinational mining companies and the Vatican, a reference to official Roman Catholic support for Yanomami rights. **********One afternoon, angry miners set fire to grass outside the residence of the local Catholic Bishop, Aldo Mongiano. The Italian-born bishop, who now has police protection, has complained that telephone death threats against him increased after President Sarney announced the evacuation policy last month. **********Police Occupy Airstrips **********The miners' fears were fulfilled on Jan. 8, when the federal police occupied Boa Vista's international airport and seven unregistered dirt strips in the area. With as many as 400 takeoffs a day last month, the strips provided airborne umbilical cords, bringing food, diesel fuel and other supplies to the jungle mining camps. **********Since occupying the airstrips, the police have required pilots to file flight plans and have not allowed planes to take off with food and diesel fuel. **********Defying the police, a handful of pilots, known in Boa Vista as cowboys, repeatedly buzzed the control tower of the city airport on the first night of the flight ban.

A Yanomami village that became the miners' major air hub, Paapayiu, is now a federal police base. **********But with 6,000 men holed up in mining camps around Bahian Ant, a particularly rich area, the police fear the hard part may be yet to come. **********Miners Stock Up **********Several miners have boasted that they flew in enough provisions last month to enable them to hold out in the jungle until March 15, the day Fernando Collor de Mello is to be inaugurated as the next President of Brazil. Mr. Collor, a free market conservative, easily swept the Amazon in the December elections. Roraima voters gave him his largest state margin in all of Brazil. **********Mr. Collor has not made public his stand on the gold miners. **********Early this month Rubem Vilar, a senator from Mr. Collor's home state, Alagoas, traveled to Boa Vista to express solidarity with the miners and to report by telephone to the President-elect, who was on vacation in Europe. **********On Monday, one of Mr. Collor's environmental advisers, Apoena Elles, said of the Yanomami lands, ''Now the situation has reached such a point that it is practically impossible to evacuate the area.'' **********To lure the miners out of the woods and to defuse the threat of violence in Boa Vista, Brazil's Justice Minister announced last week that a deal had been reached to allow the miners to prospect for gold in 2,567 square miles of national forest in Roraima. **********Accord an 'Escape Valve' **********''We have reached a solution Brazilian-style - with sugar and affection,'' the minister, Saulo Ramos, announced on Jan. 9. ''Taking out the miners is not like lining up pupils at a boarding school.'' **********Romeu Tuma, director general of the federal police, hailed the arrangement as an ''escape valve.'' **********An accord signed by Roraima State officials and miners' representatives requires the miners to deliver their firearms to the police, adopt equipment to cut the use of mercury in gold refining and pay a tax to be used to build and support schools and medical clinics for the Yanomami. **********''Gold miners are not animals to be hunted in the forest,'' said Romero Juca, the Governor of Roraima. **********But Indian rights groups, Catholic church leaders, environmentalists and federal prosecutors immediately denounced the arrangment as a violation of a judge's order last October that the miners be withdrawn from all Yanomami lands, an area twice the size of Switzerland. Critics said the new arrangement would set a precedent for opening up the two-thirds of Yanomami lands that are now classified as national forests. **********'A Complete Disaster' **********''It will be a complete disaster because the miners leave a trail of devastation wherever they go,'' said Fernando Cesar Mesquita, president of the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources.

This is not really a valley, but it's not a peak either.'' **********A continued increase in prices, which have nearly doubled over the last five years, has not helped, they say. ''What's happened with this whole perestroika business is that every Soviet company is trying to make more hard currency than ever before,'' said Sidney Reiner, president of Cosmos Travel. **********The price increases have been steep, particularly from 1987 to 1989, when there was a 25 percent jump in Soviet-controlled costs, Mr. Schaffner said. And, Ms. Cavalli said delicately, ''there has to be a commensurate increase in service'' - a reference to the often-haphazard and sometimes churlish attention lavished on tourists in Soviet hotels and restaurants. **********Mr. Schaffner said the State Department's advisory on crime had caused four high school groups and two student groups from Northern Illinois University to cancel their plans, although one of the university groups recently rebooked for October. **********Perennial Frustrations **********Paradoxically, the falloff in tourism has not shortened the visa lines at the Soviet consulate in Washington, where a three-hour line of business executives, scientists, professors and tourists recently stretched for two blocks. **********The perennial frustrations of Soviet travel, from creaky bureaucracies to nonexistent restaurant service, have lessened somewhat over the last few years, but tour operators say Americans' curiosity and willingness to endure frustration may be eroding, particularly when there are new places to be curious about. Ms. Cavalli said the summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S.

Most exchanges are based on reciprocal visits, with Americans paying for the Soviets who come here and Soviet organizations hosting American students, writers, artists and musicians there. **********But the Soviet airline Aeroflot and some Soviet hotels are insisting that all tickets and rooms for foreigners must be paid for in convertible currency, not the increasingly scorned ruble. Soviet hosts - educational institutions, the Soviet concert agency Goskontsert, the Academy of Science -are reluctant to part with convertible Western currencies, which are in short supply in most Soviet organizations and are often the only way of paying for sophisticated technical equipment. **********''The ideas for exchanges are there, the interest is there, but it's increasingly hard to put these things together,'' said Molly Raymond, deputy coordinator of the President's United States-Soviet Exchange Initiative, a United States Information Agency office that handles exchange activities. ''I see a lot of frustration out there.'' **********In particular, she fears that the new scramble for dollars and the determination of Aeroflot to earn hard currency are raising new complications for the growing array of American-Soviet exchanges. Many are fledgling efforts involving small towns, high schools or community hospitals that may have large resevoirs of good will, but little understanding of the frustrations involved. **********Aeroflot's Requirement **********Aeroflot earlier this year announced the requirement that all foreigners' tickets be paid for in convertible Western currencies, regardless whether they were tourists, who have always paid hard currency, or the guests of Soviet organizations, who have not. **********Aeroflot officials could not be reached for comment, despite several telephone calls. But the Soviet airline, like most other Soviet industries and service organizations, is part of the Government-mandated self-financing program, learning how to survive in an quasi-market economy. **********''I can understand why they are doing it,'' said Vasily Istratov, a Senior Research Fellow from Moscow based at Middlebury College. ''They are trying to teach themselves how to manage in real business.'' **********''We have a growing power of individual institutions and a deteriorating power of the center,'' he said. ''The situation is imbalanced in the country as a whole. The thing you can be sure of is hard currency.'' **********Mr. Istratov works with 65 Soviet students who are studying at 25 schools around the country as part of the undergraduate exchange program of the Intercollegiate Consortium. **********Charles Dillingham, president of the Entertainment Corporation U.S.A., said that Aeroflot brought up the issue of ticket prices in connection with the planned Soviet tour of the English National Opera Company later this month, but that Goskontsert, the Soviet sponsor of the tour, defused the problem. **********Could the regulation limit future eudcational and cultural exchanges? **********''No question.''

In all, about 30 PET systems - costing $3 million to $6 million each - are expected to be installed this year worldwide. That is a large increase given that the technology - which uses isotopes to track metabolism rates involving a variety of ailments - is now available in little more than 100 research hospitals. **********Moreover, the Federal Medicare program is taking a fresh look at PET to see if it has become a routine and cost-effective procedure that the Government would pay for, rather than just a research tool. A decision is expected next year. If the Government extends coverage for the procedure, which typically costs $1,200 to $2,200, private insurers would be pressed to follow suit. Only a few insurers now provide reimbursement. **********But despite these good omens, it is far from clear that PET scanners will become a medical fixture any time soon. Industry experts note that the Medicare study is coming at a time of tough budgetary constraints. And many insurers and employers are loath to unleash yet another big-ticket medical procedure after struggling for years against spiraling health costs. **********MEDICARE was severely criticized when it approved CT and magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) for reimbursement ''and everybody went out and bought one,'' said David J. Archibald, a vice president with Siemens Medical Systems in Hoffman Estates, Ill. ''In today's cost-containment environment, you have to show that PET is not only useful but cost-effective compared with other procedures,'' said Sheri Samotin, a managing consultant with the Wilkerson Group, a health-care consulting firm based in New York. **********Some heart specialists say PET's value has been established in deciding whether to do bypass surgery, which can cost $30,000. By detecting whether cells in the heart muscle are metabolizing glucose, PET can tell if an otherwise inactive area is sufficiently alive to warrant a bypass. **********Researchers have also used PET in preparing for brain surgery, screening for Alzheimer's disease and spotting tumors that other scanning methods miss. **********PET systems employ a cyclotron to produce short-lived isotopes that emit particles known as positrons. The isotopes are joined chemically to natural substances like glucose or oxygen and injected into the patient's blood stream. Scanning machines then track the so-called tracer materials as they are metabolized in the body. **********Medical diagnostic imaging exploded into $8 billion in worldwide sales in the 1980's. Analysts say General Electric and Siemens each had more than $3 billion in medical imaging and equipment servicing sales last year. Thousands of hospitals and medical groups routinely screen patients and make diagnoses with CT and M.R.I. scanners. CT is based on X-rays while M.R.I. uses radio waves in a strong magnetic field to cause atoms to emit detectable energy. **********Although it detects things that CT and M.R.I. do not, PET has had trouble being accepted as a routine procedure eligible for insurance reimbursement. **********A few insurers have recently started to pay on a case-by-case and doctor-by-doctor basis. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida, for example, said it covers PET scans to determine if heart bypass surgery or angioplasty, an alternative treatment for blocked coronary arteries, is worth trying. **********But the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not recommend paying for PET, although a study group is weighing the possibility of coverage in the future. The Health Insurance Association of America, an insurer trade group based in Washington, also plans a study this fall. **********The Federal Government review is the most important of all since insurers and employers rarely pay for a procedure until Medicare does. **********The Public Health Service will probably finish reviewing PET by year-end, said Dr. Thomas Holohan, director of the service's Office of Health Technology Assessment. But he said its recommendation would not go to Medicare until the Food and Drug Administration formally approves fluorodeoxyglucose, the tracer molecule in most PET scans. The F.D.A. will probably make its recommendation late next spring, after PET users compile records about the drug's safety, said J. Michael McGehee, the Washington-based executive director of the Institute for Clinical PET. The institute is gathering data in support of reimbursement. **********Several professional groups have cautiously endorsed PET. The American College of Cardiology said in March that the imaging ''appears to be useful'' in deciding whether to proceed with coronary bypass surgery. But the heart specialists added that PET's value in routine screening for heart disease has not been established. **********The American College of Radiology recently declared that PET also offers ''unique information'' in selecting patients for surgery for epilepsy who are not helped by drugs and in assessing brain tumors. **********But some experts remain skeptical about reimbursement. ''Everyone says that probably within a year, Medicare will start paying for PET,'' said Philip G. Drew, a consultant to radiologists and equipment makers in Concord, Mass. ''I think that is wishful thinking. I don't think it will take off.'' **********In any event, the PET industry has been trying to spread the high costs of the technology to stimulate sales. **********''It looks as though the cost of setting up a PET center is going to drop dramatically,'' said Neal C. Bradsher, a health-care securities analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. **********CTI Services, a unit of Siemens's partner, Computer Technology Inc., recently financed a cyclotron on the grounds of St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Fla. CTI hopes to sell isotopes to several nearby hospitals, which would then not need their own cyclotron. U.C.L.A. may offer a similar service. **********The Positron Corporation, a privately held startup company based in Houston, has a system that goes a step further, eliminating the cyclotron entirely. It employs rubidium 82, a recently approved isotope, which is made with a much less expensive generator. Rubidium is now primarily used just for heart scans, however. **********Three University of Pennsylvania scientists - Gerd Muehllehner, Joel S. Karp and David Mankoff - cut costs by designing a scanner that uses six sodium iodide detectors instead of the thousands of tiny bismuth germanate detectors in other PET scanners. **********''The cost is just under $1 million, compared with $2 million to $3 million for other PET scanners,'' Dr. Karp said. UGM Medical Systems, a startup based in a university building, is making the machines. **********Other researchers, including some financed by the Government's Strategic Defense Initiative, are developing smaller, less costly, cyclotrons and alternative ways of producing isotopes, said G.E.'s Mr. Robinson. **********For its part, G.E. is working on engineering changes to make PET ''more reliable'' and easier to run with fewer high-priced physicists and chemists, Mr. Robinson said, adding, ''There will be a true clinical market in three to five years.'' **********KEEPING UP WITH THE RESEARCH **********Advances in the more established medical imaging techniques may complicate the prospects for PET, even as the companies that make the positron emission tomography scanners scramble for a niche in the market. **********''Medical imaging technology is advancing so rapidly it is difficult for most of us to keep up with it,'' said Dr. Gerald M. Pohost, a cardiologist and director of the University of Alabama Center for Nuclear Imaging Research in Birmingham. He said studies with magnetic resonance imagers, which are already widely used by physicians, ''can lead to images that look like PET.'' **********The center in Birmingham recently got an M.R.I. system from Germany that it describes as ''twice as powerful as any M.R.I. system now in clinical use.'' **********Dr. Pohost said M.R.I. studies have already had some success in determining whether an organ is being rejected after a transplant operation. The non-invasive scan could supplant the biopsy that is currently used whenever rejection is suspected. He also envisages a capability in which M.R.I. would look at fats inside the heart. **********Other researchers are working on magnetic resonance angiograms, which provide images of the blood flow without the need for injecting tracer materials. **********''From the patient's perspective, the fact that M.R.I. technology is non-invasive makes it very attractive for research, diagnosis and therapy design,'' Dr. Pohost said. **********In July, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston announced plans to open a center for diagnostic imaging research. The hospital is associated with Harvard Medical School. **********The Sterling Drug Company, which makes imaging agents and is a unit of the Eastman Kodak Company, has pledged $18 million for the center, which would study M.R.I., magnetic resonance spectroscopy, PET and ultrasound.

Mr. Poling, an avid golfer with an eight handicap, believes his office game parallels his golf game. He says he strives for consistency in corporate decision-making just as he does on the links. **********''The three most important things in business and in golf are consistency, dependability and predictability,'' Mr. Poling said. ''If my game is good, it's because I'm consistent in my swing. I don't need a big wide fairway.'' **********In fact, the theory that an executive's golf game has direct correlations to how he or she performs on the job and in life is the subject of a new book on corporate leadership, called ''The Executive Trap,'' by Jay Hall, a Houston management consultant who has a doctorate in psychology. Having concluded that executives play all of their games the same way, Mr. Hall uses the game of golf to illustrate how executives make decisions. **********Mr. Hall, of course, is not the first to draw parallels between the types of games or sports people play and the way they function in life. Child psychologists have long studied play to gain insight into childhood disorders and learning habits. And common sense dictates that the hard-driving executive is likely to be just as relentless at his weekend tennis game as he is in the board room. **********Indeed, the way men and women learn to play games, and the importance they attach to those games, has always been recognized to be an outgrowth of their personalities. ''There's no question that all of us are affected by similar things in our lifestyle and in our golf,'' claims Jim Flick, a noted golf professional and 1988 Professional Golf Association Teacher of the Year. ''The toughest executives to teach golf to are engineers, accountants and lawyers. Because their work is so detail oriented, they are too tense and too controlled in their swings. They have no sense of rhythm in their golf swing. On the other hand, more hang-loose businessmen like salesmen are among the easiest to teach. In both work and in golf, they tend to look at the big picture. They never get bogged down in details.'' **********But what is novel about Dr. Hall's spiel is its focus on the game of golf as a key to understanding some of the problems that plague top executives. ''In its construction, golf is the one game that most nearly parallels human life experience,'' Dr. Hall said. ''In golf, you play the course, instead of playing someone else, and it is the only sport where people must call infractions on themselves. Integrity is what keeps it going. The temptations to cheat are the same as the moral decisions you have to make in life.'' **********In short, he claims, nothing duplicates the subtle nuances, exhilaration and bad breaks of life as well as the game of golf. And nothing, his theory goes, poses a bigger dilemma to executives both on the golf course and in the office than their ambivalence about making decisions. **********''We've got an epidemic of flawed executive leadership,'' Dr. Hall claimed. ''These executives either do not know how to make a decision or, once they do, are afraid to make it for fear that once they do, they'll have to give up something else that is important to them.'' **********In the office, such ambivalence might arise over a decision to give up some power to achieve better communication with colleagues. The equivalent on the course might be a conflict over whether to sacrifice distance in a particular shot for, say, accuracy. **********In Mr. Poling's case, it is not as much a matter of decision-making as playing strategically. He says he tries to imbue his management style with the same strong focus on strategy he uses in golf. ''In golf, as in business, you need to play strategically,'' he said. ''As you walk up to the next shot, you're not looking at the beautiful scenery around you. Instead, you're watching the terrain, noticing the impact of the wind, looking at the green to see the hazards. Then, if you miss the shot, you're trying to see how it can contribute to the game.'' **********He says he also reaches for balance in his game. ''Everyone likes to hit a drive the farthest, but you actually use a driver less than you do a putter,'' he said. ''You ought to put just as much emphasis on putting as on the rest of your game.'' **********Finally, Mr. Poling notes, an executive must be sensitive to timing - and act accordingly. ''In our business, you must get the product to market on time. If you delay, you'll miss the whole market for that product,'' he said. ''I learned about timing at a golf club in England, where the requirement was that you had to be finished with your game in three hours or less. My family and I would play 18 holes in three hours; over here you wouldn't even think of being able to do that. It showed me what you can do if you just concentrate.'' **********Mr. Hall named another Ford executive, David Scott, as a person who embodies his theory. Mr. Scott, who happens to be Ford's vice president of external affairs, is indeed enthusiastic about Mr. Hall's principles. ''So much of golf is between the ears,'' he said. ''I've gone from a 13 handicap to a nine handicap and my improvement has to do with applying some of the principles I've learned over the years in management to my game.'' But he said the real expert on the relationship between the sport and the office is his boss: Mr. Poling, whom he suggested as an interview. **********''He's got a beautiful, compact, consistent swing,'' he said. ''And in business, the way you get the best product is through teamwork and consistency.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/11/world/questions-arise-as-whales-avoid-baja-waters.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Questions Arise as Whales Avoid Baja Waters", "print_headline": "Questions Arise as Whales Avoid Baja Waters", "body_text": " **********The thousands of gray whales that are normally drawn to the warm bays of Baja California to give birth have failed to show up so far this season, and the authorities say they do not know why. **********''This is the first time this has happened,'' the head of conservation for the Department of Ecology and Urban Development, Graciela de la Garza, said on Friday. **********Speculation about the reason for the whales' disappearance range from the effects of last year's oil spill in Alaska to a new cold-water current in the Pacific, near Mexico's western peninsula. Normally about 2,000 gray whales migrate to Baja California, giving birth to about 1,000 calves before returning to Arctic waters, marine mammal experts said. **********Only 12 to 20 have arrived so far this year, the Mexican authorities say.

Mr. Cesena said, ''It would be interesting to check out that theory.'' But, he added, ''I consider the water pollution theory very remote.'' **********He said the prevailing theory is that a a rare cold current is keeping the whales from their accustomed haunts in warmer water. The current is less than a mile from land in some places, he said. **********The temperature, strength and exact route of the current, called the Corriente de la Nina, are still being studied, and an aerial search is being conducted for whales in the Pacific, Mr. Hernandez said. **********''Once the cold water is past, maybe the whales will appear,'' Mr. Cesena said.

Eradication Effort's Failings **********This bumper crop is bad news for the United States, which is the major consumer of the end products of the jungle harvest: cocaine and crack. **********During the 1980's, the United States Government spent millions of dollars seeking to eradicate coca-leaf cultivation here in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, source of the raw material for half of the world's cocaine. **********A few miles from here, on the far bank of the muddy Huallaga River, stands the most visible evidence of the American effort, Santa Lucia base. From this heavily fortified base, helicopter-borne teams of American and Peruvian anti-drug agents destroyed in the last year about 150 coca-leaf processing laboratories and dozens of coca-bush nurseries. **********The eradication campaign has slowed crop expansion to a 10 percent annual increase. Paradoxically, without the American effort, coca cultivation probably would have exploded, setting off a price collapse and bankruptcy for many coca farmers. Drug Issue Becomes Marginal **********Today, many Peruvians and Americans are suggesting a reassessment of policies toward coca production. **********President Alberto Fujimori, an agronomist who took office on July 28, has retired top police officers involved in eradication efforts and declined to accept $36 million in American military aid. The money was to be used in part to intercept the small planes that take off daily from Uchiza's dirt airstrip, carrying up to 1,500 pounds of coca paste for cocaine powder refineries in neighboring Colombia. **********Advocating a gradual approach, the President proposed making alternative farm crops attractive by clearing away bureaucratic and infrastructure obstacles that peasants face here. **********In Washington, the drug issue has become increasingly marginal. With hundreds of thousands of American soldiers massed for war in the Persian Gulf, drugs no longer seem to be nation's \"gravest domestic threat\" -- a phrase used by President Bush last year. American Reporter Slain **********While Peruvians and Americans debate a new approach to the coca harvest, leaders of the new coca-growers union here complain that few policy makers make the 230-mile flight from Lima to this frontier town of 50,000 people, the largest in the Huallaga Valley. **********The dearth of visitors stems largely from the region's reputation for danger. **********Last year, a visiting American freelance reporter, Todd Smith, was kidnapped while he waited at Uchiza's airstrip for a plane out of here. Several days later, his mutilated body was found on Uchiza's main square, bearing a placard that said, \"This is how Yankees die.\" **********More recently, on Oct. 19, the Peruvian Army general in charge of troops in the valley was ambushed and severely wounded as he drove on a road near here.  Changing Town's Violent Ways **********Such incidents are variously attributed to drug traffickers or two Marxist guerrilla armies that seek to win growers' support in the valley. **********Today, having just come from the wake of a former Mayor who was shot to death Wednesday night, Mr. Diaz said he was working to change Uchiza's violent ways. Carefully stepping around a sawed-off shotgun he keeps within reach of his swivel chair, Mr. Diaz warmly greeted a visitor to the town offices and handed out copies of Uchiza's first \"Trade, Tourism and Services Guide.\" **********Published last month, the full-color brochure reveals that Uchiza has one Roman Catholic church, five Evangelical Protestant churches, five pool halls, 20 air-taxi services and 28 bars. Advertisers include two of Mr. Diaz's businesses -- Uchiza's only television station and Porky's, a discotheque that regularly attracts some of the best salsa bands from Lima. **********Turning on a overhead fan to move the humid tropical air through his office, the 34-year-old Mayor then pressed into a visitor's hand copies of the city's first newspaper, a monthly that started publication in September. Dependence on Coca Harvest **********\"Eradication is not the solution,\" the current edition's editorial said about the coca harvest. **********\"Violent eradication would leave peasants without an economic base to survive, increasing the chances that 200,000 peasants would join the subversive groups\" it continued, echoing a widespread sentiment here. **********Mr. Diaz, a native son who was overwhelmingly elected last November, estimated that 80 percent of Uchiza's economy revolved around the coca leaf. The coca growers, inhabitants of the tin-roof shacks that dot the deforested hills around here, are largely refugees from the left-wing terrorism that plagues the Peruvian Andes. **********Peru's Government calculates that one million people of the nation's population of 22 million depend on coca harvests for their livelihood. Probably the nation's largest export, Peru's coca-leaf harvest annually sells for $1 billion to $1.5 billion. **********Climbing behind the wheel of his car for a tour of the town, Mr. Diaz said that the major obstacle blocking a switch to legal crops is transportation. **********He said the road to Lima was so bad that it takes 38 hours for a truck to travel the 270 miles to the capital on the Pacific Ocean. **********Because of high transportation costs, bribes demanded by guerrillas and policemen, and export monopolies, coffee growers in the valley receive only 30 percent of their export price. In constrast, American farmers generally receive 90 percent of the price of products at the port, according to the Institute of Freedom and Democracy, a free-market research group that prepared Mr. Fujimori's anti-drug proposal. **********\"To send a load of wood to the coast is as expensive as sending the same wood from the coast to Rotterdam,\" said another member of the city tour, Rolando del Aguila Hidalgo, adviser for the newly created Institute for the Integrated Development of the Upper Huallaga. Change 'If It's Profitable' **********On the city tour, Mr. Diaz took pains to point out the kind of American aid that locals appreciate: a steamroller, three dump trucks and a road grader, all provided by the United States Administration for International Development. **********Working on clearing new city streets, the American-provided road building equipment is the kind of development aid that residents here say could eventually allow crop substitution. **********\"All our 1,400 members grow coca,\" Justo Silva Vallon, manager of the Upper Huallaga Agricultural Cooperative, said in an interview at the cooperative's newly inaugurated office building. **********\"The peasants want to change -- if it's profitable,\" he continued, referring to such alternative crops as coffee, cocoa and corn. **********A more militant stance was taken by Mario Campo Roldon, a board member of a new group, the Defense Front Against Coca Eradication in the Upper Huallaga. **********\"We are tired of studies, speeches and promises,\" Mr. Campo said, his chest glistening with sweat in the Amazon heat. \"We want to substitute, but we want concrete facts -- better roads, agricultural extension services.\" **********Growers here said they were skeptical of Mr. Fujimori's drug proposal of Oct. 26, saying it was intended more to mollify American public opinion than to deliver services here. Indeed, the speech was written by officials in Lima who are keenly aware that six months from now, the United States Congress must certify that Peru is cooperating in the war on drugs in order for Peru to win a large portion of the $250 million in American aid proposed for Peru in 1991. **********The minimal interest shown by Peru's army in stopping the drug trade was illustrated at the end of the day at the airport here, one of the busiest of 150 strips estimated to be used to ship coca paste north to Colombia. **********Asked about the large number of late-model, long-haul airplanes parked in the grass by the dirt strip, the local army commander replied, \"What's the point of arresting drug dealers if more are just going pop up to take their place?\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/18/world/us-peruvian-teams-renew-drive-on-coca.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1990-03-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-Peruvian Teams Renew Drive on Coca", "print_headline": "U.S.-Peruvian Teams Renew Drive on Coca", "body_text": " **********After a yearlong break to strengthen security, a joint Peruvian-American force has resumed eradication of coca plants in the Upper Huallaga Valley, a guerrilla stronghold in northern Peru that is the source of half of the world's cocaine crop. **********''This time, we are targeting the seedbeds,'' a United States Embassy official said of the clandestine nurseries.

Northeast could not be reached for comment. **********In recent years, banking regulators have forced the industry to build capital reserves, which are a percentage of an institution's assets that are held in reserve to absorb future losses. **********But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has urged even higher levels. Just last month, he told the Senate Banking Committee that the single most effective means of insuring stability and strength in the banking system was high levels of capital. **********Today's action gave the Fed an opportunity to demonstrate publicly what it has been saying privately for a long time, said one banking expert who asked not to be named: ''They expect very high capital ratios.'' **********Even before today's decision, however, the merger was in doubt. Bank of New York and Northeast were in a dispute over the value of the Connecticut concern. Northeast had placed its acquisition value at about $500 million. But Bank of New York said that, after looking at the institution's books, a large reduction in the value of its loans would be needed and the actual value of the institution was $195.6 million. **********In 1983, when the two companies agreed to merge as soon as Connecticut law allowed acquisitions by out-of-state banks, Northeast's banking market was thriving. But in January, J. Carter Bacot, chairman of the Bank of New York, said that the weakening trend in the New England ecnomy suggested that the Connecticut company faced difficult times. Earlier that month, Northeast had announced a big increase in troubled loans that cut 1989 profits to $632,000 from $34.6 million in 1988, The Connecticut legislation was approved in March to permit banks in that state to be acquired by out-of-state banks, but because of the financial dispute between Bank of New York and Northeast, industry analysts had been expecting that even if the Fed approved the transaction, it would not have been completed by the two parties. **********Nevertheless, today's signal on capital requirements will not be lost to the industry. **********Mr. Greenspan appears to have strong support for his position on the board, where the vote to reject the Bank of New York's application was unanimous. **********''The board has stated that it expects banking organizations contemplating expansion proposals to maintain strong capital levels substantially above the minimum levels specified by the board's capital adequacy guidelines,'' the Fed said today. **********''The board carefuly analyzes the effect of expansion proposals on the preservation of strong capital levels and has adopted a policy that there should be no significant diminution of financial strength for the purpose of effecting major expansion,'' it said. **********High Amount of Good Will **********In particular, the Fed said it was rejecting the bid by the Bank of New York because the resulting institutions would have very high levels of so-called intangible capital, particularly good will. **********Good will is generally the premium paid in an acquisition above the market value of an institution, and regulators have complained it is, in essence, a worthless book entry and does not represent a real cash cushion. **********''After the proposed acquisition, tangible capital ratios for the combined organization would not be substantially above the board's minimum capital levels and would be less than the current average levels of the Bank of New York's peer group of the nation's largest regional banking organizations,'' the Fed said. **********Future Implications **********The implications of today's action for the banking industry are significant. It would appear that in the future, only the banks that can maintain profitable businesses and continue to build large capital pools will be permitted to expand through mergers or acquisitions. **********Bank of New York had proposed to pay $195.6 million for Northeast Bancorp either by selling subordinated debt, or through a cash and stock transaction. **********But the Fed said in its statement that in addition to overall measures of capital falling unacceptably low as a result of the merger, either financing technique would leave the bank's levels of cash-like capital assets, often referred to as tangible capital, below levels agreed to under an agreement made between Bank of New York and the Fed when it acquired the Irving Bank Corporation in 1989. **********The Fed said that antitrust issues, such as excessive concentration, were not a concern. **********The Fed announcement was made after the close of stock trading.On the New York Stock Exchange earlier, Bank of New York shares fell 12.5 cents each, to $24.50.

Forming bunches as thick as a fat man's waist near the center of each floor, they fan out across offices to telephones, answering machines, lamps and computers. **********But as more machines crowd the nation's desks, this snarl of wiring threatens to throttle some companies' ability to rearrange staff and departments. To eliminate the newest and fastest-growing family of wires -- the ones connecting computers -- electronics and computer companies have begun introducing products to link computers with light, radio and microwave signals. **********Last month, the NCR Corporation introduced a personal computer circuit board that sends and receives ultrahigh-frequency radio signals at a rate of two million bits a second and costs $1,395. The Photonics Corporation, Campbell, Calif., has been shipping since September 1989 an infrared light device that transmits one million bits of data a second, costs $1,195 and serves four computers. **********Motorola Inc. says its wireless product, expected early next year at a price up to $2,000 a unit, runs at 15 million bits a second, fast enough for all the standard networking software now used with wires. And Apple Computer Inc., in preparation for its own entry into the market, is petitioning the Federal Communications Commission to set aside for computer communications some radio frequencies very similar to those now used by cellular telephones. **********A few small companies have been selling wireless computer links for more than a year, but these have been fairly simple devices that moved data and programs too slowly to meet most demands. The recent products are up to 700 times faster. But while the cost of computers has plummeted as their speed has increased, wireless computer links remain expensive. **********\"Technologically, it works, but it's expensive and the question is, what will make people pay up?\" said Andrew Kessler, an electronics industry analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company. **********Wireless computers could have many applications. Investment bankers could set up a task force at a takeover target's headquarters and start exchanging financial models within minutes. Department-store cash registers, which are now connected by wire to computers that track sales and inventory, could be moved frequently as new displays are set up. **********The current rat's nest of copper wiring in most buildings presents several problems. Moving a computer that is part of a network to another desk is time-consuming and can, according to Motorola, cost $200 to $3,000, depending on the age of the building. The wires are often severed, jostled loose or simply misconnected, which accounts for more than half of all network failures. Clogged Buildings **********The wiring conduits of some buildings, particularly older ones, have become so stuffed that a company seeking to install more gear must raise the floors, lower the ceilings or move to a new address. Salomon Brothers Inc., for example, is moving out of its headquarters on Water Street in downtown Manhattan in part because the continued installation of more sophisticated equipment would force the investment bank to gut and rebuild several floors. **********The availability of wiring even affects rents on commercial property. \"It can make a difference of anywhere from a couple dollars a square foot to $10 or $20 a square foot,\" said Brendan P. Weiden, an associate partner in electrical engineering at Jaros, Baum & Bolles, a large engineering consultancy in New York. **********American companies spend about $3 billion a year wiring computers together, a fast-growing market that is prompting heavy investment in wireless alternatives. **********\"We've spent a prodigious amount of money on this technology, many, many tens of millions of dollars,\" said Edward F. Staianao, the president of the Motorola division that produces cellular telephones and computers. Three Types of Products **********Although many companies are going into wireless computer communications, the products of Photonics, NCR and Motorola are representative of three broad categories. **********The Photonics device is a fancy version of a television remote control. It involves bouncing infrared light signals off ceilings or walls to relay information to other computers. The advantages are that it seems to be cheap and safe. The problem is that it requires a large, open office, because the signal does not go around corners or through doors. **********The NCR system uses ultrahigh-frequency radio waves and Motorola uses microwaves, both of which can travel through doors, thin walls and people without disruption. **********The NCR system uses a new transmission technology that relies on encoding an ultrahigh-frequency radio signal from each computer with a different code. Much as a person at a dinner party hears many voices but listens to only one, computers on this system can send and receive coded signals over the same broad band of frequencies with each computer decoding only the signal of the computer with which it is communicating. **********This system divides and distributes the signal across many different frequencies, with only a little data on any one frequency at a time. NCR was forced to use this technique because its product uses radio frequencies shared by products that cause interference, like wireless microphones, some walkie-talkies and theft-prevention devices at department-store exits.  Motorola's Approach **********Motorola has taken a different approach. The Federal Communications Commission in April granted the company exclusive rights in all the nation's larger cities to several microwave frequencies. Because interference with other devices is not a problem, Motorola will be able to forgo coded signals and use the better-known technology of several computers each taking turns a few milliseconds long on the same frequency. **********What has prevented electronics companies until now from using products that take turns has been the problem of echoes. Stray signals can bounce off walls and arrive out of turn at a receiver, interfering with the next computer's signal. **********Motorola says it has solved this problem. Instead of broadcasting a signal that covers an entire office, its product uses a hexagonal antenna that sends a tight beam to the intended receiver. \"It's kind of like looking through a telescope at another guy looking at you through a telescope,\" said Alan P. Zabarsky, the general manager of Motorola's unit for wireless computer networks. Concerns Over Health **********Public concerns that high-frequency radio waves and microwaves pose a cancer risk are a drawback, although little energy is used to send signals. \"I don't think there's any hazard at those levels, but try to convince people of that,\" said Richard C. Allen, president of Photonics. **********NCR says its system uses only a tenth of the maximum power allowed by even the world's most stringent health regulations. Motorola says its higher-frequency signal uses only 4 percent of the power of NCR's system because the signal is sent in only one direction. **********\"When I broadcast focused, I broadcast less, because I don't spray it everywhere,\" Mr. Zabarsky said. **********Doing away with the wires that connect computers still leaves the snarls of telephone lines that wiggle through most offices. Motorola is testing tiny wireless telephones using different microwave frequencies from its computer connections, and Mr. Staiano acknowledged that combining these telephones with the wireless computer links was a likely move."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/25/world/salvador-policy-arouses-congress.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1990-01-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 583, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALVADOR POLICY AROUSES CONGRESS", "print_headline": "SALVADOR POLICY AROUSES CONGRESS", "body_text": " **********Conflict over United States policy toward El Salvador flared up today in Congress as a Bush Administration official defended the conduct of the Salvadoran armed forces and resisted efforts to reduce American aid. **********Bernard W.

A playful young mother lies on her back and balances her giggling tot on her ankles and feet, which are clad in plain white canvas sneakers. The caption: ''Keds introduces weightlifting shoes.'' **********Barbara A. Scott, marketing vice president for Keds, says the intended message is ''you don't have to sweat your brains out to wear our shoes.'' **********That no-sweat marketing approach by Keds in its new television and print ads is a deliberate contrast to the frenetic athletes and dancers prancing through the typical sneakers commercial. So far, it has helped Keds capitalize on what many industry analysts say is a fundamental change in consumer preferences for casual footwear. Consumers seem to be moving back toward the mostly simple designs of sneakers that are Keds's staples. The shift is already hurting brands like L.A. Gear, whose sales of expensive shoes in elaborate designs and unusual color combinations have plummeted. **********Except for Nike Inc., the industry leader, most footwear companies have seen sales of their most expensive shoes drop off, while the less expensive, and therefore less profitable, brands continue to sell well. Largely because of this trend, Salomon Brothers estimates that 1990 industry sales, in terms of dollars, will grow 10 percent, compared with nearly 30 percent as recently as 1988. **********There is much uncertainty in this part of the footwear industry. A lot of it stems from the fact that the companies are really more marketers than manufacturers. Many of the major companies get their shoes from the same factories in Taiwan and South Korea. **********''Shoes are all basically the same,'' said David Lubars, whose Leonard Monahan Lubars & Partners advertising agency developed the campaign for Keds. ''What you try to build is an image of what's cool and who wears the shoe.'' **********Owned by the Stride Rite Corporation of Cambridge, Mass., Keds has become the country's fourth-largest brand, overtaking Converse Inc., analysts say. Keds's casual footwear is not really in the same league as the brawny athletic shoes made by Nike and Reebok, or L.A. Gear's fashion sneakers. But analysts note that 80 percent or more of athletic shoes never go near a basketball or tennis court, anyway. Instead they wind up as street shoes worn around the house or out to the mall and movies. **********Until recent months, Keds seemed to be out of favor. Sales had slowed so much that Stride Rite announced last December that it expected revenue to grow by just 10 percent in 1990. Stride Rite's stock plunged on the news, prompting a hostile takeover bid by Walsh Greenwood & Co., the Greenwich, Conn., investment concern, which Stride Rite successfully resisted. **********Sales have rebounded since then and analysts are now projecting Keds's growth rate will top 20 percent, or double that of the industry, to $270 million in sales this year. Once known mainly as a children's brand, Keds have had especially strong appeal since the late 1980's to working mothers and professional women, who often buy several pairs. At about $20, these canvas sneakers cost a third of the average leather-bound Reeboks or Nikes, which average $60 or more. **********Sales are sluggish or declining in much of the $5.3 billion athletic footwear industry, but analysts say Keds could still flourish in an economic recession because of their low price. **********Hardest hit among the major companies has been L.A. Gear, the California-based company whose expensive fashionable shoes appeal mainly to young women. Earlier this summer, L.A. Gear announced a sharp drop in net income for the second quarter. Company officials cited reluctance by recession-conscious retailers to stock expensive footwear and sales volume moving toward cheaper L.A. Gear shoes. L.A. Gear's stock plummeted 22 percent. Recently, the company said the third-quarter net would also be down. **********Nike continues to prosper using a powerful advertising campaign that features the multiathletic talents of Bo Jackson. With projected 1990 sales of more than $1.5 billion, Nike may post sales growth of 30 percent this year, coming on top of a 20 percent rise last year. **********But even Nike's latest results disappointed investors accustomed to runaway growth. When Nike reported last month a first-quarter earnings rise of 31 percent, to $99.7 million, and a 38 percent gain in revenues, to $833.6 million, its stock fell. Nike closed Friday at $30, up $2 a share, in over-the-counter trading. **********Reebok, at No. 2 with $1.3 billion in projected 1990 sales, said recently that it expects a third-quarter drop in profits and a flat year for earnings. Converse, Avia and Adidas are expected to show sales declines, analysts say. Most footwear stocks are trading near their 52-week lows. **********''In the last six months, there has been a dramatic shift from fashion-oriented shoes back to basics,'' said Heidi R. Steinberg, a footwear analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''People don't want a lot of doodads anymore.'' **********Steven B. Frankel, an analyst with Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston, noted that Keds, lacking high profile endorsements by expensive celebrity athletes or rock stars, was in a good marketing position. **********''Keds are not in as fickle a market as L.A. Gear,'' Mr. Frankel said. ''They don't need Michael Jackson. They don't need Bo Jackson. They are getting Mrs. Jackson from 1234 Anywhere Street, U.S.A.'' Reebok, for one, disagrees. Unlike most footwear companies, Reebok has managed to market its athletic shoes well to men and women, and says it is too early to tell if there has been a fundamental change. **********''There's a lot of shifting back and forth going on out there,'' said David C. House, vice president for sales for the Reebok brand. ''Where it stops nobody knows.'' But like other footwear companies, Reebok is seeing an increase in the sales of its less expensive models. **********Keds practically invented the sneaker. Around the turn of the century, shoemakers were gluing melted, or ''vulcanized,'' rubber onto canvas tops. In 1917, the U.S. Rubber company introduced Keds, the first popularly marketed sneaker, so nicknamed because the wearer's footsteps were so quiet. **********The brand was originally named Peds, Latin for foot, but another company already had registered the name. So Keds, with its evocation of kids, was chosen instead. The first Keds had black soles and chestnut brown canvas tops. **********Sneakers changed little until the 70's and early 80's, when nouveau sports like jogging and aerobics gained in popularity. Phil Knight, a runner at the University of Oregon, and his coach, Bill Bowerman, invented Nikes, named after the Greek goddess of victory, because they wanted shoes that were lighter and had better traction than the available tennis and basketball shoes. In the 80's, Reeboks, named after a swift African mammal resembling a gazelle, became popular mainly with women seeking comfortable shoes for aerobic exercises. **********As those changes swept by, Keds's sales started sinking. The company tried to compete with a shoe called Pro-Keds, but sales were lackluster. ''Keds was left in the dust,'' said Ms. Scott, Keds's marketing vice president. **********But the company noticed that its shoes had become fashionable among some young women who wanted simple sneakers. The shoes gained cachet from photos and mentions in fashion magazines showing them as complements to white pants and khaki shorts. They were also popular in places like beach towns in Southern California and the Soho district of Manhattan, possibly because they were inexpensive and were perhaps considered an ''anti-fashion'' fashion statement. **********To expand the shoes' appeal more to young professional women, Keds in 1988 hired a small advertising agency in Providence, R.I., to develop a new approach. **********The agency, Leonard Monahan Lubars, conducted interviews with consumers, known as focus groups, and asked them oddball questions like ''If Keds were a building, what kind of building would it be?'' One frequent answer: A country house with a white picket fence around it. Nike, by contrast, was often described as a glass-and-steel skyscraper. Those reactions ''told us a lot of things,'' said Mr. Lubars, executive vice president and creative director. ''It told us 'anti-athletic' might work.'' With a modest budget, it also meant the company would not need to hire expensive athletic stars to hawk the product. **********Keds and the ad agency also came up with a new slogan: ''Keds. They Feel Good,'' that they hoped would attract young professionals while still evoking kid appeal. The television ads have the lighthearted approach of the print ads. One TV ad shows a couple playfully arguing. The woman throws a Keds shoe at the man. The tag line is, ''Introducing Keds debating shoes.'' **********Keds also expanded the product line. The shoes now come in about 20 styles and more than half a dozen colors. The basic design of a simple canvas top remained, however. **********Since starting its new campaign, or what marketers call repositioning, Keds sales have boomed. Sales to retailers nearly quadrupled, to $227 million in 1989 from $60 million in 1986. Keds also grew from a quarter of Stride Rite's sales in 1986 to half in 1989. **********Following its success with female customers, the next step for Keds is to get more men to buy the shoes, said Ms. Scott. Future ad campaigns will highlight Keds in a more masculine style."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/14/business/the-media-business-sun-times-to-sell-building.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 313, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Sun-Times to Sell Building", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Sun-Times to Sell Building", "body_text": " **********The Chicago Sun-Times Company announced today that it would sell its newspaper building and build a new printing plant to replace its outdated presses. **********The Sun-Times, which in the last five years has suffered a 17 percent decline in its weekday circulation, to 536,000, said that new presses would help the paper compete with The Chicago Tribune, which has a weekday circulation of 720,000. **********The Sun-Times building, which was built in 1957, occupies prime real estate on the banks of the Chicago River, just north of the Loop.

A month later, they assembled again to form a human swastika in front of the East German Parliament. **********German political commentators seem to be at a loss to explain the new phenomenon, although there is general agreement that it represents at least partly a reaction to the years of strict punishments meted out to right-wing radicals under the Communist Government.

It was here, too, in 1948, during the blockade of West Berlin by Communist forces, that Mayor Ernst Reuter appealed to the world, ''You peoples of the world, look upon this city.'' **********The division of Berlin left the building - restored inside but still bullet-scarred on its exterior - abutting the Berlin wall, and generations of Western politicians stood on its eastern balconies to express their indignation. **********Still Bonn For Awhile **********Now, back at the center of what will once again be the capital of Germany, the Reichstag will be the backdrop for the official reuniting of the Germanys and the site of the first sitting of the all-German Parliament on Thursday -though the Parliament will then return to Bonn until a newly elected legislature determines its permanent new home. **********The moment of unity will be preceded at 11:55 P.M. by the ringing of the Liberty Bell at the Schoneberg Town Hall, a copy of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia that was given to West Berlin. **********Then at midnight, seven young athletes each from East and West Germany will raise a 540-square foot flag while the national anthem is played, including the refrain, ''Unity and justice and freedom for the German fatherland, for that let us all aspire.'' **********The flag and the anthem are both those of West Germany, as will be the formal name of the new state - the Federal Republic of Germany - since under the conditions of union, East Germany will accede to West Germany as five new states in the Federal Republic. By the same logic, the West German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, will become Chancellor of all Germany, and the West German President, Richard von Weizsacker, will become the head of state for the entire country. **********The capital will formally return to Berlin, though most ministries and Parliament will continue to work in Bonn at least for a while, and the Government has left it for the parliament that will be elected on Dec. 2 to decide what will move and what will stay. **********Once the flag is raised, the celebrations will really begin, with half an hour of fireworks followed by concerts from 16 separate stages built on both sides of the Brandenburg Gate. Officials lifted a ban on firecrackers for the night. **********Some Leaders Demur **********Mr. Kohl had hoped to have the leaders of the Allied powers, including Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, lead the celebrations, but they signaled their reluctance and the idea was canceled. **********The moment of unity is being preceded and followed by a steady progression of formalities required to conclude 40 years of division of the Germans into two states and two cities. **********In New York today, foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the four World War II victors formally signed documents suspending all Allied powers over Germany, thus restoring full sovereignty to the new Germany. The action was taken because the formal ''two plus four'' treaty will come into effect only after it is ratified by all the powers. **********Berlin, which has technically been maintained under direct Allied control since the war, will be formally set free on Tuesday, when the four military commandants go to the Schoneberg hall and relinquish their responsibilities to Walter Momper, the West Berlin Mayor who at midnight will become the Mayor of all Berlin. **********Kohl Overwhelmingly Elected **********In Hamburg today, the Christian Democratic Union of Mr. Kohl held a congress at which it merged formally with the East German Christian Democrats, following the earlier mergers of the Social Democrats and the Free Democrats. The convention re-elected Mr. Kohl as party leader by 98.5 percent. **********Lothar de Maiziere, the East German Prime Minister, who will become a Minister Without Portfolio in the all-German Government, seemed emotionally shaken during the proceedings. He said that membership in the East German Christian Democrats had been ''the only alternative to the Communist Party if you did not want to withdraw from public life.'' **********At 5 P.M. Tuesday, Mr. de Maiziere will preside over the last session of the East German Parliament, and then over a ''celebration of unity'' at the Schauspielhaus concert hall, at which Kurt Masur will conduct Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. **********For all the scheduled celebrations, the day of unity was not being met with enthusiasm across the West German spectrum. **********The anarchists, with their tendencies to violence, posed a direct threat. But many other groups planned peaceful demonstrations to counter the official jubilation. **********A 'Day of Meanness' **********To most Germans, the demonstrations were part of the inevitable price of holding major events in Berlin. West Berlin has always been celebrated for its vibrant counterculture, and its people have rarely resisted a chance to march and demonstrate. **********The most original was scheduled by an organization calling itself the Bureau for Unusual Events. Organizers declared Unity Day ''The Day of German Meanness'' and scheduled a demonstration at which they would proclaim an ''Autonomous Republic of Utopia.'' Following West Germany's model, they intended to offer Germany the right to accede. **********In East Germany, union remains a matter of some bitterness for the Communist Party, reformed and restyled the Party of Democratic Socialism, and for the citizens' movements that sprang up around the Protestant churches a year ago. **********The Party of Democratic Socialism had planned a rally titled ''Adieu G.D.R.,'' but canceled it after the police said they could not guarantee security. The New Forum and various citizens' movements announced that they would hold a requiem on Wednesday at the Gethsemane Church, one of the major centers of the popular revolution a year ago. Some Protestant churches in East Berlin declined a request to ring their bells on unity day. **********Diplomats and Generals Involved **********Unity will also mean the uniting of all the Western diplomatic missions in East and West. The United States Ambassador to East Germany, Richard Barkley, will formally cede his post at midnight Tuesday, and Vernon A. Walters, the Ambassador to Bonn, will become Ambassador to all Germany. The embassy, however, will remain in Bonn for now, with the East Berlin mission as a branch. **********Though the Allied commanders will formally cede their responsibility for the city, reduced contingents of American, French and British troops will remain in West Berlin as long as Soviet troops remain in East Germany. The arrangement was reached after Bonn signed an agreement with Moscow agreeing to let the Soviets withdraw their forces over three to four years. **********At unity, the armies of East and West Germany will merge, temporarily forming a formidable force of 530,000 - 430,000 from the west and 100,000 from the east.

And some evidence that supposedly was burned has been found. **********The disclosures have led even some critics to begin praising Judge Zamora for making an innovative effort to investigate the killing of the Jesuits, who advocated a negotiated settlement to the civil war. **********The killing of the priests, their housekeeper and her daughter on Nov. 16 on the campus of the Jose Simeon Canas University of Central America came as leftist guerrillas were mounting an offensive in their war against the United States-backed Government. **********There has been little real progress in the case since January, when President Cristiani announced the arrest of a colonel, the highest ranking officer ever charged with an abuse of human rights here, three lieutenants and four privates. **********Resignation Demanded **********The acknowledgments by President Cristiani and Colonel Ponce prompted speculation that they cooperated with the attempted cover-up and may have authorized the operation that ended with the killing of the priests. Rebel leaders apparently came to that conclusion and in an effort to score propaganda points took time out from peace talks last week to demand the President's resignation. **********Judge Zamora's request that the two United States officials testify is part of his continuing investigation of the attempted cover-up. For more than a month after the killings, some United States and Salvadoran officials asserted that the guerrillas had killed the priests to discredit the Government and the army, which has long been linked to death squads by international human rights monitors. **********Both the Salvadoran and United States Government have asserted that they did not learn of the military's responsibility for the killings until the beginning of January, six weeks after the slayings. But the investigation has found that some senior Salvadoran commanders knew of the army's involvement earlier. **********At least one United States official stationed here, Maj. Eric Buckland, was informed of the army's involvement by mid-December, the investigation has found. But he reportedly waited two weeks before informing his superior, Col. Milton Menjivar, commander of the United States military group, who provided the information to the Salvadoran high command. **********Judge Zamora is seeking to have Major Buckland and Colonel Menjivar testify about how they obtained their information and the delay in relaying it. Some American officials fear that waiving diplomatic immunity and allowing the officers to testify would set a precedent that could come to haunt American diplomats around the world. But officials here argue that the United States may be blamed if it declines to allow them to testify and the case collapses. **********State Department and Pentagon officials said the request, which is winding its way through the judiciary and the Foreign Ministry, would be considered once it is officially presented. ''We want this case resolved,'' a State Department official said. ''We want to cooperate.'' **********Pressure on U.S. Likely **********The United States is likely to come under intense political pressure here and in Washington to waive the officers' immunity and allow them to testify. A refusal would undoubtably lead to new criticism from Jesuits and Western diplomats, many of whom already have questioned the American commitment to unraveling the conspiracy behind the Jesuits' killing. **********But some judicial officials said a defense motion to transfer the case to another jurisdiction is likely to stall the investigation before the United States is forced to make a decision on waiving immunity. Judge Zamora denied an almost identical motion earlier this year and is presumed likely to reject the new petition. **********But the new motion comes under another section of the criminal code. Unlike the previous decision, the defense can appeal the judge's ruling on the new petition. Judicial officials said they thought an appeal could delay the prosecution almost indefinitely and lead to the collapse of the case."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/15/business/airlines-give-break-to-business.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1990-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 825, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airlines Give Break To Business", "print_headline": "Airlines Give Break To Business", "body_text": " **********A year after announcing tighter restrictions on many discount fares used by business travelers with an eye toward increasing revenue, the nation's airlines have been quietly giving large companies a break. **********They are waiving restrictions on discount fares for travel agencies with big corporate clients, industry experts say, and providing their biggest customers with opportunities not afforded the individual traveler. **********Coming at a time when the airline industry is facing higher costs because of a big jump in the price of fuel and the rising need for capital to pay for new planes, the practice of waiving restrictions has already had an impact on airline profits, some experts say. **********Protecting Market Share **********Yet the airlines feel they need to offer the breaks to protect their share of the large market of business travelers. The breaks, offered only to their biggest customers, also serve to tie travel agencies more closely to certain airlines. **********The behind-the-scenes waivers stand in sharp contrast to the industry trend of tightening restrictions and increasing cancellation penalties on discount fares. For example, the lowest discount fare now carries a cancellation penalty of 100 percent. Several years ago the cancellation penalty was only 25 percent. **********The waiving of requirements like ticket purchases seven days in advance and weekend stays for travelers can produce huge savings for companies, said executives of large travel agencies and some airlines. These executives, who were reluctant to discuss the subject, spoke on the condition that they not be identified and refused to disclose specific arrangements. **********Various Arrangements **********The practice is far less widely known but apparently far more common than arrangements in which large companies negotiate special fares directly with carriers for employees on heavily traveled routes. Discounts for companies are usually limited to certain routes that employees fly frequently; industry experts said the waivers of fare restrictions represent much more of an erosion in airlines' fare structures than the corporate discounts. **********The executives noted that in most cases the travel agencies go to airlines that either dominate their areas or are seeking to break into new markets, and that the resulting arrangements are confidential and informal. While the agencies, whose commission is based on the fare, make less money a ticket, they expect to come out ahead because of the increased volume that comes with keeping large customers. **********Few Pay Full Fare **********The waivers help explain why there has been no significant change in the number of people who travel on a discount fare despite the recent tightening of restrictions. **********''The published fare today has become almost insignificant,'' said Julius Maldutis, the airline analyst for Salomon Brothers. ''Very few people pay the full fare.'' **********The president of a large travel agency on the West Coast said the average cost of air travel for business customers had risen 31 percent, to $463, from the time before airlines tightened restrictions on their fares late in 1988 until the beginning of 1989. But since then, it has dropped to $439, even though full coach fares have increased. **********Reasons for Lower Averages **********He attributed the drop partly to the practice of waiving restrictions and partly to the special fares that corporations have been able to negotiate with airlines on the routes heavily used by their employees. **********The savings for customers can be huge. The regular coach fare between New York and Chicago, for example, is $680 round trip, while the fare requiring purchase seven days in advance and a Saturday-night stay is $348 round trip. **********The regular coach fare between Dallas and New York is $936 round trip, while the corresponding discount fare is $438. **********Because business travelers must often travel on short notice and do not want to stay for a weekend, they frequently do not qualify for a discount fare with such restrictions. **********Most Fliers Get Discounts **********Mr. Maldutis found that about the same percentage of people, 90.5 percent, traveled on a discount fare in 1989 as did in 1988, 91 percent. Mr. Maldutis also found that the average discount went up to 66.5 percent of the full-coach fare from 63.2 percent. He attributed these results largely to the waiving of restrictions. **********But now, in addition to the waivers, the three-day advance-purchase fare has crept back into some markets. **********The recent waivers have further divided the travel agency industry between big companies with enough influence to secure special deals from airlines and smaller agencies that can no longer compete for business travelers because they cannot get similar breaks. **********''It's highly selective on what kind of travel agencies will get the waivers,'' the head of a large East Coast travel agency said. ''Higher-volume agencies like ourselves are able to get the preferred arrangements.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/14/business/government-shift-on-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 239, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Government Shift on Data", "print_headline": "Government Shift on Data", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department intends to abandon its computerized model of the economy, one of very few in the Government, and the monthly publication associated with it called Business Cycle Developments. **********Allan H.

Manufacturers and their suppliers are hoping that the North American market for air bags will grow fivefold or sixfold by 1995, when virtually all passenger cars sold in the United States will be equipped with the safety devices to meet Federal requirements. **********The trend in favor of air bags accelerated last week when the General Motors Corporation said it would install air bags on the driver's side of all its American-built cars by the fall of 1995. **********Even before G.M. threw its full support behind air bags, National-Standard and other suppliers of air bag components were scrambling to meet the growing demand. National-Standard estimates that it will need more than 100 special high-speed looms to weave enough wire cloth by 1995. The company will not disclose how many looms it now operates, but a spokesman said the joint venture would add a significant number of new machines, at a cost of about $250,000 each. **********Indeed, analysts say National-Standard's ailing balance sheet forced the company to find an equity partner willing to invest in new equipment or risk falling behind as air bag demand takes off. The company suffered operating losses in four of the last five years, and reported large net losses in 1987 and 1989. Long-term debt doubled from 1986 to 1989, reaching $45.9 million last year. And in the current year the company has lost money in each of the last three quarters. National-Standard cut its dividend by half in 1987, and stopped paying any dividends the next year. **********The financial damage was caused by a contraction in the company's primary business - supplying wire cord for tires - which shifted to overseas producers where labor and energy costs were lower during the 1980's. **********With the air bag business growing rapidly, National-Standard struggled to shift gears. Company officials say they expect sales of wire cloth to air bag manufacturers to grow from a small percentage to a quarter of revenues in three years. But the investment required was steep, and National-Standard did not have the wherewithal to handle it alone. ''We looked at the projections for growth in air bags, and we could not see ourselves adding all of that capacity on our own,'' said Jerry W. Ridener, the company's marketing manager for wire cloth and filters. **********Enter Toyota Tsusho. The Japanese steel and machinery manufacturer began supplying stainless steel wire cloth to National-Standard last year, when the American wire maker discovered that it could not meet all of its orders for the cloth. National-Standard says it worked with the Japanese company to develop wire cloth that would capture certain gases in the air bag propellant while allowing nitrogen to pass through and inflate the air bag. **********The Japanese company has deep pockets, also. Toyota Tsusho is affiliated with the Toyota Motor Corporation, and supplies much of the steel used by the Japanese car maker. Toyota Tsusho enlarged its presence in the United States in the mid-1980's when it opened a steel distribution center in Georgetown, Ky., to supply sheet metal to Toyota's only wholly owned American car factory. **********Neither partner in the joint venture will say how much it is investing in the plant, and a location has not yet been selected. But the Japanese say the commercial prospects for the new plant are good. **********''The wire cloth business is growing and we expect it to grow further, because of the interest in air bags,'' said Hiro Igarshi, senior consultant with Toyota Tsusho and manager of the new plant. **********Analysts and industry experts say demand for the wire mesh will surge as more air bags are added to the passenger sides of cars. At present, passenger-side air bags are in all Porsche models, the more expensive Mercedes cars and certain of Ford's Lincoln Continental and Town Cars. While each driver's-side air bag requires about five ounces of wire cloth, the passenger side bags are larger and use about two pounds of the cloth. **********''That's the real point of the deal,'' Mr. Ridener said. ''While there is enough manufacturing capacity in place to supply wire cloth for all the driver-side air bags, there isn't nearly enough to handle'' the passenger side."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/08/world/campaign-for-early-german-vote-stalls.html": {"writer_name": "David Binder", "pub_date": "1990-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 693, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Campaign for Early German Vote Stalls", "print_headline": "Campaign for Early German Vote Stalls", "body_text": " **********The campaign by the conservative Government leaders of Bonn and East Berlin to push forward the unification of Germany by seven weeks collapsed today. **********The collapse resulted from an impasse between Bonn's governing coalition and the opposition over how and when to proceed to bring West and East Germany together, ending 45 years of national division. **********The proposal, made four days ago in a surprise move by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, both Christian Democrats, was rebuffed by the leadership of the West German Social Democrats, the main opposition group in the Federal Parliament.

Many Arabs reacted much as the people of Latin America have so often in the past: they bristled at United States interference in the region, no matter what the cause. **********As it is, many Palestinians and other Arabs feel deep resentment toward the United States. They believe American support in this region is tilted heavily toward Israel. **********Many Palestinians resent the oil-wealthy Arab nations, too, because they believe that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the other countries that have found oil beneath the sand should have shared more of the wealth with their poorer Arab brothers. **********Swelling Resentments **********In the last week, the force of these resentments burst forth and seemed to swell with every new report that more American forces had arrived. **********Suddenly in the Palestinian popular mind, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the emirates - all them for years the world's largest financial contributors to the Palestine Liberation Organization - became nothing more than American dupes, puppet regimes, their leaders mere quislings. **********''What these other Arab leaders are doing is selling cheap oil to America so the Americans can improve their economy and use it to support our enemy, Israel,'' fumed 52-year-old Fakhri Takatka, who runs a family-owned stone quarry on the edge of town. ''It was wrong for King Fahd to call foreign troops onto Arab land.'' **********President Hussein, who sold the United States as much oil as it would buy, until the boycott last week, has been transformed in the popular mind so that now he is the modern-day Saladin, the Byzantine-era Muslim warrior who drove out the crusaders. **********''This is an Arab problem; America has no right to be here,'' said Achmed Dakatka, a science teacher.

Today, farmers and others on Israel's northern border with Jordan reported that Israel was moving tanks and artillery to the area, to be ready if Iraq decided to attack. **********Many Palestinians have seen newscasts on Jordanian television, widely watched in the West Bank, showing the Iraqi leader bending down to embrace Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, who has often visited Baghdad. **********Last night, most homes tuned in television and radio reports of President Hussein's speech to the Arab people in which he played on themes that could not but help rouse passions. **********''Oh, Arabs, Oh, Muslims and believers everywhere,'' the Iraqi leader said, ''this is your day to rise and defend Mecca, which is captured by the spears of the Americans and the Zionists. Revolt against oppression, corruption, treachery and backstabbing. Keep the foreigner away from your holy shrines.'' **********Defense of the Muslim Shrines **********Mecca, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, is at least 600 miles away from the nearest concentration of foreign troops. But here in Beit Fajar, some Palestinians were ready to go fight for the defense of the Muslim world's holiest shrines. **********''From the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque and in the name of the Islamic world and Islamic law,'' the Mufti of Jerusalem, Saed Addin Al-Alami, wrote in a public letter to President Hussein today, ''we appeal to you to abolish the filth of the American Army and their collaborators from the holy lands, to purify these lands and to rescue the two holy mosques from the Americans and the pagans.'' **********Here in Beit Fajar, 35-year-old Youssef Takatka nodded his head as he said: ''Saddam is right to ask us to help him liberate the holy places from foreign forces. Maybe it's not good to have the whole world against the Arabs, but Saddam is the only one fighting for the Palestinians.'' **********Many Palestinians also feel that it is only a matter of time until Saddam Hussein comes to their aid. **********''In the long run, he will come back for us,'' said Jack Y. Khazmo, who edits a weekly publication, The Magazine of the Palestinian Masses. ''If Saddam succeeds in getting the oil weapon, he will show the world there is another power, an Arab power, and he will use the weapon for us'' **********But standing against the back wall in Hassan Amin's general store this afternoon, 60-year-old Musa Mohammed Hussein, the only man dressed in traditional Arab headdress and full-length shirt, had a different view. **********''The prophet Mohammed said people should share three things: fire, water and grass,'' he said. ''It's true that the Kuwaiti Emir should have shared more. **********''But Saddam is not Saladin,'' he went on. ''We are like a people drowning, trying to grab any straw.

But after a yearlong search, SportsChannel America, a cable station seen in about 11 million homes nationwide, has found its first sponsor: Gatorade, the sports drink. **********The Quaker Oats Company, which makes Gatorade, is reportedly paying $600,000 annually for sponsorship rights to 25 Friday-night high school sports events a year, mainly basketball and football. **********SportsChannel, co-owned by NBC and the Cablevision Systems Corporation, agreed in March 1989 to pay a reported $250,000 annually to the National Federation of State High School Associations for five-year broadcast rights to selected games. The federation represents about 90 percent of the country's public, private and parochial schools. **********When SportsChannel struck its deal, executives at the Woodbury, L.I., cable network envisioned signing up four national sponsors quickly. But that did not happen. **********''There was a lot of criticism in the press,'' said Peter T. Knobloch, SportsChannel's senior vice president for national sales. **********''They thought we were commercializing high school athletics,'' he said. ''That hurt us initially. But the fact that we have the first sponsor is going to generate more interest.'' **********High school sports are a mania in many parts of the country, illustrated by the large crowds and local and regional television and radio coverage attracted to events like Texas football, Indiana basketball and Minnesota hockey. But not until the SportsChannel deal were there any regularly scheduled national broadcasts. **********SportsChannel America figured advertisers would jump at the chance to become involved because high school students are a target market for many consumer products companies. **********No ratings of the broadcasts are available because SportsChannel is not seen in enough homes, but the network estimates that its broadcasts are seen in as many as 200,000 to 300,000 homes. **********The federation and SportsChannel contend that the broadcasts are a good idea because they try to focus attention on the benefits of many extracurricular activities, ranging from band to cheerleading, not just high-profile athletics. **********Anti-drug and other promotional messages were created for the games, and announcers add facts like grade-point averages to their discussions of athletes. No advertising was accepted from beer companies. And rather than pitting far-flung schools against one another in pseudo-championship games, the broadcasts are limited to regularly scheduled contests from different parts of the country, like local rivals in Louisville, Ky., and western Texas. **********The money generated from the games is minuscule compared with that on the college level. The federation uses the money it receives to cover expenses, give participating schools $1,200 and to finance drug and alcohol education projects and other programs, said Warren S. Brown, the federation's assistant executive director. **********Yet despite the federation's careful treading, there remains strong sentiment that national commercial television will corrupt high school sports. **********''I don't care how they try to justify it, I think it's bad,'' said H. G. Bissinger, the author of ''Friday Night Lights,'' a book that looks critically at the phenomenon of Texas high school football. ''There is enough pressure on the kids already. In some places they already get 20,000 people a game.

He added, ''Certain points of the documents are worth discussing in fuller detail in order to be able to reach an overall solution to the Cambodia problem.'' **********The peace plan, first made public earlier this week, was drawn up over eight months by the five permanent members of the Security Council: the United States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.

When the plant spilled about 200 tons of arsenic in 1988, contaminating farmland and killing cattle and sheep, the disaster was covered up for nine months. **********Deformities and Cancer **********At the local hospital, doctors speak of a frightening rise in the number of babies born with deformities, of cancer and chronic mouth and lung disease. They say infant mortality here is almost three times the norm for Bulgaria and they cite an abnormal number of people with high blood pressure and dental problems among the town's 35,000 inhabitants. **********''When I started here in 1976, there was no cancer,'' said Dr. Nikolai Ivanov, a hospital surgeon. ''Last year we had at least 45 cases.'' **********But local officials have repeatedly assured workers that tests show nothing abnormal in their blood or in the environment. Doctors complaining to the plant management were promptly denounced as troublemakers by local Communist Party bosses. **********In other parts of polluted Eastern Europe the authorities have started to make an inventory of the disastrous legacy of unrestrained industrial growth and is asking for help in the West. But in Bulgaria the subject is still treated as a state secret. **********Hiding of Medical Reports **********Environmentalists, who include doctors and engineers, say that even in today's more politically lenient climate they are harassed, followed or intimidated. Several physicians said that medical reports in state-run factories are routinely hidden or falsified. **********The arsenic, lead and copper in the dust of Srednogorie - at least 70 times the permissible level, according to a secret Government document - is said to make this town one of Bulgaria's most dangerous. But at least 10 other cities are struggling with their own serious pollution problems. **********Sofia, the capital, once praised for its clear mountain air, lies trapped in frequent haze oozing from two giant steel plants at Pernik and Kremikovtsi. The latter alone reportedly dumps 20,000 tons of grime a year on Sofia's center, eight miles away, and siphons off one-third of the capital's water. **********In the northern city of Ruse, a chemical plant just across the border in Romania often makes breathing difficult. But when a ''Defend Ruse'' committee was formed, some of its members were run out of the Communist Party and others lost their jobs. Industries have poisoned the bays of Burgas and Varna, on the Black Sea. **********A Gradual Poisoning **********The gradual poisoning of Bulgaria matches the enormous pollution and environmental disaster now being recognized throughout Eastern Europe. Its fate was perhaps less predestined, though, because Stalin originally assigned Bulgaria, with its fertile soils and moderate climate, to be the East bloc's garden, to provide grains, fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. **********But that agricultural vocation began to change in the 1950's as heavy industries came in. Last year, Bulgaria, which once exported two-thirds of its farm produce, was forced to import food. A Communist Party report says that almost 60 percent of land is now ''damaged'' by excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides and industrial fallout. **********The steel and chemical industries are also increasingly having trouble finding workers. To attract laborers to the steelworks at Krimikovci, the Government has promised to exempt young men from military service if they will work there five years. **********From the outside, Srednogorie's copper plant, which employs 1,500 people, looks grimy enough, with its bulky slag heaps and its chimney spewing yellow smoke. Inside, it seems more like a battlefield. The grounds are strewn with rusting metal and discarded machinery. An old sulfur plant has disintegrated into a forest of blistered pipes and tanks. Some workers in a great hall with cauldrons and smelters wore gas masks. Others did not bother to protect themselves. **********Dangerous Toxic Clouds **********Twice last year, when controls failed, the plant emitted such dangerous toxic clouds that it had to close down and the children of Srednogorie were evacuated to other towns, said Deltcho Vichev, an engineer of the Ministry of Metallurgy and a plant consultant. **********But the worst incident came in December 1988, when workers discovered cracks in the retaining walls of a vast reservoir, the dumping ground for the plant's toxic waste. Its mud contains high concentrations of arsenic, lead and other discards left after copper, silver and gold have been taken from the ore. **********''The Government decided secretly to let water out of the reservoir to diminish the pressure on the walls,'' said one expert familiar with the incident. The highly poisonous sludge was spilled into the Pirdopska River, which feeds the Topolnika River, which is used to irrigate some of Bulgaria's best agricultural land. **********According to an unpublished Government study, 200 tons of arsenic was released and some lands irrigated with river water had concentrations of arsenic at 4,000 times the permissible level. Near the village of Poibrene, farmers told researchers that their sheep were aborting and cows ''were going mad'' and dying. **********Government 'Said Nothing' **********''The Government knew everything but said nothing,'' said the expert, himself a Government employee. ''The whole summer they let people go swimming and fishing in that river.'' **********Nine months after the spill, after continuous pressure from experts and from Eco-Glasnost, the Bulgarian environmental movement, the authorities imposed a five-year ban on fishing, swimming or using irrigation water from the Topolnika. But they have not warned people against eating produce from the area. Experts say at least 150,000 acres of badly contaminated land should be banned for agriculture. **********The arsenic in the soil around Srednogorie and on the fields downstream is likely to remain there. ''It does not decompose,'' said Mr. Vichev, who joined Eco-Glasnost because ''those of us who understand the seriousness of pollution must speak out.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/16/world/140-blacks-slain-in-south-africa-as-factions-clash.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1990-08-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 842, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "140 BLACKS SLAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA AS FACTIONS CLASH", "print_headline": "140 BLACKS SLAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA AS FACTIONS CLASH", "body_text": " **********After three days of increasing factional bloodletting that spilled across black townships east of Johannesburg, the police reported tonight that at least 140 blacks had been shot, stabbed, beaten or burned to death. **********The violence surpassed in its ferocity anything witnessed in the anti-apartheid protests of the mid-1980's and seemed to suggest that the virtual civil war that has taken thousands of lives in Natal Province over the last three years is taking root in the industrial heartland of the Transvaal. **********The number of people wounded in the clashes was over 100, a police spokesman said. **********As in the fighting in Natal, the precise causes of the upsurge in violence as well as the motives and profiles of those taking part differ from township to township.

''I would rather they burned my shack than burned me and my clothes,'' one woman said. **********As passions deepened, toward late afternoon, a crowd of people in Thokoza ran down a single, unidentified man, poured gasoline over him and set him alight on the ground, apparently because he was thought to be a member of the Zulu tribe, South Africa's biggest, numbering at least six million. **********South African Army units were ordered to reinforce the already strengthened police units, which according to reporters in the townships today opened fire on township residents with shotguns and tear-gas at close range. **********African National Congress officials accused the police of siding with Inkatha, a charge the police denied.

More ominously, in the single men's hostel police officers uncovered a cache of Soviet-made assault rifles, pistols and hand grenades, a police spokesman said. It was not immediately clear which faction had hidden them there. **********''There can be no winners, only losers and untold misery when opposing parties fight each other as is happening on the East Rand,'' Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a statement. **********Conversations with combatants, hostel residents, squatters and political leaders left the impression that the fighting had built spontaneously from a single incident Sunday when a Xhosa man was killed in the hostel here. Afterward, attack and counterattack fed on rumor and vengeance inspired by tribal, political and social rivalries. **********The killings brought to around 200 the number of deaths in a week that has seen major outbursts of violence in Port Elizabeth, Sebokeng township south of Johannesburg, and three townships on the East Rand - Thokoza, Katlehong and Vosloorus, all close to one another about 20 miles southeast of Johannesburg. **********The violence is not related to the so-called armed struggle by the African National Congress, whose suspension Mr. Mandela ordered last week, Rather, combatants and residents said today, it seems part of a broadening sense of rivalry between the congress and Inkatha that has confronted many people with political choices that draw heavily on tribal identities.

They allow users to transmit documents electronically over telephone lines to anywhere in the United States, and charge from $1 to $10 a minute for the service. **********The largest company in the field is Hotelecopy Inc., which has a contract to install 263 credit-card-operated machines in local post offices, including several already in service in Manhattan. Hotelecopy owns its equipment, but most companies in the industry are franchisers that sell the machines and a territory to would-be entrepreneurs. **********Hearing Next Month **********A Federal marshal served a temporary restraining order Monday on one of the largest of these franchisers, the Fax Corporation of America, which is based in Little Falls, N.J., and on its chairman, Seymour L. Butan, Ms. Harrington said. Issued by a Federal judge in Newark at the F.T.C.'s request, the order froze Mr. Butan's and the company's assets pending a hearing next month at which the commission will seek restitution for 500 franchisees who paid $29 million for territories and equipment, she said. **********Mr. Butan, who is 59 years old, did not return numerous telephone calls seeking comment. **********In December 1979, Mr. Butan announced that he had assembled $40 million in cash and a $20 million line of credit from a consortium of European banks for the purchase of Helena Rubinstein, a beleaguered cosmetics division of the Colgate-Palmolive Company. But the European consortium denied having authorized any funds and, in May 1981 Mr. Butan was sentenced by a New Jersey state court to 10 years in prison and fined $46,000 on 18 counts of fraud unrelated to the Rubinstein bid.

Consider the case of the Formica Corporation, whose name is to laminated plastic countertops what Xerox is to copiers and Polaroid to instant photography. **********Formica enters the 1990's proudly describing itself as the world's largest producer of consumer laminates, which are layers of paper mixed with plastic resin and bonded under pressure and heat. The 77-year-old company brought in revenues of $410 million last year, selling products ranging from chairs to wall paneling. **********But the sadder truth is that Formica is the No. 2 company in its market in the United States, fighting to regain its historic lead after having been outhustled and outsmarted through most of the 1970's and early 80's by Ralph Wilson Plastics, a Temple, Tex., subsidiary of Premark International Inc. **********Wilson is hardly a household name among homeowners, who still call all plastic laminates ''formica,'' but contractors and architects know it well. Its Wilsonart products now command about 45 percent of the American market, compared with 32 percent for Formica, which generates less than half its sales domestically. **********''When I got into it 27 years ago, Formica was the supplier and everyone else was an also-ran,'' said Dale LaRose, a vice president for the Pioneer Plastics Corporation of Auburn, Me., a smaller competitor. ''But the one word that came up in the marketplace for them was arrogance. Wilson recognized that service would become more important.'' **********In fact, the Wilson-Formica case was used in a recent book, ''Competing Against Time,'' as an example of how nimble companies focus on speed to gain strategic advantages. The authors, George Stalk Jr. and Thomas M. Hout, concluded that Wilson now ''owns the market'' and labeled Formica an ''also-ran.'' **********When Vincent L. Langone, Formica's chief executive, heard the assessment, he was furious. In his view, Formica should have been credited with recognizing the opportunities in overseas investment, where its operating returns amount to 20 percent, nearly double the domestic margins. He also argues that Formica remains the industry's design leader and a technology leader, citing its early introduction of a European method of pressing laminates with a textured steel plate to produce a matte finish without the use of specialty papers. **********What makes him angriest, though, is the book's implication that it is describing the current state of competition in the industry. ''We can get any non-standard product to customers in less than two weeks,'' he said. ''It was an accurate description of the 1970's.'' **********In any case, Formica is still struggling to overcome that legacy. With a continuous stream of new products and financial support for dealers, which is helping them price products more competitively, Formica has managed to stop the market-share erosion. The company also estimates that Wilson's operating income as a percentage of sales has declined from more than 16 percent in 1985 to about 10 percent last year while Formica's has risen to more than 11 percent from more than 8 percent in the same period. **********That comparison is disputed by Bobby D. Dillon, Wilson's president. Premark does not release separate performance figures for Wilson, but Mr. Dillon said his company's income as a percentage of sales was significantly higher than Formica estimates. **********An important feature of Wilson's strategy against Formica is a network of 15 regional warehouses that provide one-day delivery of its products to distributors. In addition, the company designed its products to use a simplified, albeit more expensive, group of resins that allowed it to quickly make any items the distributors did not have in stock. **********That meant Wilson could provide almost any product within 10 days, compared with as much as 25 days for Formica and other competitors, according to a study made by the Boston Consulting Group for the Pioneer company five years ago. That allowed dealers to keep less inventory, a cost saving often shared with customers. The consultants' study was used in ''Competing Against Time.'' There is scant evidence that Formica is about to regain market share from Wilson, and Mr. Langone is dismayed to have to fight the battle on Wilson's terms. **********''We have to be able to match Wilson's speed,'' he conceded. ''I'm not sure the market really needs it since you can get most products from a dealer's stock right away, but we have to be able to say we can do it.'' Still worse, from Formica's perspective, its three attempts to raise domestic prices in the last five years have failed when Wilson and smaller competitors decided not to follow. **********Formica needs the cash to pay down heavy debts piled up when management and an investor group took the company private last summer in a deal that valued the company at $365 million. Formica needs $40 million annually just to meet interest payments; $50 million when including the interest liability that has been deferred for five years as part of the buyout financing, said David Schneider, Formica's chief financial officer. The company had a net loss of $5.1 million on sales of just more than $100 million in the first three months of 1990, a quarter in which it paid $12.6 million in interest. **********The buyout was the latest in an accelerating series of ownership changes at Formica, which is based in Wayne, N.J. Founded in 1913 by two Cincinnati men who invented the laminate to replace the brittle mineral mica as an insulator, Formica caught the attention of avant-garde designers in the 1930's. They used it to add modern touches to furnishings in ocean liners, Art Deco furniture and landmark buildings like the Library of Congress and Radio City Music Hall. But it took the building boom after World War II to make Formica an icon of middle-class culture and a high-flier on Wall Street. **********The 50's boom in laminates encouraged Formica's major plastic resin supplier, the American Cyanamid Company, to buy Formica in 1956. Once it became part of the multinational chemical and pharmaceuticals company, Formica's pulse gradually slowed, just as competition was heating up. **********''There's no question that Formica had its head in the sand for years,'' said Andy MacLachlan, president of Winde Distributors Inc., who has been a distributor of Formica products in Woburn, Mass., since 1950. **********''Cyanamid didn't invest as much capital as entrepreneurs would, and they began to rely on the strength of the brand name at a time when all the competitors were saying, 'That's the guy to get,' '' said Mr. Langone, who joined Cyanamid in 1967 and became Formica's marketing director in 1981. Mr. Langone stayed with the company as president and chief operating officer when Cyanamid sold Formica to managers and an investment group in a 1985 leveraged buyout valued at $200 million. Cyanamid executives will not comment on Formica's decline during the years Cyanamid owned it. **********Formica went public two years later, but by 1988 found itself fending off approaches from investment groups led by Malcolm Glazer and then Samuel Zell. That led to the board's decision to sell the company again, and eventually to last year's management buyout. **********''To say I haven't been distracted from time to time wouldn't be true,'' said Mr. Langone, who became chief executive in 1988. **********The distractions notwithstanding, Formica distributors say the company has made great strides in beefing up service and support. ''We have been able to get things much faster in the past six to eight months,'' said Mr. MacLachlan, who now thinks he is on a more competitive footing. **********In addition, Formica is pushing premium-priced products that look more solid, like its eight-year-old Colorcore line, and Surell, a new material that can be made to resemble stone and is intended to compete with Du Pont's highly successful Coriann line as a material in sinks and tubs. Coriann and its competitors cost 10 times as much as traditional laminates at wholesale. **********''Du Pont has 90 percent of the market in this country so we are shooting for second place here, but we think we have the distribution to beat Coriann overseas,'' said Mr. Langone, happy to talk about the possibility of knocking someone else off a mountain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/28/business/wall-street-it-looks-like-a-cd-but-wait.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 996, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "It Looks Like a C.D., but Wait ...", "print_headline": "WALL STREET; It Looks Like a C.D., but Wait ...", "body_text": " **********WHAT'S in a name? Considerably less than is in a prospectus -- as one can discover by looking closely at the chameleon-like investment products being advertised across the country these days by Welco Securities, a tiny brokerage house in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. **********The products, which offer eye-grabbing yields, are called \"demand certificates\" and \"fixed-rate certificates,\" terms that evoke the popular certificates of deposit, or C.D.'s, offered by banks. On first glance, the sales material from Welco reinforces that impression with its emphasis on high yields and references to \"penalties for early redemption.\" But look again: These certificates are not being offered by a federally insured bank, but by a company called the Equipment Leasing Corporation of America, also of Bala Cynwyd. **********Ah, the more knowledgeable investor might say, these must be equipment-leasing certificates, which are typically secured by some specific piece of hardware purchased with the investors' money and then leased out to someone else at a profit. But these are not equipment-leasing certificates either, and they are not backed by any collateral. **********They are, in fact, nothing more than the unsecured i.o.u.'s of Equipment Leasing -- a company revealed by its prospectus to be facing a daunting array of financial problems and potential conflicts of interest. **********One might get a different impression of the company from the sales material from Welco, which says Equipment Leasing will use investors' money to buy equipment and lease it to \"credit-worthy business firms nationwide.\" But in faint microscopic print at the bottom of that sales brochure, investors are advised to read the prospectus carefully before investing. And those who do may get a far less comforting picture of the company standing behind these \"certificates.\" **********Equipment Leasing is the slim subsidiary of a feeble outfit called the Walnut Leasing Company, owned by William Shapiro, a lawyer and accountant who settled a few minor squabbles with state securities regulators in Pennsylvania in the late 70's and in New York in the mid-80's. Walnut's own equipment-leasing business started to sour in 1983, and for the past two years, auditors have been warning that Walnut's chronic losses and reliance on borrowed funds raise \"substantial doubts regarding its ability to continue as a going concern,\" the Equipment Leasing prospectus reports. **********Walnut, too, has been selling unsecured notes to the public, calling them \"thrift certificates.\" About $6 million of its $15.5 million in outstanding notes fall due in the current fiscal year and the company, as noted, is short of cash. So Walnut is selling a new $40 million issue of \"senior thrift certificates,\" and may use some of the proceeds to pay off its earlier notes. Walnut warns investors, however, that if its losses continue, it may not be able to repay the notes when they mature. **********In 1986, Walnut set up Equipment Leasing and transferred some of its stronger leases to the new subsidiary. Then Equipment Leasing started borrowing money from the public, selling about $7 million worth of unsecured notes that went by the name of \"money market thrift certificates.\" **********Kenneth S. Shapiro, an officer of both Welco and Equipment Leasing and the son of William Shapiro, refused to field any questions about the companies or the issues. \"We have a policy that we don't give any interviews to any members of the press, and if you quote us, we will take action,\" he said. \"It's all in the prospectus.\" **********What the prospectus shows about Equipment Leasing's business, among other things, is that about $2 million, or 25 percent, of the company's $7.8 million worth of lease contracts with customers are in arrears; $1.2 million of that is more than four months late. **********Equipment Leasing can't be blamed for all these credit problems, though, since it buys all its business services, including credit checks and collection work, from Walnut. Its transfer agent is Financial Data, another of William Shapiro's companies, and it has engaged Mr. Shapiro's law firm to collect delinquent accounts. The same firm rendered the legal opinion in the prospectus. And Welco Securities, the underwriter, is owned by Mr. Shapiro and run by son Kenneth. **********In other words, the whole shebang being held up to investors -- the parent company, the subsidiary, the law firm, the transfer agent, the underwriter -- boils down to Bill Shapiro and his son. **********And with the credit markets casting a cold eye on even the largest corporate borrowers these days, what interest rate should investors be paid for lending money, without collateral, to the Bill and Ken Show? The National Association of Securities Dealers requires Welco to get an independent opinion on that, so Welco hired Grigsby, Brandford & Powell of San Francisco to offer its view. **********That small brokerage firm agreed that the yields on the notes should be \"at least\" one percentage point above six-month Treasury bills for notes maturing within two years; two points above that six-month rate for notes maturing in two to five years, and three points higher for notes maturing after that. (Those rates are more than commercial banks offer, but considerably less than the yields on the \"junk\" bonds of some major corporations, which can be as much as 30 percentage points above Treasury rates.) **********In practice, of course, Equipment Leasing is offering rates higher than those minimums -- but not a lothigher, considering the risks. Recently, the effective yield on the two-year note was 11.5 percent, less than four percentage points higher than the yield on two-year notes being sold by the Treasury. **********Like Equipment Leasing, the Treasury's parent is deeply in debt and is constantly selling unsecured notes to pay the bills. But so far, no one has seriously suggested that Uncle Sam may not survive long enough as a \"going concern\" to repay his debts. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the parent of Equipment Leasing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/01/business/philip-morris-s-profit-jumps-on-sale-of-rothmans-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1990-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Philip Morris's Profit Jumps On Sale of Rothmans Stake", "print_headline": "Philip Morris's Profit Jumps On Sale of Rothmans Stake", "body_text": " **********The Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest consumer products company, said yesterday that its earnings more than doubled in the fourth quarter, partly because of a large gain from the sale of its stake in a British company. **********For the year, profits at the company - whose brands include Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O gelatin, Cheez Whiz spread and Miller beer - were up by 26.1 percent. **********In 1989, for the first time, food dwarfed tobacco as the company's largest subsidiary. It accounted for more than 50 percent of Philip Morris's annual revenues, with tobacco at almost 40 percent and beer at nearly 8 percent. But tobacco, despite years of diversification, continues to account for 65 percent of the New York-based company's annual profit. And much of that comes from one brand, Marlboro. **********The large quarterly gain for the company was prompted by strong operating earnings and Philip Morris's sale of its 29 percent stake in the British tobacco and luxury-goods company, Rothmans International P.L.C., for $455 million. **********In the quarter, the company's net income totaled $863 million, or 93 cents a share, up from $342 million, or 37 cents a share, in the corresponding period of 1988. **********For the year, Philip Morris's net profit climbed to a record $2.94 billion, or $3.18 a share, from $2.33 billion, or $2.51 a share. Its annual revenues rose by 41 percent, to a record $44.76 billion from $31.74 billion. **********The company was aided substantially in the year by the results of Kraft Inc., the huge food company it acquired in December 1988 for $12.9 billion, as well as the November sale of the Rothmans stake. **********The Rothmans sale resulted in a net profit gain of $152 million in the quarter, or 16 cents a share, Philip Morris said. The company had been Rothmans's second-largest shareholder for eight years but had felt stymied by the European Community's rules that prevented it from a having managerial role and easily increasing its stake. **********Without the sale of the stake, Philip Morris's earnings advanced by 19.5 percent in 1989, to $2.79 billion, or $3.02 a share. **********Last year, Philip Morris combined Kraft with its previously acquired General Foods Corporation unit, giving the subsidiary revenues of $22.93 billion and pretax profits of $2.14 billion last year. Kraft's revenues totaled $9.88 billion in 1987. **********Industry analysts said the resulting production gains from efficiencies of scale improved performance despite slow growth in the food industry. Kraft General Foods' operating revenues, the unit's sales from the food business rather than from combining the two companies, rose by 1.9 percent, and operating income surged by 26.2 percent for the year. Dollar figures were unavailable. **********Tobacco and Beer Gains **********Philip Morris also posted strong double-digit profit gains in beer and tobacco, especially in its international operations. Only its financial-services and real estate subsidiary reported relatively weaker gains because the company stopped selling houses in its Mission Viejo development in Southern California, where the real estate market has softened. **********Philip Morris's stock closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $37.875, up 87.5 cents a share. It was the fifth-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2.5 million shares being traded. **********The analysts said Philip Morris's earnings were in line with their expectations. They said they were especially impressed that the company could curb interest expense from the Kraft purchase. Interest costs, mainly from the Kraft deal, totaled $1.73 billion by the end of the year, up from $670 million a year earlier. **********''It was an extraordinary performance all around - again,'' said Lawrence Adelman, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. **********The analysts say Philip Morris makes much of its tobacco money through fat profit margins gained by manufacturing efficiencies and price increases for skillfully marketed brands. 11.6% Increase The company's American tobacco unit reported an 11.6 percent gain in revenues in 1989, to $9.49 billion, and a 16.8 percent gain in pretax profits, to $3.61 billion. It had a ''slight gain'' in unit sales for the United States market, which has been shrinking, to 219.5 billion cigarettes, and a gain in market share, to 41.9 percent, from 39.3 percent. It said Marlboro Lights, a low-tar version of the market leader, contributed to the gain. **********International tobacco, which has been a growth business for Philip Morris, reported a 3.6 percent rise in revenues in the year, to $8.38 billion, and a 30.1 percent gain in pretax net, to $1 billion. Unit sales rose by 7.7 percent, to 360.7 billion cigarettes. International profits rose sharply, partly because a British unit, which had $550 million in revenues, was spun off last year into a joint venture. Its sales are reported separately, but its profits are included in Philip Morris. **********The Miller Brewing Company, Philip Morris's beer unit, reported an 18.9 percent gain in pretax profits last year, to $226 million, on a 5.3 percent gain in revenues, to $3.43 billion. Miller's shipments were up by 3.7 percent, to 41.9 million barrels, despite sluggish growth in the industry. **********The financial-services and real estate business reported a 16.2 percent drop in revenues, to $527 million, and a 6.1 percent gain in pretax net, to $173 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/04/world/evolution-europe-voices-new-germany-hope-guilt-fear-joy-deep-satisfaction-words.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2386, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Voices of the New Germany: Hope, Guilt, Fear, Joy and Deep Satisfaction . . .

There were also West Germans, often of an older generation, who harbored feelings of guilt about division, since it had singled out a portion of the nation for prosperity and freedom, and a minority for poverty and repression. **********In East Germany the yearning for unity was more universal because it figured as a taboo and because the nation was compelled to live with images of the West always on its television screens. **********But there were also Germans on both sides who found certain propriety in division. Those ranged from leftists who saw in union the potential for a revival of German nationalism and dangerous ambition to East German intellectuals who dreamed of transforming the Communist dictatorship into a benign, socialist ''third way,'' free of the commercialism of the West. **********But in the end, union came in a way neither the advocates nor the critics expected, and which neither side could avoid.

This day is also of no small importance for the other people, particularly in Europe, as well as for East-West relations generally. **********A dangerous hotbed of confrontation, where the mightiest military alliances equipped with sophisticated weapons of mass destruction were facing each other, has been abolished once and for all. **********But if I said at the beginning that I am not without reservations, it is because this unification was done in such a way that it comes at the expense of the citizens of the former G.D.R. and, sooner or later, of the people in the Federal Republic of Germany too. **********The crises in industry and agriculture, soaring unemployment figures, growing social tension and increasing existential fears in East Germany are only a few consequences of the Kohl and de Maiziere Governments' crash course toward unity. A gradual merger of two equal states, for which concrete proposals were submitted during my term as the G.D.R.'s Prime Minister, could have helped to avoid many problems that came up, and still will come up. **********Gottfried Forck **********'A Lot of Work Remains to Be Done' **********Evangelical Protestant Bishop of Berlin-Brandenburg. 66 years old. **********A year ago in many towns of the G.D.R., we assembled for intercession services in churches. We prayed for more justice and freedom. But on Oct. 3, 1989, there was no telling whether our payers would help us toward these ends. Then, through nonviolent demonstrations, a bloodless revolution began as a result of which the Socialist Unity [Communist]  Party had to give up its claim to being the leading party. Christians could interpret this only as a gift of God. **********The cracking of the wall, the opening of the borders, free elections, negotiations for the unification of the two German states, the currency union and now the merger happened in such a rapid succession that we Germans hardly came to our senses. If we had given ourselves more time, many things could have been resolved in a better way. For example, many people in the G.D.R. became jobless as a result of the introduction of the market economy. Moreover, the past under socialist rule has not been dealt with sufficiently. **********Therefore a lot of work remains to be done. **********Ute Lemper **********'Unification Brings A Lot of Problems' **********A popular singer and actress from West Germany. 27 years old. **********There is not a lot to celebrate today because the unification brings a lot of problems with it. Aside from the economic problems the East will have to deal with, there are also very real psychological problems. Those people were educated in a different way for over 40 years. Now they feel guilty that they have themselves believed the wrong things and taught their children the wrong things. **********There is also great fear. The fear in the West is mostly about the cost of unification and higher taxes. But in the East they are concerned about not only their livelihood but also about being relegated to the status of a third-class country for the next 15 years. **********I have made a number of tours in East Germany this last year. I just returned from Weimar. It is devastating to see. Nothing has been done to maintain the beauty of the cities. The infrastructure has fallen aapart. **********The people are demonstrating again now, because they are losing their jobs and they are afraid of the future. **********But there are positive things, things we could learn from the East. Like their use of language. They try to tell the truth. They are not like our politicians, used to issuing empty phrases or outright lying. We have learned to look behind the words to turn them over and examine the meaning. But in the East they are more sincere, more honest and it is like a fresh wind. **********Hans Joachim Friedrichs **********'A United Germany Does Not Frighten Me' **********Television news anchor. 63 years old. It's primarily a gut feeling, but I am elated at the thought of no longer living in an artificially divided country. I went to boarding school in what became the Soviet zone soon after my departure and the G.D.R. a few years later - the other Germany, a sovereign state as the Communists would have it. I am older, and like many of my generation I have been unable to perceive the German Democratic Republic as anything but a piece of Germany, temporarily but thoroughly separated from the rest. The idea of a united Germany does not frighten me. I see no new superpower arising east of the Rhine - smallness in geopolitical terms had its rewards and its charm in the last 45 years. This, I think, is well remembered by the majority of my countrymen. By and large life has been good to them, much is at stake, they will not want to risk it. **********Petra Kelly **********'Fear That Germany Will Start to Bully' **********A founder of the environmental Green movement. 42 years old. **********I come from the town of Gunzburg in Bavaria, the hometown of Dr. Mengele, and watching the procedures leading up to the 3d of October has aroused fear. Fear that Germany will start to bully or subtly to intimidate its neighbors through economic power, political strength and even militarily, because even with reduced troops it is still a strong army with powerful weapons and even its nuclear options are being held open. **********I am also angry. Angry that the incredible speed with which this process has been taking place has overridden all the usual parliamentary procedures. We have been completely overwhelmed and forced to accept things without going through the usual and very necessary parliamentary steps. **********Also I fear that the citizens groups and the Greens in both East and West Germany have been incredibly weakened by this process. The economic power groups, business and the banks have had the say and they are determined to make a carbon copy there of what we have here. All our ecological, environmental and yes, social concerns are being overwhelmed and there will be no chance to correct the many mistakes we have made here. They will just be repeated in the East. **********Michael Friedman **********'Both German States Have a Responsibility' **********A lawyer specializing in international relations, a member of the Frankfurt Jewish Community and of the directorate of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and a member of the Frankfurt city parliament. 34 years old. **********The feelings that I have as regards the unification of Germany are ambivalent, controversial and marked by my personal life. The outcries for freedom and democracy from the East, and also from the G.D.R., have moved me and have made me once again aware of the fact that these values rank among the highest benefits of modern civilization. The fact that the Germans in the G.D.R. have now reached these goals gives reason for joy and shows that, in the final analysis, freedom can never be suppressed. **********From the Jewish point of view, but not only from the Jewish, it must be reminded that both German states have a responsibility with regard to their common past - National Socialism and the Holocaust. In the last decades it was scandalous enough that the G.D.R., because it posed as an ''anti-fascist state,'' shrugged off its responsibility. **********The mental, personal and collective grappling with the Holocaust must not be considered obsolete or barred by the statute of limitations, because this conflict became tangible for 16 million Germans only in the 1990's. On the contrary, any kind of change in the G.D.R. as a free state must be related to the confession of the outrages of contemporary G.D.R. citizens. **********Helmut Schmidt **********'The Great Victory Of the Will for Freedom' **********Chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982 from the Social Democratic Party. Today he is publisher and regular contributor with the liberal weekly Die Zeit. 72 years old. **********On the 9th of November 1989, when the Communists finally had to open the Brandenburg Gate between the two parts of Berlin and when the wall started to crumble, this was the great victory of the will for freedom. **********Only once in all my life did I have another experience which has affected me in the same deep-going way and which caused the same indescribable joy, namely the reunion with my wife upon coming home from World War II. **********The abolition of barbed wire and death strips between the two halves of my people was a cause for enormous joy and of deep gratitude for the vast majority of us Germans. The festivities on the 3d of October therefore are just an official footnote. But they remind the Germans, so I am convinced, to rest our hopes and our confidence on a persistent continuation of the hitherto policies of the Federal Republic of Germany. **********Manfred Stolpe **********'Original Enthusiasm Has Dimmed' **********Former president of the Consistory of the Protestant Church in Berlin-Brandenburg. He is now running on the Social Democratic ticket for Premier of the newly established state of Brandenburg. 54 years old. Rarely in history will the passing away of a sovereign state be greeted by so little mourning and such widespread satisfaction and even relief as in the case of the G.D.R. Only one year ago, the Communist gerontocracy at the helm was toppled by people who courageously claimed the simple truth that ''We are the people.'' Twelve months later, however, the original enthusiasm has dimmed considerably. A certain disenchantment about democratic procedures has seized people who by this year's end will have been called upon to vote four times. They were prepared for hardship but the actual balance sheet of four decades of economic mismanagement and social suppression proves to be even more disastrous than expected. Nevertheless, the tenacity with which people in East Germany pursue their course is impressive and deserves the sympathy and respect of all people who joined their rejoicing a year ago. What these people now really need is visible support and a measure of understanding which takes into account that the abolition of a political setting - as despicable as it may have been - leaves people in a psychological void. **********Carl H. Hahn **********'An Ultimate End To the Chapter' **********Chairman of the Management Board of Volkswagen. 64 years old. **********The unification of the two German states puts an ultimate end to the chapter of horrors of World War II and its consequences. It is to be hoped that this biggest European catastrophe of recent history was the last of its kind. We all are deeply moved these days. Without the political commitment of the United States, the abolition of the division of Germany and Europe would have been impossible - even a free Western Europe had never come into existence. Without the brave men of Solidarity in Poland, the moral force of the Polish church and the courage of Gorbachev, such a revolution could not have been brought about without bloodshed. **********The pace of changes demonstrates how much despair had accumulated in the people of Central and Eastern Europe after decades of Communist dictatorship. Probably, the people on this old continent will never forget Oct. 3, and those in Germany and Berlin will commemorate this day in a spirit of particular gratitude and humility."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Lev", "pub_date": "1990-11-19", "snippet": "* Fragrance Marketing Group, Chaska, Minn., a unit of Tsumura International New York, to Hakuhodo, New York, for its new product line, with undisclosed billings.\n* Golden Grain Co., San Leandro, Calif., a subsidiary of Quaker Oats Co., Chicago, to...", "word_count": 95, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING - ADDENDA;\nAccounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING - ADDENDA;\nAccounts", "body_text": " *********** Fragrance Marketing Group, Chaska, Minn., a unit of Tsumura International New York, to Hakuhodo, New York, for its new product line, with undisclosed billings.* Golden Grain Co., San Leandro, Calif., a subsidiary of Quaker Oats Co., Chicago, to Goldberg Moser O'Neill, San Francisco, for a new food product.

''What those colleges are doing is not a pipe dream,'' said William O. Mitchell of the American Apparel Manufacturing Association, which represents clothing manufacturers. ''It is a way of getting things done a lot more quickly and getting improved quality.'' **********Plants Using the Technology **********Southern Tech and Georgia Tech engineers said that new computerized systems are in use at an Arrow Shirt plant at Buchanan, Ga., and at a number of children's clothing makers including the William Carter Company of Griffin, Ga., and Health-Tex in Gadsden, Ala. **********Such technology is also in use by a blue jeans maker, the Lee Apparel Company, and by the Russell Corporation of Alexander City, Ala., which makes, among other things, jerseys for several National Football League teams. **********A tiny, experimental clothing factory capable of making a few dozen pairs of pants a day has been set up on the campus of Southern College of Technology in Marietta, an Atlanta suburb, to demonstrate to clothing makers what might be done even in the small, rural plants that have been the main producers of clothing in the United States. The industry has depended heavily on simple sewing machines manned largely by unlettered operators. **********A Different Operation **********''In a normal manufacturing situation, you see big plants with lots of intensive technology operating three shifts a day, seven days a week,'' said T. Dale Stewart, research technician at Southern Tech, ''The apparel industry has never been that way. For the most part, these are small, rural factories and the work force is young housewives with kids who can't or won't work the second and third shift. So if you're the owner of that plant, you can't depend on having a lot of expensive equipment that you'll pay off by running high volume.'' **********Therefore, ''we needed to make sewing machines more versatile,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''And computers seemed to be part of the answer.'' **********The Georgia group determined that instead of buying a new machine or retooling existing equipment to do each new sewing job, specialized computer chips could be programmed so that a single machine could be used for several different jobs with only minor mechanical adjustments. **********While some industrial sewing machines already come equipped with computer chips, many of these machines are still used for only one task. The Georgia group has been developing ways to reprogram these chips so that the machines can perform a variety of sewing jobs. **********Assembly Line Improved **********By reprogramming the machines, the engineers have converted an old straight assembly line into a more versatile line with many subassembly stations. Each computerized piece of equipment can work at a number of tasks instead of one. **********For example, after finishing enough zippers to supply all the lines at the factory that need them, the machine can be reprogrammed to work on another task instead of sitting idle. By switching to another task, a machine can help finish other work that otherwise would take longer to perform and slow up the whole assembly line. **********In a conventional assembly line, ''substantial inventory is tied up with work in progress and the first garment can take days to emerge from the sequential process,'' said Wayne C. Tincher, professor of textile engineering at Georgia Tech. **********But with the more versatile computerized machines, the first garment might show up at the end of the assembly line in 40 minutes, Mr. Tincher said. **********Single System Envisioned **********In the future, the Georgia scientists said, a large assembly line making several kinds of garments could be directed by a single computer system. Each operator would see on a computer screen the pieces of fabric next to arrive and get instructions on how they are to be sewn. The computer would then direct the actual sewing operation. **********''That's downstream a little way, but it's definitely coming,'' said Mr. Mitchell, who is director of research and development for Oxford Industries, a clothing maker in Vidalia, Ga. **********Such new technology is likely to require operators more skilled than present workers. ''We're talking about somebody who, at a minimum, can read and take direction from a computer screen,'' said Mr. Stewart of Southern Tech. ''But if someone has a good basic education, they may not need as much training on each machine. We're able to use college students here who have had only four hours of training.'' **********Mr. Mitchell agreed. ''In the past, the most important thing has been the dexterity of the operator,'' he said. ''I think in the future, the dexterity of the mind will be as important as dexterity of the fingers.'' **********Cut in Jobs Expected **********Mr. Stewart said the new technology might cut the labor force in some plants by 20 percent but not by any more. **********''You can't get robots to do this work,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''Robots are very good at grasping and manipulating a solid object like a steel rod, but they can't do anything with something that's going to flop around like a piece of cloth.'' **********An official of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union said the union does not think that workers will be displaced. Indeed, the union has encouraged the adoption of the new technology, said Carl L. Proper, assistant to the president of the I.L.G.W.U. **********''We think that in the long run a more modern industry is going to provide better jobs and more jobs for the firms that use it,'' Mr. Proper said. ''We do try actively to encourage employers to use the best appropriate technology.'' **********Mr. Proper said he is familiar with the Southern Tech demonstration plant and thinks its technology is feasible. **********'Starting to Happen' **********''I think what the people at Southern Tech are talking about is starting to happen,'' he said. ''The clothing business was behind other industries in installing and having available to it computer technology. There is a significant trend in that direction now.'' **********Mr. Proper is also executive director of the Council for American Fashion, a labor-management group that deals with technology issues. He said future garment industry workers would have to be more educated. **********Mr. Mitchell said American clothing makers would be forced to adopt the new technology if they wanted to keep their plants in the United States. **********''I hate to put it this way,'' he said, ''but the only alternative to new technology is being forced offshore to the Caribbean or Central and South America.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/27/world/former-prime-minister-re-elected-in-sweden.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 223, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Former Prime Minister Re-elected in Sweden", "print_headline": "Former Prime Minister Re-elected in Sweden", "body_text": " **********The Swedish Parliament confirmed Ingvar Carlsson as Prime Minister of a new Social Democratic Government today, 12 days after he resigned when his economic austerity policy was rejected. **********The vote - 175-101 with 59 abstentions - came after Mr. Carlsson revamped his proposals to rescue Sweden from an inflation that is approaching 9 percent. **********The vote ended the worst political crisis for the Social Democrats since they returned to power in 1982 after a six-year period in opposition. **********Mr. Carlsson's Cabinet resigned on Feb. 14 when Parliament rejected his economic program.

But, fearful of the political consequences, they said they could not endorse it until the President relaxed his firm opposition to new taxes. **********Too Early to Tell **********It is too early to tell whether Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal, which embraces sizable tax increases and spending cuts over the next five years, is an important step toward breaking the longstanding political deadlock over the budget or merely another round in the shadow boxing that has dominated the relationship between President Bush and the Democratic Congress. **********After saying at his news conference that he could not support a tax increase or a freeze in Social Security benefits, the President declared: ''I don't want to appear totally inflexible, but I'm not about to stand here and give him - give Dan or the Congress - the idea that I want to accept several of the things that are in his approach.

That makes him perhaps the most powerful committee chairman in Congress. **********But within his own party, he is something of a maverick with a history of working with Republican Presidents. The sweeping Tax Reform Act of 1986, the most important tax legislation in the last half-century, could not have been enacted had Mr. Rostenkowski not joined forces early on with Ronald Reagan. **********Before going public with his budget proposal, Mr. Rostenkowski discussed it in general terms with the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and the President's budget director, Richard G. Darman, Mr. Darman said today. **********Last weekend, in an opinion article in The Washington Post and in a television interview, Mr. Rostenkowski described a comprehensive proposal that would reduce the budget deficit by $55 billion in the next fiscal year and lead to a surplus by 1995. **********About 60 percent of the package would involve spending reductions, including slightly larger annual cuts than the President wants at the Pentagon, a one-year abolition of Social Security cost-of-living increases and a one-year freeze in spending for most other Government programs. The rest of the package involves tax increases, including higher income tax rates for the wealthy and an increase in the gasoline tax. **********It was the first time in many years that an important politician had come forth with a budget plan that included the politically unpopular measures that many, if not most, economists believe are essential to bring the deficit under control. **********The plan and the President's response to it left Democratic leaders uneasy. They fear that if they push the proposal, Mr. Bush will block it or veto it and then attack Democrats in an election year for wanting to raise taxes and cut retirement benefits. Mr. Bush gave no hint in his news conference that he would not attempt such a political maneuver. **********The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said today that he found the President's response ''foggy'' and ''confusing.'' **********Mr. Foley has been saying for several years that a package like Mr. Rostenkowski's, with additional taxes and spending cuts, was the only way to achieve real budget reduction. But he said today, as he has many times before, that enactment of such a plan was ''politically and governmentally impossible without the prior approval of the President.'' **********Mr. Bush has an ''absolute veto,'' Mr. Foley added, and Democrats gain nothing by proceeding alone to try to raise taxes or reduce Social Security payments. **********Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic majority leader, picked up on the prospect of a Presidential veto that could not be overridden after the Democrats had stuck out their political necks. **********''The President has a pen that's worth two-thirds of us, and that's all you need to know,'' he told reporters. **********Despite these reactions, the first buds of support for Mr. Rostenkowski from backbenchers began to bloom today.

Suchard had revenues of $4.7 billion last year. **********Philip Morris, based in New York, already owns Maxwell House, the second-best-selling coffee in the United States after Procter & Gamble Company's Folgers. **********Revenue of About $4.3 Billion **********Combined with Suchard, it would have coffee revenue of about $4.3 billion. Nestle S.A., based in Vevey, Switzerland, sells the most coffee in the world, with about $5 billion in revenues from various brands in 1989. **********The 60 percent share of Suchard about to trade hands is owned by Klaus J. Jacobs, who thought of himself as a David taking on the Goliaths of the food business, Mars and Nestle. By agreeing to sell his stake and thereby dismantling his conglomerate, Mr. Jacobs appears to be abandoning the challenge. **********Philip Morris said it planned to make a tender offer later for the remaining Jacobs Suchard shares, which are publicly owned. Philip Morris stock closed at $46 yesterday, up $1.625, and was the third-most-active issue on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Analysts hailed the move by Philip Morris, long a Wall Street favorite for its strong stock performance and profitable acquisitions. **********''Investors love the deal because it isn't a mega-acqusition that dilutes Philip Morris's shares and puts it deep into debt,'' said Rebecca B. Barfield, an analyst with First Boston. For a conglomerate of Philip Morris proportions, a relatively modest acquisition is anything costing less than $5 billion. **********Ms. Barfield estimated that the dilution of shares, the reduction in value for current shareholders, would be perhaps two cents a share or less this year. Philip Morris had earnings last year of $3.18 a share. **********Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said Philip Morris was acquiring the Suchard businesses for a ''very attractive price.'' He noted that Philip Morris was spending less than a dollar for each dollar of Suchard revenue. Interim financing will come from Philip Morris credit lines and Swiss banks, Philip Morris said. Financial advisers to Philip Morris on the transaction were Rothschild & Cie., France, and Rothschild Bank A.G., Switzerland. **********'Baby, Watch Out' **********Mr. Adelman was especially excited by Philip Morris's prospects in the freer European markets anticipated at the end of 1992. Food companies are less profitable in Europe because factories are smaller and distribution less efficient because of trade barriers. **********''Once you can run a truck from France to Italy,'' Mr. Adelman said, ''baby, watch out. You're going to see some very favorable improvements in profit margins.'' **********The Suchard deal would move Philip Morris's business further out of cigarettes, still its main source of profits led by Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette in the world. It would also add $3.9 billion in revenue to the $44.8 billion Philip Morris posted in 1989. **********The deal also fits Philip Morris's strategy of trying to build global products by using brands, technology and marketing across foreign borders. So far, the company's major world brand is Marlboro, and to a lesser extent, Philadelphia cream cheese, which is sold in 40 countries, and Tang powdered soft drink, which is sold in 70 countries. **********Michael A. Miles, Philip Morris's vice chairman, was good humored and clearly exultant about the transaction. ''Oh, this deal makes us twice as big a company in Europe as we used to be,'' said Mr. Miles, who is also head of the huge Kraft General Foods subsidiary based in Chicago. ''Other than that, we didn't do so hot.'' In 1989, Kraft General Foods had European revenue of about $3 billion. **********Some Not Included **********But the deal does not include several large businesses, like E.J. Brach Inc., the leading maker in the United States of sugar confectioneries, such as jelly beans. Mr. Jacobs will retain these businesses, which have revenue of about $800 million. **********The parent company's troubled reorganization of Brach helped lead to a 10 percent decline last year in operating profit to 275 million Swiss francs, or about $190 million at current exchange rates. In the 1989 Jacobs Suchard annual report, Mr. Jacobs bluntly called the effort, with its frequent change in Brach management, a $50 million ''failure.'' **********According to S.G. Warburg & Company, an investment house, Jacobs Suchard's 1989 revenue was sliced into about $1.9 billion in coffee sales; $1.9 billion in chocolate; $521.3 million in a cocoa trading company, and $388.7 million in sugar confectioneries, mainly the Brach candy business in the United States. **********Suchard's major coffee brands are decaffeinated coffee. Candy brand names include Tobler, Toblerone, Brach, Sugus and Nabob. **********In France, for example, Philip Morris will be able to add its 2 percent coffee-market share to Suchard's 38 percent. In Germany, Philip Morris adds 6 percent, from its HAG brand, to Suchard's 21 percent. **********The deal's terms call for Philip Morris to acquire Colima Holding A.G., whose principal asset is Mr. Jacobs's shares, and then make a tender offer, whose conditions will be announced before July 10. Jacobs Suchard's board has recommended the transaction to shareholders. **********AT A GLANCE: Philip Morris **********All dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data           Three months ended       March 31   1990   1989        Revenues   $11,388   $10,610        Net Income   775   590        Earnings per share   $0.84   $0.64                Year ended        Dec. 31   1989   1988        Revenues   $44,759   $31,742        Net income   2,946   2,337        Earnings per share   $3.18   $2.51                          Total assets, Dec. 31, 1989   $38,528        Current assets    9,380        Current liabilities   8,943        Long-term debt   13,646          Stock price, June 22, 1990        N.Y.S.E. consolidated close   44 3/4        Stock price, 52-week range   33 5/8-45 1/2        Employees,Dec. 31, 1989   157,000        Headquarters   New York"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/12/world/confrontation-gulf-attempts-have-been-made-break-trade-embargo-against-iraq-us.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Wines", "pub_date": "1990-09-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 594, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   Attempts Have Been Made to Break Trade Embargo Against Iraq, U.S. Officials Say", "print_headline": "Confrontation in the Gulf;   Attempts Have Been Made to Break Trade Embargo Against Iraq, U.S. Officials Say", "body_text": " **********Disclosure Seen as Deterrent **********None of the oil deliveries or the payments appear to violate the United Nations sanctions, which apply only to oil sales or other trade with Iraq conducted after Aug. 6. **********The Bush Administration is citing the oil shipments and efforts to break the trade ban to United Nations diplomats in an effort to underscore American resolve and to deter potential violators by making it clear that illegal trade with Iraq will be detected and revealed. **********United States intelligence agencies have uncovered efforts by private concerns in two dozen nations to smuggle goods to Iraq and have immediately notified the host governments and urged them to take legal action, Administration officials said today. **********One Government official said several of those concerns were ''professional sanctions-busters,'' experienced in breaking embargoes against such nations as Rhodesia, that are now seeking to sell their services to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. **********That official said the companies were based in such locations as Brazil, Eastern Europe, Switzerland, Austria and Britain. They are described as ''fronts'' with no real corporate structure, none of them well known internationally. **********None of those Governments were aware of the concerns' secret overtures to Iraq, the official said.

The report also said unidentified companies in Eastern Europe, East Asia and Africa had offered to smuggle weapons and other goods as well. **********Romania's Ambassador to the United States, Virgil Constantinescu, today denied the A.P. report and issued a list of his nation's oil purchases since Aug. 5, all from nations other than Iraq. **********Mr. Constantinescu said in a written statement that Iraq had offered to give Romania about one million metric tons of oil to settle past debts but that the offer had been rejected. He also said Romania had canceled two contracts with an American oil company, Chevron Corporation, for 150,000 metric tons of Iraqi oil. **********An Administration official, speaking on condition that he not be named, said that Iraq had discussed oil sales to Romania but that it was uncertain which nation had raised the prospect of a sale. **********Romania, like many Eastern European nations, had conducted a busy trade with Iraq and is suffering economically from the trade embargo. **********Officials said the Cuban oil shipment had been unloaded from the Iraqi-flag oil tanker Amuriyah, which docked in Cuba in the last week of August.

By June 3, President Bush will make a recommendation to Congress for a vote, and Chinese officials and business executives are worried that Mr. Bush might not recommend renewal or that Congress would block it. **********As a clear gesture of conciliation toward the United States, China announced Thursday that it had released 211 political prisoners, and had earlier lifted martial law in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, but diplomats reacted cautiously. They said it was not clear whether one or two actions would be enough to ease American indignation at political repression in China. **********Benefits of Trade Status **********China, which exported about $12 billion worth of goods to the United States last year, has benefited enormously in the last decade from most-favored-nation status, which gives Chinese exports the same relatively low tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent that the United States imposes on goods from most other countries. If the status were revoked, China would have to pay up to 90 percent duty on some items, mostly apparel, toys and electronics. **********''If most favored nation is not renewed in June, and if Congress approves, then it could hurt both countries,'' Wei Mingyi, president of China International Trust and Investment Corporation, said in a recent interview. ''Trade between the two countries could be set back by 20 to 30 years.'' **********The issue comes a year and a half after China began an austerity plan that has left the economy virtually stagnant, with zero industrial growth in the first quarter this year compared to the same period last year. Inflation is down and growth rose slightly in April, but some Chinese and Western economists say it will be a tough task to stimulate the economy significantly again without bringing back inflation, which reached double digits in 1989. **********Threat to China's Exports **********From China's point of view, the threat to its exports could not come at a worse time. Revocation of most-favored-nation status could cut China's exports to the United States by about 50 percent in the first year, and more in the following years. This would mean a decline in China's exports of about $6 billion in the first year alone, amounting to about 11 percent of its total exports last year of $52.5 billion. **********Trade between China and the United States has soared in recent years, and last year it rose by 43 percent over 1988 to $17.8 billion. But trade frictions between the two countries could rise regardless of whether most-favored-nation status is revoked, because of China's mounting trade surplus with the United States. In the first two months of this year, its trade surplus with the United States was $1.3 billion, or 79.2 percent higher than the surplus for the same period last year, according to statistics from the United States Department of Commerce. **********At that rate, American economists estimate, China's trade surplus with the United States could reach $11 billion this year, possibly making it the country with the second highest trade surplus with the United States, after Japan. **********A small minority of Chinese intellectuals interviewed say they are so disillusioned with the Government that they support revocation of most-favored-nation status, but the great majority appear to favor continuation of the trade benefits. **********'Torn Over the Issue' **********''We feel torn over the issue,'' a Chinese researcher said. ''On the one hand, we want the United States to punish the Chinese Government for what it did. But on the other hand, we know that such a punishment would affect our own personal lives, and frankly, we don't like the thought of having to endure the suffering.'' **********Most intellectuals say the Chinese Government would retaliate, probably at first by raising tariffs or restricting American imports, such as wheat and technology and equipment. But their anxieties go far beyond the impact on trade between the two countries. They say the Chinese Government would close its doors at least slightly to the world, restricting travel to America, cutting cultural exchanges and access to a wide range of Western things from books to fashions to ideas. **********It is uncertain how the revocation of most-favored-nation status would affect Chinese politics. On the one hand, it would hurt the economy and perhaps increase the pressure within the leadership for the removal of Prime Minister Li Peng, who is in charge of the economy. **********On the other hand, many Chinese say that the most likely outcome is that the hard-liners would seize the occasion to begin a campaign for self-reliance instead of openness, and encourage a new wave of anti-Americanism. **********''It will deal a blow to the reformers,'' said a Chinese businessman. ''It will foster an anti-Western attitude.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/18/world/evolution-in-europe-socialist-victory-seen-in-2d-bulgarian-round.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 186, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Socialist Victory Seen In 2d Bulgarian Round", "print_headline": "EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;   Socialist Victory Seen In 2d Bulgarian Round", "body_text": " **********Bulgarians went to the polls today in runoff elections that pitted the former Communist Party against opposition groups for control of Parliament. **********The former Communists, who now call themselves Socialists, won the first round of voting on June 10.

H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, and Gen. Alfred Gray, the Marine Corps Commandant, have urged that the United States avoid a rush toward war and give economic sanctions more time to work.  Kissinger Opposes Delay **********The remarks by Admiral Crowe and General Jones were warmly received by the committee's Democratic members, who have called for restraint by the Administration. **********But in his appearance before the panel, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger argued that the United States could not afford to wait a year for the sanctions to work because the prolonged presence of American forces in Saudi Arabia would destabilize the country and other moderate Arab states. **********\"The issue in Arabia is not American staying power but the host country's domestic stability,\" Mr. Kissinger said. **********\"Conditions in the gulf are not even remotely comparable to Europe or Northeast Asia,\" Mr. Kissinger said. \"There, American forces contributed to domestic stability. In Saudi Arabia they would threaten it.\" **********The sharply conflicting assessments were a microcosm of the escalating debate over American policy in the Persian Gulf. **********The Bush Administration's decision earlier this month to almost double the number of American troops in the Persian Gulf and to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force in an offensive against Iraq shattered the bipartisan Congressional support for the Administration's gulf policy that developed in August when President Bush announced that he was sending American troops to Saudi Arabia for defensive purposes. **********The two former military chiefs, whose testimony came before Mr. Kissinger's, echoed the assessment of former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, who testified on Tuesday, that the economic sanctions would be effective in persuading Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait if only the United States would give them time to work. Anti-U.S. Sentiment **********In his testimony, Admiral Crowe, the top military chief in the in the later part of the Reagan Administration and the first year of the Bush Administration, also argued that an American strike against Iraq would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Arab world. **********General Jones, the top military official during the Carter Administration and the early part of the Reagan Administration, said he also believed the embargo would work and expressed concern that the American military buildup would create pressure for premature action. **********\"As we build to 400,000 troops, however, the support, morale, training, cultural and readiness problems rise sharply the longer the troops remain in forward garrisons,\" General Jones said. \"My main concern with this latest scheduled reinforcement isn't that we might choose to fight, but rather that the deployment might cause us to fight -- perhaps prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily.\" **********Mr. Kissinger agreed that the growth in the size of the American force in Saudi Arabia would make it more difficult to extend their stay there. Mr. Kissinger argued that that merely strengthened the case for taking military action against Iraq early next year. Muslim Month of Fasting **********If the economic sanctions have not forced Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait by the spring, a situation that Mr. Kissinger suggested was very likely, the United States would face a decision of going to war against Iraq or risking contributing to the destabilization of Saudi Arabia. **********\"I do not believe we can maintain 400,000 troops much beyond the spring of next year,\" he said.  \"I am nervous about the period that begins with Ramadan.\" **********\"By the time it is evident that sanctions alone cannot succeed, a credible military option will probably no longer exist,\" said Mr. Kissinger, who remains an influential figure among White House officials. **********General Jones sought to balance his call for patience by sending a clear warning to President Hussein. **********\"The country is unified in seeking that he does not succeed,\" the retired general said. \"How badly he is hurt is his choice.

This means that Panama has no inflation problem, but it also means that the only ways of adding to the public coffers are by taxing or borrowing. **********Chaotic Transition **********But credit has been hard to come by. And taxes, originally due on Dec. 31, could not be collected because of the chaotic political transition that followed the American invasion earlier that month. Taxes are now due on Thursday. **********In the meantime, the Government payroll is being met with Panamanian money that had been frozen by the United States Government. **********''The situation is very touchy,'' said Ruben Carles, the Comptroller General and a former economics professor who has provided a steady diet of disclosures to local reporters about what he says is the corruption under the military. ''We cannot satisfy foreign creditors first, leaving aside work on hospitals and other socially responsible construction.'' **********To the regret of American officials here, Panamanian leaders have said they are considering spending at least $200 million for building projects, a move aimed at reviving the moribund construction industry. A senior American official said the United States has been pressing for more spending to reduce foreign debt, which represents almost a third of the Government's total debt of $5.98 billion. With a gross domestic product of $1.76 billion, Panama has one of the world's highest ratios of debt to gross domestic product. **********U.S. Aid Package **********The Bush Administration has said it will provide a $1 billion assistance package, consisting of grants and loans to promote economic development and incentives for American investment and trade with Panama. Congress recently approved the first portion of the package, $42 million in emergency aid. **********The entire package, about half of what Panama requested, also includes financing for an emergency public works program, new housing to replace that damaged by American troops, money to help Panama reduce its foreign debt and a decree lifting restrictions against American imports of Panamanian sugar. **********''We are like a very sick man who needs his medicine desperately,'' Mr. Kardonski said. **********A bloated Government payroll employs more than 150,000 people, padded by thousands of jobs created by the Noriega administration that were of no value to the country. **********Still, officials say that a serious increase in unemployment, now more than 16 percent, will lead to political insurrection. **********Fear of Unemployment **********''We have to cut public spending, but we don't want to lay off 30,000 workers,'' Mr. Galindo said. Before the crisis, the unemployment rate was just under 12 percent. **********Local banks have been facing a liquidity crisis that has been caused by severe restrictions on withdrawals imposed two years ago. **********Banking officials say that under the regulations, $1.5 billion, or almost 20 percent, of the assets in bank accounts has been frozen under restrictions that limit the size of withdrawals from time deposits and savings accounts. The restrictions are scheduled to end by June 30, but may end by April if officials can persuade depositors not to take out their money immediately and cause banks to collapse. **********Only a dozen banks have closed since the sanctions, leaving the number at 110. **********The banking commission is considering setting up a contingency fund and a special discount rate for short-term borrowing in cash-tight situations, but no decisions are expected before the end of this week. Bankers report that while foreign deposits have begun to trickle back in, the refusal by most Latin American nations to recognize the new Government has made lending hard. **********Establishing a Police Force **********American troops have also been helping Panamanians establish a local police force, although many business executives are skeptical. **********Looting has left them picking up the losses, since insurance policies have clauses that limit liabilities for acts of war. Without a fully trained local police force, street crime still persists - jails were opened during the invasion and many common criminals remain at large. There is also widespread fear that when the invasion force of American troops leaves the country by the end of February, violence will flare again. **********The violence severely damaged businesses in Colon, a city on the Atlantic Ocean side of the Panama Canal that is 50 miles from Panama City and is the heart of the largest free-trade zone in Latin America, re-exporting $4 billion in goods each year. The bulk of these goods are from businesses in the United States, Korea and Japan. **********But despite all the hardship, some business leaders are upbeat about the future. **********Mr. Galindo, the Finance Minister, said just about the best news he heard recently came from the National Brewery, makers of the beer sold under the label Cerveza Panama. **********Reflecting on a conversation with one beer executive who told him that rising consumption of its product means that the company will be paying a record amount in taxes, Mr. Galindo said, ''I suppose the recent events have encouraged beer drinking.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/28/business/demand-in-us-lifts-machine-tool-orders.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1990-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 710, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Demand in U.S. Lifts Machine Tool Orders", "print_headline": "Demand in U.S. Lifts Machine Tool Orders", "body_text": " **********Orders for American-made machine tools increased 8.9 percent in April from March, rising to their highest level since September, according to a trade association. **********Analysts said that the results reflected slight increases in capital spending by domestic manufacturers, especially aircraft companies. **********Machine-tool orders climbed to $289.4 million in April, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said in its monthly report, scheduled for release today. That followed a 36.6 percent increase in March, when new orders soared to $265.8 million. **********New orders from domestic manufacturers climbed 39.8 percent in April from the March level. But orders from foreign customers plunged by more than two-thirds. **********Officials of the machine-tool companies attributed the rise in domestic orders to more robust demand from aircraft makers and slightly increased demand from auto makers. **********Compared with the levels of April 1989, new orders were up 19.3 percent. **********Despite the overall increase in machine-tool orders, some economists said the figures reflected the economy's sluggishness, as well as a reluctance by manufacturers to spend more heavily to upgrade plants and equipment. **********''The economy has not been generating much profit for companies,'' said Neal M. Soss, the chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''And that is not the environment in which you expect buoyant capital spending to occur.'' **********The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production. Economists consider patterns in machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers. **********Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products like appliances, vehicles, aircraft and construction materials. **********Optimism About Detroit **********In recent months, auto makers sharply curtailed their machine-tool orders because of slumping sales. The auto industry accounts for about a third of domestic machine-tool sales. **********But Richard Priebe, a spokesman for the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker, said that Detroit was slightly increasing capital spending and that orders from auto companies should grow the rest of this year. **********''Domestic auto companies are looking at the new generation of engines,'' he said. ''And changes in emissions standards mean that there will be considerable expenditures that will affect machine-tool companies.'' **********Analysts said the sharp decline in foreign orders did not reflect declining interest in American-made machine tools. Rather, they said, the demand in March was unusually high because of a $63 million order to Cross & Trecker from Soviet auto makers. **********Indeed, new orders from foreign customers were up 47.6 percent for the first four months of this year, compared with the similar 1989 period. For this year's January-April period, overall new orders declined by 9.1 percent from the 1989 level, and domestic orders were off 16.5 percent. **********Since April of last year, new orders from domestic manufacturers have risen 23.3 percent, while orders from foreign customers have fallen 11.2 percent. **********Shipments of machine tools declined 10.6 percent in April, to $258.2 million, from $288.9 million in March. The level of shipments was up 3.5 percent from the April 1989 level, however. Also, shipments increased 11.1 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with a year earlier. **********Cutting Tools **********New orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were up 4.4 percent in April from the previous month and were 35.4 percent higher than in April 1989. **********But new orders for metal-cutting tools dropped 12.3 percent for the first four months of this year, compared with the similar period of 1989. Metal-cutting tools typically account for about three-fourths of orders. **********Orders for metal-forming tools increased 22.1 percent in April from the March level. But orders for new metal-forming machine tools decreased 8 percent in April, compared with April 1989. For the first four months, new orders for metal-forming tools dropped six-tenths of 1 percent, compared with the similar period of 1989. **********The machine-tool order backlog for April was $1.71 billion, up from $1.68 billion in March.

Lysenko. ''All the main decisions, on personnel, finances, were made by the party, even when technically they were joint decisions with the Mossoviet. The role of the Mossoviet was a formality. The Mossoviet itself was a formality.'' Today, a different reality has set in. Power has shifted from the party to a more open political arena. The cities of Moscow, Leningrad, Lvov and Volgograd, and even the Russian republic itself, have moved beyond the total control of the party, choosing their leaders from a new crop of independent-minded politicians. **********But the party, while forced to acknowledge its losses at the ballot box, is fighting hard to keep the rights, privileges and property accumulated during its 72-year monopoly on power. **********The press in particular has emerged as a critical battleground, one where the party refuses to cede its advantage. **********Battle Ends in Draw **********''The Communist Party is no longer the party that dominates everything,'' said Valery P. Yevseyev, deputy editor at Moskovskaya Pravda. ''It is just one of many. And in these conditions -particularly with the new law on property - every party committee and organization has to worry about itself and its future.'' **********In Moscow, the battle over the press has ended in a draw. The Communist Party has refused to give up either Moskovskaya Pravda or the city's afternoon paper, Vechernyaya Moskva, which has daily sales of 650,000, to the newly elected city government headed by Gavriil K. Popov, an economist who is an insurgent leader. **********The staffs of both papers have endorsed the party line, although Vechernyaya Moskva, the livelier and less political of the two, has stated its intention to become totally independent someday of both party and government. **********Independence, in this case, would mean keeping the profits the paper earns, 97 percent of which now go to the party's central coffers. **********In the meantime, the Mossoviet, left without a press voice, is setting up its own newspaper and weekly journal. But to do so, it must rent a printing plant owned by the Communist Party. **********Newsprint, which is a scarce and precious commodity in the Soviet Union, is another matter. Newsprint for the newspaper's initial run of 200,000 will come from reductions of about that size in the newsstand sales of the two party papers - a decision made by party leaders that has set off protests from the editorial staffs. **********Given the party's waning political influence, this economic dependence is particularly galling for newly independent local authorities. The party, meanwhile, is ready to make the most of its economic clout. **********Vladimir Perel, director of the giant Moskovskaya Pravda plant, which now prints five million copies a day - including many nonparty publications handled on contract - said it is inevitable that the plant will give first priority to party newspapers. **********''If our typography stays party property, our first task will be to put out our own products,'' he said. ''After that, we have to work on the basis of profit.'' Who Owns What?  Untangling who owns what in a society where party, people and government were always proclaimed to be one is a potential legal nightmare. In the case of Moskovskaya Pravda, for instance, the party insists that it has paid for everything over the years -equipment, building, staff and distribution costs. **********But the government newspaper Izvestia reported recently that in Volgograd, where the party committee had refused to hand over either one of two newspapers to a newly elected city government, expenses for these publications had been traditionally carried by departments of the local government. **********''We are so used to stereotypes that we consider these publications to be the property of the party,'' Izvestia wrote. **********In Leningrad, where another insurgent group has taken control of local government, the party agreed to divide the city's two newspapers, giving the Vecherny Leningrad, the evening paper, to the Leningrad City Council. **********With the election of Boris N. Yeltsin as President of the Russian republic, the identity of Sovetskaya Rossiya, now identified as a paper of both the Communist Party's Central Committee and the Russian republic, is also open to question, although few expect the party to relinquish control. **********''It is impossible to fight them,'' said Valery Vyzhutovich, a reporter at Izvestia and a member of the 40-member commission at the Mossoviet that has been negotiating with the party over the fate of the city's newspapers. ''It is better just to start our own and compete with them.'' **********Everyone, including the editors of the party papers, agrees that competition will badly shake up the party papers, which still reproduce large and boring chunks of verbatim transcripts of speeches and interviews by party leaders. In a period saturated with political events, the party press continues to provide little objective reporting and uninspired analysis. **********Mossoviet plans to issue the first edition of its weekly, to be called Stolitsa, or Capital, in July, and its editor, Andrei Malgin, is certain that in winning the battle, the Communist Party has lost the war. **********''We are going to be so sharp, so interesting to our readers that we won't even be competing with them,'' he said.

This week brought agreements between the Soviet Union and the West on a framework for negotiating the reunification of the two Germanys and cutbacks in conventional forces in Europe, with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, so eager to get a deal to rescue his nation's failing economy that he is willing to accept bigger cuts than President Bush. **********Some analysts are hailing these events as the triumph of capitalism; they hold forth the promise of a continuing decline in military spending that sooner or later will enable the United States to wipe out its budget deficit, raise its savings rate, eliminate its trade deficit and regain its world leadership. Euphoria is also fed by hopes that the opening up of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union may provide a vast new area for capitalist development that would rekindle the postwar boom. **********But fears of depression feed on the mountain of debt and the danger that it could collapse and wreck the economic structure. It would be an irony beyond belief if, in the hour of capitalism's triumph, when the Communist states are seeking a model, capitalism should collapse under the weight of its speculative excesses. Such fears were heightened this week by the failure of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the mother of the ''junk bond'' revolution, now in disintegration. **********''Drexel illustrates the overall problem of too much debt - Government debt, consumer debt, corporate debt,'' said William N. Griggs, managing partner of the investment advisory firm Griggs & Santow. ''A disaster is brewing,'' he added. James J. O'Leary, economic consultant to the United States Trust Company of New York, agrees. ''We have already seen the serious consequences of this overhang in rising delinquencies and foreclosures of commercial and home mortgages which have occurred during the strong business expansion,'' he said. ''The very heavy overhang of debt seems bound to pose much greater dangers in an economic slowdown or a possible recession.'' **********But when will the disaster arrive - and must it come? The stock market this week shrugged off the Drexel debacle, which it had expected. Some on Wall Street even felt that the fall of Drexel was a good and necessary corrective to a decade of excess and hazardous debt. **********Most economists, including Mr. Griggs and Mr. O'Leary, still expect continuing slow growth and also see it as part of the remedy for past excesses. The consensus forecast of the 50 economists and economic forecasting groups surveyed this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators calls for the American economy to grow at the sluggish rate of 1.6 percent in 1990, with a moderate pickup to 2.4 percent in 1991. **********The Bush Administration is somewhat more optimistic, but its forecast is just within the upper limit of the private economists' range; it foresees 2.4 percent real economic growth in 1990 and 3.2 percent growth in 1991. The Congressional Budget Office is closer to the midpoint of the private economists' range, forecasting 1.7 percent growth this year and 2.4 percent in 1991. No euphoria, no depression, not even a recession. **********What is the logic behind the nearly unanimous forecast of continuing but sluggish growth? Roger Kubarych, manager of Henry Kaufman & Company, speaks for most economists in stressing the sustaining role of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Kubarych, a former Fed economist, contends that with the economy slowing the Fed has ''latitude to bring down interest rates and ignore the dollar.'' Indeed, a decline in the dollar would spur United States exports and help stave off recession. The Fed has husbanded its resources and can afford to feed more reserves to the banking system, which is facing heavy risks at home and abroad. **********Gently but firmly, the Administration is also leaning on the Fed to keep the economy growing. In its annual Economic Report, the President's Council of Economic Advisers plainly states, ''The Administration's primary economic policy goal is to promote further growth.'' It contends that monetary policy can deliver on that growth objective, consistent with its aim of holding down inflation. In fact, that is why it expects no recession now: It says that when inflation becomes intolerable, politically or economically, there is ''little choice but to tighten monetary policy, which typically brings on a recession,'' but it sees no such need now. **********The immediate issue is whether the Fed is easing enough to head off a recession, which could turn into something far worse if it brought the debt structure crashing down. That would worsen pressures for trade protectionism, aggravate strained relations with Japan, exacerbate the third world debt problem and that of some major American banks. It would hurt those Communist nations now striving for political and economic freedom and links to world markets. A depression and climbing unemployment would be the worst possible advertisement for capitalism. **********For the longer run, the issue is whether the Administration is doing enough, through its own fiscal policies, to solve the Federal deficit problem, which has so hampered the United States' ability to tackle the country's domestic social problems or provide international leadership."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/06/business/court-rejects-a-poison-pill.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 231, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Court Rejects A 'Poison Pill'", "print_headline": "Court Rejects A 'Poison Pill'", "body_text": " **********The Delaware Chancery Court ruled today that National Intergroup Inc., a beleaguered company whose businesses include metals, retail stores and wholesale drug distribution, must submit its amended shareholder rights, or ''poison pill,'' plan to a shareholder vote before it can be declared effective. **********Ruling on a case brought by two National Intergroup shareholder groups - Centaur Partners and Walker Street Associates - Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett ruled that under company bylaws, changes to National Intergroup's rights plan made on Jan. 26 were invalid because they had not been approved by shareholders. **********National Intergroup said it would appeal the ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court. **********In January, National Intergroup tightened its rights plan, reducing to 10 percent from 20 percent the amount of stock someone would have to acquire before it would be effective.

Mr. Murdoch has also bought the 20th Century Fox Corporation, Metromedia television stations and TV Guide. Moreover he started the Fox TV network and Sky Television, a British satellite television service that has accumulated heavy operating losses in its start-up phase. **********As the Lippincott sale was announced, Advertising Age, the weekly trade publication, printed a report that quoted unidentified sources as saying that Mr. Murdoch was trying to sell TV Guide, which he bought in 1988 for about $3 billion.

Elections must be held during that period. They will also be challenged by a five-party leftist alliance, which sees a chance to expand its following among the poor. **********Interviews with political leaders, students and diplomats provide the following account of what happened in Bangladesh since early October: **********On Oct. 8, all major campus wings of national political parties except the Awami League joined in an alliance. The Awami League would also later become part of the All Bangladesh Students Union. **********On Oct. 10, the police fired on students demonstrating outside a Government office building against Mr. Ershad's apparent plan to run for another term after his current term ended in 1991. Opposition groups never recognized his initial election, saying that only about five percent of voters actually cast ballots.  Swore Oath Over Slain Student **********Students took one of the five bodies, that of a fellow student they identify only as Zahid, and carried it to the front of the main campus, where they swore an oath of unity over it. Student leaders at that point more or less decided to force the political parties into a similar union. **********A series of demonstrations and strikes followed. The Ershad Government then made what many consider its fatal mistake: It released criminals and allowed them to go armed into the university campus to break up the student front. **********On Nov. 27, a gun battle broke out on the Dhaka campus. A professor of physiology who was also an officer of the Bangladesh Medical Association was killed, provoking a mass outpouring of grief and rage. **********As professional groups began to ally themselves with the students and politicians, Mr. Ershad declared a state of emergency and imposed curfews. They were flagrantly violated. **********A former military officer said that at that point, junior officers in the army began to criticize the President openly.

Stone, a Republican consultant from Washington whose clients have included Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush, and Douglas E. Schoen, a Democratic New York consultant who has worked for Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. **********The two men, who have individually advised the Trump Shuttle's owner, Donald J. Trump, on national and local real estate issues, will now help him craft communications campaigns for his commuter airline, which is fighting the Pan Am Shuttle for market share. **********''This is like a political campaign,'' Mr. Stone said. ''Two candidates fighting for at least a 51 share, using the same tools: TV, radio, print, direct mail, telephones.'' **********Analysts say the Trump Shuttle has a 45 to 50 percent share of the shuttle traffic between New York, Washington and Boston. When it was the Eastern Shuttle, it controlled the market, but a strike by machinists, which was supported by other unions, hobbled the Eastern Shuttle and reduced its share to about 26 percent before Mr. Trump took control in June. **********Already in its brief life, the Trump Shuttle's marketing campaign has had more wrinkles than a shar-pei puppy. The airline chose Scali, McCabe, Sloves as its agency last spring, after a highly public search in which Mr. Trump boasted of the low compensation he planned to give his agency. Then, a few weeks after its release, Scali's first campaign for the shuttle, which involved unlikely celebrity pairings, was publicly criticized by Mr. Trump in a speech to airline executives. **********Scali appears to be taking in stride the appointment of two high-profile political advisers to the shuttle's marketing team. **********''I haven't had the experience ever with a political consultant hired by the client and working alongside us,'' said Robert Levenson, Scali's vice chairman, ''but I have to assume that if Donald hired these people, he has some trust in them and value in their opinions.'' **********Mr. Stone and Mr. Schoen both credited Scali's work. ''Instead of fixing something that's broken, we're coming in to add a strategic dimension,'' Mr. Schoen said. **********The use of political consultants by product and service marketers is not new. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., for example, has for several years supplemented its ad agency with the Sawyer-Miller Group, a Democratic political consulting firm. Although Mr. Schoen's firm, Penn & Schoen Associates, is known primarily as a political survey research organization, both it and Mr. Stone's organization, Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly, have served numerous manufacturers and service companies. **********Both firms have been embroiled in controversy. Mr. Stone, who is 37 years old, a suave figure who was once featured in a GQ magazine fashion spread, resigned as an adviser to the Republican gubernatorial campaign of Jim Courter in New Jersey last year; a colleague of Mr. Stone had admitted using political influence to secure loans from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. **********Mr. Schoen, 36, ran unsuccessfully for a Queens Congressional seat in 1983. **********In 1987, a dozen people previously retained by Mr. Schoen's firm were indicted on charges of forging signatures on nominating petitions for a candidate that had engaged the firm. Ten were convicted on a variety of forgery-related charges. Neither Mr. Schoen nor his firm were charged with any wrongdoing.  In an interview, the two consultants affirmed that they intended to concentrate on identifying and communicating to niche audiences within the business traveler market, which accounts for about 85 percent of shuttle passengers. Direct mail, they said, is likely to play a large role in their strategy. **********While welcoming their participation, Mr. Levenson of Scali objected slightly to their comparison between marketing the shuttle and marketing a political candidate, particularly to the metaphor, often used by political consultants, that their nonpolitical clients ''face an election every day.'' **********''It shouldn't be put in those overly dramatic terms,'' Mr. Levenson said. ''There are much longer-term considerations that maybe political consultants don't know. They're trained to get their guy elected and then their job is over. I don't think they're accustomed to longer-term issues like brand-imaging.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/26/business/no-epidemic-is-expected-from-drexel-s-killer-flu.html": {"writer_name": "Sarah Bartlett", "pub_date": "1990-02-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Epidemic Is Expected From Drexel's Killer Flu", "print_headline": "No Epidemic Is Expected From Drexel's Killer Flu", "body_text": " **********Aftershocks from the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. swept through the markets last week, as traders openly questioned the financial health of several other Wall Street firms. But top financial officers of a number of large brokerage firms and leading credit analysts said the problems that suddenly engulfed Drexel are unlikely to be repeated. **********The way Drexel financed its operations was particularly perilous, they said, and is atypical of the rest of the Street. ''Drexel's capital structure and business was far different from other brokerage firms,'' said Jeffrey Bowman, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. ''For others to experience similar problems is highly remote.'' **********Specifically, Drexel relied heavily on a technique called ''double leverage'' to finance its broker-dealer operations. Double leverage means a firm borrows at the holding company level and lends those funds to a subsidiary, which in turn can use the money as collateral with which to raise more money. Essentially, the same funds can be put to work twice. **********Twice as Much as Competitors **********Double leverage is common on Wall Street and in banking, but Drexel was twice as double leveraged as its competitors. **********Financial executives say double leverage need not be risky, provided the broker-dealer uses the funds to finance short-term investments rather than to support assets that do not generate cash or that are unable to be sold quickly. **********Salomon Brothers' parent company, for example, is one of the brokerage industry's heaviest borrowers of commercial paper, which are short-term corporate i.o.u.'s. And Salomon's holding company, Salomon Inc., does indeed lend those funds to its broker-dealer subsidiary. **********But Donald S. Howard, the firm's chief financial officer, said Salomon uses the commercial paper only to finance short-term investments in its broker-dealer and backs those investments with readily marketable collateral. **********When Liquidating Is Easy **********If the holding company suddenly needs to repay its commercial paper debt, it can quickly liquidate the short-term investments of its broker-dealer and send the cash upstream to the holding company. Unlike in Drexel's case, the regulators would presumably allow such a transfer because the broker-dealer still had other funds that qualified as capital, the financial cushion required by industry regulators. **********Merrill Lynch & Company also borrows heavily in the commercial paper market and funnels the money to its broker-dealer in the form of equity, but it does not borrow against that money. Again, on the surface it is double leveraged, but not the way Drexel was. **********What Drexel appears to have done was to borrow at the holding company level in the short-term commercial paper market and use that money to finance its subsidiary's portfolio of high-yield, high-risk ''junk bonds.'' Those bonds became increasingly illiquid and did not produce the required cash flow. Because the commercial paper was counted as part of the broker-dealer's capital, instead of more flexible short-term loans, the regulators would not allow the broker-dealer to channel any excess money back to the parent company. **********''It was a very imprudent capital structure,'' said a financial executive at a large Wall Street firm. ''My guess is that it's not practiced by anyone who intends to live for a long time.'' **********Bank Loans Hard to Get **********Drexel's financing appears to have differed from that of other firms in several other important ways. Since it had made its mark as a junk bond firm, those bonds made up a far higher percentage of its inventory than at other firms. That made it harder to get bank loans secured by the assets in its portfolio. **********Traditionally, banks have been willing to lend 85 cents for every dollar of a junk bond that a securities firm owned. But as conditions in the junk bond market deteriorated and credit concerns grew, that willingness disappeared. By September, said one senior executive of a Wall Street firm, banks were lending only 75 cents for every dollar of junk; by December that had fallen to 60 cents, and by January it was down to 50 cents. **********At the same time that its access to secured lending was drying up, Drexel was also being shut out of the market for unsecured commercial paper. Actually, among leading brokerage firms, Drexel had been one of the least dependent on the commercial paper market. At the end of the third quarter of 1989, for instance, it had only $700 million of commercial paper outstanding, or about 2 percent of its total liabilities, compared with 5 or 6 percent at several other firms and 12.9 percent at Merrill Lynch. **********But even that small amount became critical as its other alternatives evaporated. In the last week of November, Standard & Poor's downgraded the rating on Drexel's commercial paper from A-2 to A-3. Fitch Investors Service, the other leading agency to rate Drexel's debt, announced a similar downgrade, from F-2 to F-3, in the first week of December. **********'Out of the Market' **********That sharply reduced the pool of potential lenders, since many banks, corporations and other institutional purchasers of commercial paper are not permitted by their investment guidelines to purchase paper with that low a rating. **********''There is no A-3 market to speak of - it trades by appointment only,'' said one financial executive of a large Wall Street firm. ''When you go from A-2 to A-3, you're essentially out of the market.'' **********Senior executives at other firms said that if their access to commercial paper dried up, they would turn to their banks, with whom they have agreements to provide emergency credit. But Drexel does not seem to have had any such ironclad agreement, for its banks turned down its 11th-hour request for financing. **********''Drexel, it is my understanding, had no back-up facilities to support its commercial paper, and very few highly liquid unencumbered securities,'' said D. Bruce Brunson, the treasurer of Merrill Lynch. By contrast, a firm like Merrill Lynch has nearly $6 billion in guaranteed back-up credit lines and securities it could pledge in exchange for more credit. **********Data Not Available **********Efforts to discern exactly how securely financed other Wall Street firms are is difficult because the data are not publicly available. Publicly held firms have to release details about their holding companies' balance sheets only once a year, at year-end, and they never have to release the specific financial status of their broker-dealers. With private firms like Drexel, the amount of disclosure is even less. **********Those concerned about a brokerage firm's credit risk are forced to rely on the rating agencies, which are privy to more internal financial data of public firms, and to some extent even private ones. Credit analysts at these agencies said one of the most important issues they focus on in deciding a firm's debt rating is how it could deal with a liquidity crisis of the sort Drexel just experienced. **********Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have assigned the highest possible ratings for all the major brokerage firms with the exception of one. The Paine Webber Group is rated one notch down, at A-2 or P-2, depending on the agency, and credit analysts say that is because of less-than-stellar operating performance, not liquidity problems."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/26/business/company-news-siebe-takeover-offer-accepted-by-foxboro.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1990-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 426, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Siebe Takeover Offer Accepted by Foxboro", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Siebe Takeover Offer Accepted by Foxboro", "body_text": " **********The Foxboro Company, a Massachusetts-based industrial controls company that has received inquiries from a number of suitors in recent weeks, agreed yesterday to be acquired by Siebe P.L.C., a British safety products and engineering company, for $52 a share, or $655 million. **********Under the agreement, Siebe said it would buy Foxboro's 12.6 million shares in a cash tender offer to begin on Friday.

Informal estimates in Plauen put the rate of decline in the population, which stood at 78,000, at 18 percent. In Zwickau, a Social Democratic volunteer said the town numbered 128,000 people, but added, ''It must be a lot less now.'' **********Hugo Miltner, a teacher with a heavily bandaged arm after a serious home accident, said he shuddered at his daily hospital visits. ''It is catastrophic,'' he reported. ''There is nobody left, not even to clean the clinic or keep the equipment working.'' **********Mr. Brandt appealed to East Germans not to run away. Conceding that he, too, would have considered flight were he in the same situation, he urged patience and hard work in this part of the nation and said he was confident that with West German help prosperity would come. ''We must light a fire under rear ends in Bonn if they don't direct enough resources here,'' he said. **********In southern Saxony and Thuringia a visitor gains a sense that the East German state has ceased to exit. Driving along 100 miles of potholed roads between Leipzig and Plauen, past the decaying facades of houses that have received little care in half a century, one sees everywhere, fluttering from windows, on village squares, even at the entrances of publicly owned factories, the flag of West Germany. **********Even the frequent Saxon and Thuringian flags represent a rejection. The Communist regime dismantled the historic lands and divided their state into smaller districts, which offended traditional sentiments. The parliament to be elected on March 18, in the first free voting since 1932, will restore the borders of the former kingdoms and principalities. They are, in addition to Saxony and Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Mecklenburg and Brandenburg. **********The West German flags are mainly produced by removing the Communist emblem of a hammer and compass from East German banners. ''We know how,'' a journalist remarked. ''In 1933 we sewed black swastikas on red party flags, in 1945 we removed them again. Now we are restoring the unadorned black, red and gold of the republic.'' **********A day of random conversations in the three Saxon towns reflected virtually unanimous sentiment in favor of unity now, as well as conservative sentiments based on hatred of Communism, but uncertainty on whom to support. Many complained that few specific programs had been put forward. **********''Many Germans are not strong in the backbone,'' Mr. Miltner said. ''The party was the backbone here for all these years, so now they don't know what to do and think.'' **********On a popular level, much unity has been forged already since the border was opened three months ago. Long lines on the highways near the frontier show how common its crossing remains even after the thrill of novelty has worn off. **********Advertising boards in Plauen announce concerts and soccer matches in Hof, the nearest West German town. Buses bring West Germans from Hof, Ingolstadt or Coburg for cheap day trips to their Saxon cousins, and Plauen's few coffee houses are crammed with Bavarians marveling aloud at the low cost of the same pastries that they fancy at home. **********But before Mr. Brandt spoke in Plauen, the square had to be cleared of stands from which West Germans were hawking a variety of fruits and vegetables that astounded townspeople. In a country that lives in virtual commercial isolation, displays of kiwi fruit from Italy or South Africa, bananas from Ecuador, tomatoes from the Canary Islands, pineapples from Ivory Coast or cucumbers from Crete were looked at like museum pieces. **********There was astonishment at the sight of tomatoes, cucumbers or strawberries in February. Endives and Chinese cabbage were mysteries for many. **********The drawback was that only West German marks were accepted, a currency that sells on the black market at as much as 10 times the official one-for-one rate. Many East Germans spent money that recent visits with friends and relatives put in their pockets. Soviet soldiers looked on as if through plateglass windows, and a group of Vietnamese ''guest workers'' took a while before deciding against investing their one Western bill of 10 marks in pineapples that reminded them of home. **********A dealer tantalized onlookers. ''Don't you want to, or can't you?'' he asked in a broad Bavarian accent. **********''We're waiting for prosperity,'' an elderly woman with her hair in a large bun responded in equally dialetical Saxon, the area being one of Germany's major linguistic divides. ''We've had nothing for 40 years.'' **********The longer lines formed at a state-owned stand, which sold comparable imported produce in East German marks, at four or fives times the prices in Western marks. **********'What Have We Had?' **********A 70-year-old retired household worker said she could not afford such things in any currency, ''not on a pension of 425 marks,'' or $257, a month.'' She said she had come only for Mr. Brandt, although she believes no politician. ''They all cheated us,'' she said, worrying about what reunification would do to the value of her pension and savings. ''What have we had in these 40 years?'' **********She said she remembered hearing that Ernst Thalmann, the pre-Nazi Communist leader, had spoken on the same square. The woman said she did not remember whether Hitler had spoken in Plauen. ''He didn't interest me,'' she said unconvincingly. **********The woman and a friend said they had attended the anti-Communist demonstrations, which, as in most towns, continue as weekly events. But they said they did not join in. Expressing what appeared to be a political philosophy of wide applicability, the first woman said, ''We stand on the corner and cheer.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/01/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-hussein-seeks-a-debate-with-france.html": {"writer_name": "John Burns", "pub_date": "1990-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1266, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Hussein Seeks a 'Debate' With France", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   Hussein Seeks a 'Debate' With France", "body_text": " **********President Saddam Hussein said today that Iraq would seek to open a ''debate'' with France over the Persian Gulf crisis. Passages of his speech implied that Iraq might be prepared to enter such talks with a less than unyielding stance. **********In a broadcast message, Mr. Hussein wavered between a harsh line suggesting that Iraq would fight to defend its seizure of Kuwait and more conciliatory passages implying that a deal could be struck to avoid war. **********In the more aggressive sections, Mr. Hussein used vituperative language against the United States, calling it the ''haven of evil'' and saying there could be no solution unless Washington first withdrew its forces from the region. **********But the core of his message was directed at President Francois Mitterrand of France. In a speech last week at the United Nations, Mr. Mitterrand said that all of the issues raised by Mr. Hussein in the last two months, including the fighting in Lebanon and Palestinian demands for a homeland, could be discussed if Iraq withdrew its troops from Kuwait and met other demands of the United Nations. Those demands include the restoration of the Government of the Emir of Kuwait. **********Hint of a Change **********Mr. Hussein said that Iraq's priority in talking with France would be to insure that the situation in Kuwait ''should not be restored to the previous situation before Aug. 2.'' **********This remark differed significantly from his previous statements that Iraq's annexation of Kuwait was irreversible. Some Western diplomats here said it implied that Baghdad might eventually settle for a compromise -or that Mr. Hussein might at least be trying to signal for tactical reasons that it might accept a settlement. **********The Iraqi leader's message took the form of a greeting to Arabs and other Muslim peoples on the birthday of the Muslim prophet, Mohammed. The occasion, an opportunity for the kind of festivity that this city has not seen since the invasion of Kuwait, drew tens of thousands of citizens into the streets of Baghdad tonight in processions of lighted candles and beating drums. **********Perhaps because his primary audience was made up of Arabs and other Muslims, Mr. Hussein took his hardest line yet on the two issues he has addressed in virtually all of his messages on the Kuwaiti issue: the demand that any resolution include a settlement of Palestinian grievances with Israel, and that an ''Arab solution'' to the crisis be found - but only after a withdrawal of American troops. He also renewed Iraq's pledge to fight if its hold on Kuwait is challenged militarily. **********'Prepared for Fighting' **********''Iraqi forces under all circumstances and events will be prepared for fighting in defense of Kuwait province,'' he said. Nevertheless, he took a milder tone in responding to the Mitterrand speech, which his Government had welcomed in general terms shortly after it was delivered. **********Mr. Hussein said today that ''in spite of our objections,'' Iraq viewed the speech as different in tone from others made by Western leaders. ''We intend to make contacts with the French Government to explain after inquiry, questioning and dialogue our views accurately, so that everything is based on clear ideas and actions,'' he said. **********''What annoys us'' in the attitude of the United States and other Western nations, he added, ''and is rejected by us from the start,'' is ''not our disagreement on views, but rather the biased, prejudiced viewpoint that passes judgment without showing readiness to conduct a debate.'' **********Asks for 'Peaceful Tone' **********''Thus if debate supersedes threat and intimidation, and if a peaceful tone of politics supersedes the tone of deploying armies with the threat of using force, then it does not matter where do we agree or disagree in the first place with this or that initiative, including the initiative of Mr. Mitterrand,'' Mr. Hussein said in the official English translation of his remarks. **********''What is important indeed,'' he continued, ''is that any serious debate should seek a possible and fair solution, that the solution should be comprehensive so that we enjoy peace, and all concerned in the region should base their future on a firm foundation unshakable against changes of circumstances.'' **********Some Arab intermediaries have suggested that Iraq might accept the restoration of Kuwait as an independent state if Kuwait surrendered some strategic territory to Iraq, including a vast oilfield on the Iraq-Kuwait border and two strategic islands that command the entrance to Iraq's new oil port at Umm Qasr, north of Kuwait. **********Suggested compromises have also included payments of billions of dollars from Kuwait's vast financial reserves to compensate Iraq in a dispute over oil prices and crude pumped from the disputed field. **********Arab Proposals **********Leaders who have supported Iraq or at least avoided an outright condemnation of its actions in Kuwait, like King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, have called for negotiated settlements that would include the establishment of a new government in Kuwait, perhaps after elections supervised by the Arab League. **********The implication is that the Emir's Government, which has ruled without a parliament for most of the 29 years of Kuwait's independence and was bitterly unpopular with some poorer Arab countries, might not be restored. **********The broadcast version of Mr. Hussein's message, read over Baghdad radio and television tonight, attracted wide comment among Western diplomats here, who have been poring over his speeches for the first sign that the Iraqi leader might be ready to back out of Kuwait. **********Only a week ago, in his last major pronouncement on the Kuwaiti issue, Mr. Hussein implied that Iraq might not wait for the American-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf to attack, but perhaps would strike first if its people were ''strangled'' by the United Nations trade embargo. **********The diplomats cautioned that the message appeared to have been written in two parts. One part seemed to be intended to convince supporters that Mr. Hussein is prepared if necessary to endure a catastrophic war over Kuwait, they said, and the other to hold out the vague prospect of a compromise with the nations whose forces are arrayed against Iraq's. **********Suggestion of Pragmatism **********The diplomats said the contradictions could be interpreted in various ways. They said it was possible that the Baghdad Government was entering a more pragmatic phase, positioning itself so that it can hang on to Kuwait for the time being while holding out the possibility of a withdrawal. **********From the Western viewpoint, the diplomats said, the least attractive interpretation is that Mr. Hussein is simply trying to forestall any military attack by the United States or its allies by drawing France into talks. **********In itself, the Iraqi leader's decision to seek talks with France was not surprising. For a decade and more before the invasion of Kuwait, France had been the Western nation with the closest ties to Baghdad. **********French companies were the major foreign contractors for the Iraqi nuclear plant that was destroyed by Israeli bombers in June 1981, and French weapons, including the Exocet missile that struck the United States frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf in May 1987, helped to sustain Iraqi forces in their eight-year war with Iran."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/24/business/polish-debt-hurts-the-zloty.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 230, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Polish Debt Hurts the Zloty", "print_headline": "Polish Debt Hurts the Zloty", "body_text": " **********Poland's Deputy Finance Minister, Marck Dabrowski, said today that he thought Poland's currency, the zloty, could be made fully convertible within three years if the country can ease its debts. **********He said after a speech to international bankers in West Berlin that convertibilty was a Government goal that could not be met without easing repayments on Poland's $39 billion debt. **********The Polish President, Gen.

Not so long ago the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was almost universally regarded as a puma amidst newborn kittens -- a powerful beast, whose predatory instincts made it untrustworthy out of sight of its Government keepers. **********But in the last few years A.T.&T.'s rivals, notably the MCI Communications Corporation and U S Sprint, have grown claws of their own. And with the support of the Bush Administration, the Federal Communications Commission is proposing to lengthen A.T.&T.'s leash, with the thought of one day letting free markets rather than regulation protect consumers' interests. **********That would suit A.T.&T., which would like to move aggressively to shore up its 60 percent-plus share of the lucrative large-customer business market. But the proposal is drawing howls of protest from competitors that have only recently grown comfortably profitable. **********A.T.&T.'s rivals score a few points in the resulting war of words between distinguished economic consultants. But to the degree that the hired guns succeed in raising doubts about the potential for healthy competition in long-distance phones, a larger, unspoken question becomes more difficult to ignore: How does the simulated rivalry between a handful of phone companies that apparently cannot be allowed to fail better serve the public better than a plain old-fashioned regulated monopoly? **********Under current rules, all long-distance phone companies are free to set rates, offer new services and negotiate special deals for valued customers. Check that: all but one. As a \"dominant carrier\"A.T.&T. cannot raise or lower rates by 5 percent or more without permission from regulators. And it must provide plenty of notice to its rivals in case they want to match the offer. **********The commission argues that the rationale for this discrimination against A.T.&T. is losing its force. A.T.&T.'s rivals are now big enough, rich enough and competent enough to deter a predatory price-cutting attack. **********What is more, the commission says, U S Sprint and MCI's enormous investments in excess capacity make it unlikely that A.T.&T. would be able to gouge customers. If the phone giant raised prices, competitors would be well positioned to take away their business. **********Three consultants for U S Sprint, Steven Salop, Steven Brenner and Gary Roberts of Charles River Associates demur. The costs of transforming the smaller phone companies' maze of fiber-optic cable into a functioning network would exceed the commission's estimate by billions of dollars. Moreover, for some A.T.&T. customers -- notably those with 800 numbers that would have to be changed --leaving the A.T.&T. family would be expensive. **********But it is not rate increases that U S Sprint fears. Just the opposite: A.T.&T.'s rivals worry about price cuts that would force them to sacrifice profits in order to hang onto valued customers. And here the Charles River trio offer a novel argument in defense of their client. **********Many potential customers, they assert, including some who were burned after Ma Bell's breakup, incorrectly believe that non-A.T.&T. service is inferior. Thus if A.T.&T. were free to price as it wished, it would discriminate, lowering rates to gain savvy price-sensitive customers and raising rates for customers who believed A.T.&T's advertisements. At the very least, Steven Salop argues, deregulation should be delayed until customers are given time to see how good non-A.T.&T. service can be. **********The best guess now, analysts argue, is that the F.C.C. will find a politically acceptable compromise, deregulating at a sufficiently cautious pace to keep U S Sprint and MCI from taking their case to their friends in Congress. Indeed, the one near certainty in the not-so-brave new world of long-distance telephone regulation is that, once established, every company will be given sufficient support by regulators to stay in business. **********Therein lies the rub. As the architects of telephone divestiture in the early 1980's understood, it takes competitors to create and maintain a competitive market. But the addition of profitable service providers was a means of insuring competition, not an end in itself. The F.C.C. now finds itself running a cartel, favoring smaller companies over the larger one in the expectation that the market will someday be self-sustaining. **********But what happens if, as seems increasingly likely, that someday never comes? Is America really better off with a telephone cartel regulated in the interests of its weaker members than with a monopoly that must justify its pricing policies to the Government?"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/24/business/company-news-ual-will-let-davis-buy-additional-shares.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1990-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 337, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  UAL Will Let Davis Buy Additional Shares", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   UAL Will Let Davis Buy Additional Shares", "body_text": " **********The UAL Corporation said yesterday that it had changed its standstill agreement with Marvin Davis to allow the West Coast investor to buy additional shares in the company. **********The step was aimed at bringing in other bidders and providing some leverage for the UAL board as its advisers begin talks with a team headed by Coniston Partners, the New York investment firm, which has allied itself with three unions of United Airlines. **********The Coniston group has offered to buy the carrier for $150 a share in cash, $25 a share in notes and 25 percent of a new stock to be issued after a takeover.

Honasan, and young army officers. **********In his post as martial law administrator, Mr. Enrile was responsible for the conditions of imprisonment of Mrs. Aquino's late husband, Benigno, and he regulated her visits to him. **********Mrs. Aquino, despite her discomfort with Mr. Enrile, made him her Defense Minister. She dismissed him nine months later after a failed coup attempt against her by his followers, led by Mr. Honasan. Elected to the Senate and now one of Mrs. Aquino's bitterest opponents, Mr. Enrile is a major figure in a revived nationalist party. **********Mr. Honasan, who has also been charged in the latest coup attempt, is still at large. The Government's case against Mr. Enrile now seems to hang on allegations by dining-room staffers that the two men met at a dinner party at Mr. Enrile's house on Dec. 1, the first day of the coup. **********Mr. Enrile, now 66, was born in northern Cagayan province as the illegitimate son of a laundry woman. As a teen-ager, he traveled to Manila to confront his wealthy lawyer father, who took him in and educated him. **********Became Wealthy Along the Way **********He became a lawyer and later studied at Harvard. Recruited by Mr. Marcos, he became Customs Commissioner, Justice Minister and then Defense Minister. Along the way he also became wealthy, and currently has significant real estate holdings and lucrative logging concessions. **********Mr. Honasan is regarded as the son Mr. Enrile never had, while Mr. Enrile replaced Mr. Honasan's father, a soldier who died young. **********Teodoro Benigno, once Mrs. Aquino's press spokesman and now a regular critic of her in a newspaper column, said that the move against Mr. Enrile was a necessary show of strength. ''I think the strategy was to make people realize that she is serious about these threats to her Government and that she is not afraid of Enrile,'' he said. **********Yesterday, Mr. Enrile said that he was ''playing politics - I'm playing chess with Mrs. Aquino.'' The prize, he said, was ''my liberty.'' Government officials believe that the real prize at stake is the presidential palace."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/13/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-bush-tapes-a-message-for-iraqi-tv.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1990-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 598, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Bush Tapes a Message for Iraqi TV", "print_headline": "CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;   Bush Tapes a Message for Iraqi TV", "body_text": " **********Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq denounced the speech Mr. Bush delivered to Congress on Tuesday night. The official Iraqi press agency quoted Mr. Aziz as saying: ''The U.S. President's address is a model speech by an imperialist ruler who wants to impose his power on the world. Most of the globe's peoples, the Arabs in the forefront, reject that and insist on preserving their independence and free will.'' A Simulated Debate?  In making his tape for broadcast in Iraq, officials acknowledged that Mr. Bush was running the risk that it would be edited, although they were taking steps to make that harder technically. It could also be preceded or followed by a rebuttal from President Saddam Hussein himself, creating the appearance of just the kind of debate that Mr. Bush has rejected. **********White House officials said it was Mr. Bush who first brought up the idea of getting time on Iraqi television, at a news conference in Kennebunkport, Me., and that once the opportunity was offered by the Iraqi Government, the President felt it was worth taking a chance. **********The audience in Iraq will not be large. The British Broadcasting Corporation, which publishes such statistics, estimated in June that there are 1.5 million televisions in Iraq, which has a population of 17.9 million. But many of those people live in areas where they do not have access to television at all. **********Mr. Bush wrote much of the message himself and went over the contents in at least two meetings with experts from the National Security Council and the State Department, said Mr. Fitzwater. **********He said Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger would give the tape to Mohammed al-Mashat, the Iraqi Ambassador, by Thursday morning. Then, the United States would give Iraq five days to air it before releasing the tape, Mr. Fitzwater said. **********'A Little More Hopeful' **********Mr. Fitzwater, who has expressed skepticism that Iraq would broadcast the tape unedited, said today that he was ''a little more hopeful'' that would happen. He did not explain what caused the change. **********Mr. Mashat has said that Iraq's state-run television would ''of course'' air the message ''in its entirety, without editing.'' **********To try to prevent the Iraqis from editing the tape, the White House was including its own voice-over translation and subtitles in Arabic, which were done by the Voice of America. **********The tape was produced by Sig Rogich, Mr. Bush's scheduling chief and public relations consultant. In it, Mr. Bush stands in front of his desk in the Oval Office, with the American flag behind him. He read his remarks from a TelePrompter, pausing once to pull a piece of paper from his pocket and read a quotation, Mr. Rogich said. He and other officials refused to say what was on the paper. **********Mr. Fitzwater quoted Mr. Bush as saying in the tape that ''we have no quarrel with the Iraqi people, that the Iraqi Government has forced incredible hardships on the people of Iraq by virtue of their naked aggression against Kuwait, that we are in the Persian Gulf to defend Saudi Arabia, and that we want a peaceful resolution, we want peaceful coexistence with the people of Iraq.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/13/business/at-tishman-fewer-glamorous-jobs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1494, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "At Tishman, Fewer Glamorous Jobs", "print_headline": "At Tishman, Fewer Glamorous Jobs", "body_text": " **********The Tishman Realty and Construction Company, which built the World Trade Center, Epcot Center and many other landmark developments, is finding it must expand into projects it once ignored, like prisons, schools and government buildings, in an effort to offset the downturn in the nation's real estate markets. **********The 92-year-old company, as close to a blueblood as exists in the real estate business, has built a strong reputation on projects that also include the John Hancock Center in Chicago,Renaissance Center in Detroit and the twin towers of Century City in Los Angeles. It has been selected to modernize and expand Kennedy International Airport and add a building to the Rockefeller Center complex. **********But with the real estate development business in a sharp downturn, the company is seeing fewer of its traditional private clients in need of a construction manager. So it is expanding into less glamorous works. Tishman has just begun the Niantic Women's Prison in Connecticut, and is competing for several other large prison contracts. It has won a contract to serve as the Government's construction consultant for the final component of the 70-acre Federal Triangle Development in Washington. That complex will be the second-largest Federal building in the nation, after the Pentagon. **********The company is also seeking out development projects in Eastern Europe as that region modernizes, and it has signed an agreement to build housing complexes in Israel for the current flood of immigrants there. Although the profit margins on projects like these are generally slimmer than in doing construction management for big New York City developments, the company is determined not to be hostage to the fortunes of the private real estate industry. **********Finally, the company, whose reputation allows it to raise money more easily than some of the troubled developers it often represents, is increasingly doing projects for its own account - in other words, projects that it will own - with a focus on hotels. **********''We saw what was happening and knew that the boom years could not go on forever in New York, but we have offices and a lot of businesses outside New York,'' said Richard Kielar, a vice president of the company, in explaining why Tishman was turning to projects it once ignored. **********John L. Tishman, the 64-year-old chairman and chief executive of the company, and a grandson of the founder, comes from a family of old money that has long maintained a low profile while contributing large sums to medical and educational charities. **********The company is owned primarily by Mr. Tishman, who lives in Manhattan and Bedford in Westchester County, and although it is now private, it was publicly traded from 1928 to 1976. The other main principals are two senior executives, Irwin Miller, president and chief executive of the construction business in New York, and Abraham S. Bolsky, head of the construction business on the West Coast. **********Ran Into Trouble in 70's **********Tishman Realty learned in the 1970's just how painful it can be to be tied almost exclusively to big private projects, mostly in New York City. At that time, commercial property values were falling sharply in the city, little building was being done and Tishman suffered large losses on one of its major office projects in New York City. The company was liquidated in 1976 and its construction and research arm, along with the Tishman name, was sold to the Rockefeller Center Corporation. In 1980, officers of the Rockefeller subsidiary, including Mr. Tishman and several colleagues, bought back the business. **********Among the other well-known members of the Tishman family who were part of the company before it was sold in 1976 to the Rockefellers are Mr. Tishman's cousin, Robert V. Tishman, who with his son-in-law, Jerry I. Speyer, transformed the finance and development arm of the old company into Tishman Speyer Properties. Alan V. Tishman, another cousin, is a principal in the brokerage and building management firm of William A. White/Grubb & Ellis. **********Tishman, which now has more than 700 employees, wears a number of hats. Usually it serves as the construction manager on a major office building or a project like Epcot Center, for a client like Metropolitan Life or Walt Disney. But it might simply serve as a client's representative, ironing out difficulties between the contractor and the client. Or it might simply serve as a construction consultant to a client. **********But Tishman also has substantial business in real estate development for its own account. The company says it has completed or begun more than $1.2 billion worth of development projects for its own account. It remains to be seen whether some of those projects will prove to be a drag on earnings, given the problems of the current real estate market. **********'Very Highly Regarded' **********Real estate executives say Tishman is a leader because it consistently delivers well-made buildings while limiting cost overruns. ''They are very highly regarded,'' said William Conway, a managing director of Jones Lang Wootton, an international real estate company. **********While most of the nation's real estate developers and construction companies are at wit's end in search of financing for new projects, Tishman is handling about 50 projects valued at close to $4 billion with little sign of slowing its pace. So far, the company's new contract award volume this year has reached close to $1.5 billion, down from $2.5 billion in 1989. **********''We are satisfied in this market to have that much,'' said Mr. Kielar, the Tishman vice president. ''In all fairness, I wouldn't expect to reach that $2.5 billion figure.'' **********Mr. Tishman agreed. ''We are not unhappy with the volume that seems to be heading to us this year, but we are very unhappy about the troubles with financing'' that our developer clients are having, he said. **********But those financing troubles may be a blessing in disguise for Tishman. **********In many instances, bank lenders now require that developers put more equity than debt in new deals that only a year ago could have consisted almost entirely of debt. Because these banks have raised the hurdle that proposed developments must clear to get financing - or have simply stopped lending to new real estate projects - those developers with large, stable sources of capital are at a big advantage. **********Foreign Investors Lured **********Tishman has managed to get around the financing squeeze that most developers are facing by attracting foreign equity investors. **********''We have a number of foreign sources of equity that are waiting and asking for products,'' Mr. Tishman said. ''These are not the lenders or banks but equity participants.'' **********These foreign equity participants are overwhelmingly private Japanese companies and a few wealthy individuals looking to diversify into upper-tier American commercial real estate projects. Moreover, according to Tishman, much of its construction financing is now also coming from Japanese lenders rather than American banks. **********Probably the most spectacular and widely watched of Tishman's recent projects is the Walt Disney World Dolphin Hotel, a whimsical 27-story monolith with 1,509 rooms that was designed by the architect Michael Graves and sits next to Epcot Center in Orlando, Fla. **********The hotel, crowned by a pair of six-story dolphins and four flower-shaped fountains, is opposite the Walt Disney World Swan hotel, also built by Tishman. Both are owned by a consortium including Tishman, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and the Aoki Corporation, a Japanese company that owns Westin Hotels and Resorts and is one of Japan's largest contractors and developers. **********A Focus on Hotels **********Tishman has moved boldly into the hotel business. Two years ago, it announced a real estate investment fund - a joint venture with Aoki -that will exclusively sponsor Tishman developments and acquisitions. The Tishman Development and Acquisition Fund, as it is called, expects to put about $2 billion into the hotel business in its first five years. **********So far, the fund has developed the $185 million Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers. Earlier this year, Tishman, as a construction manager, broke ground on a 400-room luxury hotel in Osaka, Japan, that will be the first such project to be built by an American construction company. **********''We are very interested in hotels right now, especially resort hotels,'' Mr. Tishman said.  At a time when occupancy rates for most hotel chains are sliding and price wars are cutting into earnings, Tishman still thinks there are opportunities for the developer that can identify unexploited niches, particularly in the big-city hotel markets. The company is developing resort hotels in Puerto Rico and Southern California."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/27/business/briefs-386890.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 309, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** BankAmerica Corp., San Francisco, is offering $100 million in subordinated notes, due in 2000, at 99.502 to yield 9.779 percent, through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. *********** Continental Bank Corp., Chicago, plans to file a shelf registration statement on the 26 percent equity interest in the company held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. *********** Ohio Power Co., a unit of American Electric Power Co., Columbus, Ohio, is offering $50 million in 9.875 percent first-mortgage bonds due in 2020 through Lehman Brothers. *********** Pennsylvania Power and Light Co., Allentown, Pa., will redeem on Oct. 1 the $125 million principal of its 12 percent series first-mortgage bonds due in 2015.

Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who had sent their father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, to the gallows. **********As she recounted the conversations in her autobiography, ''Daughter of the East,'' Ms. Bhutto would reply, ''Violence only breeds violence.'' The two fought often on this crucial issue, she wrote, also noting how she had admonished her brother about his luxurious style of living abroad. **********The younger Mr. Bhutto's name is back in circulation in Pakistan these days as the political future of his sister grows more uncertain. Now based in Damascus, Syria, he wants to come back, encouraged by feelers from some People's Party members. **********Ms. Bhutto, by all accounts, does not want to see him. In her 20 months in office, she never exonerated or pardoned her brother for crimes in which he more or less admitted complicity as head of an armed militant organization, Al Zulfikar. **********Mumtaz Bhutto, their uncle (once or twice removed) and a Sindhi politician with his own party, said in a telephone interview today from his home in Larkana that he had met 36-year-old Mir Murtaza in Athens in June and found him eager to come home. **********But Pakistanis, most of all Ms. Bhutto and her husband, know that if her brother returns, he, as the only male heir alive, will almost automatically inherit their father's political legacy and possibly the leadership of his party, even though his sister is a year older. He will, that is, if he does not go to prison immediately. The caretaker Government of Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi would move to arrest him if he reappeared, officials say. **********Mir Murtaza Bhutto is a wanted man because of charges that he was behind the March 1981 hijacking of a Pakistani airliner and the killing the following September of a prominent Pakistani philanthropist, Zahur Elahi. Mr. Elahi was riding in a car with the judge who had signed Mr. Bhutto's death warrant in 1979. **********Both attacks were the admitted work of Al Zulfikar, founded by Mir Murtaza and his younger brother, Shahnawaz, who had fled to Kabul after their father's death. In Kabul, the two young men married Afghan sisters, who followed them into eventual exile in Europe. In 1985, Shahnawaz Bhutto, his marriage failing, died in Cannes under mysterious circumstances. Ms. Bhutto says he was poisoned, and calls him a ''martyr.'' His widow and daughter moved to the United States after the French cleared her of involvement. **********Mir Murtaza'a marriage also collapsed after his brother's death. In Syria, where he finally settled, he married again. This year, he and his wife had a son, whom they named Zulfikar. **********The decision to settle in Damascus, apparently with the help of the Syrian Government, has led many Pakistanis to assume that the Al Zulfikar organization may have links with international terrorist organizations, and may have had a hand in the death of General Zia, who was killed in an unexplained plane crash in 1988."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/03/business/deal-for-kay-is-valued-at-410-million.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1990-07-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 814, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deal for Kay Is Valued at $410 Million", "print_headline": "Deal for Kay Is Valued at $410 Million", "body_text": " **********Ratners Group P.L.C., the world's largest jewelry retailer, announced in London yesterday that as expected it would acquire Kay Jewelers Inc., the third-largest American jewelry chain, for about $410 million in stock. **********The transaction, which was approved on Sunday by the directors of both companies, will strengthen the position of Ratners as the second-largest American jewelry dealer after Zale's, which is operated by Peoples Jewellers Ltd. of Canada.

''It is still the intention that the agreement be signed at the Washington summit between May 30 and June 3.'' **********The agreement would initially be for three years. Then it could automatically be renewed for a further three years if neither side objects. It is expected to bring a moderate increase in bilateral trade, as well as provide the Soviet Union with easier access to American goods needed for its modernization program. **********Toward a Market Economy **********''The agreement looks toward development of a market economy in the Soviet Union but reflects the fact that they are not quite there at this point,'' Mr. Katz said. Before the trade agreement can be signed, President Bush has insisted, the Soviet Union must adopt a new emigration law, a demand that prevented a trade pact signed between the two countries in 1972 from coming into force. **********Mr. Katz said he did not know when Moscow's new legislation would be approved, but he noted that the link between the trade agreement and a more flexible Soviet emigration policy was clear and understood. ''I am not sure if it will be ready in time,'' he said. **********Describing the contents of the provisional agreement, Mr. Katz said that in addition to the exchange of Most Favored Nation treatment, it called for the establishment of trade offices by both governments and travel facilities for Soviet and American businessmen. **********Making It Easier for U.S. Business **********Before the talks began, United States officials said Washington was particularly eager to make it easier for American companies to operate in the Soviet Union, not only as traders but also as investors who can repatriate their profits without difficulty. **********Mr. Katz noted that the two governments planned to sign separate letters dealing with trade facilities, financial relations, tourism and protection of all aspects of intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights and sound recordings. The draft agreement also includes provisions dealing with national security questions. **********He said that Soviet access to official American loans, such as trade financing from the Export-Import Bank, was not covered in the planned trade agreement. He added that the Bush Administration would be required to seek Congressional approval if such a privilege was granted to Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/05/business/business-scene-chemical-industry-faces-oversupply.html": {"writer_name": "Louis Uchitelle", "pub_date": "1990-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 852, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Scene; Chemical Industry Faces Oversupply", "print_headline": "Business Scene; Chemical Industry Faces Oversupply", "body_text": " **********CHEMICAL manufacturers illustrate a troublesome shortcoming of free markets. For three years, they have been expanding operations, even as they worried that their new plants would produce much more than anyone wanted to buy. And, as these plants come on line, their fears are coming true. Chemicals used in the manufacture of hundreds of household items are once again in oversupply. **********That hurts. Consumers might soon get a price break on things like drugs, soap, paint and plastic zipper bags, but profits are down at companies like Dow Chemical, Union Carbide and Monsanto, and some new plants are not being opened on schedule. Dow, for example, had planned to open a huge ethylene plant in Freeport, Tex., in 1992 but will wait until 1993. By then, Dow hopes, the demand for ethylene might again exceed the supply. **********The chemical industry is not alone in going through cycles of abundance and shortage. Similar cycles also afflict steel, paper and other bulk commodities -- and many are entering an oversupply phase today. But chemicals seem to get hit the hardest, perhaps because the industry is so huge and so basic to the rest of manufacturing. **********Half a decade might pass before the demand for chemicals catches up again with the supply. This time around, the weakness in the American economy will almost certainly prolong the process. But the main problem is not the economy; it is that alternating periods of too little production capacity and then too much come in cycles that no one seems to be able to control. **********Peter Spitz, chairman of Chem Systems, an industry consulting firm, explains why. \"Imagine it is 1988,\" he said. \"Demand is rising, chemicalplants are operating at full capacity and people are making lots of money. You are a chief executive of a chemical company and you say, 'My God, someone has to build another plant, and it is very profitable.' **********\"So you announce a new plant, and one new one is probably okay. But your competitor says, 'I'm not going to let him get ahead of me and steal market share.' So he announces a new plant. And then a third announces. And if you put all these guys in a room, they seem like a crazy industry. But each one has a rationale.\" **********The emerging oversupply, as new plants come on line in the early 1990's, is greatest at the petrochemical end of the industry. Such basic materials as ethylene and propylene are made in huge quantities and then used to produce specialty chemicals like drugs, fertilizers or plastics. Petrochemicals get hit the hardest because the manufacturing process requires high-output plants to keep down production costs. **********The new Dow plant in Texas, for example, will produce 1.5 billion pounds of ethylene a year, a quantity equal to nearly 4 percent of current ethylene consumption in the United States, which is 39 billion pounds a year. Put another way, the Dow plant, if it were operating today, would produce enough ethylene to cover, by itself, the 3 percent growth in ethylene sales nationwide that is expected this year. And Freeport is not the only new ethylene plant. Some nine billion pounds of production are being added over the next five years, said John Lillich, Dow's director of investor relations. **********The chemical industry also indulged in rapid expansion in the 1970's, resulting in a huge oversupply through much of the 1980's. Operations were closed wholesale and some companies, like Monsanto, switched from commodity petrochemicals to production of specialty items, like fertilizers and synthetic fibers. **********By all accounts, the 1980's crisis frightened the chemical industry, and in the current expansion cycle many efforts are being made to keep growth under control. While Dow and other companies have delayed plant openings, Amoco Petroleum, Oxy Petrochemicals and others have simply canceled plans to build plants. \"There was an element of poker playing in the plant announcements,\" said Peter Coombes, editor of Chemical Week. \"They frightened each other into not building.\" **********But subduing the chemical industry's expansion cycle might not be easy. Sales are still sufficient to keep plants operating at 80 percent to 90 percent of capacity, well ahead of the nightmare levels of the early 1980's. Big chunks of this production are exported, however, thanks to the weak dollar. And new plants opening in East Asia, Latin America and Europe might soon shrink exports. **********The Mideast crisis has also thrown a monkey wrench into the industry. Many petrochemicals are made from petroleum and rising oil prices are forcing the industry to seek price increases for their chemicals -- not an easy task in a weak economy and a period of oversupply. **********Perhaps more frustrating, petrochemical exports from Kuwait, particularly naphtha going to Japan, have been cut off. So the Japanese are shopping in the United States, competing with Monsanto, for example, for the naphtha that Monsanto buys to make synthetic fibers. **********The upshot is temporary shortages and rising naphtha prices, just when new supplies should be bringing down the price, said R. G. Potter, president of Monsanto Chemical. \"Basically, the Mideast crisis is overwhelming the overcapacity issue,\" he added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/22/world/upheaval-in-the-east-top-spy-flees-to-soviets.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 248, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Top Spy Flees to Soviets", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;   Top Spy Flees to Soviets", "body_text": " **********Markus Wolf, the retired chief of East German intelligence, has taken refuge in the Soviet Union to avoid possible arrest at home in an arms export scandal, a West German newspaper reported today. **********He lived in the Soviet Union for many years and once called it his ''second homeland.''

But in stark contrast to that perception, the 67-year-old company is now betting its life on developing a television technology so advanced that most American manufacturers have shied away from it. **********The product is high-definition television, which by providing twice the resolution of current broadcasts can produce images and sounds of movie quality. HDTV technology is also likely to have applications ranging from medical imaging to computer graphics. It will be ''our Normandy landing'' for establishing a strong position in the electronics markets of the future, said Jerry K. Pearlman, the company's chief executive. **********But many industry analysts question whether Zenith, which pioneered FM stereo in 1961 and stereo sound for television in 1984, will be able to survive as an independent company long enough to reach its latest goal. **********For one thing, HDTV research is extremely expensive, and there is no guarantee that the market will materialize soon or in the way Zenith wants. Large Japanese and European companies, as well as a few American companies, have been racing Zenith to develop a desirable HDTV technology. **********For another, Zenith, the last American manufacturer of television sets and maker of the second-most-popular brand, faces intense competition in its existing markets from aggressive, well-financed international competitors like Philips N. V. and Thomson S. A. Also posing a threat are East Asian companies that Zenith has accused of ''dumping'' television sets in the United States at below-market prices, while keeping their home markets closed. **********All told, Zenith's consumer electronics operations, which are dominated by television sets but also include videocassette recorders and video cameras, have not been profitable since 1984, according to company financial statements. **********What is more, the company can no longer look to its profitable computer business, which it sold last December to the French company Groupe Bull to raise cash when a buyer could not be found for the consumer electronics business. **********''This is a company that doesn't make any profits, that is in an intense battle,'' said Russell L. Leavitt, an analyst with Salomon Brothers. ''Unless HDTV develops sooner than expected, it's not clear that Zenith is particularly well positioned.'' **********To complicate matters, Zenith and Groupe Bull are locked in a $100 million dispute over the purchase price of the computer company. Groupe Bull paid $496 million for the business in December and is now demanding a $49 million refund. Zenith maintains it is owed additional money from Bull, perhaps as much as $50 million. **********The initial proceeds from the sale were used to help reduce Zenith's crushing debt load to $222 million, from $560 million. Zenith, under pressure from its banks, faced a severe cash squeeze last fall. **********But investors, skeptical of Zenith's chances, have dropped the company's stock price to $9.125 from a 52-week high of $21.875. The company's shares are trading at about half of the company's book value, or liquidation value, of $16.73. **********Merger Predicted **********And some analysts are questioning whether Zenith will be able to survive much longer without a partner. ''Somewhere down the pike Zenith will join forces with somebody else,'' predicted David Lachenbruch, editorial director of Television Digest, a newsletter. ''There is a view that they are likely to find a complementary manufacturer and get together in terms of a merger. We don't have a lot of companies that are just in the consumer electronics field.'' **********Mr. Lachenbruch speculated that Zenith might combine with a semiconductor maker or an electronics-components manufacturer to become less dependent on the vicissitudes of the consumer-electronics business. Others said Zenith might align with a multinational company to gain access to markets abroad. But Mr. Pearlman said the company planned to remain independent. **********Many of Zenith's problems are attributable to forces outside the company's control and which are not limited to Zenith. The consumer electronics industry as a whole has not been profitable in the United States for the last two decades. A spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., a division of Thomson S. A., which is owned by the French Government, confirmed that its RCA brand, the market leader, has lost tens of millions of dollars in recent years. **********Critical of Competition **********Zenith, which is based in Glenview, Ill., has argued that a big part of the problem is that Japanese and other foreign competitors have been selling their television sets in the United States at extremely low prices in an attempt to gain market share. **********While the Federal Government has issued anti-dumping orders against foreign manufacturers in some countries, including Japan, new low-price producers operating from Thailand, China, Mexico and Malaysia have kept a steady stream of low-priced imports flowing into the country. (To take advantage of low-cost labor, even Zenith makes a number of its television sets in Mexico.) In the face of the brutal price cutting, other United States manufactures have left the business. **********Zenith is also competing against Philips N. V. of the Netherlands and Thomson, two powerful conglomerates that are investing heavily in their United States television operations. Propelled by the largest adverting budget in the industry, about $25 million, Philips, which owns Magnavox and Sylvania, is on the verge of unseating Zenith for the No. 2 position in the market, said Mr. Lachenbruch of Television Digest. Zenith has trailed the market leader, Thomson's RCA brand, for much of the decade. **********Market Share Shrinks **********In 1989, Zenith controlled 12 percent of the market, down from 18.5 percent in 1983, according to Television Digest. **********Although Zenith's products are regarded as technically sound, the company is plagued by an unfashionable image, many retail consultants and industry analysts say. Rodney Pounders, the assistant manager of a Fretter Inc. consumer electronics store in Chicago, said Zenith television sets, with their bulky wood consoles, ''look like the television sets that Grandpa and Grandma used to have.'' **********''When young people come in to buy a TV, they don't buy Zeniths purely because of the way they look,'' Mr. Pounders said. **********Mr. Pearlman acknowledged that product styling had been a problem but said: ''We have done a lot of work in that area. Our current research shows we are getting sharply improved marks.'' Even in 1989, a rare year in which prices for color television sets actually rose (such sets on average cost less than they did in 1963), Zenith's consumer electronics division posted a loss on continuing operations of $17 million, on sales of $1.5 billion. The company attributed the loss to higher material and labor costs. **********Most analysts think that in 1990 Zenith will essentially break even, posting either a small loss or profit. **********With limited resources, Zenith is trying to focus on a two-pronged plan. It is investing heavily in its flat tension mask, a high-resolution color monitor that provides brilliantly clear pictures, even in the glare of direct sunlight. While the mask was developed as a monitor for computers, the company plans to use it as the picture tube in its HDTV system. **********Zenith has already invested millions in research on the masks and plans to invest $30 million over the next two years to modify a factory to make them in varying sizes for computers and eventually for television screens. **********While the product has potential, ''it's not a company maker,'' said Robert M. Johnson, an analyst with Rotan Mosle Inc., a brokerage firm in Houston. **********The other, more important focus, is on HDTV. Zenith will not say how much it is investing in research -only that it is in the millions. The company's engineers face the complex task of developing a new system to broadcast and receive the high-definition television signals, which contain five times as much information as conventional signals. **********F.C.C. Ruling Helps **********The company's proposed method received a boost when the Federal Communications Commission stipulated that conventional sets must be able to receive HDTV broadcasts. By contrast, the satellite-based systems under design in Europe and Japan would make the current generation of television sets obsolete. **********The F.C.C. is expected to select a transmission system as the standard for this country in 1992. Zenith is betting that its system will be selected, providing the company with lucrative royalties from users of HDTV. Even if Zenith's system is not chosen, the company will be able to sell the high-definition television sets it develops. **********To accelerate its HDTV work, Zenith teamed last summer with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in a $24 million research agreement. A.T.&T. is working on the integrated circuitry for a prototype system. **********But Zenith faces serious competition in its HDTV work. A Government-backed effort in Japan includes broadcasters and major electronics companies. This group, which is thought to have the lead, has invested 10 years and $900 million in developing a system, and began daily test broadcasts in Japan last summer. **********European Effort **********A European research consortium financed by Western European governments, with the research being conducted by companies like Philips, Thomson, Bosch and the British Broadcasting Corporation, is developing its own HDTV standard. The consortium plans to have a system ready in time to broadcast the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. **********Philips and Thomson are also working on a standard in the United States, where they have teamed up with NBC to develop an HDTV system that meets Federal requirements. **********Within the industry, there is a wide divergence of views over how soon HDTV will be commercially viable. Last month, a senior vice president of Thomson Consumer Electronics, Joseph Donahue, said HDTV would not be a money maker until 2005. **********''That is nonsense,'' Mr. Pearlman said. ''If the process keeps moving, we think HDTV is a 1993 consumer electronics product. The widespread view that HDTV isn't coming is only being tossed about by those people who have no system to propose.'' **********Mr. Pearlman has been critical of the Government for providing far less financing for HDTV research than have the Japanese or European governments."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/10/business/manville-plan-urged-by-judge.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1990-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Manville Plan Urged By Judge", "print_headline": "Manville Plan Urged By Judge", "body_text": " **********A Federal judge took the first steps yesterday toward consolidating hundreds of thousands of asbestos cases from around the nation into one large class action before him, in what he described as an effort to control the enormous legal costs. **********At a hearing in Brooklyn, Federal District Judge Jack B. Weinstein urged lawyers for scores of defendants and tens of thousands of plaintiffs to agree upon establishing of a class-action lawsuit to achieve ''peace in the national legal war over asbestos.'' **********He indicated that if they did not reach an agreement, he was likely to try to impose it upon them. **********A 'Wasteful' War **********Reaching beyond the more than 500 Brooklyn Navy Yard asbestos cases that are being heard before him, Judge Weinstein said a national solution was required to resolve ''this wasteful, inefficient war over asbestos.'' Asbestos-related cases form the greatest number of personal-injury lawsuits in the nation's state and Federal courts, and are crowding dockets in many jurisdictions. **********The judge's moves toward consolidation are expected to be opposed by the plaintiffs' lawyers, some of whom have reaped enormous fees in individual cases. Nonetheless, if he succeeds, the effect of Judge Weinstein's maneuvering could be to cut back the legal fees substantially and to get some funds to plaintiffs who are now being given i.o.u.'s. **********The sizable legal fees have substantially depleted the trust set up by the Manville Corporation. The trust, which assumes all legal liability from the corporation's asbestos production, enabled it to arise from bankruptcy two years ago. **********In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Manville's shares were unchanged at $6.75 each. **********Mismanagement Is Charged **********Several lawyers for plaintiffs and other asbestos defendants have said that the trust is a casualty of mismanagement, of poor planning and of lack of oversight by the bankruptcy judge who set it up two years ago, who had also been warned repeatedly about its decline. **********Originally conceived as a vehicle for keeping court costs down by settling cases promptly, the trust is now a defendant in 90,000 cases before 500 state courts in 374 jurisdictions and in all 96 Federal courts. **********As a first step toward overhauling the deteriorating trust, Judge Weinstein yesterday issued an order effectively freezing it from spending any additional money in settlements or legal expenses. **********For most of the last 50 years, the Manville, based in Denver, was the nation's largest producer of asbestos, a white, flaky, fire-retardant substance once widely used in construction and as insulation. It was later identified as carcinogenic. **********The trust has effectively run out of cash, spending $974 million in settling the first 22,000 cases at an average of $43,509 a claim, well above the trust's architects' projections of $25,000 a claim. It is now facing more than 130,000 claims, and expects no new funds until the final quarter of 1991. **********The trust's problems have forced it to offer a payout proposal to asbestos victims under which tens of thousands are to receive nothing until well into the next century. Many of these victims are elderly and have fatal or serious diseases, including lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, an often fatal tumor of the lung. **********New Basis of Payment **********Under the trust's existing structure, payments were made based on filing order, rather than on the nature of the disease or the victim's need. Judge Weinstein said yesterday that he would instead take into account the severity of the injury and means of the victim. **********''Those workers and their families who were most seriously injured must secure compensation immediately,'' the judge said. He said he would order the establishment of a structured compensation plan, like workers' compensation. **********The judge told a lawyer for the trust at the hearing that it must operate ''on equal-protection grounds.'' **********''You're practically a quasi-governmental entity,'' Judge Weinstein said. ''These are cases that affect a substantial number of workers across the country.'' **********The judge said he would soon meet privately with Dr. Irving Selikoff, a leading medical scientist in asbestos-related diseases, to ascertain his estimates of asbestos claims. Asbetsos diseases often take decades to become apparent. As a result, Judge Weinstein said he would establish a national registry for potential victims and a system of medical monitoring. **********The trust's general counsel, David Austern, declined to comment yesterday on the judge's actions, saying he would have to take it up with the trustees before deciding what course the trust would pursue. **********Judge Weinstein has lined up a lawyer to serve as a court-appointed special master once he approves a class action. He has also told an analyst from the Rand Corporation, Mark Peterson, to begin work on devising a complex mathematical matrix to be used as basis for compensating victims. Mr. Peterson is expected to be attending the meeting between Judge Weinstein and Dr. Selikoff. **********Judge Weinstein is hearing the Brooklyn Navy Yard cases with Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court. Last month, the judges in effect reopened Manville's bankruptcy proceeding by ordering the original bankruptcy judge who approved the trust, Burton R. Lifland, to revamp it. Judge Lifland, in turn, gave the task to Leon Silverman, a partner at the New York law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, who helped organize the trust. **********Some Meetings Held **********At the hearing yesterday, Mr. Silverman said he had begun meeting with the lawyers for the plaintiffs, defendants and had explored ''realistic options.'' **********He added that the trust's problems reflect a ''broad national problem that is becoming increasingly acute.'' Mr. Silverman did not provide precise details on how the trust would resolve its financial plight. But Judge Weinstein said refinancing could be accomplished through loans or advances from the corporation, or by selling some or all of Manville's stock now in the trust's portfolio. **********The trust's assets include the equivalent of an 80 percent interest in Manville, but the stock cannot be sold unless certain conditions are satisfied. Earlier efforts to sell Manville stock and an effort by the corporation to buy some back have failed. **********People involved in the case said Mr. Silverman told Judge Weinstein privately last week that he intended to support a class-action suit to help resolve the trust's predicament. The judge gave Mr. Silverman until Aug. 6 to devise a restructuring."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/business/the-media-business-advertising-2d-account-back-at-waring.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 245, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   2d Account Back at Waring", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;   2d Account Back at Waring", "body_text": " **********''Who says you can't go home again?'' a pleased Saul Waring, president of Waring & LaRosa, asked yesterday. **********Six weeks ago, Perrier returned its advertising account to the Waring agency after four years with Hal Riney & Partners.

But even though his agency, Avrett, Free & Ginsberg, has resisted the acquisition offers that flow to small, successful package-goods agencies like congratulatory telegrams to newlyweds, Mr. Avrett and his colleagues have found another way to grow: Concord International. **********Concord is one of several networks of advertising agencies from around the world that share creative and marketing philosophies but not ownership. These networks, based in Europe, act as matchmakers, referring one member agency's client to a member in another country, and allowing members to seek clients that may need international service the individual agency could not supply. **********''The whole philosophy is that we can lead clients into new markets through agencies of quality and independence,'' said Stuart Grau, Avrett's vice president and director of new business development. **********Avrett (the ''a'' is long, as in agency) has already benefited, albeit mildly, from its recent decision to join Concord. It has been invited into two agency reviews, for an Italian gourmet-food company and for a European textile manufacturer. Each client wants to expand its marketing into the United States. **********For advertisers, the affiliate network concept allows the creation of global brands that ''have a common identity in every market'' and require ''consistent branding and communications'' to appeal to international consumers, as the network's literature states. While this is a rationale behind the formation of the large multinational marketing communications conglomerates in recent years, ''Concord is for clients who like smaller agencies and entrepreneurs,'' said Mr. Avrett, his agency's chairman. **********In addition to Avrett, Concord's members include agencies in Belgium, France, West Germany, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. **********Since its birth 19 years ago, Avrett has been known for slowly pushing the boundaries of packaged-goods advertising, gently drawing marketers of over-the-counter drugs and pet foods away from their traditional reliance on copy toward more visually exciting television ads. ''We've placed an enormous concentration on visual impact in categories not accustomed to it,'' said Frank Ginsberg, the agency's president and creative director. **********Even though the agency does a lot of copy-testing, Mr. Ginsberg says frankly that such research does not work and foresees less use of it on behalf of packaged-goods advertisers in coming years. **********For years, Avrett was known as the ''chow, chow, chow'' agency, after its 1973-74 commercials for Purina Cat Chow that helped popularize anthropomorphic animals as a marketing device. **********Mr. Ginsberg also claims credit for introducing the pop music of the 1950's and 60's to mainstream advertising, with the agency's 1975 campaign for Nair depilatories that featured the tune ''Who Wears Short Shorts?'' **********More recently, the 100-person agency, which bills about $130 million annually, tried an unusual tack with its ads for Del Webb's Claridge Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. Eschewing the glitz and glamour of most casino advertising, Avrett shot a quiet black-and-white commercial with an actor playing a high roller explaining why he prefers the Claridge. **********''We turned their problems into strengths,'' Mr. Avrett said.

The sponsor is offering a \"use and occupancy fee program\" to fill 100 vacant apartments in the 24-story building, called Executive House on Prospect Street. **********The development is on a prime residential strip in this city of 85,000 residents, 13 miles from the Lincoln Tunnel. The condominium is owned by Executive House Associates, a team of investors from New York, Boston, Connecticut and London. They also did the converting. **********The partners bought the structure, built in 1965, nearly two years ago and invested $3.5 million in renovations. They installed new air-conditioning systems and improved amenities, including a swimming pool and two tennis courts. There is a range of apartment types, from studios to three-bedroom units. Typical prices for vacant one-bedroom apartments range from $70,000 to $90,000, and for two-bedroom units from $105,000 to $110,000. **********Under the program, buyers contract to occupy an apartment for one year on a leased basis at a monthly cost equivalent to the market rent. Half of this so-called occupancy fee is returned to purchasers to put toward a down payment on the units, selling from $57,500 to $139,750, if they decide to buy by the end of the year. Otherwise buyers may extend the contract, or continue to lease the unit and forfeit the rebate. **********The cost of the units, most of which have terraces, is locked in when the contract is signed, but would be lowered if prices fall, Mr. Lieberman said. That price includes a space in an 260-car garage. The monthly maintenance fees range from $159 to $420, excluding utilities. Units are refurbished with new kitchens and baths once a buyer receives a mortgage commitment. **********The occupancy fee -- which includes monthly maintenance -- ranges from $575 for a studio to $1,350 for a three-bedroom apartment. These fees are comparable to the rents paid by many tenants in the 127 renter-occupied apartments, which are rent-controlled. Under New Jersey law, renters who do not choose to buy are entitled to lease renewals for three years after conversion. The elderly and disabled have unlimited renewal rights. **********Barry Lieberman, one of the investors, said the intent was \"to provide a way for purchasers to get half their down payment and an incentive for them to close on their units.\" He said failure by a renter-occupant to buy would not necessarily mean that a rental lease would not be renewed. **********On a $90,000 one-bedroom unit, for instance, the average monthly occupancy fee of $850 would generate $5,100 toward a down payment, Mr. Lieberman said. **********Sponsors hope such promotions will lead to sales in a weak market that has hurt entry-level housing most. **********\"The condominium market in New Jersey is still sliding into the abyss and there is no real improvement expected through 1991,\" said James W. Hughes, chairman of the Department of Urban Policy and Planning at Rutgers. Changes in the tax laws, tightened financing and an uncertain economic climate also took a toll. **********The East Orange area has a stockpile of condominiums in all price ranges, said Sandy Nash, manager of the Livingston office of Weichert Realtors. Prices have declined 10 percent over the last year, she said, noting that the average selling price for a two-bedroom condominium is now $105,000. **********While programs like the one at Executive House are viewed as an effective marketing tool, they are not being used at every conversion. For the concept to work, said Dr. Hughes, there should be a wide enough margin between what the sponsor paid for the unit and its market price and a sufficient rental income from the building. \"Sponsors also need deep pockets and the staying power to wait a year for units to be sold,\" he said. **********The program's success also depends on whether the buyer is able to secure a mortgage. For their part, sponsors should have a financing package with an approved lender available to buyers, said Elliot R. Jacobs, president of the Home Investors Mortgage Corporation of Hackensack, N.J., a subsidiary of Constellation Bancorp, a bank holding company. Mr. Lieberman said he and his partners expected to have financing in place before the year ends. He said 32 contracts had been signed since the program began in September. **********Dexter Humphrey, an electrical engineer for Bell Labortories in Murray Hill, N.J., rents an apartment elsewhere in East Orange, and is taking advantage of the program to buy a two-bedroom unit. \"It is giving us the necessary time and money to achieve homeownership,\" Mr. Dexter said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/18/world/upheaval-in-the-east-romania-romanian-leaders-courting-military.html": {"writer_name": "John Kifner", "pub_date": "1990-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 736, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Romania;   ROMANIAN LEADERS COURTING MILITARY", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Romania;   ROMANIAN LEADERS COURTING MILITARY", "body_text": " **********The provisional Government's abrupt dismissal of Defense Minister Nicolae Militaru on Friday after days of protests by army officers is the latest step in its troubled quest for post-revolutionary credibility. **********Demonstrations are almost a daily affair here now, nearly two months after the downfall of the dictatorship of President Nicolae Ceausescu. **********Protesters are demanding more pay for truck drivers, objective news reports on television, an end to Communism, and, above all, the rooting out of the secret police apparatus, the Securitate. Yet even when the slogans are angry, the crowds seem good-natured, enjoying and testing their new freedom. **********Perhaps the most startling protest came this week, when scores of uniformed officers from the army and air force staged what was in effect a four-day sit-in at the seat of Government, the Foreign Ministry building on Victory Square. The protesters, supported by hundreds of other officers and many more students and civilians, demanded the ouster of General Militaru and the Minister of Internal Security, Gen. Mihai Chitac.  Tense Talks Are Shown on TV Romanian television, a focus of political conflict in its own right, finally broadcast scenes of the officers meeting with a Government representative, Vice President Gelu Voican Voiculescu, hammering on the table as they made their points. **********The protest was the Government's most serious challenge to date, for the military played a crucial role in the earliest hours of the revolution, and its alienation could be a major threat. **********The soldiers' refusal in December to fire on protesting students caused Mr. Ceausescu to flee within hours. They also secured the revolution by battling the diehard security police and executing the dictator and his wife, Elena, after a cursory military trial. **********For the army officers, the immediate issue is the second-class status they suffered under Mr. Ceausescu. The late dictator had funneled most of the money and the most sophisticated arms and equipment to the Securitate, his own elite President Guard and the anti-terrorist unit that fought to quash the rebellion. **********Diplomats said that although military service was universal, the army was used mostly for conscript labor, harvesting potatoes, building roads and digging canals. A lack of training and discipline was obvious in the streets during the revolution, as soldiers fired off rifle volleys and barrages of tank fire, ripping the tops off buildings at the slightest perceived threat. **********A Search for Untainted Generals **********The army protesters, mostly junior officers including a few colonels, contended this week that General Militaru, who was brought back from retirement at the age of 73, was too old and too much a part of the old regime. Their list of demands said he had created ''a state of tension in the army.'' **********His successor, Lieut. Gen. Anastase Stanculescu, was on a list of approved candidates suggested by the protesters. But General Stanculescu, who served as First Deputy Defense Minister under the old regime, is another example of the provisional leadership's difficulty in finding leaders untouched by Romania's dark past. **********Appearing today before about 200 officers assembled in the ornate Parliament building, President Ion Iliescu said that General Stanculescu ''has prestige in the army and is appreciated by its command.'' He said General Militaru had failed to establish ''real communication with the army's command'' and ''aggravated the situation to a point where it became a source of tension in the whole society.'' **********But indicating the political difficulties that he and the Government face, Mr. Iliescu also complained of ''an atmosphere of terror and distrust, inherited from the dictatorial regime.'' **********No Word on Security Minister **********There was no immediate word on the future of the Internal Security Minister, General Chitac, who has been accused by insurgent officers of ordering troops to fire on demonstrators in Timisoara in the first days of protests preceding the revolution. Under the agreement that ended the officers' sit-in, a Government investigation on the army's role during the revolution is supposed to be completed in two weeks. **********But the Government appeared to be mounting a defense of General Chitac, with a report on state television saying that he had avoided using chemical grenades in Timisoara."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/10/business/finance-new-issues-new-sallie-mae-note-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 142, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  New Sallie Mae Note Offering", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   New Sallie Mae Note Offering", "body_text": " **********The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, yesterday priced $650 million in floating-rate notes due April 11, 1991, at a price of par to yield 45 basis points more than the 91-day Treasury equivalent yield.

Bankers also said yesterday that there was some discussion of lending Mr. Trump a little more than $60 million, but that no decisions were made. **********''Once these big banks agree in principle again, the task will become convincing the foreign banks again to go along,'' a banker said. ''If the foreign banks do not go along - particularly those in the Citibank and Chase syndicates - we still do not have a deal.'' **********The banker also said there was pressure in the meeting to get the agreement done by tomorrow or Thursday, in time to give Mr. Trump the money to make a $43 million payment due to his bondholders next Tuesday. The meetings are now expected to go around the clock and, those involved said, the attention will shift to the Japanese members of the syndicate. **********Guaranteed Loans **********Bank officials and attorneys also said the amount of personally guaranteed loans that Mr. Trump got from the banks was around $400 million. The bankers and attorneys asserted that the largest share of these personally guaranteed loans was from Bankers Trust and totaled $140 million. They also said Citibank had made more than $100 million of such loans to the developer. **********Mr. Trump, who on Friday failed to make payments to banks and bondholders, faces a cash squeeze that could push his real estate and gambling empire into bankruptcy. He is in technical default on about $352 million of bonds used to finance one of his Atlantic City casinos, but has a 10-day grace period in which to make payment to bondholders and avoid an actual default. According to First Fidelity Bancorp, the retiring trustee on the bonds, the 10-day grace period will expire at midnight next Tuesday. **********Bankers involved in the talks with representatives of the Trump Organization also denied a report that the developer was threatening some of the banks with the possibility that he might file for bankruptcy protection. **********''He has been very professional about the whole thing,'' the banker said. ''In fact, he has been very nice about it because there is no benefit to him either if he goes into bankruptcy, because it would destroy his name.'' **********The meetings of bankers are generally run by Joseph Manganello, executive vice president and chief credit officer at Bankers Trust. Mr. Manganello, who directs Bankers Trust's major ''workouts,'' or attempts to salvage troubled assets, is in charge of the ''offering sheet,'' which is the list of terms that the bankers debate for hours at a time. **********According to several people in the meetings, which include at least two representatives from each of six banks, Mr. Manganello runs the offering sheet chiefly because Bankers Trust, along with Citibank, is one of the banks with the largest loan exposures to Mr. Trump and it would be contributing a major portion of the proposed loan package. **********Bonds related to Mr. Trump's casinos were slightly lower or steady yesterday in thin trading. Trump's Castle bonds that mature in 1997 and carry a 13 3/4 percent interest rate were at about $55 for each $100 of face value, down about $4 since Friday. Bonds associated with the Taj Mahal traded about $53, holding fairly steady since Friday, and the bonds of Trump Plaza traded at about $84, also largely unchanged."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/25/business/company-news-support-sought-by-ual-pilots.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 258, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Support Sought By UAL Pilots", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Support Sought By UAL Pilots", "body_text": " **********United Airlines pilots, struggling to complete a proposed $4.4 billion buyout of the carrier, today accused the chairman of the UAL Corporation, Stephen M.

In the process, it sold 13 billion bananas, about a third of the world's supply of the fruit. Bananas are by far the world's most popular fruit. **********Now emboldened, the company is beginning to spread the Chiquita name to other fruits and packaged goods and to push into new markets, particularly Eastern Europe. **********Keith Lindner said his company's first big target would be the Dole Food Company, the world's No. 2 banana producer, behind Chiquita. **********''We would like to buy the company,'' Mr. Lindner said. ''We will be a very competitive bidder on that.'' He said that when formal bidding started, probably this month, Dole would probably fetch $1.6 billion to $2.5 billion and that Chiquita would probably bid on the low end of that range. Dole's parent corporation, Castle & Cooke Inc., said it was considering selling Dole to concentrate on the real estate business, but would not say when it would actually accept bids. **********The Lindners' path in pushing Chiquita to where it is now was not entirely smooth. They broke up the United Brands conglomerate, selling $150 million worth of operations, ranging from a feed business to a telecommunications company. **********Efforts to make the meatpacking operations of Chiquita's John Morrell & Company unit more profitable led to a series of bitter clashes with union meatpackers. **********In 1989, the National Labor Relations Board contended that Morrell had illegally tried to circumvent union contracts by closing two meatpacking plants and reopening them with lower-paid workers. **********Keith Lindner attributes the labor problems and allegations of safety lapses to former management. The plants in question were closed in 1982 and 1983, before the Lindners had a controlling interest. **********Founded in 1899 **********Founded in 1899 as the United Fruit Company, it changed its name in March to Chiquita, its foremost brand name, and the corporate headquarters were moved to Cincinnati. **********Before the Lindners took over, the company was known nearly as well for its links to a coup and payments of bribes in Central American countries, where it grows most of its bananas, as for its fruit. Later a failed diversification effort and mismanagement of the company's banana empire took it to the verge of bankruptcy. **********While the company has since benefited from a long rise in demand for bananas and the consequent higher prices, management, especially Keith Lindner, has received high marks. **********''Efficient and modern distribution is the key to success for Chiquita,'' said Timothy S. Ramey, an analyst at County NatWest USA. He said the company had improved its profit margins by careful management of its shipping costs, for instance. **********People eat more bananas than any other fruit, Chiquita and food-industry analysts say. The Agriculture Department said per capita consumption of bananas in the United States in 1988 was 24 pounds out of a total per capita fruit consumption of 97 pounds. Apples were No. 2 in the United States, with under 20 pounds consumed per person. **********Still, some analysts warn that it is just a matter of time before a down cycle begins. Bananas are highly perishable, leaving producers with little room to manipulate supply and shape prices. And, while prices are strong now, high prices typically result in increased production, which eventually causes prices to plummet. **********For that reason, Michael Kennedy, an analyst with IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis, said he was avoiding Chiquita stock. ''I know what the ending is,'' he said. ''I just don't know how many chapters are in the book.'' **********Keith Lindner, 31 years old, acknowledged banana prices were volatile but maintained that much of the volatility was from quarter to quarter. **********More Stock Issued **********In May, Chiquita completed a 6.1-million-share secondary offering at $20.125 a share. Since then, more Wall Street analysts have begun following the company, and many have issued buy recommendations. The Lindner family still controls about 63 percent of Chiquita and plans to maintain a controlling interest. **********Earlier this year, the stock reached a high of $29.75, before falling along with the turbulent market. [Chiquita gained $1 Monday, closing at $25.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.]  Well Positioned While many companies are talking about exploiting Eastern Europe's newly opened markets, Chiquita already enjoys 43 percent of Western Europe's banana trade and is in an unusually strong position to profit immediately from the opening of new markets. **********In the United States, Chiquita has just begun placing the Chiquita name on a growing number of products like kiwis, melons and pineapples. Fresh fruit represents 45 percent of the Chiquita's sales and more than 90 percent of operating profits. **********The company is also marketing packaged goods like Chiquita Caribbean Splash, a blended juice that is being introduced nationally this year. **********The company's prepared foods division, mostly meats and packaged goods, accounted for 54.6 percent of sales in 1989 but only 7 percent of profits. Banana sales bring in 60 percent of the company's profits. **********The company intends to push its meat group, including John Morrell, harder. It also sells meats under the brand names Rath Black Hawk, Partridge and Scott Petersen. The meat group also makes and sells Nathan's Famous hot dogs under license from Nathan's Famous Inc. **********Some analysts said they were surprised at Chiquita's plan to bid for Dole because of potential antitrust problems. But Mr. Lindner said that would not be an issue if Chiquita agreed to sell Dole's North America banana business. **********Even with no bananas, Dole would be a major presence in the international fruit business. It is one of the leading suppliers of pineapples, grapes, lemons, strawberries and many other fruits and vegetables. **********Move Into Packaged Goods **********Chiquita is also using joint ventures with General Mills Inc. and the Beech-Nut Nutrition Corporation. And the company is introducing pouched fruit purees for use in home baking. **********An earlier attempt to put the Chiquita name on something other than a banana skin failed. In 1987, the company stopped selling its frozen juice bar, which it had introduced in 1985. Faced with fierce competition and costly marketing, the company lost about $50 million on the venture, analysts estimate. **********Carl H. Lindner, the family's secretive patriarch, was once regarded as one of the country's most savvy investors. Operating through his family-owned American Financial Corporation, he has built a far-reaching billion-dollar empire with holdings ranging from insurance to communications. In October 1989, Forbes magazine estimated Mr. Lindner's fortune at $830 million. **********But twice in the 1970's, he ran afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission when it charged him with fraud and stock manipulation. Mr. Lindner settled all the charges without admitting or denying guilt. **********In the case of Chiquita, the Lindners took over a company with a sullied reputation. In 1954, United Fruit hired a public relations strategist to create favorable public opinion in Guatemala for support of a C.I.A.-led coup against a President who favored land reform. **********In 1975, the company's chairman, Eli Black, leapt to his death from his office in the Pan Am Building in Manhattan a few months before it was disclosed that the company had bribed senior Government officials in Honduras. **********Labor Unrest Is Common **********Panama and Honduras are Chiquita's two most important sources of bananas, supplying more than 50 percent of the company's bananas. Colombia, the Philippines, Ecuador, Costa Rica and Guatemala also grow Chiquita bananas. About half of the bananas Chiquita sells are grown by the company, the rest are purchased under contract from suppliers. **********Chiquita regularly faces strikes by its Central American pickers. Just last month, the Honduran military was sent in to break a 40-day strike by Chiquita pickers seeking higher wages. Keith Lindner said strikes were simply a fact of life in the banana business. **********Analysts said Keith Lindner takes a different view of things than his father. For one thing, Chiquita has a more conservative balance sheet than other Lindner properties. He is also more open with the shareholders and analysts. Keith Lindner said he had to persuade his father to go forward with the secondary offering, saying, ''He doesn't like to sell anything.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/08/business/company-news-stock-plan-announced-by-playboy.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 439, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Stock Plan Announced By Playboy", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS;   Stock Plan Announced By Playboy", "body_text": " **********Playboy Enterprises Inc. announced a recapitalization plan today aimed at helping the company finance acquisitions and other activities without diluting the controlling stake of its founder, Hugh Hefner. **********The recapitalization, subject to shareholder approval, would establish two classes of common stock, including a new class of nonvoting stock.

He said he expected the upcoming national congress to change the party's name to ''Party of Labor and Democratic Socialism.'' **********He said the party rejected such hallowed points of doctrine as the dictatorship of the proletariat. ''I feel we must deal with reality,'' he said.

''Steel demand was particularly strong in early 1989,'' Mr. Williams said. ''And the lower shipments in the first quarter of 1990 resulted from weaker demand,'' primarily from the construction and automotive markets.''

The dispute adds further confusion to Housing Minister Ariel Sharon's statement on Sunday night that the migrants would not be settled in occupied land. **********Immigration officials said they had been notified of no policy change. They said Soviet immigrants who chose to live in the West Bank or Gaza Strip would still be permitted to move there and would be given Government money to subsidize living expenses, just as if the immigrant had chosen to live inside Israel. **********On Sunday night, Mr. Sharon, a longtime and ardent proponent of increased Jewish settlement, said that ''due to the problems we have,'' immigrants would not be settled in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. ''We will not send any Jew who comes from Russia to Judea, Samaria or to Gaza because we understand the seriousness of the situation,'' he said, using the biblical names for the West Bank. **********Ministerial Divisions **********His statement took the nation by surprise. Still, Mr. Sharon, who is chairman of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Immigrant Absorption, has declined to elaborate. Because Israeli ministries are essentially individual fiefs, officials from other offices would not speculate on what Mr. Sharon's statement meant. **********Today, however, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai, a longtime political ally of Mr. Sharon, told reporters, ''If the Russians make it a condition that they don't want Russian Jewry to settle because of their political considerations and interests, we will abide by it because we want Russian Jewry here at any cost and under any circumstances.'' **********But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has spent much of the last year fending off political challenges from Mr. Sharon and Mr. Modai, said Mr. Sharon's remarks were nothing new. **********''That was my opinion even before Sharon's statement,'' he was quoted as telling the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Monday. ''It's the same policy.'' **********As if to underscore that, the Prime Minister's office disclosed that Mr. Shamir had sent a cable to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union weeks ago, making a similar pledge. **********Sharon-Shamir Dispute **********This afternoon the Prime Minister told the Israeli radio: ''Of course he said that nobody will be sent by us to certain territories and to certain locations. But everybody in a democratic society has the right to settle wherever he wishes.'' **********The apparent conflict suggests that even before Mr. Shamir's new Government has finished its first month, the wary alliance between political enemies, Mr. Sharon and Mr. Shamir, may already be wearing thin. Mr. Sharon has made no secret that he wants Mr. Shamir's job. **********As for the Soviet immigrants, at the Absorption Ministry, Jewish Agency, Prime Minister's office, Finance Ministry and other agencies holding some responsibility for settling Soviet Jewish immigrants, officials said they had received no new directives. **********''I don't know of any change,'' said Ida Ben-Shitrit, an Absorption Ministry official. ''If a Soviet immigrant wants to go to a kibbutz, he will get money to go to a kibbutz. If he wants to go to Ariel,'' a West Bank settlement, ''he will go to Ariel. **********''He will not be stopped,'' she added, ''but we will not send him.'' **********For several months, Israeli officials, trying to assuage Soviet and American concerns, have been saying that it is not Israeli policy to direct Soviet immigrants to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And in fact only a tiny number have chosen to move there. About 4,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants have moved to East Jerusalem, which was part of the West Bank until Israel annexed it in 1967 and which Israelis consider part of Israel. **********'Modest but Significant' **********Senior immigration officials explained that behind all the debate and dispute was what one called a ''modest but significant'' policy change. They explained it this way: **********Before, Israel made no attempt to direct immigrants to any particular place. But under Mr. Sharon's new policy, Israel will actively encourage Soviet immigrants to move to the Negev, Galilee, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv or other points inside Israel. All new immigrant housing will be built inside Israel; none will be built in the West Bank or Gaza. **********But if an immigrant chooses to move to the West Bank, the Government will not stand in his way and will give him the subsidies and other benefits given to those who live inside Israel. **********Once an immigrant or anyone else chooses to make a permanent home in the territories, the immigrant receives Government benefits that exceed any given to other Israelis, with the possible exception of those who live in the most remote villages and small towns."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/13/world/hong-kong-calls-china-talks-useful-but-sees-no-progress.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 683, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hong Kong Calls China Talks Useful but Sees No Progress", "print_headline": "Hong Kong Calls China Talks Useful but Sees No Progress", "body_text": " **********The Governor of Hong Kong said today that his three days of talks with Chinese officials had been useful, but neither side reported major progress in easing tensions between Hong Kong and Beijing. **********There was no sign of new conciliation on the Chinese side to accompany the lifting of martial law, which took effect on Thursday.

It is filled with symbols of liberation, some universal, like whirling dancers, and some very American, like an office meeting. Not surprisingly, the spot is bathed in light - a metaphor for freedom and, not incidentally, a G.E. product. **********Five years ago, American advertisers routinely ridiculed the cultural and economic poverty of Communism. The ''Russian Fashion Show,'' a commercial for the Wendy's hamburger chain, was a parody of the Paris couture, with beefy babushkas in identical gray sack suits substituting for slender models. **********But last year, as the Soviet Union's policies of political openness began to affect the nation's allies, American companies started to flirt with advertising images of the East bloc that were by turns heroic, romantic and familial. BBDO has specialized in these ads; it has done two for Pepsi-Cola, one promoting Soviet-American friendship and another underscoring the notion that Russians are just like Americans. **********BBDO's G.E. commercial, which is to make its debut Sunday morning on several public affairs programs, represents a new wave of pro-Eastern advertising, filmed on location and serving as a witness to the opening of Eastern Europe. It is the second quasi documentary to promote a venture by an American company in the East bloc. Several weeks ago, the McDonald's Corporation released an advertisement about the opening of the company's first restaurant in Moscow. **********Celebration is the theme of G.E.'s new commercial, entitled ''Hungarian Rhapsody.'' ''The last 20 years, there've been so many down moves in the world,'' said Ted Sann, executive creative director of BBDO New York, ''this is a chance to reverse it.'' **********The commercial's goal, however, has a harder edge. As explained by Barbara J. Parsky, G.E.'s manager of corporate advertising, the spot is aimed primarily at the financial community, to showcase G.E.'s aggressive global expansion. The campaign illustrates G.E.'s $150 million acquisition in November of half of the Tungsram Company Ltd., Hungary's largest light-bulb maker. **********The spot opens in fading sunlight, as the camera sweeps over the Danube River separating Buda and Pest, the Hungarian capital's two principal districts. As the strains of a ''Hungarian Rhapsody'' by Liszt gradually build, a young man says in accented English: ''Freedom's all that matters. Freedom is everything.'' **********As the sun sinks, the camera zips between scenes of people lighting candles and smiling. ''There's a new light shining over Eastern Europe,'' says the announcer, who proceeds to explain briefly the G.E.-Tungsram arrangement. **********More Hungarians are seen: working in their offices, meeting in the Tungsram factory, congregating in groups, marching over a bridge. Their faces glow. ''Everything is changing,'' one woman says. Another adds, ''I'm so happy.'' The candles reappear, but they are increasingly interspersed with electric lights switching on, illuminating museums, monuments, a ballet and a waltz party. **********The camera freezes on a little girl lighting one last candle as the company's 11-year-old corporate slogan appears on screen: ''G.E. We bring good things to life.'' **********The company could not bring every good thing to light. Its advertising agency had hoped to film the lighting of the Hungarian Parliament. But the building is lighted only when Parliament is in session. **********''They would have had to vote on it,'' said Al Merrin, the BBDO senior creative director for the project.

''He is courageous. He wants all Arabs to be equal. He wants to give the money of the rich Arabs to the poor Arabs. The emirs gave us nothing.'' **********A 62-year-old Tunisian, who boasted that he had traveled the world, felt little differently when the subject came up. ''Kuwait is not important,'' he announced in fluent French. ''It is part of Iraq. It is not worth a war. The United States has no right to intervene.'' **********A Muslim Opposition **********For President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, though, the gulf crisis has proved less straightforward. Tunisia has long benefited from being a friend of the United States and its economy is enormously dependent on trade with Western Europe and the remittances of 250,000 Tunisians living in France. **********The strongest opposition to his three-year-old Government comes from the Islamic Renaissance Movement, known as Nahda, which gained ground in the 1980's in reaction to the Westernization of Tunisia that was tasking place under his predecessor, Habib Bourguiba. **********And since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it is the Arab voice of Tunisia that has been raised on the streets. ''What you hear is the fruit of the accumulated frustration of the Arab world,'' a Government official said. ''The Western response has turned Saddam into a political and religious hero.'' **********In preparing his own response, Mr. Ben Ali has therefore measured the risks of a domestic Islamic backlash against the dangers of Western reprisals. And he has chosen a policy that balances strict adherence to United Nations resolutions on a trade embargo with public disapproval of the Western military buildup. **********Keeping the Peace at Home **********In his only major speech on the subject to date, he criticized American troop deployments more than the Iraqi invasion. He boycotted an Arab League summit meeting, creating the impression that he was trying to avoid condemning Baghdad. He has also promoted a so-called Arab solution to the crisis, urging Saudi and Kuwait leaders to be patient and reminding Western visitors of the need to appease Arab public opinion. **********But his main priority has been to maintain peace at home. And in this, he has been successful. Tunisian officials say experience shows that any American attack on Iraq would result in angry protests here, but to date there have been only demonstrations against the American presence in the gulf, organized by the Government party as part of what officials call their ''management'' of the crisis. **********Diplomats looking to explain Tunisian grass-roots support for Iraq recognize the impact of President Hussein's televised messages. With a strong appeal to Arab nationalism, their exploitation of envy of rich Saudis and Kuwaitis and their defiance of the United States and Israel, they have been well received throughout the Arab world. **********But in Tunisia, many political experts go further, noting that pro-Iraqi sentiments also reflect the population's strong desire to reassert its Arab identity and Muslim traditions after 30 years in which both were suppressed as part of the Bourguiba Government's drive to modernize Tunisia. **********Reversal of Policies **********Under Mr. Bourguiba, not only was French preferred over Arabic as the language of Government, but he also banned prayers on television, ordered Tunisians to work all of Friday, denied the mullahs the right to decide holy days and had his police persecute leading members of the Islamic movement. **********After Mr. Ben Ali seized power in November 1987, however, these policies were reversed, with the new President displaying his Muslim colors by visiting holy places in Saudi Arabia on his first trip abroad. **********When he visited France on his next trip, he then surprised his hosts by speaking publicly in Arabic. **********While stressing that he is the Muslim leader of a Muslim country, though, his own version of Islam is far from fundamentalist. He continues to encourage emancipation of women, he is building a Western-style market economy and to this day this country remains one of the most cosmopolitan in the Arab world, visited by two million foreign tourists a year. **********When he met leaders of the Islamic Renaissance Party to encourage them to take part in a more open political system, however, he refused them the right to identify themselves as a Muslim party. ''My party is also Muslim,'' he reportedly told them.

It was the first time since the Vietnam War that a soldier was charged with murder in a combat situation. **********The soldier who was charged, First Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, 42 years old, is a Panamanian-born member of the 82d Airborne Division with more than 19 years of Army service. **********The Pentagon had portrayed the December invasion as a model of discipline, in which soldiers took great care to protect civilians and to capture Panamanian soldiers alive. **********Sergeant Bryan was charged with murder on Tuesday in the killing of an unidentified Panamanian man near the Madden Dam in Panama ''by shooting him with an M-16 rifle on or about Dec. 23.'' **********The three charges of aggravated assault also involve incidents at the Madden Dam. Sergeant Bryan is accused of hitting a Panamanian man in the hand with the butt of an M-16 rifle and striking a man in the head with the butt of the rifle on Dec. 20. He is also accused of hitting a Panamanian man in the back with a rubber hose on Dec. 21. **********A lawyer for Sergeant Bryan denied the accusations. ''Mr. Bryan is innocent of the charges,'' said Mark Louis Waple, Sergeant Bryan's civilian lawyer. ''He did nothing more than honestly and honorably serve his country during Operation Just Cause in the recent invasion of Panama.'' **********Mr. Waple said Sergeant Bryan had no record of disciplinary action and had been selected to attend the Army's Sergeant Major Academy in 1991. Sergeant Bryan has been assigned to the 82d Airborne for 10 years and was awarded the Army's Meritorious Service Medal in 1984, Mr. Waple said. Army officials said last month that the service's Criminal Investigative Command was investigating another case involving a different soldier who is accused of killing a Panamanian soldier who was taken prisoner. That soldier belongs to a unit that was stationed in Panama, and Army officials declined today to discuss the status of that investigation. **********According to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the maximum penalty for premeditated murder is death. Other penalities include life in prison, dishonorable discharge, forfeit of pay and allowances and reduction in rank. **********According to military procedures, the accusations against Sergeant Bryan are to be be brought before a military officer. **********The investigating officer plays a role similar to that of a grand jury in a civilian court. But there are some differences. The proceeding before a military officer are ususally public, and Sergeant Bryan would have the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine Government witnesses. **********The investigating officer would then make recommendations to Maj. Gen. James H. Johnson Jr., commander of the 82d Airborne, as to whether there should be a court-martial and, if so, on what charges the defendant would be tried. **********Army officials said last month that the murder charge against Sergeant Bryan stems from an incident at a roadblock. A car carrying Panamanians drove up and a grenade was later thrown at the Americans, wounding some of them. The Americans fired at the Panamanians, and Sergeant Bryan is accused of killing one of the Panamanians who survived. **********A relative of the sergeant disputed the Army's account, saying that Sergeant Bryan did not commit murder. **********The investigation of Sergeant Bryan's actions was one of a series into accusations of criminal acts against American soliders in Panama. Army officials assert that the cases demonstrated the service's ability to investigate itself. **********About 24,000 soldiers and Marines were involved in the Panama invasion, which began on Dec. 20. An Army official said inquiries were made into more than 60 cases of possible wrongdoing. The inquiries led to about 20 formal investigations. Most of those cases have been dismissed. **********The investigation of the accusations were carried out by the Army's Criminal Investigation Command."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/14/business/dow-drops-by-43.07-to-2582.67.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1990-09-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 743, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Drops by 43.07, To 2,582.67", "print_headline": "Dow Drops by 43.07, To 2,582.67", "body_text": " **********Stock prices fell sharply yesterday in repeated waves of computerized program selling, with the Dow Jones industrial average sliding 43.07, or 1.64 percent, to 2,582.67. **********Professional traders began selling heavily barely 20 minutes after the opening bell and repeatedly pounded the market, playing the price differential between the most widely held stocks and stock index futures. **********Birinyi Associates, which monitors program activity, said that a total of 98 minutes of heavy program selling during the day trimmed the Dow by 61 points. 3d-Largest Impact It was the third-largest negative impact on the Dow this year to come from program trading and was only 22 points away from the biggest decline eight months ago. **********Since the Dow average itself fell just 43.07, the implication was that program selling accounted for practically all of the market's weakness. **********In an indication that the drop ranged well beyond the 30 Dow blue chips, the broader Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 3.89, or 1.2 percent, to 318.65. **********With many traders and investors out of the market for a while, activity slowed to 123.4 million shares, from 129.9 million Wednesday. **********With 1,009 individual stocks sinking lower, 93 - including Hilton Hotels, CNA Financial and Digital Equipment - hit new lows. **********Of the 1,945 individual stocks traded yesterday, only 9 hit new highs and 430 rose. **********'Trend-Conscious' Traders **********''You have a market with just traders,'' said Michael Metz, chief market analyst for Oppenheimer & Company, ''and they're very nervous and trend-conscious.'' **********Traders appeared to react to a sharp drop in the dollar after Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that if Congress and the Administration came to terms on a credible budget agreement, the Fed could be expected to ease short-term interest rates.

Mr. Hu finds himself losing influence on the mainland and in the United States, where the Alliance's voice of dissent is being challenged by other Chinese exile groups that have sprung up since the crackdown. **********Mr. Hu and his colleagues are being forced to come to terms with the predicament that overseas dissidents of many relatively closed societies face: they may speak more freely overseas, but they risk becoming irrelevant at home in China. **********''In some ways, when you are overseas, you can exercise greater influence, because you can say what you want,'' Mr. Hu said in an interview. ''But although we are outside the Communist Party and we can do things, they are of little use.'' **********Even Fang Lizhi, China's most famous dissident, has hardly had an impact in China since he was allowed to leave in June. **********Morever, as disturbing events unfold in the Middle East, the Chinese Alliance and similar groups are losing a valuable asset: America's attention. **********And quarrels among dissident groups - laced with charges that one leader or another is a spy for China -have weakened their impact. By several estimates, there are hundreds of local and national dissident Chinese groups overseas. Washington is now headquarters for several of them, including the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars. A Paris-based group, the Federation for a Democratic China, shares an office with the Alliance. **********Some of the exiles say they have been sobered by the lack of any clear sign that the hard-line Government in Beijing will collapse soon, as many dissidents hoped. **********Mr. Hu says his group, which has 2,000 members and 60 branches worldwide, had a great hope that the May demonstrations last year would lead to fundamental change in China but recognizes that it cannot be of much direct help to the Chinese opposition. Instead, its mission calls for a steady effort to educate the rest of the world about the human rights issue in China. Mr. Hu devotes most of his time to writing, sometimes for the group's Chinese-language magazine, China Spring, which it tries to circulate on the mainland, despite a Government ban. China Spring, with a circulation of 11,000, was founded in 1982, a year before the editors formed the Alliance. **********Internal Disagreements **********The Alliance has been weakened by internal disagreements, which last year led to the ousting of one of its founders, Wang Bingzhang, and a lawsuit by two senior officers against another member who is alleged to have accused them of being spies for the Chinese Communist Party. **********Last June, another member, Shao Huaqiang, declared that he was employed by the Chinese state security agency and then applied for asylum in the United States. **********After the battle with its cofounder, the Alliance separated its operations into an administration, a board of directors and an ombudsman. In February it moved its operational headquarters nearer to Congress, in Washington, while Mr. Hu remains in Queens with the editors and writers of China Spring. More recently, it has been trying to forge ties with other major dissident groups, particularly the Federation for a Democratic China. **********But even if the Alliance became more influential in China, the group's leaders realize that their struggle will be a protracted one. **********''The risks you can take are limited,'' said Chen Jiaying, an editor at China Spring.

The four islands were seized by the Soviets in the last days of World War II, and now serve as strategic bases for Soviet forces. **********Peace Treaty Sought **********Mr. Kaifu said today that he would like to use Mr. Gorbachev's visit to ''make a good start of discussion on a peace treaty and the territorial issue.'' But so far neither side has budged, at least publicly. **********Nonetheless, Japanese officials said they sensed some easing of the Soviet position, born perhaps of increasing interest in Moscow in having Japan infuse money and technology into its badly faltering economy. **********''There is some softening of the rhetoric on the Soviet side, and they used some conciliatory expressions,'' a senior Japanese official said today. ''But that does not mean that they are being more forthcoming than before.'' **********The prospect of Mr. Gorbachev's visit here in April has greatly heated up the longstanding territorial issue, which has brought into a stalemate Japanese-Soviet relations since the end of the American postwar occupation. And increasingly, Japanese experts are betting that Mr. Gorbachev will come to view the startegic value of the islands as far less important that attracting Japanese yen to help rebuild the Soviet economy, particularly in areas neighboring Japan like Siberia. **********Attitudes May Be Easing **********There have been some signs of easing attitudes on both sides. On Monday, Ivan Frolov, a Politburo member and chief editor of the newspaper Pravda, told Japanese reporters in Moscow that Mr. Gorbachev would bring with him ''something historic'' in his visit to Tokyo. But he did not say anything explicit about the islands, called Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomais. **********Japan, at the same time, has been making small gestures. While Mr. Shevardnadze has been locked in negotiating sessions, millions of Japanese have been following the medical condition of a three-year old Soviet boy from Sakahalin Island, an area not in dispute. The boy was flown to a Japanese hospital last weekend for emergency skin grafts after an accident left him badly burned over 80 percent of his body. It was the first time anyone from the Soviet Union was brought into Japan on short notice for sophisticated medical care, and today Mr. Shevardnadze thanked the Japanese for the gesture, saying it would be remembered. **********Mr. Nakayama and Mr. Shevardnadze also signed a series of accords, agreeing to some limited ''technical assistance'' to the Soviet economy, cultural exchanges and exchanges of scientists who can explore the lessons of the Chernobyl nuclear accident. **********But the overarching issue of the visit has been the question of the northern islands, and for the first time even business leaders and the governing Liberal Democratic Party are openly disagreeing on how to handle it. Eiji Suzuki, the chairman of a major business group, said this week that ''I am afraid Japan will be left behind'' if Japan continues to insist on a solution to the territorial issue before Japanese business is free to enter large-scale deals with the Soviets. **********Returning Only Two Suggested **********Not long ago Shin Kanemaru, a powerful former Deputy Prime Minister, revived the idea of taking back only two of the islands, a move that Japan and the Soviet Union nearly agreed to in the mid-1950's. **********But Mr. Kaifu, speaking on Monday at an annual rally seeking the return of all four, insisted that the Soviet Union ''cannot put the northern territories to the side'' if it wants to improve ties. **********The debate has also led to an unusual series of detailed historical arguments that stretch from an 1855 agreement between the two nations - which recognized the islands as Japanese territory - to the Yalta agreement, which appeared to give them to the Soviets. While the argument rages, the two nations have been unable to sign a formal treaty ending World War II. **********''An overriding condition is that we should not put off the conclusion of a peace treaty with the Soviet Union any further,'' Haruki Wada, a political commentator, wrote recently in The Japan Times. ''It is morally wrong for our generation to pass on the settlement of postwar issues to a future generation which knows nothing of World War II. It would only complicate matters to do that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/29/business/company-news-soviet-airline-agrees-to-buy-ge-engines.html": {"writer_name": "John Holusha", "pub_date": "1990-03-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 430, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Soviet Airline Agrees To Buy G.E.

Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, called the report a ''cynical political exercise brought out to appease nationalists.'' **********Mr. Stevens said that it was clear that official information produced by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the army had been passed illegally to Protestant paramilitary groups. The groups used the documents and other information to enhance their own intelligence systems and as an aid in targeting people suspected of being I.R.A. terrorists. **********He said that it was impossible in many cases to trace those responsible for the disclosures because of the ''serious lack of controls and adequate accounting procedures relating to the distribution of security force documents, coupled with the age of the documents themselves.'' He published 83 recommendations for improving the handling of intelligence and investigation terrorism, including the establishment of an anti-terrorist squad. But he acknowledged that ''in the present climate,'' information leaks from the security forces ''may never be completely eliminated.'' **********The police chief in Northern Ireland, Hugh Annesley, appointed Mr. Stevens in September to investigate allegations of collusion after the BBC broadcast a report that members of an illegal Protestant terrorist group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, had showed him a list of Irish Republican Army suspects they said they had obtained because of a ''breach of security,'' and said they had used it to assassinate a Roman Catholic man, Loughlin Maginn. **********Loss of Security Document **********Suspicion of collaboration between the Protestant authorities in Northern Ireland and Protestant terrorists there is one of the reasons for support for I.R.A. terrorism from the Roman Catholic minority in the north. Among other things, Mr. Stevens looked into the disappearance from a high-security Belfast police station last year of a confidential bulletin-board poster showing the photographs and names of 12 people suspected of being members of the I.R.A. and the loss of a security document from an Ulster Defense Regiment base. **********Mr. Stevens said that 94 people had been arrested in connection with his inquiry and 59 of them had been charged or reported for alleged offenses under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or other security statutes. The British authorities charged two privates in the Ulster Defense Regiment with Mr. Maginn's murder. No members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary have been charged as a result of the investigation, Mr. Stevens said. **********The British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, said in the House of Commons today that he still had the fullest confidence in the Ulster Defense Regiment but that he found some findings in the report ''painful.'' **********''It has highlighted shortcomings and deficiencies in several important areas,'' Mr. Brooke said. ''I am fully aware of the great efforts that continue to be made by the regiment steadily to improve its effectiveness and professionalism, and I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of its members impartially serve the whole community in Northern Ireland.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/15/world/rio-journal-a-most-unlovely-slum-even-if-the-view-is-nice.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1990-05-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1140, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rio Journal;   A Most Unlovely Slum (Even if the View Is Nice)", "print_headline": "Rio Journal;   A Most Unlovely Slum (Even if the View Is Nice)", "body_text": " **********Santa Marta hill affords an exhilarating postcard view of Rio's tourist attractions - Sugar Loaf Mountain, South Atlantic beaches and the Christ statue high on a neighboring mountain peak. **********But the atmosphere on the hill is anything but that of a postcard. For example, when restoration workers raised metal scaffolding around the Christ statue recently, a little girl in the Santa Marta hill slums asked her mother, ''Why are the men putting Christ in jail?'' **********Cramped, violent and poor, the hillside community of Santa Marta is one of many favelas, or slums, that are home for about half of Rio's seven million inhabitants. **********Sociologists once dubbed Brazil ''Belindia'' - an affluent Belgium surrounded by an impoverished India. A tour of Rio's India starts where the maps end. **********Life in a Half-Lit World **********Airbrushed out of the minds of the affluent, most favelas do not appear on city maps. Indeed, many maps paint Santa Marta pastel green, implying perhaps that the hill, home to 10,000 poor people, is a park. **********In the middle-class Botafogo neighborhood, a cobblestone street gave way to a snaking, climbing alley. Ramshackle houses quickly closed in, forcing an intimacy with the sounds and smells of the inhabitants - blaring radios, crying babies, cooking oil and untreated sewage. **********Of unpainted wood and rough brick, the shanties are jammed so tightly together that the afternoon sun dims. Children raised in this half-lit world, half a mile from the beach, have a gray pallor. **********A woman laboring up the path with a bag of groceries stopped long enough to complain that her adopted son had been killed the night before by a rival cocaine trafficking gang. **********Gang War Under Way **********A few twists and turns later, the alley opened to a small patch of sunlight. Three young men, clearly working as lookouts for a drug gang, sat on a rock, one cradling a shotgun. With a nod, they let a group of visitors pass. **********''Those boys are going to die,'' said Frances O'Gorman, a community organizer well versed in the politics of the favela's cocaine gangs. In brief, she explained, Zacarias's gang recently wiped out the Long Hair gang, only to confront the ruthless Red Falange. At stake is Santa Marta, a prime location for distributing cocaine to Rio's beach-front neighborhoods. **********''I have never known a year as violent as this,'' said Ms. O'Gorman, who has worked on the hill since the late 1970's. She said that at the self-help group she advises, United Social Works of Santa Marta, one-third of the 20 council members have recently fled the favela in face of gang death threats. **********Halfway up the hill, the rooftop play area of the Social Works center offered a reprieve of sunshine, fresh air and the sweeping view of sea and mountains. From a slum on a far hillside came an irregular series of pops. **********''There's a shootout going on,'' said Anita de Souza Barbosa, general coordinator of the social group. It is not a terribly unusual occurrence on the hill. In the 1980's, homicides in greater Rio de Janeiro tripled, hitting 7,654 in 1989. **********Day Care for 68 Children **********Slum dwellers get little solace from calling the police. Members of Rio's underpaid military police routinely appear in newspaper crime pages here - as suspects. **********At the social center, Mrs. Barbosa showed the broken hinges of a food storeroom door she said had been kicked in by police ''looking for drugs.'' **********''They threatened to come back and take our typewriters,'' the community organizer said, referring to typewriters used for teaching secretarial skills to slum girls. **********On May 1, Mrs. Barbosa's 19-year-old son, Alcemir, was badly beaten by policemen in front of his shack. **********A rare bright light on the hill, the center provides day care for 68 children of mothers who work, most of them as housemaids. **********But, reflecting the slum's precarious health conditions, only 38 children were at the nursery on a recent afternoon. A contagious skin infection kept the rest at home. **********Urban Amenities Installed **********A new, city-run health clinic was another bright spot on the tour. Indeed, a few of the amenities of urban life are slowly penetrating a slum formed over 30 years ago by rural migrants from Brazil's interior. **********Muddy alleys, once slippery with sewage, are gradually being paved with cement. Electric wires and plastic water pipes now reach into most corners of Santa Marta. Last year, the city installed a garbage collection bin at the slum's entrance and started reinforcing the hillside to prevent mudslides. **********In March 1988 a tropical downpour unleashed a mudslide that swept 60 houses down the hill. ''Eight of my neighbors died that night,'' said Raimunda Sampaio, whose dark, four-room cement shanty stands next to the reinforcing work. **********A drawn woman who looked decades older than her 48 years, Mrs. Sampaio said she came to Rio at age 18 from a rural town in Brazil's northeast ''150 leagues from the coast.'' Twenty-two years of marriage produced 12 children; 10 survived. **********''I came to make a life for myself, and I made only babies,'' she said as a naked grandchild wobbled uncertainly next to a water barrel. **********New President Supported **********Five minutes away, through a maze of alleys, stood a house of greater hope. With the help of the social center's credit union, Joana Barbosa dos Santos was replacing her wood and tin shanty with a house of brick and corrugated roofing. **********A migrant from the northeast, Mrs. dos Santos worked for over three decades as a housemaid for families in Rio before retiring recently, without a pension. Three of her children work in local supermarkets, each earning little more than Brazil's legal minimum monthly wage - $70. **********Mrs. dos Santos echoed what polltakers have detected - lower class support for the radical economic plan of Brazil's new President, Fernando Collor de Mello. To battle Brazil's 5,000 percent annual inflation, Mr. Collor froze prices and blocked savings accounts. **********In a recent poll, 45 percent of the lowest-income people interviewed said they were ''totally in favor'' of the economic plan, double the approval rate expressed by respondents with medium or high incomes. **********''At least you buy something today - rice, cooking oil - and you know that tomorrow it will be the same price,'' Mrs. dos Santos said.

''And the markets are in the process of correcting those earlier expectations,'' said Walter S.

''It is true, however,'' said Fraser P. Seitel, a spokesman for Chase, ''that we are engaged in a massive effort at Chase to do two things - boost revenues and reduce operating expenses by $300 million a year.'' **********Bank insiders said the changes were disclosed Thursday morning when Thomas G. Labrecque, Chase's newly named chairman, briefed senior officers about the previous day's board meeting. **********At Citicorp, cost-cutting is concentrating on the global finance group, which lends to large corporations in North America, Europe and Japan. The bank said yesterday that it was reorganizing the group's management structure in ways that ''ultimately will result in fewer people and lower costs.'' Job Losses Acknowledged While both Chase and Citicorp are still working on details of how to reorganize their corporate lending businesses, they acknowledge that many jobs will be lost. At Chase, executives estimate that more than 3,000 employees might be cut, out of its work force of 42,000. Citicorp, with 90,000 employees, has not indicated how many jobs might be lost as it reorganizes the 15,000-employee global finance group, but analysts expect that a cut of several thousand is likely. **********A large number of the layoffs are expected in New York City, where both banks are based. But both are continuing to expand their consumer banking business, which employs the greatest number of workers. **********''We are witnessing truly major efforts to control costs, the like of which American banks have never seen before,'' said Thomas Hanley, a managing director at Salomon Brothers. **********While the cost-cutting ''is long overdue,'' Mr. Hanley added, a determined management could cut costs more than might now be expected. At Chase, for example, ''I expect they will ultimately achieve cost savings substantially greater than the $300 million target they have set,'' he said. **********Frank DeSantis, an analyst of large New York City banks at Paine Webber Inc., said the actions at Chase were a reminder that ''it is amazing what people can do in a crisis.'' Spending on meals and lodging for directors and the advisory committee is not the major problem at Chase, but ''the changes are symbolic and show a willingness of management to cut expenses starting at the top and going down,'' he added. **********The shifts of meetings were suggested by Mr. Labrecque, whose announcement was loudly applauded at the normally uneventful monthly meeting of the senior officers, bankers at the meeting said. The 51-year-old Mr. Labrecque, an executive with 26 years of experience at Chase, was named in June to succeed Willard C. Butcher as chairman at the end of October. Mr. Butcher, who is retiring, was selected by Mr. Rockefeller to run the bank during the 1980's. **********Profits Rather Than Prestige **********Because Chase has been well known in banking circles for lavish spending on entertainment of clients and senior employees, analysts saw the willingness to cut spending on meetings of the advisory committee and the directors as a sign that under Mr. Labrecque the bank will become more concerned with profits than prestige. **********The international advisory committee was created by Mr. Rockefeller as a way for Chase to benefit from the economic and political insights of key business leaders. Henry A. Kissinger is a member of the committee, along with Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman of Fiat S.p.A., and Lord Carrington, chairman of the Christies International auction house and a former British Foreign Secretary. **********Under Mr. Rockefeller, and to a lesser extent Mr. Butcher, the chairman of Chase has tended to be more involved with activities like the international advisory committee, leaving to subordinates the nitty-gritty work of controlling costs and avoiding bad loans. **********Mr. Labrecque has already indicated he will be more active than his predecessors in the daily management of the bank. **********Employee-Protection Plan **********Other action taken by Chase's board on Wednesday included approval of a plan to protect all employee severance pay agreements and retirement funds if control of the company changed. The so-called ''tin parachutes'' would not necessarily prevent an unwanted acquisition or merger, but they have been adopted by other banking companies because they make employees more confident about their future. **********The need for cost-cutting is especially evident at banks like Chase and Citicorp, which have been hurt by a decline in wholesale lending and other financing for large corporations. While the banks still maintain expensive networks of foreign offices, corporate treasurers have learned how to borrow more cheaply in the securities markets or from foreign banks. During 1989, the decline in the wholesale banking business with large corporations accelerated, as the number and size of corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts dropped. **********Citicorp executives say they do not have a target for how many jobs will be cut in the next few years. But analysts said they expected Citicorp would cut costs in its global finance group by at least 10 percent, with the loss of several thousand jobs. Profits in the global finance group, headed since January by Michael A. Callen, fell 69 percent in the second quarter, to $42 million, as operating expenses rose along with the costs of bad loans. **********Change in Measurements **********To improve the performance of the global finance group, Mr. Callen said that the practice of measuring bankers' performances by earnings of each profit center would be de-emphasized and replaced by measures of market share, rankings compared with other banks and the total amount of revenues from a corporate client. **********Mr. Callen said he was beginning to review staffing in each of 50 different activities of the global finance group with a goal of cutting back the layers of management. **********Citicorp and Chase are not the only money-center banks acting to reduce costs. Earlier this week, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, the eighth-largest banking company, said it was planning to cut 1,400 jobs and reduce costs by $125 million annually. Most of the cuts are also expected in the corporate finance area."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/17/business/a-guilty-plea-by-grumman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Guilty Plea by Grumman", "print_headline": "A Guilty Plea by Grumman", "body_text": " **********The Grumman Corporation, the nation's 10th-largest military contractor, pleaded guilty to two criminal counts of unauthorized use of secret Pentagon documents, the Justice Department said today. **********It said the company was ordered by a Federal judge in Alexandria, Va., to pay $2.5 million in fines and damages as part of the plea-bargaining deal. **********Grumman becomes the fourth large company to plead guilty in the long-running investigation into unauthorized trafficking in documents by contractors and military officials. **********The other companies that have pleaded guilty are the General Motors Company's Hughes Aircraft unit, the RCA unit of the General Electric Company and the Boeing Company, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer.

Come next January, banks from other states can expand into the state's huge and lucrative market. And bankers in the state have feared that New York giants like Citicorp, Chase and Chemical would swoop in and buy large California banks, creating continent-spanning empires. **********But as the magic date draws near, it is shaping up to be a less earthshaking event than was thought when the California legislature approved the interstate banking bill in 1986. Most New York banks, weakened by problems with third world debt, can no longer afford to buy a huge California bank. And the California banks, having had five years to prepare, have armed themselves for the conflict. Like Japanese banks, they have bought up attractive independents in the state, leaving little for the New Yorkers. **********''Most bankers have forgotten whatever fears they might have had at the time,'' said Howard Gould, the former California banking superintendent who is now managing director of the Secura Group, a consulting firm in Pasadena, Calif. **********Indeed, the major banks in the state, with the exception of First Interstate Bankcorp, are entering the new era in a stronger position than ever. And they are likely to have the fast-growing economy of the nation's largest state and its ringside seat on the Pacific Rim to themselves, maintaining what some consumer groups see as an oligopoly. **********In fact, the California banks could end up becoming the nation's premier banks, eclipsing their rivals in New York. It is not surprising, then, that rather than 1991, attention here is focused on the new leaders of three of the state's four largest banks, who were recently appointed to replace executives who shaped those institutions for more than a decade. **********At BankAmerica, the state's leading bank, Richard Rosenberg, a marketing whiz, is replacing A.W. Clausen. At Security Pacific, the state's second-largest bank, Robert H. Smith has just replaced Richard J. Flamson. At First Interstate in Los Angeles, down-to-earth Edward M. Carson is expected to reverse some policies of the expansion-minded Joseph J. Pinola. Only at Wells Fargo & Company, ruled by penny-pinching Carl Reichardt, is no change in the works. **********Not everyone is convinced that 1991 will be a ho-hum affair. ''It's a sort of once-in-a-lifetime event,'' said Mr. Smith. **********While New York banks may not be able to afford to buy into California, there could be mergers of equals between big banks in both states. In addition, California banks will be able to expand into other states after 1991. While they may shun the crowded New York retail market, other areas like the Southeast, might be attractive. **********Some analysts believe the Japanese-owned California banks may take most advantage of that new opportunity. Never prohibited from buying California banks, Japanese banks have purchased almost all of the state's medium-sized banks and control 25 percent of its banking assets. **********Despite a recent softening in the real estate market and the threat of defense spending cutbacks, California remains almost too attractive for outsiders to ignore. Citicorp, the largest New York bank, is still expected to increase its presence here. And First Interstate, reeling from loan losses, might prove to be a tempting acquisition. ''Everybody figures it will be somebody's Christmas present,'' said one investment banker. **********Some super-regional banks, like NCNB of North Carolina, might also move into California. Comerica Inc. of Detroit staked its claim last September, agreeing to buy Plaza Commerce Bancorp of San Jose next year. **********The 1986 California interstate banking law was the fruit of persistent lobbying for several years by the New York banks. Some consumer groups also favored the move to stimulate competition. There are more than 400 banks in California, but the four giants control about 65 percent of all deposits. Consumer groups say that California consumers receive less interest on deposits and pay higher interest on loans than in more competitive areas like New York. Yet California bankers claim they compete furiously - on service rather than rates. **********But consumer advocates do not expect much change in 1991. The New York banks are not the powerhouses they once were. Although Wells Fargo has only half the assets of Chase Manhattan, its market capitalization is 20 percent higher. The strongest New York banks, J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust, are not much interested in retail banking, California's main attraction. **********Besides, small banks, with assets below $1 billion, are almost the only thing left to buy. And as David A. Brooks, Citicorp's executive in charge of consumer banking in the West, puts it, Citicorp would have to buy as many as 35 to 40 small banks to become as big a player as it would like in California. **********Another possibility is to buy a savings and loan. Some of the state's thrifts have as much as $20 billion or more in assets - a substantial market position. But some bankers worry that a thrift's customers would leave after a takeover since they typically look for the best interest rates rather than the long-term relations that banks offer. **********That leaves First Interstate, which is considered the most likely takeover candidate in the state. Established before interstate banking restrictions took effect, First Interstate operates in 13 Western states, making it easy for an acquirer to sell off pieces to help finance a purchase. Its banks in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada are performing well. But the company's results have been dragged down by loan problems in Arizona and, particularly, Texas, which it entered in 1987. The problems caused a net loss of $124.5 million in 1989. **********First Interstate would be the most logical acquisition in the state for Citicorp. But both Wells Fargo and Security Pacific say they would be interested. BankAmerica is also thought to be intrigued. ''It's really a question of who is going to pull the trigger,'' said Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, based here. **********But analysts say everyone is afraid of pulling the trigger for fear of driving First Interstate into the arms of another bank. That could buy First Interstate time. Mr. Carson, 60, who will take over from Mr. Pinola in June, said First Interstate is ''not looking for a buyer,'' although it is not intent on staying independent ''at all costs.'' He added, however, ''if we perform the way we think we will, then it's in our shareholders' best interest to stay independent.'' **********Mr. Carson says that unlike his predecessor, his goal is not expansion, but to ''maximize what we've got.'' He has already cut the holding company's headcount to 200, from 500, and says he would sell off some smaller banks in states like Colorado and Wyoming to raise cash, while keeping its major banks, including those in Arizona and Texas. **********The bank's recent stock offering, through which Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company bought a 10 percent stake in First Interstate, alleviated its capital crunch. Although the buyout firm says it will be a passive investor, analysts say it might eventually buy First Interstate itself or force its sale. **********Bankamerica has undergone a similar transformation. A few years ago, suffering from huge losses from bad loans, BankAmerica was a carcass from which competitors were biting off chunks of market share. Having slimmed down, revved up marketing and put its loan portfolio in order, the bank is a feared giant again. And Mr. Rosenberg, who has headed the bank's California retailing operations since 1987 and will take over from Mr. Clausen in May, is expected to strengthen its retail banking operations in California and elsewhere in the West. **********Mr. Rosenberg and most of the other top brass at BankAmerica are veterans of Wells Fargo, as is Jerry A. Grundhofer, head of Security Pacific's California bank. They have spread a style of banking throughout California that turned Wells Fargo into the state's premier bank in terms of profit growth and stock appreciation, although some analysts are now concerned by its large number of loans in troubled areas like real estate and leveraged buyouts. **********The philosophy, pioneered by Wells's chairman Mr. Reichardt, is simple: Cut costs to the bone and expand by acquiring banks in one's own state, eliminating redundancies and achieving more efficiencies than buying in another state. Wells is now digesting three small banks to further bolster its market share in Southern California. ''San Diego County is bigger than the entire economy of Oregon,'' said Robert L. Joss, a vice chairman. ''Would you buy a bank in Oregon or would you try to expand in San Diego?'' **********If any California bank takes advantage of 1991 to move outside the state or merge with a New York bank, it is likely to be Security Pacific. Security, which has expanded into other businesses like investment banking and consumer finance, believes size is necessary for American banks to compete with giants from Japan and Europe. ''If that means being a $200 billion or $150 billion organization by merging with someone, so be it,'' said Mr. Smith, who has long been the heir apparent and had a role in shaping the bank's policies. **********CITICORP ON THE PROWL IN CALIFORNIA **********John S. Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, has defined three strategic new markets for his bank: Western Europe, Japan and California. That leaves little doubt that the nation's largest bank plans to take advantage of the opening of the California market. **********Citicorp already has more than 5,000 employees in the state, engaged in everything from corporate lending to designing automated teller machines. It boasts more credit card holders in California than any bank except Bank of America. And Citicorp, which has long emphasized retail banking, established a foothold in California in 1982 by purchasing a troubled Oakland thrift and renaming it Citicorp Savings. **********But trying to turn an ailing thrift into a healthy bank was tougher than Citicorp envisioned. Citicorp Savings has assets of only $7 billion and very low profits. Many consumers and businesses in California are still not aware of Citicorp's presence. ''We're not arrogant enough to believe we're here until customers believe we're here,'' said David A. Brooks, who is in charge of consumer banking for Citicorp in the West. **********But 1991 and new thrift regulations could change that. To start, Citicorp Savings will get a new name next month, Citibank Federal Savings Bank, to identify it more as a bank. Citicorp will also be able to combine back office operations of its banks and its thrifts, which could lower Citicorp Savings's costs. **********And Citicorp will begin marketing banking services to its credit-card holders in the state. ''If we could just get our card base to bank with us, we'd be the largest bank in California,'' Mr. Brooks said. **********But Mr. Brooks, a former vice chairman of Crocker National Bank, said the marketing campaigns won't be effective unless Citicorp has more branches. Right now, Citicorp Savings has 95 branches in the San Francisco Bay area, putting it among the top five banks and thrifts. But in Southern California, the 35 branches are woefully inadequate. ''You can't compete without bricks and mortar,'' he said. That probably means acquisitions, starting in 1991. Mr. Brooks would not comment on whether Citicorp would want to buy First Interstate Bancorp. But he did say that to become a major player in the state's largest metropolitan areas, Citicorp would prefer one or two large acquisitions to numerous small ones. **********Some analysts say Citicorp, with its capital base weak and its stock depressed, is not in a great position to make such a move right now. But Mr. Brooks said if the right deal came along at the right price, it could raise the money. ''By the end of the 1990's we will be a big player in this marketplace,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/28/world/convictions-set-aside-for-3-in-an-ulster-case.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Convictions Set Aside For 3 in an Ulster Case", "print_headline": "Convictions Set Aside For 3 in an Ulster Case", "body_text": " **********An appeals court today set aside the convictions of three Irish citizens serving 25-year sentences for conspiring to kill Britain's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in 1987. **********The three - Martina Shanahan, 24 years old; John McCann, 26, and Finbar Cullen, 29 - were immediately arrested again under Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act.

The talks are to resume Monday, and an announcement is possible on Tuesday. **********A new test of how far Japan will go in meeting American trade demands will come this week as negotiators meet at the State Department for a fourth round of talks on ''structural impediments'' - the more pervasive obstacles to trade that stem from public policies and cultural habits. These include, for example, land-use policies that make doing business in Japan extremely costly, or levels of spending on such things as housing, schools and public works so low that domestic growth is dampened and dependence on exports for economic growth is increased. **********Concessions Promised **********Japanese officials said their negotiators would bring concessions in their briefcases, but it remains to be seen how far these would go in narrowing a $49 billion imbalance in trade between the countries last year. Over the last decade, the gap was nearly $400 billion. **********Both sides are racing to meet a mid-April deadline for an interim report that could influence feelings in Congress, where frustration over Japanese policies that block imports is rising. A final report is due in July. **********''Japan has, to some degree, opened its market,'' the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said in a recent interview. ''But we need to have them open it much more, and when people ask how much more, I say I want them to respond to the competitive criteria of price and quality.'' **********Some of the Japanese seem to have heard Washington's message. ''The mounting discontent in the U.S. Congress against the huge Japan-U.S. trade imbalance can be said to be a hair trigger,'' the Japanese Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, said recently. ''Deterioration of sentiments towards Japan appears to be spreading nationwide in the U.S.'' **********In the background on Capitol Hill is legislation recently introduced by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate subcommittee on trade, that increases the chances of reprisal by subjecting the structural impediments to the Super 301 provision of 1988 trade law, which sets rigorous negotiating targets and deadlines. **********The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 provides a structure for the United States to identify and retaliate against unfair trade practices. Last year the United States decided to pursue intensive negotiations with Japan over its trade practices in supercomputers, satellites and wood products. **********Under the law, if the Japanese markets in these sectors are not open by June 16, the United States may retaliate by imposing up to 100 percent tariffs on selected imports from Japan. **********Political stakes are also high in Tokyo, where factions of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have protested some American demands, particularly one that seeks to eliminate a law that delays the opening of large stores for up to 10 years. The law is intended to protect Japan's many small retailers. **********Pressure on 2 Sides **********Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is walking a tightrope between opponents within his party and President Bush, who stepped up the pressure on Japan at a meeting with Mr. Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif., a month ago. **********That meeting is coming to look more and more like a turning point in the long history of trade disagreements between the countries. Mr. Taifu, who had just won election, promised to make changes in structural reforms a priority of his new Cabinet, and seems to have at least partly delivered on that pledge. **********To win support in Parliament, the Japanese leader has argued that the reforms are needed not just to ease frictions with Washington but to help Japanese consumers. **********Polls suggest that he is getting public support. One survey by Nihon Keizai Shinbun, a leading business newspaper, found that more than 80 percent of 10,000 Japanese surveyed agree wholly or in part with American criticism that the Japanese economy should be more open. **********Not as Difficult **********This suggests that trade concessions may not be as difficult to achieve as many in the Government and the ruling party have been saying. **********In addition to seeking a relaxation of restraints on big retailers, who are usually more willing to risk introducing new products, including goods directly imported from abroad, the United States wants, among other changes, a much tougher Japan Fair Trade Commission. **********Moving Rapidly **********While preparing for the new negotiating round on structural impediments, the two Governments have moved rapidly to bridge differences in other areas. **********For example, the Governments, facing retaliation threats, have just concluded a preliminary market-opening telecommunications agreement that could help American companies sell more equipment and services to Japan. And on March 23, they announced a preliminary agreement on measures to open the Japanese market to the most powerful American-made computers. **********The Japanese have shown some flexibility in discussions about market barriers in wood products. An assistant United States trade representative, Don Phillips, is to lead a negotiating team to Tokyo next week to make another attempt to resolve the issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/26/world/li-peng-says-soviet-ideas-of-change-do-not-apply-to-china.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1990-04-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 865, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Li Peng Says Soviet Ideas of Change Do Not Apply to China", "print_headline": "Li Peng Says Soviet Ideas of Change Do Not Apply to China", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Li Peng of China said today that reports of a rift with Moscow over the waning of Communism had been exaggerated, but he left little doubt that the two neighbors are on different political wavelengths. **********At a news conference ending the first visit by a Chinese Prime Minister since Zhou Enlai's trip 25 years ago, Mr. Li said the Soviet model of political and economic change did not apply to China, and appeared to juxtapose President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's problems of runaway ethnic unrest with what he insisted was solid political stability in Beijing. **********The two countries were to issue separate statements rather than a joint communique on the visit, a decision that was attributed to lack of time but is often a sign of diverging views. **********Mr. Li's visit came almost a year after Mr. Gorbachev ended 30 years of chill between the two nations by traveling to Beijing to normalize relations. **********That visit was largely eclipsed by student pro-democracy demonstrators, who occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square demanding liberalizations similar to those Mr. Gorbachev has permitted. Mr. Li was central among the Chinese hard-liners who sent tanks to crush the protest. **********Border and Trade Issues **********The Chinese Prime Minister's reciprocal visit this week produced several signs that the normalization continues, including agreements on troop reductions along the 4,300-mile Soviet-Chinese border - with details as yet undisclosed - as well as on trade and on technological exchanges. **********There are believed to be about a million troops facing each other on the two sides of the lengthy frontier. Mr. Gorbachev last year pledged to pull back some 200,000 troops unilaterally. But Western military analysts say the withdrawal has not yet been carried out. A significant reduction in the force level would presumably benefit the economies of both countries. **********Mr. Li said economic agreements signed here included long-term Soviet credit for China to build two power engineering facilities, in return for $735 million in short-term Chinese credits to provide Soviet consumers with textiles and light industrial products. **********A student in Moscow in the 1950's, Mr. Li seemed somewhat at a loss when asked to compare the city of his memories with contemporary Moscow. He said the streets seemed wider and the buildings more modern, but did not mention, if he noticed it, that by Chinese standards the stores are sparsely supplied and the political debate is shockingly frank. He spoke in Chinese through an interpreter. **********'Have to Wait and See' **********Asked about reports that the Chinese leadership blamed Mr. Gorbachev for the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, Mr. Li dodged the issue of the Kremlin's role and said: ''It is too early to say that they have abandoned socialism and socialist policies. We have to wait and see.'' **********Mr. Li said President Gorbachev had convinced him that the changes under way in the Soviet Union were ''of a socialist orientation'' and disparaged ''speculations'' in the West about ideological differences. **********''It is true that different socialist systems have different views of perestroika and our reforms, but every socialist country has its own reality and real situation,'' he said. **********''Each country should decide for itself how socialism should be built,'' he said. ''We do not have one model to follow.'' **********The decision by the Soviet Communist Party to give up its statutory monopoly on power, Mr. Li said, was ''a choice made by the Communist Party and the people of the Soviet Union'' but that China had no desire to emulate it. **********Confident About China **********The Chinese leader said his willingness to visit Moscow reflected his confidence that China was under solid control and the political leadership united. **********''Some believe that in April, May or June this year more disturbances will affect China,'' he said, referring to predictions that students would try to observe the anniversary of the democracy movement. ''But I am sure that nothing of that sort will happen.'' **********Mr. Li said that the reported ethnic unrest in the northwest of China was ''an event of very small proportions'' and that ''now the situation is stabilized.'' The Governor of the province where the unrest took place accompanied Mr. Li to Moscow, possibly to discuss Chinese concerns that northwest China would be influenced by ethnic unrest across the border in Soviet Central Asia. **********''We earnestly hope that stability will prevail inside the Soviet Union and we also hope that the U.S.S.R. will be able to settle its problems,'' Mr. Li said. **********Asked about the disgraced former Chinese Communist leader, Zhao Ziyang, who was deposed after showing lenience toward the student protests, Mr. Li said he was ''quite well, lives in Beijing, and is still a member of the Chinese Communist Party'' although his activities were ''under study.'' **********''He has a salary which is greater than mine,'' Mr. Li said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/08/business/icahn-seen-as-loser-in-usx-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1990-05-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Icahn Seen As Loser in USX Vote", "print_headline": "Icahn Seen As Loser in USX Vote", "body_text": " **********Carl C. Icahn all but conceded today that he had failed to win support for his plan to split the USX Corporation. The votes cast at the annual meeting here will not be tabulated for at least a week, but the indications are that the New York financier has come up short in his costly campaign. **********''There are five or six major investors who have told us that even though they agreed with what we have been trying to do, they intend to vote with management,'' Mr. Icahn told reporters after the meeting. **********For its part, USX maintained again today that the Pittsburgh-based company is healthier financially than it had been in years. **********'Businesses Are Humming' **********''Our businesses are humming,'' Charles A. Corry, the chairman, told shareholders. ''We have a solid, balanced energy operation that's growing. We are operating a good metals business that's one of the most efficient steel producers.'' **********For the last month, Mr. Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, has been traveling widely to persuade shareholders to support a nonbinding resolution asking the company's managers to spin off at least 80 percent of its steel business as a dividend to shareholders. Mr. Icahn has insisted that USX shares have been undervalued and that splitting the company would yield a value of $48 a share. **********On the New York Stock Exchange today, USX's shares fell 50 cents each to close at $33.50. **********The shareholders attending the annual meeting here, the home of USX's Marathon Oil Company subsidiary, seemed generally to support management's position that the company should remain intact. **********Renewed Attention **********Still, several institutional investors and analysts said that even if Mr. Icahn failed to win a majority of the votes, he had succeeded in putting considerable pressure on management to improve USX's share price and to give renewed attention to the prospect of separating the company's historical core business from USX's larger energy holdings. **********Mr. Icahn, while suggesting that big institutions had enough votes to deny him the majority he sought, remained upbeat. ''I believe the company will eventually follow the course we have outlined,'' he said, ''and I know many institutional investors who have spoken with management believe the same thing.'' **********Mr. Icahn said today that he would continue to meet with shareholders and with USX management to press for a spinoff of the steel business. ''Even if I do not win,'' he said, ''the higher the vote we get, the more leverage we gain for our argument.'' **********Some investors contend that USX's managers have told them privately that a breakup has been seriously considered and that such a move might be pursued over time. But the company has argued that a spinoff or sale of the steel business would be better timed when the steel market is healthier than in recent months. **********Visible Campaign **********Mr. Icahn has in recent weeks taken on a highly visible campaign, spending heavily on newspaper and television advertising. He said at the beginning of the proxy battle that he would spend as much as $10 million to promote his case. USX, too, has been spending on advertising, saying that it could probably match Mr. Icahn's expenditures in this contest. **********In comments at the meeting, Mr. Icahn urged the company to abolish a ''poison pill'' provision that prevented anyone from acquiring more than 15 percent of the company without it becoming prohibitively expensive. Mr. Icahn, who holds 13.3 percent, said he would like to increase his holdings beyond that point and was willing to sign an agreement promising not to seek control. **********He further accused USX's managers of engaging in a ''widespread campaign'' in which they told shareholders that he intends merely to cause the share price to increase and then sell his stock - he paid in the low $20's for most of his holdings - and take his profits. ''But nothing could be further from the truth,'' Mr. Icahn told shareholders. ''I have been a stockholder for the last four and a half years. I have been a loyal shareholder and a patient one.'' **********Concerns About Cost **********While several shareholders here and elsewhere have acknowledged that the value of their investment might rise under a proposal like Mr. Icahn's, they said they had concerns about the cost and tax implications of creating a second company. **********The analysts have suggested that USX has managed to convince the shareholders that its restructuring plan, which includes selling off the reserves of its Texas Oil and Gas Corporation subsidiary and buying back shares, was sufficient. They have also contended that having two companies would add $115 million a year in operating costs. **********''Management has had a certain inertia on their side,'' said John Jacobson of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. ''It's difficult for some shareholders to accept that management knows less about how to run the company than Carl Icahn does.'' **********Mr. Icahn said today that his campaign had focused attention on the issue of retaining the company's steel operation. He added that USX's steel business needed more capital investment, ''but that should not come from Marathon,'' he said. ''The steel company needs to bring in equity capital on its own, and it might be good to bring in a foreign investor to help the steel business meet the capital needs of the 1990's,'' he added. **********The proxy battle has been one of the most unusual in recent corporate history. Although they are typically used to oust a board or affect an acquisition by another party, this contest has centered on a resolution that is not binding and asks management to spin off one of its businesses. **********Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Icahn's troubles in gaining more votes in this contest centered on questions about the sincerity of a man regarded by many as simply being a corporate raider. **********''The proposal would have been considered in a much different light if it had not been promoted by Carl Icahn,'' said Howard D. Sherman of Institutional Shareholders Services Inc., a Washington-based firm specializing in consulting institutional investors in proxy contests. ''Icahn is unfairly tainted by simply having been around when a lot of Wall Street criminals were doing their thing. And, unfortunately, that is what a lot of people have focused on.'' **********He added that USX's management has been highly regarded for turning around its steel business after the depressed conditions of the early 80's. ''Management has also done a good job of creating questions in the minds of shareholders on whether Mr. Icahn's numbers add up,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/17/business/more-woes-at-sumitomo.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 288, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "More Woes at Sumitomo", "print_headline": "More Woes at Sumitomo", "body_text": " **********The giant Sumitomo Bank Ltd., whose chairman, Ichiro Isoda, resigned last week in the wake of a stock manipulation scandal involving a branch manager, received more setbacks today. **********A second top executive, Teizaburo Nishi, the vice president in charge of Sumitomo's domestic branch network, announced he was resigning.

But Health and Social Welfare Minister Eduardo Bauza subsequently blamed one of his aides, Dr. Matilde Menendez, for the state of the hospital and dismissed her and several others. **********The Moyano is a vast complex of 28 wards.

French Canadians have their own national holidays, their own music videos, their own literature. They drink wine at lunch and still smoke with abandon in cafes, offices and public elevators. **********That Quebec is different has long been taken for granted. But the question of how to institutionalize those differences has tormented politicians here and in Ottawa for decades. The collapse of the most recent attempt to accommodate Quebec's distinctiveness within the Canadian federation has once more left the question unresolved. **********Two provinces, Newfoundland and Manitoba, refused to ratify the Quebec agreement, known as the Meech Lake accord. The dissenters complained that the clause granting special status to Quebec had Orwellian undertones: Quebec would become ''more equal'' than the other nine provinces. Quebec is now defiantly exploring the means to go its own way, though without saying exactly how far. **********Signs: French Only **********Had the accord been signed, it is widely assumed that the Quebec provincial government would have used the constitutional guarantees to pursue the same goals, accelerating the pace at which French speakers have been wresting control of issues like immigration, employment and above all language policy. But in that case such expanding of local autonomy would have been carried out within a framework binding Quebec to the rest of Canada. Now the process continues in a less stable political atmosphere. **********Quebec's sign rule - a provincial law passed more than a year ago that banned all English-language signs and billboards - is the most dramatic example of how Quebec has sought to impose French as the official language in the province. Eighty percent of Quebec's population is French-speaking; almost half the people speak little or no English. **********''Our linguistic difference is a kind of shield that protects us against the pressure of North American culture,'' said Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer for the Montreal newspaper La Presse. '' 'Miami Vice' never caught on here.'' Demography is a far greater threat to French culture than McDonald's or MTV. The province, which had one of the highest birth rates in the Western world 30 years ago, now has the lowest. French Canadians fear that they are becoming an endangered species. Major policy disputes almost always reflect that preoccupation. **********Even without the constitutional accord, Quebec is the only province with its own immigration service. French Canadian civil servants work alongside federal government employees in every Canadian consulate and immigration office from Paris to Hong Kong. Schoolyard English?  Quebec is obliged to abide by Federal immigration regulations and thus has little real power over selection, quotas or numbers. But the province's immigration officials abroad seek to encourage French-speaking immigrants to chose Montreal over Toronto or Vancouver. **********Despite the recent breakdown of constitutional talks, the Quebec provincial government has kept on negotiating with Ottawa for even greater control over how it spends its share of the immigration budget, as well as for more say in the assimilation of new immigrants. **********Quebec already has in place a law that requires all new immigrants to send their children to French schools, regardless of their country of origin or their personal preference. When the largest school board in Montreal recently issued a proposal calling for schoolchildren caught speaking English in corridors or playgrounds to be punished, it further underscored what Canadians view as an irreconcilable philosphical difference between the two cultures. **********''The notion that the collective interests of a majority supersede individual rights is indigenous to Quebec,'' Peter Blaikie, a English-speaking lawyer in Montreal, said. One reason the constitutional agreement collapsed was some provinces' fear that Quebec would use the ''distinct society'' clause of the Meech Lake accord to further restrict minority rights. **********Quebec's economy is the most statist in Canada. The provincial government invests heavily in local businesses and industries. Quebec has its own $37 billion social security pension fund, having opted out of the federal system in 1966. Its stated purpose is to use savers' investments to promote Quebec's economic growth. Last year, when the Steinberg grocery store chain went up for sale, the pension fund intervened to insure that the chain remain in French Canadian hands. **********Low University Fees **********That more European approach is reflected in other fields. Despite a steep tuition rise that will go into effect next year, university fees in Quebec are still among the lowest in Canada. **********Quebec abides by the federal criminal justice system, based on English common law, but in civil cases, it follows the Napoleonic code. There are few significant clashes. Civil courts follow federal rules of procedure, but Quebec civil cases are presented to a judge, not a jury. Three out of nine seats on the Canadian Supreme Court are reserved for Quebec judges. **********On most social issues, Quebec is more liberal. Abortions are easier to obtain than in other provinces. Homosexuality, even among public officials, is generally accepted. **********Quebecers proudly insist that they are less puritanical than their English-speaking counterparts. French Canadian journalists, like Europeans, rarely invade the privacy of their politicians. In the 70's, the marital turmoil of former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau was a much bigger story outside Quebec than within. That restraint has held up into the 90's. **********''We don't delve into politicians' private lives,'' Mr. Dubuc explained. ''An elected official can womanize. No one will write about it.'' **********'We Are More Expressive' **********French Canadians take enormous pride in their temperament, which they describe as anything but Anglo-Saxon. ''We are Latins, we are more expressive,'' Martine Belleville, a cook in a Montreal vegetarian restaurant, said with an unapologetic shrug. **********She was explaining the spontaneous street demonstrations on the Quebec national holiday of St. Jean-Baptiste, when hundreds of young Montrealers piled into cars and, waving fleur-de-lis banners and beer bottles, happily honked and blocked traffic most of the night. **********They were as noisily exuberant as Brazilians after a victorious soccer match, but they were celebrating the sobering prospect of a more autonomous state. **********''You would never see 200,000 people take to the streets of Toronto to celebrate being Ontarian,'' Jean-Claude Rivest, an adviser to Premier Robert Bourassa of Quebec, said with relish.

Like Landmark, Downey Savings and Loan, a Newport Beach, Calif., institution, has a substantial real estate operation that has performed well for more than 30 years. Nevertheless, it, too, has begun selling assets to meet new rules governing the savings industry's activities in the real estate business. Included in the rules are stricter capital requirements and higher loan-loss reserve standards. **********Bruce W. Harting, a savings and loan analyst with Salomon Brothers, said it took at least six months after the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 for most savings and loans with large real estate operations to realize that it would be advantageous to divest immediately, rather than to wait until July 1994, as the law allows. Now, many of those companies are bringing their portfolios to market. **********Executives at Landmark, which owns its properties through Oak Tree Savings, a Louisiana-based savings and loan association, acknowledged that the forced sale of its real estate would probably cause the company to dispose of properties below market value to avoid falling short of the new capital requirements. **********''When I first realized what the regulations would mean, I was paralyzed,'' said Gerald G. Barton, chairman and chief executive of Landmark. ''I could not believe this would happen. Why would anyone want to disband one of the best real estate companies in the world?'' **********Downey has easily met all the capital requirements established by the new regulations, but must still sell parts of its portfolio to meet rules that govern what types of real estate investments a savings institution may make. **********Executives at Downey say they realized that later this year and into next a flood of commercial properties would reach the market as savings and loan associations rushed to sell their portfolios and as the Resolution Trust Corporation - the Federal agency charged with financing the Government's rescue of the savings and loan industry - begain selling properties seized from insolvent institutions. So Downey started liquidating its $560 million real estate portfolio early this year. **********So far, the company said that it had sold seven shopping centers for more than $85 million, giving it a $20 million profit, and that it was negotiating the sale of five others, which could bring another $10 million. Its investment in residential properties remains largely in loans to developers. **********''Downey particularly, and to a lesser extent Landmark, are in enviable positions because they have relatively strong balance sheets,'' said Bert Ely, president of Ely & Associates, a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., and an expert on the savings industry. ''But they are more the exception than the rule among these institutions.'' **********It is Oak Tree's balance sheet that makes Mr. Ely somewhat cautious about Landmark's position. It may turn out that Landmark will need a significant gain on the sale of its real estate assets to absorb losses that may appear down the road in Oak Tree's operations. The company has had large losses on its mobile home operations, it has about $1.2 billion of mortgages on raw land, and questions may arise later about the adequacy of its reserves because of other concerns, like the amount of good will on its books and the amount of money it has moved to its service corporation. **********Depending on the amount of its future losses, Landmark's capital position could deteriorate, requiring a capital infusion from the sale of properties. **********One factor that weighs heavily on the financial condition of savings institutions is whether they are in residential or commercial development and in what markets. **********''Most of the S.& L. companies with real estate development facilities are West Coast companies,'' said Mr. Harting of Salomon Brothers, ''and the residential building market there is still good.'' **********Mr. Harting said he expected significant premiums for the sale of residential development subsidiaries because of the relative strength of the California housing market. The commercial market is more difficult, he said, but it is still a little too early to determine just how much discounting will be necessary in the second half of this year. **********Among the many other California savings units that are now marketing their portfolios are Great American Bank, a San Diego-based company, which is suffering from a large exposure to the depressed Arizona market; GlenFed Inc., a troubled Glendale, Calif., company that is also trying to unload its development subsidiary, and CalFed, the nation's fourth-largest savings unit."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/15/world/a-religious-party-holds-shamir-fate.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Brinkley", "pub_date": "1990-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1273, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A RELIGIOUS PARTY HOLDS SHAMIR FATE", "print_headline": "A RELIGIOUS PARTY HOLDS SHAMIR FATE", "body_text": " **********The fate of the Israeli Government and its peace initiative lies in the hands of a small, rigorously Orthodox religious party that won 1.5 percent of the vote in the last national elections. **********''I can tell you, I feel very uncomfortable about this,'' Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, head of the Torah Flag Party, said this afternoon as Labor and Likud leaders courted his favor. On Thursday morning the Parliament votes on a motion of no confidence in the Government that will, if the motion passes, bring Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Government to an end. If the motion fails, however, it will confirm Mr. Shamir as the leader of a narrow, right-wing government without the Labor Party. **********As it stood this afternoon, the Labor Party seemed likely to get votes from 60 of the 120 members of Parliament. Likud seemed likely to get 58 votes, leaving the decision in the hands of Rabbi Ravitz and his little party that got only 34,279 of the more than 2.3 million votes cast in November 1988. **********Heavy Price Proposed **********And tonight, the rabbi told Mr. Shamir that he would give Likud his vote, but at a heavy price: Likud would have to accept the American terms for starting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, even though Mr. Shamir has already rejected them. And the Prime Minister would have to allow all the Labor ministers, who were dismissed or resigned on Tuesday, back into the Cabinet - a price Mr. Shamir was unlikely to pay. **********Under Israel's political system, this party, which has only two members in Parliament, was able to set such conditions as the Prime Minister's price to stay in power. Late this evening, Mr. Shamir had not responded. **********But whatever may come of Torah Flag's offer and the nation's Government crisis, it seems most likely that Israel's peace intiative, and the American proposal for advancing it, will move forward little if at all. **********If the next Government is headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, he will almost certainly remain unalterably opposed to moving forward with the plan, even though he is the one who originally proposed it a year ago. **********Protests From Right Feared **********But even if the next Government is headed by the Labor leader, Shimon Peres, an advocate of the talks, many people here agree that his government would not be able to do much more than talk to a Palestinian delegation. If talks moved beyond that, the protests from the right would grow so strong that Mr. Peres's fragile, narrow government probably could not survive. **********For today, however, the decision on the nation's direction lay with Rabbi Ravitz. If Mr. Shamir refuses his terms and Torah Flag does in fact vote in favor of Labor's no-confidence motion, or if it abstains, then the Shamir Government will fall. **********But if Mr. Shamir gives in and Torah Flag votes in favor of Likud, then the motion will end in a tie, meaning it fails. That will enable Mr. Shamir to control the Government. **********''We shouldn't have to make the decision for the whole nation as such a small party,'' Rabbi Ravitz said. But the rabbi's quandary is the product of the deep divisions in Israeli society that keep the nation and its Government from being able to make decisions. Without a consensus, Israel's proportional-representation electoral system produces government after government so riven with disagreement that it cannot act. **********Change in Mood Sensed **********Before the last national elections in November 1988, Israelis were united in their desire not to see another Labor-Likud coalition government, so poorly had the last one functioned. But after the elections, faced with the specter of a narrow Government dominated by religious parties, Israelis demanded a new ''national unity'' Government. **********Now, 15 months later, the second Labor-Likud Government is about to end, and it has been able to accomplish even less than the first one. Though there has been no accurate reading of the public's temperament, Labor and Likud leaders say they believe the mood has changed again. **********In December 1988, as the Labor-Likud coalition agreement was being worked out after weeks of embarrassing negotiation with the religious parties, about 50,000 people held a boisterous rally in a Tel Aviv park urging electoral reform. **********Most of them were angry at the terms the religious parties were demanding as the price for joining a narrow Government - the closing of restaurant and movie theaters nationwide on the Sabbath, an expansion of military-service exemptions for the Orthodox and a redefinition of who is considered Jewish under Israeli law, a demand that so angered the American Jewish community that it now seems to have been dropped. **********Peace and Electoral Change **********The demands so angered the public that when the Government was formed, Labor and Likud leaders concurred in their written coalition agreement that the top two priorities would be to work toward peace, and to change the electoral system to dilute the power of small parties and end the perpetual Governmental stalemate. **********A joint Labor-Likud Parliamentary committee was formed and it was decided that the principal problem, as the committee saw it, was that the vote threshold for a seat in Parliament was too low. Only about 20,000 votes are needed to win a seat, guaranteeing that small parties will fill Parliament. **********That denies Labor and Likud the ability to build a government without becoming allies of several smaller parties that have different goals and agendas and can at any time withdraw support if their interests are not met, meaning that the narrow coalitions are inherently unstable. **********The electoral reform committee drafted a bill that raised the vote threshold for election to more than double the present level, and at first it seemed to garner considerable support. But last spring the bill fell victim to the very pressures that motivated the legislators to draft it. **********Religious party politicians lobbied heavily against it, afraid that the new system would dilute their power. The secular politicians succumbed, afraid that the religious parties might not support them if the reform bill failed and they were in need of coalition partners again. The bill died. ---- Kollek Cites Bush's Assurance LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) -Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem said today he had received assurances from President Bush that the United States still opposed any division of Israel's capital. **********At a news conference during a visit to London, Mayor Kollek released a letter from the White House in which President Bush restated the United States policy on Jerusalem, which has been to oppose a division of the city and to promote talks over its future. **********''The basis of our position is that Jerusalem must never again be a divided city,'' said the letter, dated Tuesday. ''We did not approve of the status quo before 1967; in no way do we advocate it now. This was and is my policy.'' **********President Bush recently struck a new note in United States statements on Israel by condemning Jewish settlement of East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel after the 1967 Middle East war and now a mixture of Arabs and Jews. **********Palestinians view Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and most countries, including the United States, do not recognize Israel's annexation of the eastern sector of the city."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/business/economic-scene-the-2-front-battle-facing-moscow.html": {"writer_name": "Leonard Silk", "pub_date": "1990-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 978, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene;   The 2-Front Battle Facing Moscow", "print_headline": "Economic Scene;   The 2-Front Battle Facing Moscow", "body_text": " **********LITHUANIA'S struggle for independence from the Soviet Union has virtually blotted out from public attention President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision earlier this month to accept the advice of his liberal advisers and move rapidly to establish the basis for a market economy. A set of decrees is expected shortly from the Government on paving the way. But the battle to keep the Soviet empire from disintegrating could cause Mr. Gorbachev again to delay his plans for a radical reform of the system. **********Prof. Abram Bergson of Harvard, an authority on the Soviet economy, has said Mr. Gorbachev may be approaching the point where President Roosevelt was in 1941, when ''Dr. New Deal'' had to give way to ''Dr. Win the War.'' But for Mr. Gorbachev, winning the war - as various nationalities seek to secede - means rescuing the economy at the same time. For the economic crisis is worsening the nationalities crisis. **********The Soviet leader's problem is vastly different from Roosevelt's near the outbreak of World War II, when an underemployed market economy, not fully recovered from the Great Depression, could respond vigorously to the pressures of rapidly rising Government wartime demand. **********By contrast, the Soviet Union has an economy so bureaucratic, so lacking in incentives, so demoralized that it could not possibly respond to an increase in demand. The last thing it needs is an increase in demand; it is already suffering from vastly excessive public and private demand, with an enormous budget deficit and a bloated, but largely hoarded money supply, ready to explode into inflation. **********Official Soviet statistics show household savings deposits at 338 billion rubles, but there is a huge, unknown volume of rubles in private hands, believed to be 100 billion to 300 billion. Edgar L. Feige, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, puts the ruble overhang at 1.1 to 1.6 times the annual retail sales of the Soviet Union. To prevent a runaway inflation, if price controls were suddenly lifted, that ruble overhang needs to be mopped up. Mr. Feige believes that can best be done by undertaking a program of ''Socialist privatization'' to lay the groundwork for subsequent market reforms. **********In the first stage of this process, he holds, the constitution should grant and guarantee private property rights; in the second stage, the Government should relinquish ownership of the means of production, which many critics see as the real root of both inefficiency and dictatorship, and redistribute the nation's wealth, in the form of shares in state enterprises, agricultural resources and the housing stock, to its citizens. **********The surplus money collected by the sale of state assets to citizens, and to state and local governments, business enterprises, and foreign investors, would be sterilized, or withheld from circulation. Once monetary balance was restored and citizens provided with income-earning assets to ''buffer'' subsequent economic adjustments, the stage would be set for ending price controls, permitting the price-and-profit system to play its critical information and incentive roles. **********''Socialist privatization'' would obviously not guarantee each citizen equality of outcome but equality of opportunity, a ''level playing field'' at the start of the market system. It would be, in effect, like the start of a new game of ''Monopoly,'' when shares (instead of money) would be divided up equally, though in the longer run there would be unequal distribution of wealth and income, as the assets were better employed by some players, in competition with others. In fact, the real name of the game would be ''Anti-Monopoly,'' to end the monopoly power of state-owned and controlled resources and enterprises. **********But will Soviet citizens accept the inequality of income? Many experts contend that a major obstacle to growth is that the Russian people traditionally have been and still are envious of anyone who makes more money than they do. Prof. Wassily W. Leontief, the Nobel laureate in economics at New York University, says, ''They don't like anybody who makes profits.'' **********But this may be changing, as indicated by the first comprehensive survey of Soviet attitudes, conducted in interviews ranging from one to one and a half hours with 2,485 Soviet citizens in both urban and rural areas. The survey was directed by Ellen Mickiewitz of Emory University, a professor of economics and a Carter Center fellow, and other emigre scholars based at American universities. They found that 84 percent of the Soviet citizens interviewed favored the ''reform'' idea of permitting greater income inequality, while only 11 percent favored the ''traditional'' idea of income equality. **********The respondents were split evenly, however, between those who held that ''the State should be mainly responsible for people's success and well-being'' and those who agreed with the statement that ''people should look out for themselves, decide for themselves what to do for success in life.'' **********Clearly, if an uncertain and divided public, who is nevertheless ready for change and willing to accept inequality, is to be brought together in support of a market system, and energized to produce more, they will need to get not more rhetoric from the top but a real personal stake through ownership of the means of production. **********In effect, this calls for a new revolution, and Mr. Gorbachev will have to take greater risks and show greater decisiveness in leading it. If he fails to do so, his entire effort at economic and political modernization may collapse and hasten the disintegration of the Soviet Union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/13/world/upheaval-in-the-east-us-and-soviets-confident-as-trade-talks-open.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1990-02-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  U.S. and Soviets Confident as Trade Talks Open", "print_headline": "UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;   U.S. and Soviets Confident as Trade Talks Open", "body_text": " **********The United States and the Soviet Union opened talks today on ending nearly a half-century of trade restrictions.

Mr. Bush's decision to seek a trade agreement, which was announced at the summit meeting in Malta in December, is a sign of American support for Mr. Gorbachev's economic and political reforms. **********''We got off to a good, fast start,'' said a senior official at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, speaking at the end of the first day of negotiations. **********The United States team is being led by the Trade Representative, Carla A.

The 12-nation European Community's program to turn itself into a single market of 325 million consumers by the end of 1992 had started an investment boom. Higher spending generated by German reunification and the rebuilding of Eastern Europe promised to keep Western Europe's economy growing. **********The expectation among economists and oil companies is that the price of oil will stabilize at $23 to $25 a barrel - provided President Saddam Hussein of Iraq decides not to challenge the American-led forces in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. **********While those prices are about one-third more than those of a few weeks ago, ''oil prices would have to be a lot higher to put Europe into a recession,'' said Peter Gutmann, an economist at the National Westminster Bank, one of Britain's largest banks. Only a major disruption that sent prices beyond $40 a barrel could bring European expansion to a standstill, he said. **********But that analysis by no means suggests that Europe will feel no pain. Oil at $23 to $25 a barrel will reduce economic growth in Western Europe by as much as one-half percentage point over a year and will increase inflation by one-half to 1 percentage point, most economists agree. The effects of such changes would quickly become apparent. **********Economists now expect the average inflation rate for Western Europe to edge up to 5.5 or 6 percent by year-end, from about 5 percent now. Economic growth is expected to be about 2.5 percent in 1991, compared with the previously expected growth of about 3 percent. Last year, Western Europe's economy grew 3.5 percent. **********There are a number of reasons why the oil crisis will not be felt as severely as the oil shocks of the 1970's. **********For one thing, this increase is not nearly as great as those in the past. In 1973, prices quadrupled when Arab members of OPEC embargoed oil shipments to the United States and some of its allies. In 1979, after the fall of the Shah of Iran, prices doubled. **********In addition, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the price of oil has fallen dramatically since the early 1980's, when it peaked at about $60 a barrel in today's dollars. **********Western Europe has also become much more energy efficient. ''Oil consumption relative to economic growth is much less than it was,'' said William P. Ledward, an economist at Nomura Research Institute Ltd., the London-based research arm of the Japanese securities firm. That dependency has dropped by about 30 percent since 1980, he estimates. **********Strong Forces Behind Growth **********Economists also think Western Europe is in better shape to weather higher oil prices because strong forces are behind its growth. These include the 1992 program and German reunification. **********What happens to West Germany, whose gross national product accounts for 25 percent of the European Community's, matters a great deal to Western Europe. West Germany's growth is expected to slow to 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 1991 from 4 percent this year. But economists say they are not worried. **********With German reunification, ''the strongest impetus for growth in Europe is the acceleration of domestic demand in Germany,'' said John Lipsky, director of international research at Salomon Brothers in London. **********A growing number of economists expect the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to lead an interest rate increase on the continent to make sure that the higher oil prices and heavy public spending related to German reunification do not ignite inflation, now 2.4 percent. **********They say the Bundesbank could raise rates by a half to three-quarters of a percentage point within three to six months, which would increase short-term German rates to as much as 9 percent. That means the dollar, which has recently been weakening, could fall during the next six months to perhaps as low as 1.50 marks, from near 1.60 marks now. **********Economists in Western Europe are also confident that the higher oil price will not mean a return to the days of raging inflation. One reason, they say, is that central bankers will act more decisively this time to make sure inflation does not take hold. **********In addition, labor markets are not as tight as they were in 1973 and 1979 in many countries, making it less likely that higher oil prices will set off a wage-price spiral as they did in the past. Although the level of wage increases has been rising in Britain in particular, and to a lesser extent in West Germany and Italy, economists had already been expecting a moderation next year. **********While Britain's unemployment is now a low 5.7 percent, it is beginning to rise. And reunification with East Germany will ease some labor shortages in West Germany, where unemployment is 7.1 percent. In addition, unions are much weaker in countries like Britain and France than they were in the 1970's. **********''I don't think the rise in inflation is going to be a self-generating problem,'' said George A. Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in London. **********Impact Will Vary **********While Western Europe as a whole is in good shape to weather the higher oil prices, the effect will vary from country to country. **********The impact will be somewhat less in France, for example, which gets a relatively large portion of its electricity from nuclear power plants. Italy is more vulnerable because its power plants burn more oil. Energy-producing countries like Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands will be even better off, said Mr. Ledward of Nomura. **********Britain, with its North Sea oil fields, is a small net exporter of oil. That means the higher oil prices should have a positive, if minor, effect on its trade balance, which has been deeply in the red. **********On the other hand, Britain's economy is currently the weakest of any major country in Western Europe, and its inflation, at 9.8 percent, the highest. A base interest rate of 15 percent has already caused a recession in the commercial and residential real estate markets, and the Confederation of British Industry had warned that the manufacturing sector was on the verge of a recession even before Iraq invaded Kuwait. **********European Monetary System **********Because they expect Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government to ease interest rates, many economists expect Britain to avoid a recession. As a matter of fact, they think the higher oil prices will cause the Government to lower interest rates sooner rather than later and to join the European Monetary System, which would tie the pound to the mark. **********The Conservative Government has to hold an election by July 1992, and probably would like to hold one next year if possible. That means getting the economy moving again. And if the Bundesbank raises interest rates, economists reason, Mrs. Thatcher will have to join the European Monetary System so she can lower British rates without causing the value of the pound to plummet. **********British Credibility **********Although lowering rates is often inflationary, tying the pound to the mark would give Britain credibility in the financial markets in connection with its willingness to fight inflation. **********Mrs. Thatcher has promised to join the system, whose member currencies are managed so their value relative to one another does not radically change. So far Mrs. Thatcher has had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to join the system. She has no desire to see the European Commmunity become a United States of Europe and she fears that proposals to create a single European currency and a central bank will be a big step toward just that. **********During the summer, John Major, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, made comments that have led analysts to believe that Britain would join the system in the fall. The higher oil prices, said Christopher Dillow, a Nomura economist, ''mean we're still on course.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/26/world/upheaval-in-the-east-a-former-kgb-chief-champions-azerbaijanis.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1990-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 970, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Upheaval in the East;   A Former K.G.B.

Aliyev passed through the Moscow office of the Azerbaijani republic this afternoon, a turbulent crowd fell silent and men were startled from their seats, nodding and muttering ''salaam aleikhem'' to the tall, trim figure in navy blue pinstripes. **********Mr. Aliyev, the former head of the Azerbaijani K.G.B., was for 14 years the Communist Party boss of Azerbaijan. Until he suffered a heart attack and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev retired him in 1987, he served as a tenacious old-guard member of the ruling Politburo. **********This week he was back from obscurity to remark upon the violent upheaval in his former domain, declaring his deep sympathy with the insurgent Azerbaijani Popular Front and condemning Mr. Gorbachev's decision to send soldiers and tanks into Baku. **********''The absolute majority of the population is behind the Popular Front,'' he said today during an hourlong interview at the republic's headquarters, now the front's Moscow bastion. **********Defends 'People's Movement' **********Mr. Gorbachev's decision to use force, he said, has cost needless bloodshed and ''strained the situation in Azerbaijan to the limit.'' **********''The situation before the troops were brought in there represented absolutely no threat, either to perestroika or to Gorbachev,'' Mr. Aliyev said. ''It was a people's movement, which developed during the past few years, and I think there was no threat here at all.'' **********Mr. Aliyev's emergence as a critic, unusual in a society where retired leaders generally stay retired, suggested that Mr. Gorbachev's enemies at least sense his vulnerability. **********''Now a lot of things are unpredictable,'' the 66-year-old Communist said. He was evidently relishing Mr. Gorbachev's predicament, if not actually offering himself for a political comeback. **********Mr. Gorbachev and his Kremlin colleagues ''should have had a dialogue with the Popular Front,'' he said. ''They should have spent as much time as possible discussing the situation, and they should not have permitted the difficulties that took shape now.'' **********Blames the Armenians **********''Serious mistakes have been made in the area of ethnic policy,'' Mr. Aliyev said. He declined to make a more general assessment of the Soviet leader's policies. When he was in the Politburo, he was not regarded as an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Gorbachev. **********Mr. Aliyev said that Azerbaijan's slide into chaos began two years ago, when Armenians laid claim to the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the republic, where most of the population is Armenian. He complained that Mr. Gorbachev had failed to ''nip it in the bud.'' **********''If we want to talk about pogroms, pogroms started two years ago,'' he said when asked about the recent house-to-house attacks on Armenians in Baku. ''In Nagorno-Karabakh, they started killing Azerbaijanis and expelling them from their homes and their lands. And that was done by extremists of Armenian nationality.'' **********Although the Soviet press now portrays him as a former Brezhnev sycophant and the boss of a political machine, Mr. Aliyev seems to command some affection among the Popular Front loyalists. **********It may be simply a case of sharing common enemies, especially Mr. Gorbachev but also the Armenians, who have seized upon the Soviet President's program of political liberalization to press their claim to Nagorno-Karabakh. **********Denies Long Links to Front **********''Aliyev?'' mused one young Azerbaijani as the ex-leader passed through the hall today. ''I'll tell you, I lived in Armenia, and they wrote so critically of him there that he must have done something right.'' **********Mr. Aliyev's open support for the front may also lend credence to accusations, widely heard from Baku intellectuals disenchanted with the Popular Front, that it has forged an opportunistic alliance with remnants of the old Aliyev political machine in Azerbaijan. **********Mr. Aliyev said he has not set foot in Azerbaijan since 1984 and had never met members of the front before Sunday, when he dropped in here to express his condolences and to offer his voice in protest. **********The former Azerbaijani leader said that although some Popular Front leaders are calling for withdrawal from the Soviet Union, he is firmly convinced that secession does not have widespread popular support. **********A Mixed Reputation **********Mr. Aliyev rose through the internal police and headed the party in his republic from 1969 until 1982, when Yuri V. Andropov, then the Soviet leader, brought him to Moscow. **********He built a reputation as a corruption fighter. But since his resignation, several newspapers have published allegations by the former chief prosecutor of Azerbaijan that Mr. Aliyev supervised a corrupt political machine and fended off Kremlin scrutiny by lavishing Brezhnev with extravagant gifts and praise. He was also accused of having dodged the draft in World War II. **********Today Mr. Aliyev dismissed all of those accusations as fabrications and slanders. **********He said he had been ''isolated from any political life'' during his retirement, and that no one in Moscow or in Azerbaijan had called for his advice in the two years since Armenians and Azerbaijanis began fighting anew over Nagorno-Karabakh. **********Nonetheless, he said, ''I knew and I still know the situation in Azerbaijan better than anyone else.'' **********He was asked if he foresees a new political role for himself - a prospect considered unlikely but not unthinkable, in view of the populist resurrection of the deposed Moscow party chief, Boris N. Yeltsin. **********''You know, I haven't thought about this question,'' he said. ''Well, first of all, no one has asked me. And secondly, the situation is so difficult now, I just don't know.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/19/business/the-media-business-advertising-4th-account-lost-by-chiat.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1990-09-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 136, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  4th Account Lost by Chiat", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;   4th Account Lost by Chiat", "body_text": " **********Chiat/Day/Mojo lost another account yesterday, its fourth major loss this year. **********Cluett, Peabody awarded its $10 million Arrow Shirts account to Ammirati & Puris, New York.

A power spike can make the PC see stars for a few seconds without causing permanent harm, but anything in the working memory that has not been stored is knocked out. *********** Get a good power-line conditioner - commonly called a surge supressor - and install it between the power outlet and the PC. Consider the Masterpiece Plus ($159.95 from Kensington Microware Inc.) ''We strongly recommend surge protection,'' said Ms. Richardi of Con Edison. *********** Consider getting an uninterruptible power system. These devices, which cost several hundred to several thousand dollars, are standby battery systems that detect when power has failed and, faster than a blink, provide standby power. The user then has time to save important files. Such devices used to be bulky and expensive, but like everything else in the computer industry they are becoming smaller, more powerful and less expensive. For an individual PC, prices start at $350. The device will also power a lamp during a blackout. *********** Make sure the PC is not plugged into the same power line that services an air conditioner or other power-hungry electrical device. Each time the air conditioner kicks on, it sends a spike along the line. Ask the electrician about ''clean'' lines. *********** Get a good hard-disk diagnostic program and use it. Such programs can often alert the user to potential hard-disk problems, and, in some cases, they perform minor software surgery to correct problems. Disk Technician Advanced ($149 from Prime Solutions Inc.) is our choice for the PC side. *********** Make sure the PC has proper ventilation. Overheating can cause all sorts of errors. *********** Summer heat usually leads to iced tea or ice cream in the office. Be careful. The computer doesn't like those any better than it does hot coffee, especially when they drip onto the keyboard. *********** In offices where windows are left open, try to protect the PC from grime and other contaminants. Grit and grime, even particles of cigarette smoke, can get inside the PC and cause overheating. (In some areas of the country, ants can be a problem, too. Southern fire ants are attracted by electrical currents and are notorious for gnawing the insulation off wires and cables.) What's more, some people find an open window an invitation to carry out a computer. *********** Shut off the PC when a storm looms. A lightning strike nearby can send a 5,000-volt fast ball down nearby power lines. A good surge supressor can block the blow, but it may give up its life in the process. Unplugging the PC is the best way to guard against a blowout. **********By far the most important rule is to make backups more frequently. That has been said here before, but an astonishing number of PC users never do it. And those who do make backups should amend their habits for the summer. Businesses that back up their disks weekly should consider a midweek backup as well. And companies that back up at the end of the day are using a time that coincides with the arrival home of many workers who crank up the air conditioning. That leads to increased electrical demand and subsequent brownouts or power dips. Better to back up early and often. If all this seems too much, consider Cosmo Lee, a programmer and computer consultant to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, who has brought forth a timely idea. Mr. Lee said recently that he thought many companies spent more money hiring plant-watering services than they invested in protecting the hard disks in their computers. Granted, healthy plants can make the office a very pleasant place to work, but Mr. Lee thought that backups should get at least as much attention as begonias. **********So he began PC Backup Services Inc. in New York City (telephone 212-PC-GUARD). For a fee that he says is only slightly higher than that of a plant-watering service, PC Backup Services will take over a company's hard-disk backup and diagnostic program. Its employees run diagnostic software to identify potential hard-disk problems, install backup software, perform two sets of verified backups and install data recovery software. **********The initial fee is $150 for each PC, plus the cost of floppy disks. Then, once a week, the PC Backup Services team will come back to update the backups and run the disk diagnosis. The weekly fee ranges from $15 to $10 for each computer - the more PC's, the lower the fee. **********PC Backup Services hands the backup diskettes to the owner in a sealed plastic bag and urges that at least one copy be kept off-site, as extra insurance in the case of fire, flood or theft. And, if anything should go wrong with the hard disk, a hot-line phone call will bring the team back to install the backups on a new hard disk. **********So far, the service is available in New York, Boston and Washington, Mr. Lee said. But it seems only a matter of time before he or other entrepreneurs go national."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/world/ex-military-ruler-returns-to-seoul.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-12-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 453, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EX-MILITARY RULER RETURNS TO SEOUL", "print_headline": "EX-MILITARY RULER RETURNS TO SEOUL", "body_text": " **********Chun Doo Hwan, the disgraced former President who led an authoritarian government for eight years ending in 1988, returned to his home in Seoul today after two years in voluntary internal exile. **********Mr. Chun returned to the capital from an isolated Buddhist temple in the mountains of eastern Korea where he had retreated in November 1988, after publicly apologizing for official corruption and other abuses committed during his years in power. Mr. Chun was a general in the Korean army when he became President in 1980 after a military coup. **********Hundreds of police officers were posted around Mr. Chun's home to prevent violent demonstrations by leftist students demanding that the Government prosecute him. **********There was only one demonstration today, by about 20 students at a university nearby. They chanted anti-Chun slogans at the campus gates before dispersing peacefully. **********Hundreds of Mr. Chun's supporters, including Buddhist monks bused in for the event, applauded as his car, accompanied by a police escort, reached his house.  Departure Scene Quite Different **********When the Mr. Chun and his wife last saw their home, it was besieged by thousands of student demonstrators calling for punishment of the former president. **********The previous year, in the face of persistent and often violent demonstrations on the streets of Seoul by students opposed to the military Government, Mr. Chun had agreed to relinquish power to a president elected by popular ballot. **********Mr. Chun spoke briefly to supporters before leaving the temple 90 miles northeast of Seoul with his wife, Lee Soon Ja.

The embattled fruit, electronics and services conglomerate was one of Britain's fastest-growing companies in the 1980's. **********The company's troubles have riveted the attention of the City, as London's financial district is known, and have reportedly brought high-level international talks involving Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Turgut Ozal of Turkey. **********After a meeting today with Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's chairman and chief executive, the British-led group of banks and insurance companies agreed to extend until Nov. 9 a moratorium on debt repayments. Lenders had granted a one-week moratorium on Oct. 5. Polly Peck at one point in recent weeks suspended payments to its creditors. **********'Considering Our Options' **********The company declined today to say whether it was considering selling any assets. ''We're considering our options, which obviously include the sale of some of our assets,'' a spokesman said. ''There are no sacred cows.'' **********Several Turkish banks have also agreed to help Polly Peck by providing it with an unspecified amount of money, Reuters reported today. ''We have agreed in principle to extend short-term credits of up to one year to Polly Peck subsidiaries in Turkey,'' Burhan Karacam, general manager of Yapi Kredi Bank, a large private Turkish bank, told the news agency. **********A large portion of Polly Peck's operations are in Turkey and the Turkish section of Cyprus. Mr. Nadir, a native Turkish Cypriot who is now a British citizen, is a friend of President Ozal and owns two of Turkey's leading newspapers. **********The company's stock price plunged 55.6 percent on the London Stock Exchange on Sept. 20 with the disclosure of an inquiry by the British Government's Serious Fraud Office into the possibility of illegal trading in Polly Peck stock. Mr. Nadir, who is 49 years old, has denied involvement in any illegal activities. **********After the plunge, the banks withdrew some lines of credit and refused to roll over some loans that had come due, creating the liquidity crisis. Some $:200 million ($394.9 million) in debt falls due in the last three months of this year. **********Polly Peck has repeatedly stressed that its operations are profitable. In the first half of this year, the company had pretax profits of $:110.5 million ($193.2 million) on sales of $:880.7 million ($1.54 billion). **********In a brief statement today, the company said its British-led lenders had agreed to give it a four-week breather until Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, the accounting firm, completes a report on its condition. **********''Polly Peck would then hope for a significant extension to enable an orderly reorganization to take place,'' the company said. ''Lenders are not unsympathetic to this, but any commitment must wait until the report is available.'' **********Mr. Nadir, who immigrated with his family to Britain in the 1960's, started out with a small garment company, He bought control of Polly Peck, then a tiny textile company, in 1980. Mr. Nadir has turned Polly Peck into a conglomerate whose businesses include fruit, electronics, Pizza Hut restaurants in Turkey and hotels. **********In December, Polly Peck completed the purchase of the Del Monte fruit business from RJR Nabisco Inc., making it the world's largest distributor of pineapples and the third-largest of bananas. $110 Million for Sansui In January, Polly Peck injected $110 million into the Sansui Electric Company, a Japanese consumer-electronics concern, in return for a 51 percent stake. That stake was increased to 72 percent, when Polly Peck combined Sansui with two of its other consumer electronics units. **********During the 1980's, Polly Peck was the best-performing British stock. In 1989, the company had pretax profits of $:161.4 million ($259.9 million) on revenues of $:1.16 billion ($1.87 billion). **********In an effort to raise money to satisfy bankers, Mr. Nadir has reportedly been trying to sell corporate and personal assets and to repatriate corporate funds from Turkish northern Cyprus. Some minor deals have been announced. **********He is said to have also approached the Turkish Government and Turkish banks about financial support. And as the crisis developed, Polly Peck's problems have become something of an international incident. **********In a letter signed by the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, the British Government warned the Turkish Government late last month that Polly Peck needed $:100 million ($197.5 million) in rescue money, according to The Financial Times. The British newspaper said Mr. Hurd was responding to a request by the Turkish Economics Minister, Gunes Taner, to ''hold things steady'' with the company's British-led lenders while it considered steps to help Polly Peck. **********Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Ozal were said to have discussed Polly Peck's difficulties late last month in New York, where they were attending a United Nations meeting. **********Turkish Cyprus Employer **********Polly Peck is believed to account for at least 20 percent of the gross national product of Turkish Cyprus and is the largest private employer, according to The Financial Times. Mr. Nadir has been stymied in his attempts to bring out of Turkish Cyprus half of some $:140 million ($276.4 million) in cash that the company has there, because the Turkish Cypriots lack hard foreign currency. **********Even before the liquidity crisis, Polly Peck had planned to reduce its high debt by floating stakes in various subsidiaries. As of June 30, it owed banks and other creditors a total of $:1.38 billion ($2.41 billion), including $:543.5 million ($950 million) due within a year. Its debt equaled 93 percent of equity. **********In June, Polly Peck sold 15 percent of Vestel Elektronik, a Turkish electronics company, on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. It has been considering floating parts of its Del Monte fruit operations. **********Polly Peck's problems date back to August, when Mr. Nadir jolted investors by announcing he planned to take the company private, only to change his plans less than a week later, causing the stock price first to rise and then drop sharply. His actions drew a reprimand from the London International Stock Exchange. **********But the real crisis began on Sept. 20, when it was disclosed that the Serious Fraud Office had raided the offices of an investment firm controlled by the Nadir family and had questioned Mr. Nadir. Polly Peck's stock price plunged, cutting the company's market value by $1.1 billion before trading was suspended. Trading has not resumed and the stock has lost its position on The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British companies. **********Collateral Sold by Banks **********It turned out that banks had contributed to the heavy selloff by selling some of Mr. Nadir's shares, which they were holding as collateral. The company later disclosed that both Polly Peck and Mr. Nadir were suffering from cash-flow problems. **********Mr. Nadir still owns 24 percent, or 106 million, of Polly Peck's shares. That is down from 28 percent, or 122 million shares, before the bank sales. At Polly Peck's last trading price of $:1.08 a share, Mr. Nadir's holding is worth $:114.5 million ($226 million). **********Before the crisis, Mr. Nadir's stake in Polly Peck, combined with other personal business interests, made him one of Britain's 50 richest people, according to The Sunday Times in London. In a report published on Sept. 16, four days before the crisis began, the paper ranked Mr. Nadir 36th, with a fortune of $:213 million, or $420.6 million at today's exchange rate."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/24/business/your-money-products-to-help-trim-tax-bills.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Your Money; Products to Help Trim Tax Bills", "print_headline": "Your Money; Products to Help Trim Tax Bills", "body_text": " **********A NUMBER of excellent books and computer programs are now available to help taxpayers whittle down their income-tax liabilities. Indeed, studying them can be a profitable way to spend part of a long holiday weekend, for after the first of the year little can be done to reduce 1990 taxes. **********In the remaining five weeks of the year, taxpayers can ask a number of questions and act on the answers, which vary with individual circumstances. These are among the questions taxpayers might ask: ***********With the top tax bracket going up to 31 percent in 1991, from 28 percent this year, would it be a good idea to accelerate income into 1990? ***********Would giving an appreciated asset, like stocks, to charity be advisable? For people not subject to the alternative minimum tax, the full market value is deductible. ***********Is more withholding needed to avoid a penalty for underpayment? ***********Can more money be put into a tax-deferred retirement account like an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, or should someone with income from self-employment establish a Keogh plan? **********The first step in answering these questions is to organize financial records well, and for people with an I.B.M. or compatible personal computer, the fastest, easiest, least-expensive way to do that is undoubtedly with Quicken, a personal finance program from Intuit. The new Version 4.0 tracks investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, certificates of deposit and collectibles, and provides performance reports, as well as the information on interest, dividends and capital gains needed for Schedule D of the tax return. The program lists for $59.95 and is widely available for about $35. **********For more detailed tax strategies, J. K. Lasser's Your 1991 Income Tax Software, which lists for $74.95, includes both the tax book \"J. K. Lasser's Your 1991 Income Tax,\" which has justifiably beenthe best-selling income-tax guide for generations, and a year-end tax planner program. Buyers may send in a coupon to get a free upgrade for the preparation program early next year after the I.R.S. makes available all the forms for filing 1990 returns. People who wait to buy that program will not get the planner. Companion programs for 24 states can be ordered for $29.95.

Lasser's Personal Tax Strategies 1991\" by David S. DeJong and Ann Gray Jakabcin (Pocket Books, $4.95, 349 pages) focuses on year-end strategies and begins with a tabular presentation that makes it easy to find the place in the book where one's particular problems and possible solutions are discussed. **********Another program that may be valuable for people who want an on-screen expert to guide them is Andrew Tobias's Tax Cut, from Meca Software Inc. It is written by Daniel Caine, a tax lawyer, who provides an easy question-and-answer format for novices, as well as a built-in audit function to check the return.

It is a companion to the firm's tax guide, which provides line-by-line instructions for filling out tax returns and which will be published later. **********Another valuable book is \"Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies for the $40,000-Plus Household\" (Prima Publishing, distributed by St. Martin's Press, $12.95, 278 pages). The first chapter is filled with year-end tips, and subsequent chapters consider topics like home sales, marriage and divorce, travel and moving expenses, child- or dependent-care expenses, charitable contributions, investments, audits, Social Security taxes and estate planning. Mr. Block is a lawyer who manages to avoid legalese in favor of concise, clear English. **********Price Waterhouse has also lent its name to tax-planning books and has moved from one in recent years to three well-documented books this year: \"The Price Waterhouse Personal Tax Adviser,\" which details year-end and year-round tax strategies; \"The Price Waterhouse Investors' Tax Adviser,\" and \"The Price Waterhouse Retirement Planning Adviser.\" The trilogy is published by Pocket Books at $5.50 each. **********\"The H & R Block 1991 Income Tax Guide\" (Collier Books, a division of Macmillan Publishing, $9.95) is a large-format, 512-page volume with instructions for filling out the 1990 return, as well as timely advice on the new tax law for next year and help in planning year-end strategies.

The participation of these three nations was taken as a sign that they would support important modifications of their laws and banking practices, although Bush Administration officials said they did not know if any changes would be imminent. **********The proposal calls for the elimination of anonymous bank accounts and accounts held in fictitious names. It also asks for greater international coordination among law enforcement and regulatory authorities. **********Numbered and anonymous accounts have long frustrated investigative efforts to track down drug money and have kept even bankers from knowing the source of funds. In attempting to peel away the layers of anonymity in some European banks and to put pressure on the bankers to change their rules, the recommendations represent a significant step in drug law enforcement. **********''It is the single most comprehensive, significant and forceful international declaration on money laundering to date,'' said John E. Robson, Deputy Treasury Secretary, who headed the American delegation. ''It is a clear recognition of the global nature of the problem and acknowledges the need for rapid and tough actions.'' **********The group also proposed an easing of bank secrecy laws to permit bankers to report suspicious deposits to authorities and called on prosecutors to develop cases against corporations - not just their employees - which engage in money laundering. The committee said bankers should be forbidden to tell customers when they are under investigation. **********The report is to be on the agenda at the meeting in Houston in July of the leaders of the Group of Seven - Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the United States and West Germany. Several of the eight other nations that participated in the study have long been identified as havens for illegal profits. In addition to Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg, the group includes Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. **********Although declarations by the Group of Seven are more often statements of desire and determination than commitments to change, they often lead to, or reinforce, changes in domestic economic policies. **********If adopted by the European countries, the proposals could encourage banking by drug traffickers in laundering havens in Latin America and the Caribbean that did not participate in the report. **********Set Up Last Year **********The study panel was set up last July at the annual meeting of the Group of Seven, even though all of the industrial nations have not yet ratified the Vienna Convention of 1988. That convention set out principles for multinational narcotics investigations and provided for treating money laundering as a crime and for extraditing money launderers in nations that signed the convention. **********Under the laws of seven of the nations in the study group, including the United States, money laundering is already treated as a crime. Four other nations are considering such legislation. Among the Group of Seven, only West Germany and Japan do not outlaw it. **********Congress is expected to strengthen the Federal law this year. The House is scheduled to vote next week on a bill that would set up a procedure for considering the revocation of the license or charter of a bank if it or an employee was convicted of money laundering. The measure is expected to be adopted; a similar proposal has been introduced in the Senate. $85 Billion Laundered Annually The report estimated that each year as much as $85 billion was laundered and reinvested from illegal profits from cocaine, heroin and marijuana. **********In recent years, a number of large international prosecutions have illustrated the use by drug traffickers of major banks and other financial institutions to conceal large amounts of illegal money and to repatriate profits abroad. Earlier this week, the Justice Department announced that it had ordered 173 banks in 23 states to produce the records of more than 750 accounts in a case involving the laundering of $1.2 billion through more than a half-dozen foreign countries. The banks were not accused of wrongdoing. **********There is also concern among some prosecutors and law enforcement officials that the integration of Europe's markets in 1992 will make it easier to launder money as national regulatory barriers are dropped and trading activity increases. **********Some Differences Expressed **********Several regulatory issues failed to gain unanimous support. For example, the report noted a division over whether banks should be required to report suspicious transactions. **********Nor did the report address other important areas, like regulating electronic transfers of money, in the effort to prevent the use of banks to hide narcotics proceeds. With increasing frequency, narcotics traffickers use these transfers to move their profits swiftly between accounts in different countries. Mr. Robson said the Treasury Department expected to complete by summer regulations announced last fall that could require greater record-keeping by banks and clearinghouses of electronic transfers. **********The study did not call for member nations to adopt the reporting requirements of American banks; currency reports must be filed for transactions of more than $10,000. That regulation has stirred considerable debate in a number of nations, most recently in Canada where the opposition has criticized the Government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for failing to adopt a proposal similar to American law. **********Rather, the report called upon member nations to ''consider the feasibility and utility'' of a system of reporting large currency transactions to a national central agency."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/28/business/merrill-lynch-settles-claims-from-250-million-87-loss.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 643, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Merrill Lynch Settles Claims From $250 Million '87 Loss", "print_headline": "Merrill Lynch Settles Claims From $250 Million '87 Loss", "body_text": " **********Merrill Lynch & Company and its insurers have quietly settled a set of claims filed after the brokerage firm stunned Wall Street by announcing in April 1987 that it had lost more than $250 million trading mortgage-backed securities, it was disclosed yesterday. **********In addition, the brokerage house has agreed to release more than $1 million in compensation, plus interest, that it had withheld from Howard A. Rubin, the senior trader Merrill had originally blamed for a substantial portion of the losses, which at the time were among the largest ever reported by a Wall Street firm. **********Merrill dismissed Mr. Rubin immediately after the losses occurred, disclosing that it had given the Securities and Exchange Commission information relating to allegedly unauthorized trading. Earlier this year, Mr. Rubin settled, without admitting or denying any guilt, an S.E.C. action charging that he had aided and abetted a record-keeping violation in connection with the disputed trades. **********The details of the settlement of claims arising from the mortgage-backed operation's losses were first released yesterday by George B. Yankwitt, an attorney for Mr. Rubin. Mr. Yankwitt also said that Merrill, as part of its agreement with his client, had further agreed to provide Mr. Rubin with ''a general release from all potential claims.'' **********Citing numerous news accounts three years ago in which Merrill executives blamed unauthorized trading by Mr. Rubin for the firm's losses, Mr. Yankwitt said, ''It is worth noting that these lawsuits are being settled without him paying anything and, indeed, with Merrill paying him. I consider this a complete vindication of Mr. Rubin's position, which is that he had not engaged in any unauthorized or wrongful trading.'' **********Monica Prihoda, a spokesman for Merrill, would not comment on the nature or details of the ''general release'' cited by Mr. Yankwitt as part of the settlement. But she confirmed that Merrill had received ''a significant payment of $17.5 million'' from the insurance companies that provide its directors and officers with liability coverage to settle various lawsuits, brought by Merrill shareholders on the firm's behalf. **********Those lawsuits had asserted that the Merrill losses were caused by Mr. Rubin, and that his supervisors, Brian Barefoot, Robert Andres and Greg Herschell, had failed to supervise his trading activities. **********''The settlement with Mr. Rubin was to resolve prior contractual claims unrelated to the trading loss,'' Ms. Prihoda said. As for assertions by Merrill shareholders about who was to blame for the losses, she said, ''Merrill Lynch believes all those allegations, except those relating to the conduct of Howard Rubin, to be completely without merit.'' **********'A Very Good Result' **********David A. P. Brower, one lawyer representing various Merrill shareholders who had filed ''derivative actions'' on the firm's behalf, said the plaintiffs were pleased that the settlement had enabled the firm to recover some of its trading losses. ''All the plaintiffs feel that this is a very good result,'' he added. The details of the agreement with Merrill's insurers had been approved by the New York Supreme Court early last month, he said. **********In addition to citing the trading losses, various Merrill shareholders had filed other claims on the firm's behalf against certain of its executives and officers, Mr. Brower said. These claims cited the lease agreement governing Merrill's office space in Battery Park City in New York, various transactions involving the defunct Baldwin-United Corporation, and Merrill's investment in a resort development in St. Thomas, in the United States Virgin Islands.

WSVN, the Fox affiliate in Miami, has a three-hour news program, starting at 6 A.M. **********And more competition is on the horizon. In January, the largest Fox affiliate, KTVU in San Francisco-Oakland, will begin a morning news program. The Fox stations are generally alone among independent stations in developing morning programs to compete with the networks. Most others broadcast cartoons and reruns from 7 to 9 A.M. **********A CBS executive said the Fox programs were cutting into the three networks' morning ratings. \"These independently produced local programs are making a dent,\" said David F. Poltrack, the CBS senior vice president for planning and research. **********\"There are two distinct groups who watch morning news programs,\" he said. \"The first is the 'on-your-way-outs,' who watch for 15 minutes on the way out to work, and the second is the housewife, home-based group, who watch the program from beginning to end. The news and information appetite is greatest for the on-your-way-out group, and locally produced programs probably serve them more.\" **********Mr. Poltrack said Fox probably took just under one rating point from the three networks in the morning. Advertising revenue at the Fox shows in the New York, Miami and Washington markets has put them on a par with NBC, ahead of CBS but still well below ABC stations.  No Plans for a Network Program **********Fox executives said they had no plans for a network program in the morning. Indeed, the key, they said, has been avoiding the network route. \"What we've discovered is, by having the locally produced morning shows, we have an alternative,\" said Ian Rae, the executive vice president of Fox News. \"If we do it by network, we become another one of those big heavy morning programs.\" **********In the early morning, a single ratings point can mean a difference of millions in revenue. In New York, where a ratings point represents about 70,438 households, local advertising rates for a 30-second commercial on the morning programs range from about $1,000 on \"Good Morning America\" to about $200 for \"CBS This Morning,\" station and advertising executives said. \"Today\" earns about $600 (half what it brought in a year ago), while \"Good Day New York\" gets about $450. The ABC, CBS and NBC programs have about 175 local spots a week, while Fox has 225 a week. **********Thus, Channel 7 is earning more than $9 million a year from \"Good Morning America,\" while Channel 2, which broadcasts \"CBS This Morning\" is probably getting less than $2 million. In between, \"Today,\" on Channel 4, earns about $5.5 million and Channel 5, the Fox station, earns about $5.3 million. The rates are down from a year ago, except those for \"Good Day New York,\" which are slightly higher. Different Strategies **********The strategy at WNYW, where \"Good Day New York\" had its premiere in August 1988, has been to emphasize local news and features. The Washington and Miami programs present much more hard news, including national and international reports from the Cable News Network and Conus, another news network. **********Carolyn Wall, the vice president and general manager of WNYW, said: \"We set out to create a morning show that was local, spontaneous and that would attract new viewers to morning television -- people who were not viewing because the networks were designed to play in Peoria, as opposed to a local show that would be snapshot of New York that day. It can be a model in terms of its philosophy and approach, but we could never export it.\" **********Even the name of the show is an in-joke, a reference to the Australian greeting often heard in the offices of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns Fox. **********\"Good Day New York\" evolved from a feature-oriented and somewhat goofy program into one that Joachim Blunck, the third and current executive producer, described as more serious, if still whimsical. In addition to its local news segments, the show features live interviews from the street and sex advice from Dr. Ruth Westheimer. It has a certain New York savvy that is proudly parochial.  Appealing to Young Viewers **********With their essentially upbeat, quick-paced formats, \"Good Morning America\" and \"Good Day New York\" appeal to the younger audiences loved by advertisers. \"Today\" -- which owned that audience until last year -- and \"CBS This Morning\" have also been trying to reach those viewers. **********Kimerly Montore, the vice president for news at WTTG and the head of news development for Fox, said the success, if not the style, of \"Good Day New York,\" led to the development of an early-morning news program in Washington. **********\"Washington is a very heavy news town,\" she said. \"We decided to be a hard, strong news and information program. We put the 'Good Day New York' concept into news makers and news events.\" **********The rationale at KTVU in Oakland is that viewers might prefer a live news program to the ABC, CBS and NBC offerings, which are three hours old by the time they are shown on the West Coast. 'Enormous Potential' **********Ms. Wall of WNYW said that as more local morning programs were developed at Fox stations, there would be increasing opportunities to attract national advertisers. **********\"For us to create a local morning environment has enormous potential,\" she said, \"because you can personalize your message in every market.\" The three key sponsors for \"Good Day New York,\" for example, are Tropicana, Maxwell House and Isuzu; Maxwell House recently made a long-term commitment to the WTTG show as well. **********\"You have to deal market by market,\" said Mr. Rae, the Fox News official. \"Our stations are providing an alternative to the established national programs. I think we've started something of a trend.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/25/world/anti-drug-effort-drags-outside-us.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1990-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANTI-DRUG EFFORT DRAGS OUTSIDE U.S.", "print_headline": "ANTI-DRUG EFFORT DRAGS OUTSIDE U.S.", "body_text": " **********Nearly two years after President Bush declared his war on drugs, Administration officials say they have made little progress toward blocking narcotics trafficking from Latin America into the United States. **********\"We've had a degree of success,\" said Melvyn Levitsky, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, \"but nowhere near what we want to have.\" **********Administration officials say better progress has been made on cutting demand for drugs. They say that drug consumption has been reduced among some sectors of American society and that this answers Latin American criticism that not enough is being done to tackle drug abuse at its true source -- the abuser. **********But the Administration's program, as outlined in a White House report to Congress in January, includes among its goals a reduction of imports of cocaine and other illegal drugs by 15 percent by the end of 1992 and by 60 percent by the end of the 1990's. Administration officials said they could not be sure if imports of cocaine, the drug that is exacting the greatest toll on the United States, had been cut by even 5 percent in the last year.  Shipments Redirected **********The officials noted that while they have succeeded in stemming nearly half of the cocaine trafficking through the Caribbean into Florida, statistics on drug seizures indicate that shipments have merely been redirected through Central America and Mexico into the American Southwest. **********John P. Walters, who will be acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy when William J. Bennett's resignation takes effect at the end of the month, acknowledged that \"there's the risk of failure\" in American efforts. **********\"These are countries with enormous economic and social problems,\" Mr. Walters said of the Latin American drug-producing nations. \"At times, we're working in areas where governments don't even exercise control.\" **********For example, Administration officials said that while the Colombian Government has made much progress interrupting the operations of the cocaine ring based in Medellin, Colombia, it has overlooked the growth of the country's other major cocaine ring, operating out of Cali. The disruption of the Medellin ring has also encouraged new drug gangs and coca cultivations to appear in Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela. **********\"It's like hitting mercury with a hammer,\" said a State Department official who deals with drug policy.  Panama Banking Laws an Issue **********The problem extends even to Panama, where the United States invaded 11 months ago to overthrow a Government allegedly linked to drug traffickers. American officials noted that the new Government is resisting attempts to rewrite banking secrecy laws that are utilized by drug money launderers. Panamanian officials insist that the current laws are more than adequate to prevent such abuses. **********Some officials said they worried that while the Administration concentrated on limiting cocaine production and shipments from the Andean countries, cultivation of heroin poppies was rising in Guatemala and Mexico. **********The Bush Administration approach links trade preferences to anti-narcotics efforts and emphasizes disrupting trafficking organizations by destroying processing labs over the more traditional approach, crop eradication. Central to its war on cocaine is the so-called Andean Initiative, a five-year, $2.2 billion aid program to break up cocaine production and trafficking organizations and strengthen local economies and government institutions. **********Administration officials said that the disruption of some trafficking has caused a substantial drop in coca leaf prices in parts of Bolivia and Peru, prompting some peasants to switch voluntarily to legal crops, and that a modest decrease in cocaine imports in some parts of the United States resulted in a decrease in the potency and an increased in the price of cocaine sold in several American cities. **********But American officials point to Peru as the toughest problem facing the Administration's drug war in Latin America. With 300,000 acres of land planted in coca and 200,000 peasants employed in its cultivation, Peru is by far the largest source of the raw material for cocaine. The Peruvian Army is reluctant to disrupt coca-growing for fear of driving the farmers into the arms of the leftist Shining Path guerrillas, and the rebels profit from the coca trade by taxing traffickers. **********A State Department official who recently traveled to Bolivia described visiting a farm owned by a peasant named Florencio in the Chapare coca-growing region. Florencio had destroyed more than 40 acres of coca plants in the last year in exchange for thousands of dollars in American economic aid, and now cultivates papayas, black pepper and macadamia nuts. **********But not all is going well at Florencio's farm. He and his family still live in a dilapidated shack. He complains that life was easier in the days when the cocaine middlemen used to come to him to buy coca leaves; now he has to drive his pickup truck four hours on bad roads to sell his produce. And he continues to grow a few acres of coca as a hedge. **********\"Florencio is the model but he is still not getting ahead,\" said the State Department official. \"He told us he made more money last year growing coca. It's discouraging.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/02/world/editor-s-note-outcry-erupts-jerusalem-post-over-new-publisher-s-editorial-bent.html": {"writer_name": "Sabra Chartrand", "pub_date": "1990-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Editor's Note;   Outcry Erupts at The Jerusalem Post Over New Publisher's Editorial Bent", "print_headline": "Editor's Note;   Outcry Erupts at The Jerusalem Post Over New Publisher's Editorial Bent", "body_text": " **********Journalists at The Jerusalem Post, Israel's only English-language newspaper, have mounted a drive to oust the paper's publisher of eight months, saying he is trying to turn the liberal daily into a platform for right-wing views. **********The Post's editor, Erwin Frenkel, resigned last Tuesday after the publisher, Yehuda Levy, a retired army colonel with no background in journalism, indicated that he had decided to take editorial control of the paper. The next day, The Post's news staff voted unanimously to call a strike in January. [Nine senior members of The Post's editorial staff, including the managing editor, David Landau, announced on Monday that they would resign in 30 days unless the publisher was replaced and Mr. Frenkel reinstated.]  Advocates Land for Peace The Jerusalem Post has a circulation of 25,000 on weekdays and 55,000 for its Friday weekend paper, and a circulation of 70,000 for its international weekly edition. It openly advocates territorial compromise with Israel's Arab enemies and has frequently published editorials criticizing the Government's handling of the two-year Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. **********While most of Israel's mass-circulation dailies are liberal in tone, The Post is generally more to the left than many of the others. **********The Post is widely read by diplomats, tourists, journalists and Jews abroad, giving it a degree of importance in portraying Israel to the world that might seem disproportionate to its readership. **********Mr. Frenkel's resignation and the staff decision to call a strike has generated a furor here, forcing Mr. Levy to deny that he intends to change the paper's editorial slant. **********Calls Accusers 'Incorrect' **********''Whoever is trying to make me look like someone trying to change the paper from left to right is just incorrect, although even this could be within my full right,'' Mr. Levy told the Israeli radio. He declined to be interviewed for this article. **********But in earlier interviews, Mr. Levy said he simply wanted The Post to be more balanced in its coverage. Post editors insist that Mr. Levy's growing involvement in the paper's daily report points to something else entirely, although they cannot produce a wealth of evidence to substantiate their criticism. **********Still, they complain that Mr. Levy recently urged the paper to write about the ''Jordan is Palestine'' crusade, a movement championed by right-wing academics and politicians who believe that a Palestinian state already exists in Jordan. **********They also say he went over the heads of editors to reprimand reporters covering politics and the occupied territories for what he saw as dovish articles, and has said in interviews that the paper should adopt a more pro-Zionist position. **********An Editorial Is Quashed **********Uncertainty over Mr. Levy's intentions peaked in November, when the publisher ordered Mr. Frenkel to withdraw an editorial from the paper's international edition. The editorial, which appeared in the daily, was a reply to criticism from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who said The Post's left-wing editorial line undermined ''Israel's position'' in the Jewish world. **********In his editorial, Mr. Frenkel boasted that the paper ''consistently dissented from the Likud's territorialism,'' referring to the refusal by Mr. Shamir's party to cede land for peace. Mr. Frenkel also said The Post was not ''enraptured in its reporting of events by the Prime Minister's reading of Israel's international positions.'' **********The dispute over the editorial so angered Post editors that they now say they are unwilling to compromise with Mr. Levy. Mr. Landau, the managing editor, said ''his action regarding the editorial, which laid down the basic credo of The Jerusalem Post, still resonates.'' **********Other Post staff members asserted that officials in the Prime Minister's office persuaded Mr. Levy to pull the editorial. **********'Address for the Pressure' **********''The Prime Minister's and the Foreign Minister's offices maintain constant pressure on The Post, but until now they did not have an address for the pressure,'' Menachem Shalev, the paper's diplomatic correspondent, said last week. ''Now they do,'' He said Government officials have told him that Mr. Levy has assured them that the paper's editorial line will change. **********Mr. Levy will have the power to effect that change if he does take over as ''responsible editor'' of The Post, an intention he indicated in a letter written in early December to a committee of Israeli newspaper editors. **********Requesting admittance to the group, Mr. Levy wrote, ''As publisher, I intend to become very involved in the work of the editorial staff, and all that this implies.'' **********The letter prompted Mr. Frenkel's resignation. On Friday, Post employees rejected the idea that an interim editor take over until tempers cool, and they delivered an ultimatum to David Radler, the president of Hollinger Inc., a Canadian newspaper chain that owns the daily. Hollinger, which bought The Post in April, pledged at the time to preserve the paper's editorial independence. **********Mood Is 'Militant' **********''I attempted to explain to him what his choices were, that the whole editoral staff speaks with one voice, and he has to choose between a good paper and sticking behind the man he appointed publisher,'' said Joanna Yehiel, The Post's magazine editor. She said Mr. Radler came to ''no conclusions, but he certainly listened.'' **********Other staff members were more blunt. **********''We're trying to drive a wedge between Radler and Levy,'' a reporter said. ''They haven't lived up to their commitment, and that's what has turned the mood so militant.'' **********At the time of the sale, Post employees were ecstatic to learn that their paper was being bought by Hollinger, which owns about 200 papers across Canada, as well as the recently acquired Daily Telegraph of London. The Post had been on the market for several weeks, and its owner, the ailing Koor Industries, was determined to sell to the highest bidder. **********Absentee Ownership **********Koor, which is a part of the Histadrut trade union, led by the Labor Party, had essentially ignored The Post for years, insuring complete editorial independence. Potential buyers who vied for the daily included an Israeli businessman with close ties to the hawkish Minister of Trade, Ariel Sharon, and Robert Maxwell, the British publisher. **********The Post's editors feared that those buyers would alter the paper's dovish positions, and they were relieved when Koor accepted an 11th-hour offer of $17.5 million from the Hollinger group. The Hollinger bid was much higher than the paper's estimated worth, which Israeli newspaper executives put at about $3 million. **********But the relief was short-lived. Although Hollinger newspapers are not known for a strong stance on Israel, Mr. Radler took a greater interest in the country after striking up a friendship with Mr. Levy during Mr. Levy's time in Canada as emissary for the Jewish National Fund. Mr. Radler decided to buy The Post at Mr. Levy's suggestion. **********Immediately after the purchase, Mr. Levy was appointed publisher, and in an interview with another Israeli paper, he hinted that like the suitors the editors sought to avoid, he intended to transform The Post. **********'Something of a Delusion' **********''Altogether, it seems to me that in this matter of editorial independence there is something of a delusion,'' Mr. Levy said in the interview, held in July. ''If my editor takes a line which is not balanced, I think that it is my right and my duty to straighten him out.'' **********In the interview, Mr. Levy recalled serving as a military liaison for the foreign press during Israel's invasion of Lebanon. He said coverage of the Sabra and Shatila massacres was distorted because the press failed to mention that ''the number of civilians killed there didn't even reach 40.'' **********It is this portrait of Mr. Levy that alarms Post editors now. ''Imagine Sabra and Shatila happening today, and we're not allowed to report it,'' Mrs. Yehiel said last week. ''Is that what they want of The Jerusalem Post? Is that what the Jewish people want?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/10/business/futures-options-concern-about-inventories-causes-energy-price-surge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 345, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Concern About Inventories Causes Energy Price Surge", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS;   Concern About Inventories Causes Energy Price Surge", "body_text": " **********Energy futures prices surged yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid concerns that gasoline and crude oil inventories would be tight in the near term. **********On other markets, grains and soybeans were mostly higher, copper prices advanced and livestock and pork prices gained. **********West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 71 cents higher, with the contract for June delivery at $18.99 a barrel; heating oil was 11 cents lower to 6 cents higher, with June at 51.34 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.20 cent to 1.49 cents higher, with June at 63.97 cents a gallon. **********Gasoline futures advanced on good cash buying on the Gulf Coast, said Jerry Samuels, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. **********Prices were also helped by American Petroleum Institute figures that showed a draw-down of nearly a million barrels of unleaded gasoline.

The new technique loosens the coal deposit freeing the methane in such a way that it flows more easily around the well bore. **********But most analysts say these advances would not have been made without the financial aid from Congress. **********\"This is one of those examples of where a Government tax-incentive program worked extremely well,\" said John H. Wood, head of the proved reserves program for the United States Energy Information Administration. \"Production is growing very rapidly.\" **********Methane, like coal, is formed from decaying plant matter that has been tightly packed under extreme pressures for millions of years.  Global Warming **********Energy companies have known since the 1920's that coal layers contain methane, often in large concentrations. Indeed, exploding concentrations of underground methane have killed thousands of miners. The Federal Bureau of Mines estimates that 300 billion cubic feet of methane escapes from underground coal mines each year, contributing to global warming. **********Until the more productive method was developed in recent years, high costs discouraged energy companies from trying to capture methane from the coalbeds. **********Amoco Inc. drilled the first successful methane-recovery well in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Colorado in 1977. **********Amoco used essentially the same drilling technology in its coalbed wells through most of the 1980's as it did in its oil and gas wells. Drill bits carved a well to the lowest depth of the coal seam. A pipe was lowered to the bottom of the well and concrete was forced out the bottom of the pipe until it rose up to the surface between the pipe and wall of the well. This formed an outer casing or shell to protect the pipe and prevent mud, gases and coal from seeping into groundwater supplies. **********Small bullets were then shot through the steel pipe and concrete that lay within the coal seam to create holes through which the methane could flow into the well. Next, a mixture of sand and water was pumped under heavy pressure from the surface into the well to further loosen the coal and get the methane flowing more rapidly into the well. Stress-Cavity Technique **********Since 1988, most drillers have used a newly developed method, called the stress-cavity technique, that dramatically accelerates the methane flow rate by exposing more coal to the well bore. The steel and concrete shaft stop short of the coalbed and do not go through it as is the case with the older method. Water and natural gas are pumped alternately from the surface directly onto the coal, carving a huge hole as chunks of coal are flushed back to the surface through the narrow drill pipe. Afterward, a liner pipe is placed at the base of the well to prevent more coal from being sucked in as methane is released from the coalbed. The methane flows through holes drilled in the liner pipe. **********The Devon Energy Corporation, based in Oklahoma City, said it drilled 10 wells this year using the stress-cavity technique near the sites of wells drilled with the older method. J. Michael Lacey, vice president of operations and exploration at Devon, said the payoff was production of 92.8 million cubic feet a day for the new wells compared with five million cubic feet a day at the older ones. **********Drilling costs for both types of methane wells, which average $400,000 a well in the San Juan Basin, are only a part of total development expenses. Additional wells must be drilled, often to depths of 8,000 feet or more, to flush salt-heavy water produced from the coalbed back underground. **********Sources of drinking water no deeper than 400 feet have been badly polluted by water pumped from coalbeds and released at the surface. Local officials filed environmental lawsuits in Alabama this year over water handling procedures at several drilling sites in the Black Warrior basin, delaying drilling programs there. For this reason, ARCO, for one, halted its drilling program at 25 wells instead of completing the 100 wells it had planned. **********Field stations are required to separate the water and methane that flow from the coal layer, as well as remove carbon dioxide from the methane. Pipeline companies limit carbon dioxide to 1 percent of a total natural-gas shipment because the molecule corrodes pipe. Before treatment, carbon dioxide levels in coalbed methane are as high as 15 percent. Pipelines for gathering the methane and connecting to lines operated by pipeline companies are another big expense. **********By all accounts, the drilling advances as well as the $3 billion invested in coalbed methane wells and related equipment would not have occurred without the special tax credit Congress approved in the 1980 Fuel Use Act. The credit amounts to a reduction in taxes on income from sales of coalbed methane. Congress recently estimated that the credit is worth $600 million for the years 1991 and 1992 combined. **********Producers said the credit gave them the financial cushion to experiment and develop the technology for mining the coal gas. The credit was set to expire at the end of this year, but a two-year extension for all coalbed methane wells was included in the latest budget. **********Before that extension, most analysts and producers anticipated a sharp decline in drilling in 1991 for coalbed methane. A resurgence is now expected in 1992. **********\"A lot of small companies now realize they have another two years\" to organize and finance drilling programs, said G. Warfield Hobbs, a former Texaco geologist who specializes in the economics and financing of coalbed methane production. \"It's going to grow exponentially.\" **********Mr. Hobbs, managing partner of Ammonite Resources in New Canaan, Conn., estimated that 2,400 wells have been drilled for coalbed methane this year, or more than one-third of all natural gas wells drilled in the United States, at a cost of more than $1 billion. He said the amount of methane production should reach a trillion cubic feet a year, or double this year's rate, within a few years. **********John E. Olsen, a natural gas analyst with the First Boston Corporation in Houston, said the effect of the tax credit for producers was that the break-even price of coalbed methane was 25 cents a thousand cubic feet, well below the approximately $2 a thousand cubic feet that buyers are paying at this time of year. (Coalbed methane sells for slightly less than other forms of natural gas.) And for the year, Mr. Olsen said, the tax incentive amounted to an after-tax benefit of $1.26 for every thousand cubic feet. **********Among the major energy companies, Amoco, ARCO and Conoco had the most output from the two largest areas of coalbed methane production. All three were active in the San Juan Basin, and ARCO and Amoco had smaller drilling programs in the Black Warrior Basin. **********Meridian Oil, a Houston-based unit of Burlington Resources, was one of the largest drillers in New Mexico. Smaller independents such as Devon Energy, Taurus Exploration, McKenzie Methane and Energen also were active in coalbed methane this year. **********Many natural gas producers drilling in locations far removed from promising coalbed methane sites opposed the tax-credit extension. They blamed the subsidy for depressing market prices as more coalbed methane was produced, and fear the situation will worsen. Supporters of the subsidy countered that they shoulder the risk of huge losses if their coalbed projects yield little methane. **********Mr. Hobbs said rising coalbed methane output, as well as new natural gas supplies coming on-line in the Arkoma Basin of Oklahoma and in the Mobile Bay field off Alabama, should keep natural gas prices from rising substantially for several years. Cutting Prices **********Domestic producers have already lured some California customers away from Canadian producers by cutting prices on shipments that include large amounts of coalbed methane, Mr. Hobbs said. Canadian producers delivered 1.4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to American customers last year, and many are concerned they will lose market share in California to marketers of coalbed methane from the San Juan Basin. **********The American Gas Association, a trade group in Washington, estimates probable reserves of coalbed methane at 90 trillion cubic feet. The trade group estimates total probable reserves of all forms of natural gas in the United States at 796 trillion cubic feet. The United States consumed 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas last year. **********\"Most people agree that this is a large resource,\" said Dr. Wood of the Energy Information Administration. \"It's a matter of whether it's economical to get it out of the ground. That in large part is dependent right now on the tax credit.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/business/ge-to-buy-risky-assets-of-kidder.html": {"writer_name": "Sarah Bartlett", "pub_date": "1990-03-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 557, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E. to Buy Risky Assets Of Kidder", "print_headline": "G.E. to Buy Risky Assets Of Kidder", "body_text": " **********Kidder, Peabody & Company announced a substantial recasting of its balance sheet yesterday that will shift troublesome assets to its parent, the General Electric Company. **********The move seemed intended to quell potential investor nervousness about Kidder's portfolio of illiquid assets. These include high-yield, high-risk ''junk bonds'' and ''bridge loans'' that were intended to be temporary but that could not be refinanced as investors have grown nervous about whether heavily indebted corporate borrowers can pay their debts. **********G.E. to Own All of Firm **********Kidder said G.E. would pay $750 million for the entire portfolio of junk bonds, bridge loans and equity stakes that it holds in companies. That amount is what each side agreed was the market value of the portfolio, and it was affirmed by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm. **********Kidder said it would use the $750 million to pay off about $500 million of its short-term debt and to buy back from employees an 11.7 percent stake in the firm, for about $50 million. The remaining $200 million will be paid back to G.E. as a dividend, and G.E. will then own 100 percent of Kidder. **********Dennis D. Dammerman, G.E.'s senior vice president for finance, said the transaction would not affect G.E.'s first-quarter earnings, and ''should not cause analysts to adjust their estimates of a double-digit increase'' in earnings per share. A spokesman for Kidder said G.E. would cover the expense of buying the portfolio from money it had previously set aside for unexpected developments. **********As for the first-quarter results, Michael A. Carpenter, the chairman and chief executive of Kidder, said the firm would break even on an operating basis but would record a loss of less than $25 million, which would reflect the reduced value of the portfolio being transferred to G.E. **********Asked why Kidder would pay a $200 million dividend to G.E., Mr. Carpenter said the firm would not need as much capital after the transactions were completed, because its balance sheet would be much stronger. **********Less Risky Balance Sheet **********As a result of the recapitalization, he said, Kidder's broker-dealer unit will have capital amounting to about $250 million more than regulators require. That is about $100 million more than it had in excess capital before, a change that results not from any infusion of capital, but from the fact that the balance sheet will ultimately be less risky. As such, less capital will need to be set aside under regulatory guidelines. **********Mr. Carpenter said the decision to recapitalize had been entirely Kidder's and had not been forced on the firm because of any problems in obtaining financing or pressures from rating agencies. He said the decision reflected a response to new market conditions and cited the recent collapse of the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group and financial pressures on Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. **********Although Mr. Carpenter insisted that the firm's business strategy would not change, he conceded that the move would probably signal the end of its bridge-lending activities. **********As for Kidder's plans in the junk bond business, Mr. Carpenter said the firm would continue to maintain a trading presence, but on a much smaller scale."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/31/business/lincoln-suit-is-dismissed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lincoln Suit Is Dismissed", "print_headline": "Lincoln Suit Is Dismissed", "body_text": " **********A judge dismissed a suit today that had been filed by the American Continental Corporation against Federal regulators, which accused them of hurting the survival chances of its Lincoln Savings and Loan Association subsidiary by leaking confidential information. **********United States District Judge Richard M.

Today's action by the community had been expected, and 11 Japanese chip producers have agreed to the plan. **********American semiconductor producers and the United States Government have also complained about Japanese dumping, which helped drive all but two American producers out of the market for D-RAM's in the middle 1980's. But the dumping complaints were dropped in 1986 as part of an agreement between the United States and Japan that set up a minimum pricing system for Japanese D-RAM's and other types of chips. **********Since that time, however, D-RAM prices have largely been higher than the minimum prices and Japanese producers have cut production to shore up prices. **********The agreement has also done little to encourage American companies to re-enter the D-RAM business. Only last week, U.S. Memories, a joint venture aimed at producing D-RAM's, collapsed for lack of investors. **********Uncertainty Over Plan **********Semiconductor industry experts say it is also unclear whether the European system will entice new companies into the market. Siemens A.G. of West Germany has already begun producing D-RAM's. Philips N.V. of the Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, an Italian and French company, have expressed some interest. **********But the minimum pricing system could help American companies sell chips in the European market. The Texas Instruments Corporation has already announced it is building a chip-making operation in Italy. **********The European pricing system is different in some ways from the American system. In Europe, all the Japanese manufacturers will be given the same minimum price based on a weighted average of their costs, plus 9.5 percent. In the United States, each Japanese company is given its own minimum price, based on its production costs plus 8 percent, said Michael Gadbaw, an attorney for the Semiconductor Industry Association. **********Preference for New Chips **********The Europeans will also allow new generations of chips to be sold for ''a certain period of time'' below their production costs. **********The commission said it had requested pricing information from eight Japanese producers - Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, NEC, NMB, Oki, Toshiba and Texas Instruments, an American-owned company that produces in Japan. Three other Japanese companies - Matsushita, Sanyo and Sharp - requested to be included. **********The Intel Corporation, which said Monday that it would become the exclusive marketer of D-RAM's made by NMB of Japan, is also expected to be subject to the pricing system for the chips it gets from Japan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/05/business/lessons-in-the-cracker-market.html": {"writer_name": "Anthony Ramirez", "pub_date": "1990-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1790, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lessons in the Cracker Market", "print_headline": "Lessons in the Cracker Market", "body_text": " **********Few products looked more promising. When RJR Nabisco introduced a bite-size version of graham crackers last fall, the company was abuzz. In the in-house lingo, the sweet, crispy snack was very ''more-ish'' (you wanted more of it) and had ''high poppability'' (you wanted to pop it in your mouth). **********But to the company's dismay, sales were sluggish. As it turns out, looks -at least the looks of the box - were the problem. **********So in a crash program, Nabisco's marketing people changed the logo and changed the name to Graham Bites from Honeycomb Graham Snacks. And perhaps most important, in their eyes, they changed the color of the box, from a subdued blue to a bright yellow. As a result, sales of the six-sided snack, reintroduced in May, are strong and getting stronger. **********What the Package Says **********''In hindsight, the old box didn't say, 'I'm a new product; notice me,' '' said James Chambers, the Nabisco product director who oversees Graham Bites. ''With the new box, our sales are in the kill zone all the time.'' **********Nabisco's experience with Graham Bites shows how an eye-catching package design can be crucial in selling a product, even in this age of increasingly sophisticated consumers. **********Marketing consultants say that as packaged goods have proliferated, eye-appeal has become increasingly important. This is especially true for snack foods, which many shoppers buy impulsively as they trudge through a store. **********But consumers tend to shun the new and unfamiliar. So packaged-goods companies have been reluctant to introduce brands because of the high risk of failure - more than 95 percent in most instances. Instead, companies offer easy-to-recognize line extensions, or new versions of established brands, like Nabisco's Graham Bites. **********Even so, success is far from guaranteed. A big question in ''leveraging brand equity,'' as marketers put it, is how close in taste, appearance and packaging to the old product should the new version be? This is treacherous territory, as the experienced executives of Nabisco discovered, because package design is more art than science, more trial and error than application of established principles. **********''More and more marketers are realizing that package design is the final stage of their entire marketing program,'' said John Lister, a principal in Lister Butler Inc., a brand-identity consultant to companies like Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive and Nabisco (but not on Graham Bites). ''What the consumer sees on the supermarket shelf is the last five seconds of your selling effort. It's the stage when the consumer does or does not reach for your product.'' **********There are more than 18,000 different packaged food items in the typical supermarket, 80 percent more than 10 years ago, Mr. Lister said. Yet the average shopping time of 30 minutes has not changed. **********The upshot: the typical person glances at an average of 10 items a second during a shopping trip, up from 5.5 items a decade ago. More than likely, shoppers have gone glassy eyed long before the end of their trip. **********The Cookie Market **********At stake for Nabisco, Keebler, Sunshine and others is an estimated $5.9 billion wholesale market this year for cookies, crackers and biscuits, up from $5.6 billion last year. Nabisco has by far the largest market share, at 44 percent or an estimated $2.6 billion. **********As the major food subsidiary of RJR Nabisco, the tobacco giant that went private in history's largest leveraged buyout at $25 billion last year, Nabisco needs to score big new-product successes to help pay off the parent firm's huge debts. Marketing has long been part of the company's history. In 1899, Nabisco's Uneeda biscuit was one of the first nationally advertised products in the country. **********Graham Bites began as teddy bears. In early 1989, Nabisco executives were toasting each other over the success in the previous year of a new children's snack called Teddy Grahams, bite-size graham cracker snacks shaped like teddy bears. **********In its first year, more than $150 million worth of Teddy Grahams was sold, the biggest new-product success in the industry in more than 25 years. It became the third-best-selling cookie, after Chips Ahoy and the market leader, Oreo, both from Nabisco. **********Focus on the Mothers **********In snacks aimed at children, usually preteens, food companies rarely focus on them because they seldom go unaccompanied to stores. Companies focus on mothers, whom marketers call the family gatekeepers. **********Toward that end, designers strive not so much for what will appeal to children, but for what mothers think will appeal to their children. Even if antic cereal boxes with brightly colored cartoon characters turn children off, a mother will still buy it -at least once. **********Teddy Grahams were an exception. Graham crackers are low in sodium and saturated fat, so they seem relatively healthful. Nabisco thought mothers would buy bite-size graham crackers for their children without the guilt that restrains frequent purchases. And children liked them for the sugar. **********Aiming at Adults **********Nabisco reasoned that the sweet taste and relatively healthful image could also hook adults. So it took aim with an adult version of Teddy Grahams, called Honey Maid Honeycomb Graham Snacks. **********But having focused so much on how to sell the children's snack, Nabisco marketers sought to banish those ideas from their minds when it came to marketing Honey Maid. In hindsight, they concede, that was a mistake. **********There are some marketing rules of thumb on how to design packages for adults versus those for children. **********White packages or relatively restrained colors are said to appeal to adults. The Campbell Soup Company's Pepperidge Farm brand of fancy, expensive cookies are in cream-colored packages, with Old World script or other typefaces that convey a tasteful restraint. The product information is displayed in a fairly straightforward way, with nary an exclamation point in sight. **********Bright Colors, Big Letters **********By contrast, the bright primary colors and big block letters, often at unusual angles, of innumerable cookie, cracker and cereal boxes are thought to appeal primarily to children. Or at least act as a signal to adults that their children will go for the product. **********Nabisco marketers confess to an excessive fealty to the ''mother brand'' of Honey Maid Graham Crackers, a 110-year-old product. Nabisco wanted adults to know that the new snack was similar to the product that at least five generations had bought. **********So the box had a straightforward logo in a subdued blue. The name Honey Maid was the same size as in the original brand. ''It was all very, very much like mother,'' in the words of Bruce J. Wood, senior vice president-marketing. **********By the time the adult snack was placed on supermarket shelves in September 1989, some in Nabisco's supermarket sales force were wondering if the family resemblance was too close. Nabisco's advertsing agency, FCB/Leber Katz Partners, said the name Honey Maid Honeycomb Graham Snacks was too long to advertise, let alone for shoppers to remember. **********Something Was Wrong **********By November, everyone connected with the project knew something was wrong. Supermarket managers were telling many of Nabisco's 2,500 salespeople that many shoppers passed by the product, especially when it was at the bottom bay, or floor level shelf. **********The sales goal for Honeycomb Graham Snacks was a relatively modest $1 million a month, but the product was selling only 75 percent of that. ''It wasn't a bad consumer response,'' said Mr. Chambers, the product director. ''It was just a muddy consumer response.'' **********Luckily for Nabisco, it had introduced Honeycomb Graham Snacks in only half the country - about 15,000 supermarkets and other grocery outlets. As recently as five years ago, the company introduced products nationally with attendant fanfare. Now it offers them in stages, to reduce risk and allow for midcourse corrrections, like package redesigns. **********Packaging Deadline **********To be ready for the April 1990 national introduction of the snack to 30,000 stores, Nabisco had to have a new package prepared by early February, so its salespeople could have something to show supermarket executives. **********For weeks, Thomas J. James, director of graphic design, fiddled with elements of the box. The borders on the front panel seemed stolid and too industrial. The type identifying the flavor seemed too small. And something was wrong with the box's color, though Mr. James was not quite sure. **********The breakthrough in the creative process was a seemingly minor change in December. The honeycomb hexagon on the front panel rested on its side. When the product spilled out of this hexagon, it did not spill convincingly. By rotating the hexagon, so it balanced on point, Mr. James introduced tension and energy into a static design. ''That little thing sparked everybody's thinking,'' he said. **********Marketers began to focus on the individual snack bit, rather than the pile of bits emphasized in the original design. The back panel was redrawn to show a bull's eye design and a hand holding one bit the size of a quarter. And they renamed the product Graham Bites to underscore the idea. **********Conveying an Idea **********''We had wanted people to think the idea of handful, of popping it into the mouth,'' said Mr. Wood, the marketing senior vice president. ''We didn't realize it would be better to home in on one piece.'' **********The last thing to change was the box's color. Because the sweetened crackers were an adult product, Mr. James and the other marketers hesitated to turn to a bright color. But the Nabisco sales force told them that the biggest problem was that shoppers were ignoring the package. **********One of 10 proposed designs was a yellow package. Teddy Grahams came in a pale yellow package. If they were going to go with yellow, it would probably have to be bright yellow. ''We knew we had taken blue as far as we could go,'' Mr. James said. ''Whatever else you could say about yellow, it certainly communicated fun.'' **********It also communicated different. With the early February deadline approaching, Nabisco decided on a package in bright yellow - Pantone Matching System 108 Yellow, to be exact - with large rounded block letters emphasizing the shortened, ''fun'' name of Graham Bites. A tiny honeycomb netting underscored the product's difference from the ''mother brand.'' The box was, in short, a kid box. And, as it turned out, very more-ish."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/25/business/moody-s-reviews-ratings-of-2-giant-japanese-banks.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1990-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 553, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Moody's Reviews Ratings Of 2 Giant Japanese Banks", "print_headline": "Moody's Reviews Ratings Of 2 Giant Japanese Banks", "body_text": " **********The top triple-A ratings for long-term borrowings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and the Fuji Bank Ltd., the largest and fourth-largest banks in the world, are under review, Moody's Investors Service said yesterday. **********Moody's said the ratings for short-term borrowings of the two Tokyo-based banks remained at the highest level of prime-1 and were not under review. **********Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Fuji are both strong operations over all, Moody's said, and a rating reduction, if any, would not be substantial for their borrowings of more than a year. A lower rating would, however, tarnish the banks' image in capital markets, including the markets for interest-rate and currency swaps. **********Interest-Rate Risks **********Because rising interest rates in Japan have reduced bank earnings, Moody's said the two banks need to show that they have plans to control their interest-rate risks in the future. Deborah Kinzer, a senior analyst at Moody's, said deregulation of the financial system in Japan had resulted in banks raising the interest rates they pay on consumer deposits more rapidly than the interest rates they charge borrowers. **********Japanese bank earnings for the year ended March 31 are expected to be announced in May or early June. **********Dai-Ichi Kangyo operates the largest branch system of any Japanese bank and has assets of $430 billion, nearly twice the level of Citicorp, the largest American banking company. But Moody's said Dai-Ichi Kanyo had a long-term problem of controlling the costs of its branch banking system. Because its expenses are higher than other large Japanese banks, Moody's said, the earnings of Dai-Ichi Kanyo are more vulnerable when rapidly rising interset rates narrow the profit margin from lending. **********Real Estate Exposure **********Moody's said a rating review of both banks was justified because of their exposure to Japanese real estate. The rating agency has said it is worried about the possibility that real estate prices might decline. **********Although data were not available on the extent of their risk, Ms. Kinzer noted that the real estate exposure of the two banks was not as great as that of the Yasuda Bank and Trust Company, the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company, the Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation and the Mitsui Trust and Banking Company. The credit ratings for these Japanese banks were lowered earlier this year. **********At Fuji Bank, Moody's said it was also concerned about the risk of loss on loans made in the United States to finance corporate takeovers. **********Ms. Kinzer said the recent decline in the Tokyo stock market was not a consideration for Moody's because only a small part of each bank's stock holdings was counted when measuring their financial resources. **********Masahiro Nagayasu, the manager of the New York branch of the Fuji Bank, said he was puzzled by the Moody's review because other large Japanese banks were vulnerable to losses on real estate or loans for American corporate takeovers to the same degree, or more, than Fuji. He added that Fuji bank had recently created a new group to use financial futures and options to control the risk of rising interest rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/28/business/briefs-479990.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-09-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 400, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Amdura Corp., Denver, said a bankruptcy court had approved the sale of certain assets of its subsidiary, the Amdura National Distributing Co., to the United Hardware Distributing Co., Plymouth, Minn.

No specific measures or targets were disclosed today, but the party leaders issued a communique acknowleging that the Central Committee had held the meeting and mentioning some elements of the economic plans. **********The communique cautioned against rapid economic growth and emphasized the need to raise efficiency and improve the nation's industrial structure. **********Chinese officials and economists had said earlier that the conclusions of the meeting would reflect the compromises struck between the various leadership factions -- in particular, between provincial and central leaders and between hard-liners and liberals. The communique showed little sign of the conflicts between those groups, but its remarkable vagueness suggested that no single faction had dominated the blueprints.

They only briefly mentioned specific areas of economic restructuring, like prices, taxes, labor and enterprise. It also suggested that Chinese leaders did not want to repeat the economic mishaps, including inflation and economic overheating, that accompanied high growth during the last five years; they contributed to the pro-democracy demonstrations in May and June of 1989. Zhao's Fate Not Mentioned **********The document did not mention the fate of the former Communist Party General Secretary, Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted during the Tiananmen Square crackdown more than 18 months ago. Mr. Zhao has been said to be under investigaton, and the party, at least publicly, has still not made any formal determination of his role during the democracy movement. **********No changes in the leadership were announced, and the party did not appear to expand the 14-member Politburo, on which three seats have been vacant since the crackdown. **********The document gave no target economic growth rate, but the official press has said the economy should grow at about 6 percent annually in the next few years. This is dramatically slower than the previous decade's average annual growth, which was about 10 percent.  Splits With Local Authorities **********According to Chinese economists and officials, the meeting had been delayed until now because of serious disagreements between the central Government and the provincial governors over the degree of regional autonomy and taxes that the provinces must hand over to Beijing. Because of severe fiscal deficits, central leaders had been seeking higher taxes from the provinces and greater influence over local markets, but the governors reportedly rejected earlier versions that they felt would have been too onerous. **********One characterstic of the last decade had been the devolution of authority from Beijing to the localities, in an effort to raise economic incentives and spur the economy. In contrast, the new five-year blueprint includes an attempt by central leaders to take back some of that power. Officials have said the plan will give the central Government greater power but not quite as much as it had sought. **********China's leaders also hope to spur ailing state enterprises -- one third of them are losing money -- and preserve the household responsibility system that allows individual farming."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/12/world/iran-welcomes-offer-by-moscow-on-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Iran Welcomes Offer By Moscow on Talks", "print_headline": "Iran Welcomes Offer By Moscow on Talks", "body_text": " **********Iran has welcomed an offer by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A.

Yet we do have important unresolved social challenges - from drug abuse to education and the environment - that require collective action. Corporate management however has neither the political legitimacy nor the expertise to decide what is in the social interest. It is our form of government that provides the vehicle for collective choice via elected legislators and the judicial system. **********Whether corporate social responsibility is advocated by political activists or the chief executive officer, the costs of these expenditures, which don't increase the value of the company or its stock, will be passed on to consumers by way of higher prices, or to employees as lower wages, or to shareholders as lower returns. Remember that employees also have shareholder interests by their participation in corporate pension funds. The essential issue is finding the most appropriate and effective way to solve social problems. **********During the last decade, an active market for takeovers has shown little tolerance for managements that are not attentive to shareholder value. Indeed, management's response to the threat of takeovers unlocked billions of dollars of value for the shareholders. It would, however, be a profound error to view increases in a company's value as concern just for the shareholders. Enlightened managers and public officials recognize that increases in stock prices reflect improvement in competitiveness - an issue that affects everyone with a stake in the company - or the economy. **********Nonetheless the chief executives of some of our largest companies contend that shareholder interests should not be their primary obligation. Just as ''corporate social responsibility'' were the buzzwords of the 1960's and 70's, ''balancing the interests of 'stakeholders' '' are the latest code words for the same idea. Hicks B. Waldron, chairman of Avon Products, for example, contends: ''We have 40,000 employees and 1.3 million representatives around the world. We have a number of suppliers, institutions, customers, communities. None of them have the democratic freedom as shareholders do to buy or sell their shares. They have much deeper and much more important stakes in our company than our shareholders.'' **********An approach that attempts to balance the interests of everyone with a stake in the company makes it easier for corporate managers to justify uneconomic diversification or overinvestment in a declining core business, since these moves are likely to be endorsed by people other than the shareholders. For organized labor, it means more jobs - in the short run. Suppliers enjoy the prospect of additional business, and the local community a larger tax base resulting from the increased size of the enterprise. Business decisions based on social criteria also often bring praise for the chief executive officer. It is precisely these decisions that subordinate shareholder interests and that trigger the much maligned corrective mechanisms of takeovers and restructuring. **********There is another view of stakeholders that is both consistent with and supportive of shareholder value: improved competitiveness, and in, the final analysis, socially responsible business behavior. This view recognizes that the company's continued existence and competitiveness depends on a long-term financial relationship with each of the groups that has an interest in the company. Employees want competitive wages and benefits. Customers want high-quality products and services at a competitive price. Suppliers and bondholders have financial claims that must be satisfied with cash when they fall due. Shareholders look for dividends and higher stock prices. **********If the company does not satisfy the financial claims of its constituents, it will cease to be viable. Employees, customers, and suppliers will simply withdraw their support. Thus, a going company must strive to enhance its long-term cash-generating ability. The ability of a company to distribute cash to its various constituent groups depends directly on its ability to generate cash from operating its businesses efficiently and on its ability to obtain any additional funds needed from the debt and equity markets. This long-term emphasis on cash flow as the basis for evaluating the maximum benefit for shareholders among arrangements with other interested parties, is the essence of the shareholder-value approach to management. There are inherent conflicts between shareholders and other groups, but management serves the long-term interests of its constituents best by enhancing its competitive position and thereby also increasing its economic value. **********The rash of takeovers and restructurings has led many to the politically expedient conclusion that shareholders are reaping substantial economic gains at the expense of other interested groups, especially employees. This adversarial view of the shareholder-stakeholder relationship is simplistic and in most cases inaccurate. Employees affected by a work-force reduction initiated as part of a takeover or corporate restructuring can usually point to superior competitors or to a management team that has failed to develop strategies that maximize shareholder value as the real culprit. In the end, it is the quality of management decision-making, coupled with an implementation process that fully embraces the contributions of all stakeholders, that leads to corporate success. **********Social investing, whether carried out by investment groups or by management, is not only at odds with the basic fiduciary duty to maximize value for shareholders, but also goes counter to corporate efforts to gain advantages in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. What can be more socially responsible than to build a sustainable competitive advantage? After all, it is competitiveness that will provide the jobs and the tax base needed for the accomplishment of social goals that are more effectively addressed by government than by the private sector."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/02/business/finance-new-issues-yields-put-at-9.3-and-9.8-on-offerings-by-fannie-mae.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 132, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Yields Put at 9.3% and 9.8% On Offerings by Fannie Mae", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;   Yields Put at 9.3% and 9.8% On Offerings by Fannie Mae", "body_text": " **********Two debenture issues by the Federal National Mortgage Association were priced yesterday through a nationwide group of securities dealers. **********The Fannie Mae sale totals $1 billion, including $400 million in four-year securities and $600 million in 10-year securities. **********Fannie Mae said both issues were priced at par, with the four-year debentures yielding 9.3 percent.

Rowe Price, a leading mutual fund company. **********Henry L. P. Schmelzer, the executive vice president of New England Securities, said that after the October 1987 crash many insurance agents, who sell his firm's mutual funds, were reluctant to push stock funds. **********''We're just beginning to see a return to a fairly good level of comfort among the insurance agents,'' he said in explaining the rise in I.R.A. money going into stock funds. **********Role Remains Critical **********Although I.R.A.'s are less important to the mutual fund industry than they were before 1988, when new rules reduced tax benefits for many investors, they still have an important role. The sales of individual retirement accounts helped gross sales of equity funds climb to $6.7 billion in March, the highest level for any month since April 1987, and up from $5.7 billion in February. **********By contrast, the money managers who run stock funds remain hesitant to invest the money they are being given. At the end of March, 11.9 percent of the assets of stock funds were in short-term money market investments, called cash in the industry. That was up from 11.6 percent a month earlier and the highest level since June 1982, just before the 1980's bull market began. **********''Main Street is more confident than Wall Street,'' said Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Strategic Insights, a division of the Jesup & Lamont Securities Company. **********While some fund officials said overall buying of stock funds slowed in April, as stock prices generally declined, they said the trend still remained positive. Some also reported that the flow of cash out of high-yield, high-risk ''junk bond'' funds appeared to be ending finally. In March, the outflow was $231 million, the smallest in nine months. **********If investors put more cash into the stock funds than they took out, as the officials said, April could mark the 11th time in the last 13 months that cash flow was positive, with a total inflow of $14.4 billion through March, when $3.1 billion came in. **********By contrast, in the 18 months beginning with the 1987 crash and continuing through March 1989, investors put more money into stock funds than they took out only during two months, with net withdrawals of $29.2 billion. **********With the general rise in stock prices, the assets of stock funds have climbed to a record $248.6 billion, as of the end of last month. **********The cash flow figures include purchases of funds, as well as redemptions and transfers between different funds in the same group. They exclude dividends that are automatically reinvested. **********One of the strongest I.R.A. performances was reported by Fidelity Investments in Boston, which said that investments in individual retirement accounts doubled in the 1990 season, which ended when tax returns were due on April 16. Michael Hines, a Fidelity spokesman, said more than half the money went into equity funds, several percentage points more than in 1989. **********While junk bond funds continued to see cash flow out on an overall basis, those who moved cash between different types of funds put money in for the first time since last June, a total of $55 million. That came as junk bond prices generally edged up in the month, with the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index gaining eight-tenths of 1 percent. In April, high-yield prices gave up most of that small gain, according to Merrill Lynch. **********''One bright light is a turnaround in the high-yield area,'' said Mrs. Nelson of T. Rowe Price. She said that firm's junk bond fund would have shown positive cash flow in April but for one large institutional redemption. She said sales of the fund were rising. **********Some Flow Into 'Junk' **********John Reilly of the Massachusetts Financial Services Company, also in Boston, added that ''in March, we actually had some net cash inflow into the junk bond area. In April, it was just about flat.'' **********Several fund groups reported that sales of other bond funds suffered in April as interest rates rose, driving down the value of existing bonds. **********Funds that invest in Ginnie Maes, mortgage securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, seem to be bringing in cash, however. They had a cash inflow of $99 million in March, up from $50 million the month before, when a string of 34 monthly outflows, dating back to March 1987, was ended."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/22/world/china-s-army-is-cared-for-in-a-lean-budget.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-03-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 571, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China's Army Is Cared For in a Lean Budget", "print_headline": "China's Army Is Cared For in a Lean Budget", "body_text": " **********The Government acknowledged today that it faced grave budgetary difficulties, but at the same time proposed a budget for 1990 that includes a sharp increase in military spending. **********The National People's Congress, now meeting in Beijing for a 15-day session that will give pro forma approval to the budget and other proposals from the leadership, also agreed today to accept the resignation of Deng Xiaoping from his last formal post, as chairman of the Government's Central Military Commission.

Lithuania bypassed its former President.

''We have no real power now to suspend the Soviet Constitution or to get rid of Soviet military presence here. But we can inform Moscow formally what our intentions are, and that the clock is beginning to tick now.'' **********People here said today that they were less concerned with symbolic statements or with immediately ridding Estonia of all Soviet emblems that have been incorporated into the Estonian Government in the last 50 years. **********One of the first gestures of the Lithuanian Government after it declared its independence was to pry the Soviet hammer and sickle off the side of the parliament building.

Mr. Ingersoll will have all the English and Irish properties, and Warburg all the American properties. **********Under the swap, Mr. Ingersoll gave up his 50 percent stake in The New Haven Register; The Trentonian in New Jersey; a group of suburban weeklies ringing St. Louis and about a dozen smaller dailies and weeklies. **********In exchange, Mr. Ingersoll, who is 44 years old, received dailies in Birmingham and Coventry, England; The Dublin Press in Ireland and a group of weeklies. **********The agreement means dividing a newspaper empire with an estimated market value of $1.5 billion, but also with heavy debt on the United States papers. **********In an interview yesterday, Mr. Ingersoll said he was pleased with the swap, because it would enable him to operate independently.

''His often-expressed dream was to create a major media company in this country, but at least for now, that's the end of that dream, whatever reason he might give for it,'' said John Morton, a media analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. **********The Warburg announcement did not offer any reason for making the swap, but in recent months there have been suggestions that the partnership had soured because of Mr. Ingersoll's overly ambitious management, which had created huge debts. **********''Obviously, he was in a lot of trouble,'' said Mark Goodson, the chairman of the Goodson Newspaper Group, which Mr. Ingersoll managed until last year. Mr. Goodson removed his newspapers from Mr. Ingersoll's management after their longtime relationship deteriorated. Mr. Goodson estimated that Mr. Ingersoll lost $10 million in management fees, but Mr. Ingersoll puts the amount at $6 million. **********Warburg said in a statement that Robert M. Jelenic, who has managed the newspapers under Mr. Ingersoll, would continue to operate them and that Warburg would use its $3 billion in equity capital to ''improve and expand'' the operations, except for the Long Island weeklies, which have been up for sale for several months. **********Known for Cost Control **********Mr. Ingersoll is known for an extremely tight cost control, which has given his newspapers a reputation for high profits and undistinguished journalism. **********Mr. Jelenic said that many of the papers, except the Chanry group of weeklies on Long Island, had been operating at levels higher than last year because of additional cost cutting. He said Warburg did not anticipate any trouble servicing any other debt. He did not offer any specific operating numbers for any of the newspapers. **********Mr. Jelenic also said that he had no plans to change the way the papers were operated, and that only the Long Island weeklies were for sale. **********Mr. Ingersoll built his empire in the 1980's by paying top prices for newspapers in this country. His purchases were heavily dependent on debt, mostly through junk bonds, which were sold with the expectation that profits would be high. **********A Well-Known Father **********His rise was viewed with particular interest because his late father, Ralph Ingersoll, who established the company, was a legendary journalists. In the 1940's, the senior Ingersoll founded PM, a liberal New York daily, that failed financially. He then began managing and acquiring newspapers. His son, Ralph 2d, took over the company in 1982 after buying his father out in a bitterly contested deal that left them no longer on speaking terms. **********Most of the papers were in the Northeast, where newspapers generally have seen profits wither recently in a poor advertising climate. **********Earlier this year, Mr. Ingersoll closed The St. Louis Sun, a tabloid that he had started the year before in competition with The Post Dispatch. No competing metropolitan paper had been successfully started in decades, and Mr. Ingersoll was regarded as reckless by many analysts for embarking on the venture. **********Although Mr. Ingersoll has bristled at the notion that he was trying to eclipse his father's accomplishments, it has been widely believed in the industry that the shadow cast by his father propelled him to try to demonstrate that he could do what his father could not: start a successful newspaper. **********Mr. Ingersoll said that once all the equipment was sold, his loss from The Sun would be ''around $25 million,'' but analysts have estimated a considerably higher figure. **********Another Troubled Operation **********The Community Newspapers group is also in financial duress, mostly because of the junk bonds used to buy and expand the group of free weeklies on Long Island, where Mr. Ingersoll intended to compete for advertising with Newsday. **********The bonds included a reset provision under which interest rates were adjusted annually to make up for the difference in value if the bonds were trading at a discount. **********The investment came on the eve of last year's dramatic slowdown in the newspaper business generally and especially on Long Island, which reduced Community's profits well below the levels needed to service debt. **********In its announcement, Warburg said yesterday that the negotiations with holders of Community Newspapers bonds would continue. **********Bond analysts said Warburg's decision not to pay the interest would put pressure on bondholders, as well as on Warburg, which will be considered in default in 30 days, if payment is not made. That could lead to Community Newspapers being pushed into bankruptcy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/26/business/president-elect-of-brazil-pushing-free-market-ideas.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1990-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 536, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President-Elect of Brazil Pushing Free-Market Ideas", "print_headline": "President-Elect of Brazil Pushing Free-Market Ideas", "body_text": " **********Beginning a nine-nation tour to put a ''new face'' on Brazil, the country's president-elect, Fernando Collor de Mello, vowed in New York yesterday to restore growth to Latin America's largest economy through privatization, fiscal discipline and debt relief. **********In a speech to 400 business executives and bankers, several of whom had said earlier that Brazil's high inflation and low growth in the 1980's had left them skeptical about its prospects, Mr. Collor put forth his ideas on developing a freer market in his country. **********On his March 15 inauguration, Mr. Collor, a 40-year-old state Governor, will assume leadership of a country that experienced 1,775 percent inflation last year and stopped servicing its foreign debt. After enjoying one of the third world's highest growth rates in the 1970's, Brazil's economy slumped in the 1980's, averaging about 2 percent growth a year. **********Admirer of Thatcher **********Mr. Collor, an admirer of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's free-market policies, proposed restoring growth through increased foreign investment and deregulation of the economy. **********''The inflation and stagnation paralyzed investments and discouraged the entry of foreign capital,'' Mr. Collor said in Portuguese to the luncheon sponsored by the Americas Society at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. **********Echoing free-market advocates in other Latin American countries like Argentina and Mexico, Mr. Collor blamed Brazil's stagnation on ''the inhibiting and inefficient state, the inflation and financial speculation, the system of privileges that protects and rewards inefficiency.'' **********Last year, Brazil's Congress refused to approve an inflation-fighting package submitted by Brazil's President, Jose Sarney. The plan would have cut Government spending and the Government payroll.

The rate rose five-tenths in March and nine-tenths in February, revised from the seven-tenths originally reported for March and the eight-tenths for February. **********The Fed said production of autos and light trucks fell by nearly 14 percent in April from March.

''What today's data tell us is that the manufacturing sector has yet to hit bottom and that talk of an inventory-led rebound in the economy is mistaken,'' he added. **********Easier Interest Rates Seen **********Mr. Carson said he believed the Fed would not change its credit policy in a hurry, but when it did it would be toward reviving the economy with easier interest rates. **********Many economists expect that the Government will announce on Wednesday an April rise in the Consumer Price Index of three-tenths of 1 percent compared with a five-tenths increase in March.

Operating rates for auto plants dropped to 65.1 percent in April from 75.6 percent in March. **********In contrast, mining output increased to 88.3 percent from 87.4 percent because of gains in the oil and gas sector and continued strength in coal mining, the Fed said. **********The operating rates of utility companies were up to 87.1 percent in April from 86.6 percent in March."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/09/world/us-kenyan-dispute-grows-a-little-testier.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-05-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 278, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-Kenyan Dispute Grows a Little Testier", "print_headline": "U.S.-Kenyan Dispute Grows a Little Testier", "body_text": " **********A Kenyan Cabinet member accused the United States today of supporting the opposition, another step in the dispute between the United States and Kenya over the future of democracy in this nation.

Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, who is under strong pressure from the Indonesian military authorities in East Timor. **********Indonesia, which is overwhelmingly Muslim, forcibly annexed the predominantly Roman Catholic territory after Portugal withdrew in 1974. **********Monsignor Belo's letter, which took seven months to reach Portugal, was delivered to Bishop Manuel Martins of Setubal, a major industrial city south of Lisbon, and he read excerpts on national television this week. The letter was written on June 7, four months before Pope John Paul II visited Dili, East Timor's main commercial city. **********Fears Assassination **********Bishop Martins said by phone from Setubal that the letter had been ''carried by many hands'' and reached him through members of a religious order. **********In the letter, Monsignor Belo said he feared he might suffer the same fate as Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, the Salvadoran primate assassinated in 1980. **********''The situation of the East Timorese is absolutely unthinkable, from the point of view of persecution, torture,'' Bishop Martins said after reading the letter. ''The East Timorese are profoundly isolated and their bishop is profoundly isolated. Many things have been promised, and many hopes created, but it seems there's no morals in politics. Moral principles are invoked only as currency, as means to an end.'' **********The Timorese bishop asked Bishop Martins to press the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to reply to a letter that he wrote to him in February 1989. Monsignor Belo complained then that Portugal had not been sufficiently active in seeking a negotiated settlement in East Timor since the territory was invaded by Indonesia in 1975. **********International rights groups say that perhaps as many as 200,000 East Timorese, out of a population of 650,000, have been killed by Indonesian troops. **********Says U.N. Failed to Respond **********Portugal withdrew from East Timor as part of a rapid dismantling of its colonial empire. The United Nations still recognizes Portugal as the administrating power, but Monsignor Belo told Mr. Perez de Cuellar that the United Nations had yet to discharge its responsibilities toward the territory. **********''The East Timorese have never been consulted about their political future,'' he said. **********In the letter revealed this week, Monsignor Belo said the people of East Timor were forced to accept Indonesian rule ''at pistol point,'' and that he was being subjected to harsh attacks by the Indonesian authorities. **********''However, the majority of the population is well aware of the maneuvers practiced by the Indonesian Government and military authorities,'' he wrote. ''The Christian population prays'' and ''waits for the happy day when people can express their aspirations as free men. Monsignor, pray for me. From one day to the next I could follow the path of Bishop Romero.'' **********From the time he was appointed bishop of East Timor in 1983, Monsignor Belo has faced pressure from the East Timorese nationalist movement, known by the Portuguese name Fretilin, as well as from the Indonesian authorities. Supporters of Fretilin and young Catholic radicals initially accused the bishop of being an agent of the Indonesian Government, but Monsignor Belo soon proved to be as outspoken as his predecessor, Martinho Lopes da Costa, who was ordered by the Vatican to retire after Indonesia complained that his sermons fomented nationalist sentiment. **********An 'Intifada' Emerges **********Since the Pope's vsit on Oct. 12, when a melee broke out as students demonstrated for independence, East Timorese persecuted by the police have sought refuge in the Bishop's residence.

President Bush has objected to the bill on First Admendment grounds, saying it amounted to an infringement on free speech. But supporters of the bill are hopeful that Mr. Bush will not veto the measure because of his pledge in the 1988 campaign to serve as the ''education President.'' **********Lobbying Since 1970 **********''How can the man who claims that he is the education President veto this bill?'' said Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, which has been lobbying since 1970 for improved programming for children. **********The House also passed legislation that would require television manufacturers by mid-1993 to build into any television set, with a screen 13 inches or larger, a microchip that would enable the set to show special closed-captions for the deaf. **********Currently, a televison set can be equipped to show closed-captions by buying an attachment that costs $160 to $200. Supporters of the legislation said it would cost manufacturers $5 to $15 for each set to build the capability directly into the television. **********The children's programming legislation at this point has no opponents in the industry, having received the reluctant endorsement of the National Association of Broadcasters. It also had broad support in the Senate. **********Under the measure, commercials on children's television programs would be limited to 10 1/2 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes on weekdays. **********Most children's programs are on Saturday and Sunday mornings and on weekday afternoons. **********The measure would also require that serving the educational needs of children be made a guiding factor when the Federal Communications Commission considers whether to renew a television station's license. **********Broadcasters Are Warned **********''We all know that televisions are on for six or seven hours every day in almost every household in the United States,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcomamittee on Telecommunications and Finance. ''If broadcasters are to use the public spectrum, they will have to show they are taking children's education needs into consideration to justify their licenses.'' **********During the debate, many lawmakers spoke of an ''overcommercialization'' of the public airways, especially in programs directed toward children, who, they contended, were less able to distinguish between a commercial and normal programming. **********Studies by the industry have found that some stations show as much as 11 to 12 minutes of commericals an hour during children's programming on weekends and up to 14 minutes on weekdays. Regular prime-time programming has an average of less than 8 minutes of commercials an hour. **********The issue of regulating children's programming is not new. Until the early 1980's, the F.C.C. limited the amount of commercial time on children's programs and generally required an educational commitment from local broadcasters. **********But when the industry was deregulated by the Reagan Administration in 1984, the guidelines were abandoned and the number of educational programs declined, while the number of toy-based programs proliferated. **********Attempts in 1988 to reimpose regulation were successful in Congress, with the House and Senate passing a bill that was similar to the measure passed today. But after Congress recessed for the November elections, President Reagan vetoed the bill. **********Children's Needs Stressed **********While the authors of the current bill see reducing the advertising content as important, they say that making children's needs a criteria for license renewal is even more critical. **********Under the legislation, the F.C.C. is instructed to develop a system that takes a station's educational and informational programming into consideration. **********''We have to remind broadcasters that they can't get away with showing 'The Cosby Show' and showing Bozo the Clown going to the local hospital,'' Ms. Charren said. ''It's an issue of choice. For the parents who do not want their children to see violent cartoons or 'Looney Tunes,' there should be a choice.'' **********The bill also requires the F.C.C. to examine the role of ''program-length commercials,'' generally cartoon shows based on characters, like the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles, that are also popular toys. Such toy-based cartoon series have proliferated in recent years, helping to increase sales for toy manufacturers and, lawmakers say, pushing much educational programming to the side. Tough Issues for F.C.C.

Its policy over the network question suggests that it will act cautiously, avoiding precipitous action. **********Available to 18.7 percent of United States households, the Tribune stations -- including WPIX in New York, WGN in Chicago and KTLA in Los Angeles -- have a reach even wider than that of Fox and one that is exceeded only by the three big commercial networks. So, the argument went, Tribune could grow into a Fox-like network by investing heavily in programming through the acquisition of a studio or the rapid development of its nascent entertainment division.   'More Cautious Approach' **********\"They could certainly have taken the Fox route, and plenty of bankers were ready to argue that they should,\" said Peter Falco, an investment analyst at Merrill Lynch. \"But they just have a much more cautious approach. It was too risky for their style of management.\" **********Such caution, even amid the acquisition fever of the 1980's, is typical of Tribune, a company that prides itself on embodying what Jack Fuller, the editor of its flagship Chicago newspaper, called \"the fundamental conservatism of the middle of the country.\" Making deals with what one banker called \"the guys with gold chains in Hollywood\" or taking the kinds of risk that Fox's owner, the News Corporation, is prepared to confront, is not where it feels most comfortable. **********Indeed, despite its $2.45 billion in sales last year -- a revenue figure that makes the company larger than other media groups like Knight-Ridder, McGraw-Hill, Washington Post, Dow Jones and The New York Times -- Tribune has managed to keep a generally low profile, at least until The Daily News was struck last month. **********Run by men with a background in finance, Tribune has a buttoned-down culture untouched by the glitz of other media giants. None of the company's top three officers -- Charles T. Brumback, chief executive; Stanton R. Cook, chairman, or John W. Madigan, president of the Chicago Tribune Company -- has any experience as a journalist. The company, over all, has much more in common with Main Street than with Los Angeles or New York. **********Indeed, the only corporate advertisment Tribune has taken out since going public was in 1989, when its Chicago Cubs baseball team, acquired in 1981 for $21 million, won the championship of the National League's Eastern Division. \"We prefer to let our actions speak for themselves,\" said Mr. Madigan, who is widely expected to succeed Mr. Brumback as head of Tribune. **********In recent years, Tribune's results have indeed been eloquent. Net profit last year was $242.4 million, having risen 23 percent annually from the $69.2 million earned in 1983. Over the same period, as a result of efforts to cut costs and make all operations as efficient as possible, the company's return on equity grew to 21 percent, from 10 percent, and revenue soared to $2.45 billion, from $1.5 billion. **********Alongside the newspaper division, which consists of seven papers and accounts for about 65 percent of revenue, the decision to stick to what it knows and avoid gambles in broadcasting and entertainment has also paid dividends. **********Aided by successes like the \"Geraldo\" show, with Geraldo Rivera as host, which was started in 1988, revenue grew to $584 million last year, compared with $228.7 million in 1983, and operating profits more than doubled over the same period to $96.8 million.  Erratic Newsprint Performance **********Only the company's newsprint operations, which have suffered strikes this year and account for about 18 percent of revenue, have performed erratically. **********This growth has led several analysts to praise the company as one of the best managed in the media business. **********But even before the strike at The Daily News, net income plunged 27 percent in the first three quarters of this year, in line with the results of many other media companies. And that decline came despite the fact that so far Chicago has largely avoided the slump that has shaken the East Coast. **********\"There is nothing cheap about a strike,\" said John Morton, an analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan. He and other analysts now expect Tribune's 1990 profits to fall as much as 35 percent from last year. This performance prompts a critical question: What should be done about The Daily News and the Tribune Company's loss-making newsprint operation? **********But Tribune's top executives show no sign of contemplating abrupt changes in direction. Mr. Fuller, the editor of The Tribune, said the company's long history and tradition -- The Chicago Tribune was founded in 1847 -- leads it to shun expediency in favor of measured action. Mr. Madigan, who is 52 years old, said, \"We've really looked hard at what we wanted to do to be more competitive in the industry, and rather than takeovers, we've found lots of opportunity to be more efficient.\" **********A model of the kind of regional strength the company likes is Chicago, where Cubs games are carried on WGN-TV with commercials for The Chicago Tribune, with all three units generating Tribune profits. The company does not want to spread itself thinly around the country. **********The view of management seems to be that the company has leading products in big markets throughout the country -- including Atlanta (where it has the WGNX-TV station); Denver (where it has KWGN-TV); Orlando, Fla., (where it owns The Orlando Sentinel), and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. (where it has The Sun-Sentinel) -- and that it should therefore build on this strength rather than spread itself more thinly. **********Still, some new departures in television and entertainment appear possible. James C. Dowdle, the chief executive of Tribune Broadcasting, told a Paine Webber media conference last December that \"if we can isolate the right opportunities, we will make acquisitions of independent television stations in major metropolitan markets, radio stations and add-ons for entertainment.\" He added that \"we will expand our efforts to produce and syndicate mini-series and made-for-TV movies.\"  'Hard-Nosed' Techniques **********But, in typical Tribune style, Mr. Dowdle, who declined to be interviewed for this article, also talked about keeping a strict control on costs and the company's \"hard-nosed development techniques.\" **********Such a hard-nosed approach is certainly evident in New York. A recently completed company study of the New York market through the year 2005 shows a population increase of two million, an employment expansion of 1.8 million jobs and a doubling of retail sales. Tribune, which also owns WPIX-TV and WQCD-FM in this market, does not want to leave. **********Jim Squires, who was editor of The Chicago Tribune until last year, said the mission of Mr. Brumback, who was named chief executive three months ago, is \"fix New York.\" **********Mr. Brumback declined to be interviewed. But in weighing the decisions for the loss-making Daily News and the newsprint mills, it seems clear that two factors are firmly present in his mind. On the one hand, Tribune will hesitate to take a drastic course, just as when it shunned a Fox-like experiment during the 1980's. On the other, it is a pragmatic company proud of its strong financial performance, and losses will not be tolerated forever."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/14/business/trade-talks-will-continue-in-informal-settings.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1990-12-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 631, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trade Talks Will Continue in Informal Settings", "print_headline": "Trade Talks Will Continue in Informal Settings", "body_text": " **********The collapse of global trade talks in Brussels last week in a dispute over farm subsidies does not mean the negotiators are finished. **********Agriculture Secretary Clayton K.

Retaliatory Pressure Seen **********In the absence of formal negotiations and progress, however, the Bush Administration is likely to face growing pressure from Congress to begin retaliatory actions against nations accused of unfair trade practices. **********The Bush Administration had postponed actions on a number of domestic trade complaints in the hope they would be resolved by agreements reached in Brussels. \"We are going to analyze each of the cases on their merits,\" a senior trade official in Washington said this week. **********If it becomes apparent that the stalemate in Brussels cannot be overcome and that the four years of trade talks known as the Uruguay Round, because they began there, are indeed over, the cases \"would be handled in a more confrontational and acrimonious atmosphere than would otherwise have been the case,\" the trade official said.  Cautious Moves Expected **********The White House is likely to proceed slowly, unwilling to pick a fight with any of its allies, given the delicate situation in the Persian Gulf. **********Still there is likely to be growing Congressional pressure to move on the cases. The ability of Carla A. Hills, the United States trade chief, to deflect action will depend on her credibility in arguing that the Uruguay Round can be revived, one Congressional aide said. **********The Administration faces a deadline around mid-January on a formal complaint brought by the National Pork Producers Council and the American Meat Institute against a European ban on pork and beef imports from the United States. **********The meat producers are asking for retaliation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which could involve 100 percent tariffs against European food products. **********The last American action against the European Community came two years ago, when 100 percent duties were imposed on canned tomatoes and instant coffee, among other products.  Aircraft Subsidies an Issue **********The United States could also act against the Europeans in the long-standing conflict over subsidies paid to Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft company that competes with Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. **********But the trade fights are not just with Europe. A tougher stand would also be taken against such major trading partners as Japan and Korea. **********In 1986 and again in 1988 the Reagan Administration rejected petitions from the domestic rice industry against Japan's blanket prohibition of rice imports, saying those restrictions would be addressed in the Uruguay Round. The American industry is almost certain to revive its petition. **********And a new dispute is arising with Japan following its award of a major contract in the Kansai airport project to a Japanese bidder over a more experienced team led by Westinghouse Electric and AEG of Germany. **********Trade relations have also deteriorated with South Korea, where American officials say there has been a backsliding on commitments combined with anti-American rhetoric. One example is a comic book published by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, a farm group controlled by the Government of President Roh Tae Woo, showing that foreign food products are unhealthy and that their purchase would force Korean farmers from the land."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-ac-r-s-aruba-work-stresses-distinctions.html": {"writer_name": "Randall Rothenberg", "pub_date": "1990-04-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  AC&R's Aruba Work Stresses Distinctions", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;   AC&R's Aruba Work Stresses Distinctions", "body_text": " **********AC&R Advertising's first campaign for the Aruba Tourism Authority has much that is standard to island advertising: beautiful scenery, an attractive couple in bathing suits and a narrator who speaks with a Caribbean lilt.

''If any of our groups break the agreement, they will be disciplined,'' **********Asked about terrorist acts by groups that do not belong to the P.L.O., Mr. Khalaf, whose guerrilla name is Abu Iyad, said he was certain that the resumption of ''a significant dialogue with the United States'' would moderate extremist Palestinian tendencies, even outside the P.L.O. and among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. **********''I am confident we can still control things, but the momentum of events is going against us and against those of us who still speak of peace, or negotiations and of dialogue,'' Mr. Khalaf said. **********Asked what they would do if the United States refused to commit itself to resuming or broadening the suspended discussion, some P.L.O. leaders said that they had no other option under consideration. **********The P.L.O officials conceded that their main difficulty in dealing with extremism was the large number of groups involved in the P.L.O., and opinion in the Arab world in general and, beyond that, in Israel and the West. **********'Anger and Frustration' **********''We want to talk about peace but how can we ignore the anger and frustration our people and the daily killings of Palestinians by the Israeli Army in the occupied territories?'' stressed Bassam Abu Sharif, a senior advisor to Mr. Arafat. ''We are facing conflicting pressures from every direction. We need a break.'' **********Among other things, P.L.O. officials said that militant Islamic fundamentalists in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, who oppose any compromise with Israel, are gaining greater influence, and at the expense of the P.L.O. **********Meanwhile, hard-line Arab countries, particularly Libya, Iraq and Syria, are supporting extremist factions, the P.L.O. officials added. **********They agreed, for example, with Israel's conclusion that Libya financed and trained the Abul Abbas group in the May raid. **********Western officials here and some Palestinians also noted that Iraq might have allowed the Abu Nidal organization to reopen an office in Baghdad, although the group's leader, Sabry al-Banna is still living in Libya under surveillance. **********No Authorization for Raid **********''Abul Abbas did not consult the P.L.O. Executive Committee and was not authorized to undertake any military operations against Israel,'' said Khaled al-Hassan, an influential member of Al Fatah's Central Committee. **********Mr. Hassan was the only senior P.L.O leader to denounce the sea raid immediately, describing it in an article on June 4 in the Lebanese daily Al Hayat as a ''children's game that P.L.O. leaders should be far above.'' **********''I was against this operation from A to Z,'' he said in an interview at his home here.

Western Union has already shed four types of telephone service: long-distance, cellular, satellite and private leased lines. **********Western Union is trying to refinance its bonds and has warned the Securities and Exchange Commission that it may have to file for bankruptcy.

Sieck, the vice president of electronic services at the Link Resources Corporation, a New York consulting company. **********Western Union's telex business, which has been devastated by the widespread introduction of facsimile machines, is less important to A.T.&T. than electronic mail, but still valued for its loyal client base in countries where other forms of communication are less developed, Mr. Smart said. Many countries still require that letters of credit be sent by telex to be valid, he said. **********Individual Negotiations **********Western Union began trying to sell its remaining communications businesses early this year, said Denis A. Bovin, a managing director at Salomon Brothers who advised the company on yesterday's agreement. Western Union did not auction the businesses, choosing instead to negotiate individually with large telecommunications companies in the United States and elsewhere, he said. **********Leigh Walzer, who follows distressed companies for R. D. Smith & Company, a New York investment research firm, said the $180 million price was slightly higher than he had expected. The agreement with A.T.&T. increases the likelihood that bondholders will accept Western Union's current proposal to refinance its bonds again, he said. **********Western Union is seeking to substitute notes with longer maturities for its $500 million junk bond issue, which pays 19.25 percent interest, and its $30 million issue, which pays 16 percent. The interest on the new notes would be paid with additional notes for the first two years, said Warren Bechtel, a spokesman for the company. **********Western Union said the company's 1990 shareholders meeting, scheduled for Friday, would be adjourned to July 31 to allow time for the preparation and distribution of new proxy materials.

The move will cost taxpayers $1.7 billion. **********Federal officials were unable to attract acceptable bids for the Bexar Savings Association and the Gill Savings Association, both based in San Antonio, said Steve Katsanos, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust agency. **********High Interest Rates **********A loss estimate of $1.2 billion for Gill Savings makes it one of the most costly rescues recorded by the Government in the savings industry crisis. The loss for Bexar was put at $483 million. **********Sunbelt executives and officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed the transaction, Mr. Katsanos said. The F.D.I.C., which insures deposits up to $100,000, controls Sunbelt. **********Unlike other insolvent Texas savings institutions under Federal control that were transferred to private owners, Sunbelt has been a continuing drain on the Treasury.

But the commitment was contingent on Comfinance's obtaining the financing, the papers said, and, as has been typical of the somewhat mysterious deal, the papers gave little data on Comfinance. **********A spokesman for Pathe said that Comfinance's principal shareholders were Pathe's president, Giancarlo Parretti, and chairman, Florio Fiorini. **********Asset Sales Seen at Pathe **********One executive who has followed MGM/UA said he believed that Pathe was attempting to sell some other assets, including a real estate business it owns in Spain and that it could use the proceeds toward the purchase of MGM/UA. Mr. Parretti did not return telephone calls requesting comment yesterday. **********Pathe has agreed to acquire MGM/ UA Communications for $1.2 billion, or $20 a share. It has put up $100 million. In its filing Pathe said it was extending the closing of the tender offer to May 10, from yesterday. **********A spokeswoman for Time Warner Inc., which has agreed to guarantee a $650 million loan or to make a six-year bridge loan itself if Pathe cannot arrange the financing elsewhere, said the company had not seen yesterday's filing. Time Warner is eager to see the deal done because it would give its subsidiary Warner Brothers the right to distribute United Artists films. Additionally, the 1,000-film library would serve as collateral for the Time Warner loan. **********Even so, a number of Wall Street analysts said that it was one of the strangest deals they had seen in years. **********''MGM/UA has lost money for the past three years, and Pathe has lost money for the past four years,'' David Londoner, a media analyst at Wertheim & Company, said. ''Put the two companies together and add $650 million to $1 billion of debt to the capital structure. And you have to ask yourself: does this remain viable?'' **********The document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission states that Comfinance has the right to enlist ''other affiliates of the buyer'' in connection with the $450 million. **********Uncertainty on Financing **********It adds, however, that the obligation of Comfinance and other potential investors to make a $450 million deposit, which Pathe could then use to buy MGM/UA stock, was conditioned, among other things, on their obtaining acceptable financing. There was no indication as to whether that financing was currently in place. **********Although the papers were not filed until late yesterday afternoon, the share price of MGM/UA rose $1.125, to close at $18.625. **********Mr. Parretti was convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy in a Naples, Italy, court on March 30 and sentenced to almost four years' imprisonment in absentia. Although he has appealed the decision, several analysts said that the conviction might make it more difficult for him to obtain bank financing. **********Beyond that, the deal's economics are unusual. **********Last year, MGM/UA lost $74.7 million on sales of $876.6 million. And in 1987 it lost $88.1 million on sales of $450.6 million. The company has debt of about $400 million, primarily high-interest ''junk bonds.'' **********Even if Pathe is able to get $200 million in production loans, it could need additional financing. A traditional big studio makes about 15 films a year for about $25 million each, a total of $375 million.

Preston is getting annoyed. **********Here he is, brimming with plans for Avon Products Inc., the direct-sales beauty company he has run for the last two years. He wants to overhaul the catalogue, change the way Avon's 1.5 million sales representatives are paid, slow down the introduction of new products and speed up delivery of old ones. In short, he wants to repair the damages wrought by an abysmal decade. **********And, he has a shot at carrying out his plans. Sales and profits are up. Debt, head count and other costs are down. The ill-starred diversification into health care that once caused debt to zoom to $1.1 billion - a stunning 82 percent of capitalization - is mercifully fading into memory. Avon's international divisions are doing especially well - foreign sales contributed 48 percent of Avon's revenues and 58 percent of pre-tax earnings last year. And although a court has just invalidated Avon's attempt to strengthen its ''poison pill'' to ward off takeovers, the corporate bigwigs that made hostile runs at Avon in the 1980's are lying low. **********''It may be wishful thinking, but I think we're hitting a period of stability,'' said Mr. Preston. ''Our debt's down, our cash flow's exraordinarily strong and we're in a position to again focus on the future.'' **********That's what he keeps telling the analysts. But no one wants to listen. On Wall Street, Avon is one thing only: a no-growth company that should spend its cash on buying its stock and paying rich dividends - at least until one of the myriad takeover runs succeeds. **********On July 5 Irwin L. Jacobs and the Amway Corporation, two of Avon's spurned suitors, sold 4 million shares - the majority of their stake - to Chartwell Inc., an investor group. The sale gives Chartwell, which already owned 17 percent of Avon, just under 20 percent of Avon's voting stock, the point that would activate Avon's poison pill. Avon's was the most active stock traded that day - yet arbitragers were so certain that no tender offer would come that Avon's stock closed at $37, down 75 cents. (It closed at 37 3/8 on Friday). **********Even analysts who have ''buy'' recommendations on Avon stock are not betting on growth. ''We are not interested in great strategies,'' said Jack L. Salzman, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. ''A direct selling company is only good for generating cash.'' **********Joseph Kozloff, who follows Avon for Smith Barney, agreed. ''Direct selling should be run as a no-growth cash generator,'' he said. **********Wall Street's readiness to write off Avon's future comes despite some fairly comforting numbers. Avon's 1989 sales hit $3.3 billion, up 8 percent from the prior year. Its earnings from continuing operations were $152.4 million, up 26 percent. Despite a charge of $98 million in the fourth quarter, related to its last remaining health care businesses, net earnings were $54.6 million, compared with a loss in 1988 of $404.5 million. And, perhaps most significantly, debt was down to $630 million and continues to fall. **********At issue, then, is whether Avon's greatest strength - its worldwide network of ''Avon ladies'' who sell Avon's products to their neighbors, friends and, increasingly, to their co-workers in offices and factories - has become its greatest weakness. **********In its heyday, that network represented a low-cost, almost foolproof distribution system. The sales people received a 40 percent commission on everything sold, but no base salary. They even paid for the brochures. **********Avon thrived under that system, developing a reputation for excellent management. In fact, though, Avon was not so much well managed as un-managed. ''It was a big numbers game - if Avon wanted to show more sales, it just added more Avon ladies,'' said one former Avon executive who insisted on anonymity. Even Stanley C. Gault, chief executive officer of Rubbermaid Inc. and an Avon director, recalls being ''astounded at Avon's lack of knowledge about its own customer base'' when he joined the company's board in the early 1980's. **********Demographic realities, meanwhile, were about to prick a very big hole in Avon's isolationist bubble. ''By the mid-1970's research reports showed that by 1980 no one would be home to greet the Avon lady, but management didn't want to listen,'' recalled a consultant who worked for Avon 15 years ago. Even Mr. Preston, who was then running Avon's domestic beauty business, conceded, ''We were slow to recognize the flow of women to the work force.'' **********Assuming that its beauty business would generate cash forever, Avon went on a shopping spree. It bought Tiffany & Company. It bought perfume companies. It bought Mallinckrodt Inc., a maker of specialty chemicals, drugs and medical diagnostic equipment. And it bought health care companies. **********The diversification was a disaster. New regulations restricted how much health care companies could charge, at the same time that Avon's beauty sales began shrinking. By the end of the 1980's, Avon had sold Tiffany and many other ancillary businesses. But it was still saddled with a couple of health care companies. And it was drowning in debt. **********In a funny way, Avon's troubles were the best thing that could have happened to Jim Preston. Until the diversification went sour, John Chamberlin, Avon's president, was the heir-apparent to Hicks Waldron, the chairman. But as Avon continued to bail out of its non-beauty products, its beauty business, though battered, was starting to stabilize. And Mr. Preston went from the man who was presiding over the dinosaur division to the humbled company's fair-haired boy. **********''The board recognized that Jim funded the non-cosmetics businesses when they got into trouble,'' said Mr. Gault. Mr. Preston was named president in May of 1988, and chief executive and chairman within eight months. **********He inherited a troubled company. The flow of women to work was a triple whammy. Although a handful of Avon's top sales representatives make as much as $100,000 a year from commissions, most make far less. So, with more lucrative jobs available, fewer women want to sell Avon products; fewer are home when Avon ladies call, and many buy cosmetics at stores near their jobs. **********Mr. Preston readily admits that Avon's direct-sales business is more likely to grow at 3 to 5 percent a year, rather than the 8 to 10 percent the company had been promising analysts in the 1980's. Accordingly, he has been slashing product lines and staff.  By March of last year Avon had cut employment by 28 percent, to 28,400, and halved its dividend to $1. It has closed one distribution center, and it will probably have to give up some expensive Manhattan space when its lease expires in 1997. **********Mr. Preston is taking a more activist approach to the Avon ladies - particularly to the 100,000 or so who account for over 55 percent of domestic sales. He is offering them sales training, and awarding plum territories to the most productive. He has persuaded them to chase their customers to work, so that 30 percent of Avon's domestic revenues now come from workplace sales. **********And Avon is finally investing in formal research. ''We've always pushed products out to the marketplace,'' said Robert W. Pratt, an executive vice president. ''Now we'll let demand pull products and delivery systems out of us.'' **********Avon's latest research tells it that 14 percent of its customers account for 56 percent of its sales, and that this core group is comprised primarily of women who are over 50, unlikely to have college degrees and highly likely to be overweight. Avon now has pinpointed a sizable group of younger, sleeker ''fringe'' consumers. By tinkering with product mix and selling methods Avon expects it can win over enough fringe customers to increase sales by 18 percent. **********And very slowly, and oh so gently, Avon is changing its product and commission structure. Instead of offering enough new products to warrant 26 different brochures a year, it will move to monthly product and brochure changes. It is introducing a two-tiered commission system whereby sales representatives will continue to receive 40 percent commissions on cosmetics and fragrances but only 25 percent on non-cosmetics items like pantyhose on which Avon competes with discount stores and drugstores. **********It is also using a new program called A.C.E. - Avon Career Enhancement - to get Avon ladies to recruit new representatives. Avon tried something similar in the mid 1980's, when it paid some 16,000 Avon ladies a flat recruiting fee. That program was a costly disappointment. This time, Mr. Preston said, Avon will pay a percentage of the recruit's sales instead of a flat fee, and will be ''more selective'' about who participates. **********These moves may put Avon at rights with its demographically changed world. But the miscalculations of the last decade did more than drown Avon in debt; it put it in play. **********Avon thought it had bought some calm this spring, when it avoided a proxy fight with Chartwell by agreeing to form a special committee to find ways to increase shareholder value, and to hire John P. Rochon, a vice chairman of the Mary Kay Corporation, to consult to that committee. But Avon broke off talks with Mr. Rochon last month when he refused to sever ties with Mary Kay. **********At the time, Richard L. Fisher, a Chartwell managing partner, said Chartwell ''will continue to pursue vigorously our objectives of maximizing shareholder value in Avon.'' **********Needless to say, Mr. Preston says that is his goal too. The question is whether Chartwell will give him the chance to reach it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/24/business/company-news-us-says-coastal-can-buy-iraqi-oil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says Coastal Can Buy Iraqi Oil", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; U.S. Says Coastal Can Buy Iraqi Oil", "body_text": " **********The Coastal Corporation said it had received permission from the Government to import as much as 2.6 million barrels of Iraqi crude oil shipped in July to Saudi Arabia, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

So the five agreed that the committee would discuss only naval activities in the gulf. **********Details of the planned air embargo are still being worked, but officials say it would be aimed primarily at civilian cargo aircraft and not at regular passenger planes. **********Under the plan, nearby countries would close their airspace to cargo flights heading for Iraq or Iraqi-occupied Kuwait unless they agreed to be inspected. The Security Council cannot authorize shooting down planes caught violating sanctions, since this is already prohibited by international law. **********Diplomats say that no country that is likely to try to break the embargo has sufficient aircraft to be very successful at it. Civilian aircraft operators would find it impossible to insure planes flying to Iraq or Kuwait or get them refueled at foreign airports. **********Today the Red Cross said that it would postpone an offer to dispatch $100,000 in emergency medical supplies to Iraq and Kuwait after a vigorous United States protest that it would violate United Nations sanctions. **********The United States told the Geneva-based League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies last week that it lacked evidence that these supplies were needed and that its plans for monitoring their distribution did not meet Security Council guidelines. **********But Jose Aponte, Director of International Services for the American Red Cross, said today that the League would now await an assessment of Iraq's medical needs from Red Cross officials in Baghdad before deciding whether to send the supplies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/27/world/gorbachev-names-a-party-loyalist-to-vice-presidency.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Keller", "pub_date": "1990-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1337, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GORBACHEV NAMES A PARTY LOYALIST TO VICE PRESIDENCY", "print_headline": "GORBACHEV NAMES A PARTY LOYALIST TO VICE PRESIDENCY", "body_text": " **********President Mikhail S. Gorbachev chose a colorless but loyal Communist Party functionary today to fill the new Soviet post of Vice President, his chief deputy in managing state affairs and his stand-in if Mr. Gorbachev cannot serve. **********Mr. Gorbachev's choice, Gennadi I. Yanayev, presented himself as \"a Communist to the depths of my soul\" and an unwavering supporter of Mr. Gorbachev's programs. His nomination is to be put to a secret ballot of the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies on Thursday. **********The choice sent a flabbergasted murmur through the Kremlin Palace of Congresses. A Hard-Working Apparatchik **********Many members, including some close to Mr. Gorbachev, had conjured up their profile of a probable Vice President: a non-Russian to unite the country, a person of popular stature or at least a winning public figure to repair Mr. Gorbachev's diminished prestige, and someone with a reformist reputation. **********Mr. Yanayev, who is 53 years old, is of Russian heritage, is unrenowned outside Communist Party circles, and is regarded as a hard-working apparatchik not associated with any particular innovations or causes. **********His speech today, which stressed the need for law and order and rejected economic \"shock therapy,\" was in keeping with Mr. Gorbachev's recent drift toward a conservative position. 'You Choose Your Own Man' **********After two nationally prominent candidates had publicly spurned the post, Mr. Gorbachev appears to have turned, as he has often done for important appointments, to a man steeped in Communist Party discipline and with a background not unlike his own. **********Like Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yanayev (pronounced ya-NYE-yeff) has never stood for competitive public election. He was appointed to Congress in a seat reserved for trade unions. **********The Soviet leader rebuffed suggestions from the hall that he offer a choice of candidates, and debate was cut off after a short series of orchestrated testimonials. **********If Mr. Gorbachev died or was otherwise unable to serve, the Vice President would serve as acting President until a nationwide presidential election could be organized, which under the Constitution must happen within six months. **********Aleksandr M. Yakovlev, a law professor and parliamentary leader, said, \"Either you choose a man with appeal, charm -- that's not the case here -- or you choose your own man, reliable.\" **********Mr. Gorbachev \"has chosen a devoted person who will share his views and work as a team,\" he said. \"That's good for the President. Will it be good for the country? That depends not only on the Vice President but also on the President himself.\" **********Mr. Yanayev's nomination was the first in what many expected to be a series of significant changes in the executive branch after a major reorganization of the Government structure that was given final approval today by the Congress. **********Mr. Gorbachev reported this morning that the last member of his original 1985 top leadership team, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, was in the hospital after a moderate heart attack. **********The news appeared to affirm the speculation that Mr. Ryzhkov, who has shouldered much of the blame for the country's economic failures, would soon be replaced. Conventional Hard-Liner **********Mr. Yanayev has been an important Communist Party whip in the Congress, the head of a 730-member bloc of party loyalists. **********Like Mr. Gorbachev, the vice presidential nominee holds advanced degrees from agricultural and law schools, and soon after school began his career in the Komsomol Communist youth league. There and later, at the official All-Union Council of Trade Unions, he specialized in contacts with foreign organizations. **********In May he was promoted to head the trade union council, but held the post for only two months before being made a secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee in charge of international affairs, and a member of the party's ruling Politburo. **********His interviews in the Soviet press over the last year have generally been published in the most hard-line newspapers, especially the daily Sovetskaya Rossiya, and have invariably reflected the most cautious and conventional viewpoints. 'He Has Firm Principles' **********Mr. Gorbachev presented his candidate today as a man with wide-ranging experience. **********\"He is a mature politician,\" Mr. Gorbachev said. \"He is well-oriented in political issues. He has firm principles. He is an active supporter of perestroika, and an active participant in it.\" **********One legislator who got the microphone long enough to announce that he would vote against the choice was met with a burst of applause.  In the corridors later, even those close to Mr. Gorbachev strained to find something positive to say about Mr. Yanayev. **********\"He is an open, normal person,\" said Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, one of Mr. Gorbachev's original partners in liberalizing Soviet society. \"He was born to be a politician.\" **********Ivan A. Vakarchuk, a physicist from the western Ukraine, said that he would oppose the nominee and that he believed many others would too, because they feared the prospect of having such an orthodox Communist a heartbeat away from the presidency. **********\"The Vice President is a nobody, as long as the President is alive,\" he said. \"But only as long as the President is alive. You have had cases in your country, after Kennedy, after Nixon, where the Vice President arose from nowhere.\" Little New Executive Power **********The vice presidency was created as part of a package of constitutional changes given final approval today. **********The measures would streamline the Government by making Cabinet ministries directly subordinate to Mr. Gorbachev rather than to his Prime Minister. **********The changes added little to Mr. Gorbachev's enormous constitutional powers, which already included the right to impose direct Kremlin rule -- with the suspension of civil liberties and the use of troops -- in trouble spots. **********One of the few provisions that would have actually increased Mr. Gorbachev's power was stripped from the package before final approval.  Additions to Council **********The Soviet leader had proposed creation of a Supreme State Inspectorate under the Vice President to assure adherence to federal laws and decrees. But many deputies argued that it would have concentrated too much power in the executive office. A Gorbachev aide said the President might bypass the Congress and create the new enforcement service by decree. **********The new Government structure also raised the status of the Federation Council, a group of leaders that is supposed to give the republics a voice in making federal policy and negotiating issues like budget-sharing and centralized food distribution. **********But before approving the changes, the Congress revised the council to include not only the 15 republics but also 20 smaller ethnic jurisdictions, adding to doubts about whether it will operate as a real decision-making body. **********Two separatist republics, Lithuania and Estonia, boycotted a meeting of the council on Tuesday and have said they do not plan to attend in the future. Post Shunned by Shevardnadze **********Mr. Gorbachev said last week that he had planned to name Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to the post of Vice President. The Foreign Minister is a Georgian who commands enormous respect here and abroad as the co-author of Mr. Gorbachev's revisions. **********But Mr. Shevardnadze told the Soviet press that he would decline the job if offered. Mr. Shevardnadze announced last Thursday he would resign as Foreign Minister and warned that the country was sliding toward dictatorship. **********When one member of Congress protested to Mr. Gorbachev today that Mr. Yanayev and Mr. Shevardnadze seemed to be \"diametrically opposite politicians,\" the Soviet leader insisted that the two men had worked cordially together and, \"if their positions do not coincide, they are very close in almost all directions of domestic and foreign policy.\" **********The other leading candidate for Vice President, according to officials close to Mr. Gorbachev, was Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the popular and articulate President of Kazakhstan, a republic in Soviet Central Asia. **********But Mr. Nazarbayev had openly belittled the job as lacking in power, telling reporters today: \"He has nothing, no rights, no authority. He will just run errands for the President. Such a job does not suit me.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/20/world/in-bhutto-s-shadow-women-who-succeeded.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1990-08-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 691, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Bhutto's Shadow, Women Who Succeeded", "print_headline": "In Bhutto's Shadow, Women Who Succeeded", "body_text": " **********As rumors began to circulate this week that Pakistan's new caretaker Government was about to name its information and broadcasting minister, one of the first visitors to the likely candidate's house was the editor of the country's newest daily newspaper. **********The ritual was not unusual in South Asia, where an unexpected political turn can quickly affect the press, and it pays to put in a good word early. The new paper, The Independent, is planning to begin publication in September. **********What was striking was that both the minister, Abida Hussain, and the editor, Maleeha Lodhi, were women. **********Benazir Bhutto, whose administration was abruptly dismissed on Aug. 6, was Pakistan's most visibly powerful woman, and the first woman to head a Government in the modern Islamic world. But beyond the limelight that surrounded her after her return from exile in 1986, strong and influential Pakistani women have been working in the shadows. **********For these women and many others, Ms. Bhutto's 20-month Government is and always was viewed with mixed feelings. **********It was not surprising that within days of her dismissal, a battle broke out in the country's most militant women's organization, the Women's Action Forum, over whether to condemn the change in Government. Ms. Bhutto's ouster, many in the group argued, was not a feminist issue. A Damaged Cause?  The summary manner in which Ms. Bhutto was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan has been widely condemned here. But there is also concern that her perceived shortcomings as a Prime Minister - her failure to push through a legislative program, or to prevent her husband and his relatives from using their connections in lucrative business deals - have damaged the image of women as administrators. **********Leaders of women's organizations say the role of women in Pakistan has been gradually improving for more than a decade, although the gains are often limited to the educated elite. The literacy rate for women in some rural areas is as low as 1 or 2 percent. **********''We know we are only 0.000-something of a percent of Pakistani women,'' a foreign service officer said. ''That makes us feel guilty, and we try to help others when we can.'' This woman and others in the Foreign Ministry are now being assigned to run desks that oversee sensitive policy areas, like Middle Eastern and Persian Gulf affairs. **********They have their counterparts outside Government service. ''I can name you 20 or more women in position of real influence,'' said Nasim Zehra, a columnist who writes on political and international affairs for several Pakistani newspapers. Ms. Zehra is a graduate of Tufts University's school of diplomacy. **********High-Ranking Editors **********In addition to Ms. Lodhi, a graduate of the London School of Economics who was editor of The Muslim before deciding to publish The Independent, Sherry Rehman is editor of Pakistan's boldest and liveliest news magazine, The Herald. Women are advancing to important editing positions at other publications, too. **********Asma Jehangir, the head of the country's Human Rights Commission, and her sister, Hina Jilani, are Pakistan's leading campaigners against forced labor, child abuse and laws limiting women's rights. **********In Karachi, Bilqis Edhi is an equal partner with her husband, Abdul Sattar Edhi, in running Pakistan's largest private charitable organization. Mrs. Edhi, who has concentrated her efforts on helping abandoned and abused women in slum areas, is also the foundation's business manager. **********In Islamabad, Pakistani and foreign women enjoy a relatively congenial working atmosphere. Several Western news agencies and newspapers have female correspondents here. **********But ''it's not as if after Benazir Bhutto took over, Pakistani women suddenly left their burkhas at home and rushed to join the men in different fields of work,'' an Indian journalist, Indira Das, observed after a recent visit.

Some traced the change to last Monday morning, when he went fishing at 5 A.M. He floated around the Kennebunk River for an hour or two, catching nothing but grinning broadly when he spied a group of bleary-eyed reporters on the bank swatting frantically at early-morning hordes of moquitoes. **********By Labor Day weekend, he even did not look so grimly determined to enjoy himself as he drove his ball around the Cape Arundel Golf Club course. He even began to make jokes. **********On the 10th tee on Saturday, a reporter's electronic pager went off, disrupting the President's drive. A collective breath was held. But the Chief Executive merely did a playful double-take and smiled. **********Today, as the Summer White House packed up to return to Washington, Mr. Bush could not resist squeezing in another round. Hurried as usual, he roared down the fairway in his golf car. **********But he had forgotten to secure his clubs, and they fell to the ground with a great clatter. **********''I don't need those!'' the President exclaimed, jamming on his brakes. **********''The press did it,'' said Ken Raynor, the club pro. **********Mr. Bush laughed, fixed his clubs and roared off again. Well, not quite. He forgot to release the brakes. **********Work and Prayer **********There were serious moments here. **********Mr. Bush has been working hard, aides said, spending hour after hour with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, plotting strategy for the gulf crisis and, most recently, working on the summit meeting. **********On Sunday, Mr. Bush spoke to the congregations at St. Ann's Episcopal Church, his customary house of worship, and the First Congregational Church. **********Accompanied by his friend the Rev. Billy Graham, Mr. Bush told those assembled at the Congregational Church: ''These are very interesting times. A week from now, perhaps at this minute, I will be sitting in Helsinki, Finland, talking with President Gorbachev. These are challenging times.'' **********Later, at St. Ann's, Mr. Bush said: ''These are rather trying times, and right now I would suggest that we get our strength from being one nation under God. I know I feel that way; so does Barbara; so does the rest of the family.'' **********Breaking the News **********While the President seemed more relaxed, things were not going so smoothly for his press operation. **********Late Friday night, as word of the impending Helsinki summit meeting began to leak out in Moscow, the White House hurriedly scheduled a news briefing for Saturday morning. **********But Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, did not want to take the podium and get bombarded with questions he could not answer. So a solution was found: Mr. Scowcroft was recruited to give a briefing. **********But Mr. Scowcroft decided he would not announce the summit meeting, and that left him in the uncomfortable position of refusing to comment on what by then was common knowledge. **********Then things got even more embarrassing. Just as Mr. Scowcroft was making his most emphatic refusal to comment, reporters noted that Mr. Fitzwater was on the telephone, scribbling hurriedly on a piece of paper. **********He approached the podium and handed the paper to Mr. Scowcroft, who laughed and said, ''We'll have an announcement at 1 P.M.'' **********Mr. Fitzwater grinned. ''Shows you how fast diplomacy can work sometimes,'' he said. **********Mr. Scowcroft sighed. ''I knew I shouldn't have done this,'' he said with his usual deadpan delivery. **********A Fondness for Initials **********The telephone call turned out to have been from Mr. Bush, who phoned Mr. Fitzwater from the Fidelity, his speedboat, as it plied the Gulf of Maine, to let him know the summit meeting could be announced at 1 P.M. **********Mr. Bush, who likes to do things personally, made the announcement himself, emerging from the door of his house on Walker's Point, the family estate, to speak to a small pool of reporters. **********What was different from other Presidential appearances here was that as befitting the seriousness of the moment, Mr. Bush was in a jacket and tie instead of his customary polo shirt. What was the same was his weakness for acronyms, abbreviations and insider jargon. **********At one point, he sounded as though he was declaring that he had great confidence in his ''sink.'' He was using the standard military acronym Cinc for Commander in Chief and referring to Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the American forces in Saudia Arabia. **********At another point, Mr. Bush was asked if he expected to talk about things other than the Persian Gulf with Mr. Gorbachev. The President replied, ''I know that we'll have discussions of, as I mentioned, C.F.E., and a C.F.E. agreement would lead to the C.S.C.E. meeting.'' Excuse me? C.F.E. is the treaty on reducing Conventional Forces in Europe. It is to be signed at a meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or C.S.C.E. **********Out of Sight, Not Mind **********For White House watchers, the Persian Gulf crisis has offered some interesting twists. **********First, there was the fact that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was noticeably absent from public view while some officials not always seen in the spotlight were more visible, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Mr. Scowcroft. **********Clearly, this did not signal a diminishing of Mr. Baker's status. It turned out that he was on the phone from his Wyoming vacation spot arranging the summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. **********This is a Presidential staff that maintains at least the appearance of collegiality. So White House aides routinely brush off questions about whether John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, whose expertise is domestic politics, is ever at odds with Mr. Scowcroft, an expert on diplomatic and arms control issues. **********Still, there may have been a flicker of a smile on Mr. Scowcroft's face on Saturday, when he was asked if Mr. Sununu had negotiated the summit arrangements during his visit last week to Moscow, where he was teaching Kremlin officials how to run an American-style Presidency. **********''No,'' Mr. Scowcroft replied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/12/business/the-media-business-soviet-tv-to-get-us-money-show.html": {"writer_name": "Jeremy Gerard", "pub_date": "1990-06-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 834, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "  Soviet TV To Get U.S. Money Show", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS;   Soviet TV To Get U.S. Money Show", "body_text": " **********During an installment of the television show ''Adam Smith's Money World'' last November, Donald M. Kendall, the president of Pepsico, speculated that perestroika and glasnost would translate into great opportunities for American business. He advised the business community to take advantage of those opportunities before Japan and Western Europe also got into the act. **********One person well aware of the tremendous changes taking place and already acting on them was the show's host, whose real name is George J. W. Goodman. When ''Adam Smith's Money World'' begins its seventh season on public television in the fall, the weekly program focusing on connections between business and the larger world will also be shown in prime time on Soviet television. **********''Money World,'' which will be dubbed in Russian, will be the first American business program broadcast on Soviet television, where American shows of any sort are a rarity. **********Mr. Goodman and his Soviet colleagues conceded yesterday that much of the information presented on ''Adam Smith's Money World'' would be beyond the comprehension of the typical Soviet viewer, who is generally unschooled in the ways of Western finance. But you have to start somewhere, they said. The show typically deals with one topic, like the savings and loan crisis or inflation, and looks at the larger impact of those situations. **********''We anticipate that the vast majority of the population may have a very difficult time with much of the vocabulary and concepts,'' said Marek L. Bezzubov, the president of Soventure Group Inc., the American half of a joint venture that acquired the broadcast rights from the American producers for Co Star, a Soviet joint venture company that produces and distributes films. **********''It is literally a must for them to start getting acquainted with the business world, and eagerness usually translates into trying to understand,'' he said. **********The half-hour show will be presented on the Soviet Central Television Network sometime between 7 P.M. and 9 P.M., Mr. Bezzubov said. Its competition in that time slot may include news programs, cartoons, sports events and blocks of commercials. In type of programing, it will compete with ''600 Seconds,'' a late-night news magazine that sounds suspiciously like one-sixth of a popular American counterpart. **********Soviet Central TV operates two television channels in Moscow. Two others, presenting similar programing, are Leningrad Program and Moscow Program. There is also a fifth, an instructional channel. **********Talks Began Last Year **********Mr. Goodman said talks with Co Star began last year when he was planning an hourlong special on perestroika and glasnost for the Public Broadcasting System. Because of preliminary work on the special, he said, ''Money World'' was familiar to executives at Soviet Central TV. **********Under the agreement, Co Star will get the broadcast rights to 52 weekly installments of ''Adam Smith's Money World,'' which is produced by Alvin H. Perlmutter Inc. and WNET, the public television station in New York. Co Star will also sell 90 seconds of advertising to American companies doing business in the Soviet Union, like the General Motors corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. **********In return, the American producers will get technical support for the PBS special on perestroika and glasnost, as well as for segments of the weekly program. No money is being exchanged in the deal between Co Star and ''Money World,'' Mr. Bezzubov said. **********'A Fabulous Turn of Events' **********''It's just a fabulous turn of events.'' Mr. Goodman said yesterday in an interview at his midtown office, ''Adam Smith has come to theland of Karl Marx. I think there's enormous confusion because the signals aren't clear there as they go to a market economy.'' **********''Money World'' is underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance and Unisys, he said, but he hopes that ''some alert, forward-thinking foundation would put up the money so that we can do a prologue for each show about why we're doing it, a primer to let Russian audiences watch and then tell us what they think of it.'' **********Mr. Goodman said that the program's title presented some problems in the translation. ''We changed the word 'money' to 'finance,' '' he said, ''because they said 'money' had a dark financial tone.'' But given the changes taking place in the Soviet economy, Mr. Goodman added, that is likely to change as well."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/07/world/evolution-in-europe-daughter-of-brezhnev-wins-return-of-seized-valuables.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1990-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 556, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   Daughter of Brezhnev Wins Return of Seized Valuables", "print_headline": "Evolution in Europe;   Daughter of Brezhnev Wins Return of Seized Valuables", "body_text": " **********Galina Brezhnev, daughter of Leonid I.

Churbanov, who was jailed for corruption. The value of the stuffed animals is about $130,000 at the artificially high exchange rate used for most noncash dollar-ruble transactions here. **********Routine Case, Judge Says **********The presiding judge, A.

''If it were not for the famous name of the plaintiff, I would not even remember the trial. **********''Under the law, Galina Brezhnev was within her rights, since most of the property belonged to her and not her husband, and the Supreme Court had no right, after sentencing Yuri Churbanov, to confiscate it.'' **********The paper also quoted from Miss Brezhnev's testimony explaining the source of the property. **********''The Mercedes was a gift to my father from some Government official,'' she was quoted as saying. ''I had a driver's license, and I drove the car. My father wasn't in the habit of giving gifts to my husbands.'' **********The cash, amounting to 65,492 rubles, or about $111,000, came from her father's estate, Miss Brezhnev said. She said she had bought the country house, valued by the court at 64,000 rubles, or about $108,000, by using money from her mother and by selling a sable coat and earrings of sapphires and diamonds. **********The paper gave no explanation for the valuable stuffed animals. **********When Mr. Brezhnev died in 1982, tales of Miss Brezhnev's life and fortune were rife in Moscow. The story was told that before her marriage to Mr. Churbanov, Miss Brezhnev, a tall beauty in her youth, had fallen in love and married a famed circus performer, Yevgeny Milayev, who had lavished gifts on her. **********Father Opposed First Marriage **********But according to accounts at the time, Mr. Brezhnev was opposed to the marriage and forced his daughter to dissolve it. Instead, he arranged for her to marry Mr. Churbanov, a bland young officer in the Interior Ministry. **********Mr. Churbanov rose rapidly in rank and influence, ending as a First Deputy Interior Minister.

Kansas City Power said the bid was worth $857 million. **********Analysts said the move had stemmed partly from the two companies' partnership in an over-budget nuclear plant and partly from Kansas City Power's impending need for a new electric plant. Instead of building such a plant, it was seeking to buy an electric company. **********Kansas City Power offered $27 a share for Kansas Gas and Electric's common stock, which had closed Friday at $19.75. Yesterday, Kansas Gas and Electric shares jumped $4.625 each, to close at $24.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Kansas City Power closed at $31.50, down 87.5 cents, in Big Board trading. **********If combined, the companies would achieve savings of $85 million in the first five years, Kansas City Power estimated. That would come to about 1.4 percent of the combined revenues of the companies. **********A spokesman for Kansas Gas and Electric said the company was studying the offer, which it received yesterday morning. **********The companies are of modest size. Kansas City Power serves the Kansas City metropolitan area in Kansas and Missouri. Kansas Gas and Electric serves south-central and southeastern Kansas, including Wichita. **********They are partners at the Wolf Creek nuclear plant, near Burlington, Kan., about 100 miles southwest of Kansas City. They set out to build the plant in 1973 for $525 million, but finished it 12 years later for $2.9 billion. **********In 1985, the Kansas Corporation Commission, the state's regulatory agency, said the plant was bigger than customers needed, and delayed allowing some of its cost to be passed on to customers. The commission later relented, but it said $283 million of the plant's cost had resulted from imprudent acts of management and would have to come out of the pockets of shareholders. **********'The Final Revenge' **********''Kansas Gas and Electric would not be in this position if they hadn't built the Wolf Creek plant,'' said Gregory B. Enholm, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. ''This is, in a way, the final revenge of a nuclear power plant - to cause the company to be put out of existence.'' **********Mr. Enholm suggested that the opening bid was low. It comes to about 140 percent of the book value of the company, he said, instead of a range of 160 to 200 percent. **********In a letter sent yesterday to Wilson K. Cadman, the chairman and president of Kansas Gas and Electric, the president and chief executive officer of Kansas City Power, A. Drue Jennings, said that if the bid succeeded, his company would freeze rates for all wholesale and retail customers through Jan. 1, 1993. **********No Layoffs Expected **********Mr. Jennings said his company did not expect any layoffs among Kansas Gas and Electric's 1,330 employees. **********In a telephone interview, he added that ''the real synergies should be very measurable'' if the companies combined, and that $85 million over five years was a conservative estimate based on publicly available information. **********He said the offer was all in cash and fully financed. His company said it had executed a $1 billion credit agreement with the Westpac Banking Corporation and the First National Bank of Chicago, and had retained the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation as a financial adviser. **********Mr. Jennings also said that to assuage the fears of neighboring utilities, it had filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has jurisdiction over wholesale electricity transactions, for changes in policies governing access to its transmission lines. The changes are meant ''to open up the system quite a bit,'' he said, so that other companies could trade power across the combined territory of the merged companies. **********Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington indicated that the companies had discussed a merger as early as 1983, as well as the possibility that Kansas Gas and Electric would sell generating capacity to Kansas City Power. The filing also says that if the merger is not consummated by the time of Kansas Gas's annual meeting next year, Kansas City Power would consider soliciting proxies to elect its candidates to the target company's board. **********The takeover offer was made conditional on regulatory approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission, among other conditions.Equitable Life Assurance Societyd (Donaldson, Lufkin)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/26/world/china-finds-a-han-tomb-and-men-of-mud.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-08-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1062, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Finds a Han Tomb and 'Men of Mud'", "print_headline": "China Finds a Han Tomb and 'Men of Mud'", "body_text": " **********Workers building a road in central China appear to have stumbled on an archeological treasure: a 2,100-year-old network of underground vaults said to contain tens of thousands of terra-cotta sculptures buried with a Han Dynasty emperor, during one of the greatest civilizations of ancient times. **********The figures, spread over an area as big as 10 football fields, are believed to be part of the burial site of Jingdi, an emperor who ruled from 157 B.C. to 141 B.C. This would be the first excavation of the area around a Han Dynasty imperial tomb, and some Chinese archeologists have described the find as surpassing in artistic quality and in number of artifacts even the famous terra-cotta army discovered near the ancient capital of Xian in 1974. **********The excavation is only in the early stages and so far Chinese officials have been coy about the discovery, refusing to let a foreign journalist visit the site or interview experts who have examined the artifacts. Information about the discovery has emerged only in dribs and drabs in the official Chinese press organizations in the last month. **********'A Pretty Terrific Find' **********Yet from the growing number of accounts published in Chinese-language newspapers, and from accompanying photos published in recent days, a more complete picture is emerging of a vast underground array of scupltures. There are said to be rows and rows of terra-cotta sculptures of men, boys or horses. Each is only about two feet tall, but they reportedly are all carved masterfully with different facial expressions. **********''Reporters recently visited the excavation site, descended a ladder into the moist pit, and saw the terra-cotta figures,'' wrote a journalist in People's Daily. ''They were about 60 centimeters tall, all naked male figures, all armless and all red. The sculptures are thin, and all are different. Some are very handsome, featuring small smiles on their faces. Some have high cheekbones and serious expressions, some stare straight ahead, others seem serene and contented. The figures are so vivid that they almost seem alive.'' **********Foreign experts interviewed by telephone said they had not heard of the discovery, or had seen only the briefest references to it. But they said that China did not have a record of exaggerating archeological claims. **********''It sounds like a pretty terrific find,'' said Michael Loewe, a specialist in ancient China at Cambridge University in England. ''If this really is the tomb of Jingdi, with that size and complexity, then it should certainly be as significant as Qinshihuangdi's tomb.'' **********The tomb of Qinshihuangdi, the first Qin emperor, is only 25 miles away, also in the countryside outside Xian, and attracts several hundred thousand foreigners to Xian annually. **********24 Vaults, Thousands of Figures **********The latest sculptures are considerably smaller than the life-sized warriors and horses buried with the Qin emperor. The Qin excavation, which is unfinished but is believed to consist of fewer than 10,000 figures, is 70 years older than the new find, but consists of only three vaults, compared to the 24 found so far at the Han tomb. **********''Some say there are tens of thousands'' of figures buried in the Han vaults, People's Daily reported. ''Some say there are 100,000. Then there is some talk of a million figures.'' **********K. C. Chang, professor of archeology at Harvard University, said the reports of the discovery were in line with what was known of Han Dynasty burial practices, but that it was too early to assess the magnitude of the find. In particular, he said it was important to examine the craftsmanship to see if the artistic level marked an improvement compared with previous finds. **********The Han Dynasty, of which Jingdi was the fifth emperor, was one of the greatest periods in Chinese history, in which paper and porcelain were invented, philosophical and historical studies flowered, and Chinese culture spread to Korea and Vietnam. While Jingdi came to be overshadowed by his father and by his son, he still is remembered for consolidating the empire and his generally wise stewardship of the nation. **********Workers Find Antiquities **********It is not unusual for China to limit access by foreigners to its antiquities. Because so many Chinese artifacts are abroad, China is particularly sensitive about conducting excavations on its own. National law even forbids foreign nationals from taking part in digs. **********The site was discovered on March 10, as workers were building a new road about 15 miles north of the ancient capital of Xian. At a depth of about 22 feet, their digging tools made an unusual noise and so they stopped for an inspection. They realized they had discovered antiquities, and so archeologists were called in, just as they were in 1974 when a peasant digging a well stumbled across the site of Qinshihuangdi's terra-cotta army. **********Assessment of the new find is difficult because the work has only just begun. The 24 pits each measures about 13 feet wide and between 82 feet and 950 feet long. Some contain horses and carts instead of human figures, and others appear to have been emptied by ancient grave robbers. **********''If only the central Government and the province will give us manpower and financial support, we believe that in two to three years of hard work we can excavate all 24 pits, and we can solve the mysteries surrounding them,'' People's Daily quoted Wang Xueli, an archeologist from Xian, as saying. The newspapers have said that a museum is expected to be constructed at the site. **********China has always been short of people to conduct archeological digs, which is one reason why many known imperial tombs have not been excavated and why major finds often occur when experts are called in to rescue a site that workers or peasants have turned up. But the Chinese Government might be willing to devote considerable resources in this case because of the likely gains from tourism. **********''These men of mud can bring in hordes of Westerners,'' People's Daily quoted local peasants as saying."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/29/business/company-briefs-962090.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-06-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 330, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Airbus Industrie, a consortium of companies in France, West Germany Britain and Spain said Olympic Airways of Greece had ordered two Airbus A300-600R airliners and placed options for two more.

The view of Federal officials was that the causeways appeared to raise salt concentrations and the temperature of the water to levels in some areas near the coast that would be harmful to the fish. Oil Companies' Argument **********The oil companies disagreed, saying years of study at their expense had not indicated any bad effects from the causeways. \"It has been and continues to be our position that variations caused by natural factors, like wind and current, far exceed any variations that you could attribute to the causeways,\" said Paul Laird, a spokesman in Anchorage for BP Exploration, a unit of the British Petroleum Company. **********ARCO, B.P. and Exxon agreed to spend $50 million to clear several water passages in the gravel roadbeds first built for exploration drilling at the Point McIntyre field as well as at the nearby Endicott field. **********The roadbeds extend 2.5 miles to the Point McIntyre field, and 5 miles to Endicott.

The combined output of Lisburne and Point McIntyre will exceed 60,000 barrels when output from Point McIntyre begins by late summer in 1992, Mr. Greenstein said. An expansion set for the summer of 1993 should increase output in the combined project to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day, he said. **********Oil produced from the fields will flow through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline to the tanker port at Valdez, Alaska, with most of the output then shipped by tanker to West Coast refineries.

As if four takeover bids and three chief executives in four years were not enough, the parent of United Airlines has recently been battered by the rising fuel prices and weakening traffic that have troubled the whole industry. **********Yet for all the turmoil, UAL in the last few months has regained from American Airlines its position as the nation's biggest airline, improved its service record and, thanks to its lucrative Pacific routes, remained one of the most profitable domestic carriers. **********That success will be tested in coming weeks. A group including United's three unions that has made an accepted offer to buy the airline for $201 a share has until Oct. 9 to line up financing. If, as most analysts expect, the deal collapses, the unions will seek an immediate resumption of talks on new contracts, and the negotiations could be difficult. **********Earnings Troubles **********What is more, the airline will face more pressure to cut costs because earnings, which reached a record in the second quarter, are expected to drop sharply in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. In the three months ended June 30, the company reported a 5.1 percent increase in net income, to $148.3 million, or $6.81 a share, on revenue of $2.7 billion. But analysts expect that a weak third and fourth quarter will mean that United's earnings for 1990 will be less than half the $324.2 million in 1989. **********While no one disputes that United's troubles have already caused their share of turmoil at the $10 billion company with 74,000 employees, people who have followed the carrier say it is extraordinary that an organization under such strain could be so resilient. **********''The outlook for United is very promising,'' said John Eichner, a New York-based industry consultant. ''It must be one helluva property if it is doing this well in spite of all of its problems.'' **********United's 6.5 percent operating margin - operating income relative to revenue - in the second quarter was bested only by American Airlines' 7.8 percent and Southwest Airlines' 13.4 percent. The major reason was the Pacific routes: For example. last year United's operating margins ran at 7.1 percent in the Pacific and 4 percent domestically, estimated Thomas Longman, the airline analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. **********''I am not sure it would be fair to call United the stellar performer in the business,'' Mr. Longman said. ''They just happen to have a nice chunk of their business - roughly 30 percent - in the Pacific.'' **********United's service to the Pacific, which includes daily flights to Japan, Australia and other points in the Far East, is now the largest in the region, having surpassed that of Japan Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. In 1988, United was flying about 31,000 seats to and from the Pacific each week. The figure now stands at just under 50,000. Northwest flies about 40,000 seats a week and Japan Air Lines 32,000. **********Takes the Top Spot **********Helped by its Pacific routes and service to Europe that was introduced last spring, United has moved slightly ahead of American as the largest United States carrier in terms of miles flown by paying passengers. Each airline holds about 17 percent of the market among domestic carriers. **********The airline's improvement in service is evident in several ways: On-time arrivals and departures are up in the last year, and the number of times in a month that United ground crews mishandle baggage is down, according to Transportation Department figures. (These trends are true for the industry as a whole as well.) Analysts say a good part of the credit must go to Stephen M. Wolf, the 49-year-old former chief executive of Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger who became United's chief executive in December 1987, replacing Frank Olson, who in turn replaced Richard Ferris in June 1987. Industry experts say Mr. Wolf has succeeded on a number of fronts. **********New Team Praised **********For one thing, they say, he has assembled what may be the strongest top-management team in the business. Job No. 1 was maintaining the morale of James Guyette, United's longtime head of operations who many industry experts thought would quit when he lost the chairmanship to Mr. Wolf. In addition, Mr. Wolf in 1988 recruited from American Airlines John C. Pope, considered one of the industry's saaviest finance executives, to be United's chief financial officer. And Mr. Wolf promoted Christopher Bowers, another longtime United employee, to the crucial position of head of sales. Industry experts say that United's relations with travel agents have improved markedly under Mr. Bowers. **********Also under Mr. Wolf, United's middle management - the thousands of marketing executives, logistics specialists, strategic and financial planners, and ground-crew personnel -has ''focused on the right things,'' said Robert P. Neuschel a longtime student of United who runs the Transportation Center at Northwestern University. He was referring to the airline's improved customer service. **********More than anything, Mr. Wolf has undertaken to expand the service to the Far East that United began in 1986, when Mr. Ferris paid $750 million for the Far East business of Pan American World Airways. The Pacific service is highlighted in United's two-year-old advertising campaign, produced by Leo Burnett & Company, set to Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' and carrying on the ''Friendly Skies'' theme that the airline has used since the 1960's. **********But for all its recent successes, United faces major risks. All three of United's major unions - the pilots, flight attendants and machinists -are working with expired contracts and have agreed to hold off on contract talks until the takeover issue is resolved. But if the union bid for the carrier fails, the employees will seek an immediate resumption of talks. Given Mr. Wolf's tough bargaining position in the past - he has all but said that United's pilots are overpaid - those talks could be protracted and contentious. **********Some Union Resentment **********''There would be distractions, unhappiness and disruptions of all sorts,'' said Rick Dubinsky, the head of United's pilots' union. ''If this deal falls through and you have three unions with open contracts, any thought of this company being a well-run airline under Steven Wolf would be fantasy.'' **********Indeed, some United employees resent Mr. Wolf for the way he has handled himself in past buyout attempts, arguing that he has been too quick to give up and too quick to seek concessions from workers. **********Mr. Wolf, who declined to be interviewed, is not part of the current buyout group and would be replaced by Gerald Greenwald, a former Chrysler vice chairman, if the bid succeeds. But he was a member of the union-management group whose buyout proposal collapsed last October for lack of financing, touching off a steep fall in the stock market. Earlier buyout proposals by the pilots' union (in 1987) and the Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis (in 1989) also failed. **********Having presented its $201-a-share bid to United's board, the union group has been given until Oct. 9 to line up financing. The unions, in turn, have given their banks a deadline of this Wednesday to say whether they as lenders will go along with the deal or support a lower bid. And while the board has technically accepted the $201 offer, it could still decide that it does not like the financing terms that the employees ultimately line up, and reject the deal. Skepticism about the deal's being completed is an important reason that United's stock has fallen sharply in recent months. (But since Mr. Davis offered late Thursday to join the employee buyout of the company, the stock has risen by $12.75, to $103.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.) 'No Compelling Reason' **********''The key is that there is no compelling reason why United has to be sold,'' said Sharon J. Kalin, a stock trader who has followed United since the first takeover bid emerged in 1987. ''The company is not in a cash squeeze, and there is no raider breathing down its neck.'' **********Another concern for United is that it has fallen behind in ordering new aircraft. United is taking delivery of one new jet a week, mostly Boeing 737's used on domestic medium-haul flights and 767's that will be used for travel to Europe. But United has told its suppliers it will hold off on ordering new wide-body aircraft for domestic long-haul flights until the airline's future is clearer. That puts United at a competitive disadvantage, because many of its existing long-haul domestic aircraft are DC-10's, which consume more fuel than new models and require larger crews. **********Moreover, United's European service is still only a token effort - just three flights a day, to Frankfurt and Paris. **********And on its home turf, O'Hare Airport in Chicago, United has begun feeling increasing pressure from American Airlines. American pulled aircraft out of Cleveland to support more flights out of Chicago. American also purchased from Trans World Airlines the rights to fly from Chicago to various European destinations. **********Finally, all the disciplined management in the world may not be able to keep United profitable if the hostilities in the Middle East continue to send jet fuel prices higher, and if the economy weakens further."}}
