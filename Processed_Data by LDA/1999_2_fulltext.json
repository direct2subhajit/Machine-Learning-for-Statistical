Editors delete even oblique references in manuscripts. In private, it is mentioned cautiously, generally only among friends. **********But thousands of Chinese witnessed the bloody spectacle that played out on the boulevards of central Beijing on the night of June 3 and the early morning of June 4. **********A factory worker recalls hauling a dying man away on a bicycle cart; a surgeon remembers two days without sleep, operating on more than 20 students, workers and soldiers; a young businessman -- then a high school senior -- tells how he roamed the streets watching protesters set fire to military vehicles and soldiers shoot into crowds. **********However, with public discussion banned, such events remain largely undigested, and many people refer to ''the June 4 problem'' without really being able to define it, much less say how it might be solved. **********Chinese who experienced the crackdown often voice disillusionment with the Communist Party and politics in general. Others say that to avoid a repeat of such carnage, compromise and patience are in order, as long as China continues on its path of economic development and slowly expanding personal freedom. Still others say that the country will never truly move forward until the  events of Tiananmen are addressed. **********''There is certainly support to redress June 4,'' said Li Sunzhi, former president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, whose students protested. ''You hear it from taxi drivers, retired generals and even some retired cadres. But the Government strategy is to let it drag out.'' **********And perhaps with good reason. ''If June 4 were reappraised,'' Mr. Li said, ''I think many potential liberals could become more aggressive and it could lead to a real political awakening among Chinese.'' **********No one expects the Government to reverse any time soon its official verdict any time soon. At least not as long as leaders like Li Peng remain. Mr. Peng, who as Prime Minister issued the declaration of martial law on May 20, 1989, is now chairman of China's Parliament. Still, some prominent citizens speak out, although within limited circles. **********Dr. Jiang Yanyong, who in 1989 ran Beijing's most prestigious military hospital, told a small meeting of Yanjing University alumnae last week that he had ''always believed in the party.'' But on the night of June 3, scores of wounded were carried into his emergency room and many were dead by morning, including the son of two army officers. **********''In my wildest dreams I never imagined that something like this could happen,'' he said. ''A Government should never do such a thing. That is counterrevolutionary.'' **********But many less potent memories have been submerged in the past decade. Many Chinese have only the vague sense that June 4 was a terrible tragedy that will someday prove a watershed in modern Chinese history, although many are reluctant to guess why or how. **********''I was a participant and also to some extent a victim of June 4,'' said a 36-year-old former university lecturer who, like many protesters, was fired and afterward unable to hold another state job. **********Now a small businessman, he struggled to define the legacy. ''June 4 was a national tragedy and a major historical event,'' he said, ''though we've not reached the point where we can appraise and understand the event or its consequences.'' **********He added, with a note of sadness, ''Following the trauma of June 4, many people like me arrived at the conviction that the only path for China was one of cautious, progressive liberalization -- anything else was unacceptable.'' **********The taboo regarding June 4 sits uncomfortably in a country whose opinionated citizens now debate environmental pollution, corruption and foreign trade. China today is richer, less ideological and more pluralistic, and it offers many more opportunities to its citizens. **********In 1989, students were assigned jobs at graduation, and only the privileged got passports. Today, at China's more prestigious universities, more than half the students in some departments study overseas. **********Since 1989, the Government has confronted some of the student protesters' leading complaints, including official privilege and corruption. **********Young Chinese, in particular, say they are more concerned with pursuing careers than multiparty democracy, which they see as a distant prospect. Many students and other Chinese now view 1989 protests as naive and its leaders as uncompromising. **********''In 1989 that kind of event was so new that young people were responding from the heart,'' said a 28-year-old advertising account manager who remembered going to the square every day after school to watch. ''Today, it's true, we're more willing to accept the realities of life. But we're also able to look at issues in more independent and mature ways.'' **********For the most part, today's college students have only their childhood recollections. ''The memory is already fading in society and relatively speaking among intellectuals,'' said one writer. ''In fact, where the memory of June 4 is least faded is among officialdom. It hangs over them all the time.'' **********The most prominent voice for a re-evaluation of June 4 is Bao Tong, a former Central Committee member who was jailed in 1989 for seven years after he opposed the military crackdown. He remains under constant surveillance, though authorities have thus far allowed him to pursue his campaign for a reversal of the official verdict. **********''There is no doubt in my mind that public support for a reappraisal of 1989 and for major political reform not only exists but is widespread even under current political conditions,'' Mr. Bao said. **********Even in 1989, he said, most Politburo members opposed a deploying troops against the protesters but were overruled by Deng Xiaoping, China's late paramount leader. **********The most heartfelt call for remembrance comes from Ding Zilin, a retired professor who vowed to publicize the Government killings after her son, then a high school senior, was shot on the night of June 3. **********She rues and also understands the general public's silence. ''If my own son had not been lost in the massacre, I probably would have been one of the silent majority,'' she said. **********These lone voices have been joined by a smattering of career democracy advocates, a number of whom were detained this week for trying to commemorate Tiananmen. **********''Events of that day changed my life, until then I was an ordinary worker,'' said Ma Qiang, 29, who helped carry away the dead and injured that night, and who is now affiliated with the fledgling China Democratic Party. ''Afterward, I felt the need to start writing and studying things like democracy and law. So for me June 4 is a terrible memory but also a resource.'' **********But far more numerous are the vast pool of Chinese who have set aside the memories, knowing how unlikely a reassessment is. **********''It is not very convenient to talk about this topic now,'' said a nervous young banker, who 10 years ago spent several weeks in Tiananmen Square. ''The widespread attitude among the participants is that they hope that June 4 can someday be re-evaluated. But this is an event officials are still very sensitive about.'' **********And too much pressure now, some say, could provoke a backlash that night erase the freedoms Chinese have gained in recent years. **********''I think that June 4 is an event that should be left to history to judge,'' said a 34-year-old man who uses the English name Andy. ''There are disagreements here that will be unresolved for 10 or 20 years. And until then we should do what we can do in the present circumstances and not provoke a crisis.'' **********But by then, others say, memories may be so faint that a reassessment would be meaningless. **********In the meantime, hundreds of families mourn in a vacuum. Many a June 4, the families of two slain students, Hao Zhijing and Duan Changnan, go to a leafy cemetery and wail by the photographs on their sons' headstones, with little public sympathy to console them."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/02/business/world-business-briefing-asia-japanese-joblessness-at-record.html": {"writer_name": "Sheryl Wudunn", "pub_date": "1999-06-02", "snippet": "Japan's unemployment rate remained at record high of 4.8 percent in April for second month; Chief Cabinet Sec Hiromu Nonaka says Government will consider measures to combat unemployment; graph (S)", "word_count": 63, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPANESE JOBLESSNESS AT RECORD", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; JAPANESE JOBLESSNESS AT RECORD", "body_text": " **********Japan's unemployment rate remained at a record high of 4.8 percent in April for a second month, the Government said, and economists say the rate could creep up further as Japanese companies continue to restrict new hires and ease workers off the payrolls.

People whose ancestors were Turkish, as Mr. Bolukbasi's were, mixed freely with Macedonians, Jews, Croats, Greeks, Slovenes -- anyone who found their way through his portals. Cognac was the social lubricant of choice. **********Today, Mr. Bolukbasi is that faceless being called a refugee, part of the human flood that has surged out of Kosovo in recent weeks. He has lost his home, his restaurant, many of his friends and everything he worked to build. **********Now he finds himself responsible for a family of 23 people, including small children and his 67-year-old mother. They are jammed into a small apartment in a dreary concrete colony here, outside Istanbul. **********Despite his misfortunes, Mr. Bolukbasi knows that he is lucky. He and most of his relatives escaped the Balkan inferno. Thanks to help from a Turkish friend, they have a place to live and food to eat. **********''Life was beautiful in Kosovo until 1989,'' Mr. Bolukbasi said. ''I wouldn't trade a minute of that time with anyone in the world.'' **********It was in 1989 that Slobodan Milosevic, now Yugoslavia's President, began his climb to power with fiery promises to his Serbian brethren in Kosovo. Soon afterward, Albanian-language schools in Kosovo were closed, thousands of Kosovo Albanians were dismissed from their jobs and replaced with Serbs, and a spiral of ethnic chauvinism was set in motion that led to the savagery of the last two months. **********Mr. Bolukbasi, whose wife is of Albanian extraction, fled his home at the end of March. He spent his last evening in Pristina with a band of Serbian militiamen, who urged him to bomb the apartment of his upstairs neighbor, an Albanian nationalist. **********''I told them I couldn't do that, because if I bombed the building my family would also die,'' he said. ''One of the thugs reached into his shirt and pulled out a knife. He told me, 'O.K., if you can't bomb the guy, just go up and cut his throat.' '' **********An hour after escaping from that encounter, Mr. Bolukbasi and eight relatives packed themselves into a car and set out on a trek that took them first to Macedonia and ultimately to Turkey. He has vague dreams of joining relatives in Germany, but he seems to lose concentration when he considers the future. The past only brings tears to his eyes, so he lives only in the present. **********As the oldest of five siblings, Mr. Bolukbasi, 45, must now assume the role of patriarch. One member of his clan is a 20-year-old woman whose mother, Mr. Bolukbasi's sister, was turned back as she tried to flee Kosovo. The younger woman rarely speaks, and no one in the crowded apartment knows what has befallen her immediate family. **********Tuade Bolukbasi, 35, landed in Turkey after a harrowing monthlong journey from Kosovo. **********''The police came to our house with guns and told us we could leave the building if we each paid 200 marks,'' Ms. Bolukbasi said, naming a sum equivalent to about $130.  ''Then they made the women watch while they beat the men. They told us: 'Look at how we can beat Albanians. You wanted NATO, so now you have NATO. See if NATO can help you.' '' **********So far, only one member of the Bolukbasi clan has found work in Turkey. He is a 16-year-old who packs groceries at a market. The family is sustained by his salary, help from their Turkish patron and donations from municipal officials. **********Turkey has deep historical ties to the Kosovo Albanians. Some Serbs assert that Ottoman Turks created the region's ethnic problem centuries ago by capturing the region and persuading some citizens to convert from Orthodox Christianity to Islam. **********This history has given Turks a feeling of kinship with the people fleeing Kosovo. Turkey has accepted about 16,000 of them since March, according to the Turkish press. More than 5,000 are living at a camp at Kirklareli in western Turkey, and the rest, like the Bolukbasi family, have melted into the population. **********President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey visited the Kirklareli camp recently, distributed radios and other gifts and told refugees, ''You will be back home in your land before winter comes.'' **********That pledge sounds far-fetched to refugees like Mr. Bolukbasi. ''Even if I could go back, what would I go back to?'' he wondered. ''What would I do? How would I live with neighbors who killed children?'' **********After a lifetime of friendship with people whose ethnic identity never seemed important, Mr. Bolukbasi now finds himself among those who want revenge. **********''I like what NATO has done so far,'' he said solemnly. ''But now I want them to start killing people. All Serbs are Milosevic now. All of them are maniacs.

It has become a sort of  museum of a museum, with dark paneled walls and dim, shadowy lighting that were once believed to enhance a sense of dignity and seriousness, and boxy, home-aquarium-style display cases that let the art speak for itself. **********The stodginess and fading glory of the museum began to bother Mexican authorities. And now, despite years of economic turmoil, the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo has embarked on a sweeping  renovation. **********The project is going to cost about $13 million and is supposed to be completed in December 2000 as Mr. Zedillo turns over power to a new President. **********Everyone agrees that the updating is overdue. But with such basics as running water and electricity unavailable to many Mexicans, not everyone thinks that so much money should be sunk into a museum, even one that is internationally acclaimed and that helps pay for itself by contributing to the country's important tourist business. **********Gilberto Lopez y Rivas, a first-term congressman in the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution and an anthropologist by training,  practically stammers when he talks about the project. **********Unquestionably, he said, the museum, where he once worked, is a great showcase of Mexico's past. But he said it was ''an insult that you can spend that kind of money while so many of the country's Indians are living in absolute poverty, with dirt floors and no water.'' **********Still, there seems to be far more applause than criticism of the make-over. **********''My guess is that if we have to look at this as a trade-off, where do you spend your money?'' said Federico Estevez, a political science professor in Mexico City. ''In the end, a lot of people will prefer to spend it on the museum. Maybe you need to pave roads or build something in a small town somewhere. But the museum is something that can be seen and enjoyed by everyone. It's a big, gorgeous place with all this history.'' **********Raquel Tibol, an author and art critic for the weekly Proceso magazine, said the right thing was being done for the wrong reason. **********''Every President,'' she said, ''increases the number of projects like this at the end of his term. They all spend their last year in office dedicating hospitals, factories, bridges, museums, whatever.'' **********Ms. Tibol said the museum was built ''too fast'' so that the outgoing President at the time, Adolfo Lopez Mateos, could dedicate it. A result was too little administrative space, she said, and inadequate climate control in storage areas. **********No one, she said, should be put off by the cost. ''Look at the cost of corruption, or the cost of these political campaigns that are going on right now,'' she said. ''That is what is really outrageous in this country.'' **********Carpenters and painters are to finish the first six galleries by late September and three more by the end of the year, leaving 14 display areas to be completed next year. Some skeptics question whether meeting the December 2000 deadline is possible. And they worry that if there are delays and cost overruns, a new administration may have other priorities. **********The new design for the museum transforms it from a passive, sometimes somber viewing experience to one with exhibits that will draw visitors along paths through sections of villages and burial grounds, combining displays of centuries-old pottery and stone sculpture in reproductions of the kinds of homes and temples in which they were used. **********Touch-screen computers are being sprinkled in alcoves so as not to distract from the antiquities but to provide instant historical details. Bell-shaped acoustical devices will be suspended above some of the paths so people can pause under them and listen to long-ago regional music and voices speaking in early forms of some of the country's more than 50 indigenous dialects. A huge panel covered with a drawing of the Tlatelolco marketplace, where Hernan Cortez, the Spaniard who defeated the Aztecs, reported seeing daily crowds of up to 30,000 people, is being turned into a video screen where three projectors will play constantly changing images. **********Relenting to longtime criticism, museum officials are going to provide legends identifying objects not only in Spanish but in English as well. **********Besides all the technological wonders, the museum is literally changing the face of some of its proudest exhibits based on new information from a surge of more than 200 archeological digs in Mexico in the last five years. **********For example, several revisions are being made to the big sand-table model of the ceremonial center of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, where Mexico City now stands. **********''In 1965, people invented a serpent wall around the whole thing,'' said Felipe Solis Olguin, a deputy director of the museum. ''That didn't exist. In reality, there was a large platform wall with many staircases to ground level. Some temples and the ball court were in the wrong position. And five or six buildings had been left out.  The archeologists found evidence of how it really looked.'' **********Memories of the Christmas Day theft here in 1985, in which more than 100 priceless gold, jade and stone artifacts were taken, still pain museum officials. Nearly all of the pieces were later recovered from a home in Mexico City and two men were arrested. **********At the time, the Government said museum guards had apparently been sleeping off the effects of a Christmas Eve party. But Teresa Franco, the director of the National Institute of Anthropology and History, which runs the museum, said that it was not really a matter of anyone having had too much to drink. **********''The main fault,'' she said, ''was our security system.'' Now, she said, there are about 85 guards, nearly triple the size of the security force in 1985. Since the theft, the museum has also fitted alarms to display cases and installed video cameras and a central monitoring room."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/13/news/facing-the-very-loud-music-american-topics.html": {"writer_name": "Brian Knowlton", "pub_date": "1999-10-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 440, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Facing the (Very Loud) Music : AMERICAN TOPICS", "print_headline": "Facing the (Very Loud) Music : AMERICAN TOPICS", "body_text": " **********If you drive by City Hall on a Friday evening in Fort Lupton, Colorado, you will find teenagers listening to loud music, as in almost any small American town.

''It will demand from us a recognition that there is no easy way out of the region's troubles, but there is a solution that advances our interest and keeps faith with our values, if we are ready to make a long-term commitment.'' [Excerpts, page A11.] **********The cost of that commitment continues to rise. The White House is expected to ask Congress for $5.9 billion in emergency spending to cover the costs of American involvement in the operation over the next few months. **********The request, which officials said could be submitted as early as Friday, has increased significantly to $4 billion from estimates of $3 billion earlier this week, the military and Administration officials said. They attributed the increase to the activation of so many reservists and the request by NATO's Supreme Commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, for about 300 more American aircraft. **********In Congress, where some lawmakers have criticized the Administration's strategy in the Balkans, Mr. Clinton's senior military advisers urged patience, saying an air campaign would ultimately undermine President Slobodan Milosevic or at least level the playing field for a resurgent rebel force in Kosovo. **********Some lawmakers scoffed at the assertion, viewing the assessments as a way to deflect attention from a discussion about sending in ground troops. Others were dubious of reports that ethnic Albanian guerrillas, who the Pentagon had said were virtually wiped out by the Serbs earlier in the conflict, would ever be strong enough to defeat what was left of the Yugoslav Army in Kosovo. **********And some discarded the idea that a rebel force could act as a surrogate for allied ground troops needed to defeat the Serbs. **********Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate's Armed Services Committee, ''I don't think that there is any question that we can accomplish the mission, the military mission that was laid out with air power, to reduce the capabilities of the Serb military and police forces.'' **********General Shelton emphasized again today that military success might not achieve one of NATO's political goals -- allowing the Kosovar Albanian refugees to return to their homes. **********Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen warned senators that as air raids continued, American casualties were no longer just ''possible'' but ''probable,'' adding, ''This is not going to be quick or easy or neat.'' **********The size of the forces arrayed against Mr. Milosevic has grown steadily. Requests for more aircraft from NATO nations would increase the total to more than 1,000, more than double the 430 the alliance had ready when the strikes began on March 24. **********The size of General Clark's request for American aircraft, which surprised the Pentagon, has forced officials to consider the large call-up of Reserve and Guard members. **********A third of the aircraft requested, for instance, are aerial tankers needed to refuel the waves of fighters and bombers conducting raids into Yugoslavia. Many of those tankers -- KC-135's and KC-10's -- are assigned to Reserve or National Guard units around the country. **********The Pentagon is still working out the details of which units will be called up and how many people will be needed. While a senior military official said the total would be around 30,000, an Administration official said it could be as high as 33,000. By law, the President can authorize the activation of 200,000 reservists or Guard members for 270 days at a time. **********The final details of the activation are expected to be completed by the weekend and could be approved by Mr. Cohen by early next week. **********If approved, as expected, the call-up would be the largest single activation since 1990 and 1991, when 265,000 were sent to the Persian Gulf. It is the first of any significance since 3,800 reservists and guardsmen went to Bosnia with the first NATO peacekeepers in 1995. Since then, thousands have continued to serve in Bosnia, where today they account for about 1,000 of the 7,000 American troops there. **********A vast majority of those called up will be in the Air Force Reserve or the Air National Guard. While many will be pilots or crew members for tankers, cargo planes or other support aircraft, some will operate fighter jets, including F-16's and  A-10's. **********The Army is also expected to call up a large contingent of reservists, many of them soldiers needed to support the deployment of two dozen Apache helicopter gunships to Albania. The Apache force is slowly setting up an operating base in Albania and needs engineers and security officers, as well as Army reservists trained to interact with locals. **********The total size of that force is now expected to be as high as 4,800 soldiers, more than double the 2,000 estimated when the deployment was announced, Army officials said. **********The Navy and Marine Corps will contribute far fewer reservists, the officials said. All of them will come from units in high demand in the fighting, including crews of EA-6B jets, which jam the enemy's radar and other electronic communications, the officials said. **********The officials said the total that Mr. Cohen requests will be a ceiling. In other words, the Pentagon plans to seek authority for about 30,000, but may not need all of them to report to duty. The officials said they probably would be called up in batches. **********All of the armed services have come to rely more heavily than ever on the nation's 900,000 reservists. In the Air Force, in particular, Reserve and National Guard units are routinely used during their scheduled training periods to patrol the skies over Bosnia and Iraq."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/16/business/most-pilots-at-american-are-now-back-in-the-cockpit.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1999-02-16", "snippet": "Overwhelming majority of American Airlines pilots, pressured by Federal judge's contempt citation, return to work, alleviating delays for passengers and allowing airline to make major strides toward returning to normal; American says it expects to...", "word_count": 1179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Pilots at American Are Now Back In the Cockpit", "print_headline": "Most Pilots at American Are Now Back In the Cockpit", "body_text": " **********Pressured by a Federal judge's contempt citation, an overwhelming majority of American Airlines pilots returned to work yesterday, alleviating delays for passengers and allowing the airline to make major strides toward returning to normal. **********After canceling about 12 percent of its flights yesterday, American, a unit of AMR, announced that it expected to fly nearly all of its 2,250 scheduled flights today. **********Christopher Chiames, a spokesman for American, said: ''We operated close to 2,000 flights today -- 90 percent of our schedule -- and tomorrow we will essentially be back to full operations. That's not to say there won't be a handful of cancellations, but you have a handful of cancellations every day.'' **********Even as most pilots ended their sickout, which began 10 days ago, several pilots interviewed yesterday said that out of anger toward American, they would refuse to fly extra flights beyond their normal schedule. As a result, officials of American said yesterday that beginning next month the airline would reduce the number of scheduled flights by a few dozen each day because of concerns that many pilots would not agree to work overtime. **********American, the nation's second-largest carrier after United Airlines, said it canceled nearly 300 flights yesterday -- down sharply from 1,100 three days ago -- as the number of pilots calling in sick fell for the third consecutive day. Union officials said about 400 pilots called in sick yesterday, about average for a February day and far below the 2,400 who called in sick last Thursday and Friday. **********The pilots started streaming back to work after Judge Joe Kendall of the Federal District Court in Dallas issued a ruling on Saturday that held the pilots' union in contempt and ordered it to deposit $10 million with the court in anticipation of his levying a fine even larger than that. **********In citing the Allied Pilots Association and its two leaders for contempt, Judge Kendall found that they had not complied with an order he issued last Wednesday directing the pilots to return to work. **********At O'Hare International Airport near Chicago yesterday, the lines at American's counters were far smaller and passengers were far less irate than they had been on Friday and Saturday. Fewer cancellations meant fewer delays and made it far easier for customers to find alternatives if their flights were canceled. **********Linda Mann of Bakersfield, Calif., who flew to Chicago on Saturday to do some business and then was flying to Detroit yesterday to visit family, said: ''I was really worried. I thought I was going to be stuck in the L.A. airport and not be able to get out, but I had no problems. I was very happy, to say the least.'' **********Brian Nolting of Chicago, who was at O'Hare with his wife to take a flight to Tucson, Ariz., to visit their daughter, said: ''I was envisioning myself sleeping on the airport floor, and I didn't like that. It was good news to see the flight was going.'' **********At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, one indication that things were returning to normal was that skycaps were far busier. Wally Smith, a longtime American skycap, said: ''Last week was terrible. When flights don't come in, I don't make any money. Today is better. I'm even smiling today.'' **********The union and airlines resumed negotiations yesterday, after not holding formal talks since Thursday. The main issue in the dispute is the union's unhappiness with the way American is handling its acquisition of Reno Air. **********''We didn't have any movement today on the core issues,'' Richard T. LaVoy, the union's president, said in a telephone interview last night. ''I would say a lot of pilots are frustrated that management hasn't been sensitive to our core issues. There is a tremendous frustration that we haven't been able to close this out.'' **********Union officials say they fear that American may move some routes to Reno Air, where pilots earn about half what American's earn, and that American's pilots might lose some work as a result. American officials denied that they planned to do this, adding that their intention was to integrate Reno Air into its larger network over the next 18 months. But union officials said they wanted the airlines integrated far faster, while the salaries of Reno pilots are increased so that they are comparable to those of American pilots -- who average $140,000 a year. **********Some of American's 9,200 pilots said they remained bitter toward the airline, insisting that they would refuse to accept extra flights beyond the 78 hours of flying they are contractually required to work each month. This tactic could force occasional cancellations and delays, but far less than during the sickout. **********Several pilots also said they would work to rule, meaning they might delay flights by spending extra time doing equipment checks and safety checks above and beyond what is required. **********''I'm really angry at the company right now,'' said one pilot who called in sick and spoke on condition of anonymity. ''My personal feeling is that I'm going to work to rule and I'm not going to fly any overtime now.'' **********Eager not to anger Judge Kendall any further, union officials said they were doing their utmost to persuade pilots to return to the cockpit and get the airline back to normal. And union officials said they were not urging pilots to refuse overtime. **********''The union leadership is not encouraging that,'' Mr. LaVoy said. **********But many pilots said that despite union leaders' calls to work overtime, there was a widespread feeling -- even among American executives -- that many pilots would refuse to work overtime. **********Explaining the airline's decision to make a modest reduction in the number of scheduled flights next month, Mr. Chiames, the airline spokesman, said, ''At this point, we're making the assumption as we move forward that to avoid staffing shortages because pilots refuse to pick up open time, we'll have to reduce the scheduled flights.'' Open time refers to flights beyond the contract's requirements. **********Mr. Chiames added: ''The company's goal here is to welcome all of our pilots back. The goal is for there not to be hostilities as they come back to work.'' **********In his ruling on Saturday, Judge Kendall said he would require the union to compensate American for losses suffered as a result of the sickout. In court last week, American said its losses totaled more than $40 million. **********But Mr. Chiames suggested yesterday that the losses could be considerably more than that. He estimated that the airline lost $12,000 to $16,000 on each canceled flight. Since American was forced to cancel more than 6,000 flights, that could translate into losses of $72 million to $96 million. **********American officials pointed out, however, that the losses could be considerably lower than that because it used less fuel and had lower food expenses. **********Several labor experts said that in the negotiations the union was likely to ask the airline to put forward a low estimate of its losses at a hearing scheduled for tomorrow. Judge Kendall said he would use the hearing to determine Americans' damages and to order a fine based on that amount. **********The pilots' leaders told the judge last week that the union's net assets totaled about $38 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/19/world/sonia-gandhi-and-her-party-in-tough-race.html": {"writer_name": "Celia Dugger", "pub_date": "1999-09-19", "snippet": "Sonia Gandhi's leadership of India's Congress Party faces key test as she seeks her late husband's former seat in Uttar Pradesh, once bastion of Congress power, where party failed to win single seat in national elections last year; polls show part...", "word_count": 357, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sonia Gandhi And Her Party In Tough Race", "print_headline": "Sonia Gandhi And Her Party In Tough Race", "body_text": " **********Sonia Gandhi's leadership of the Congress  Party  which long ruled India, but is now a shadow of its former self -- faced its most crucial test today as voting in India's gargantuan monthlong national election moved into the biggest Hindi heartland states. **********The biggest prize is Uttar Pradesh, the north Indian state with a population of 160 million.

The targets were set at a special session of the General Assembly last June. **********More intensive satellite surveillance would also expose the so-called balloon effect in which illicit crops reduced or eradicated in one region or country tend to shift to another. **********Pino Arlacchi, the executive director of the drug control program, said that the European Space Agency will provide the satellites and technical expertise to monitor the drug crops for member countries, and the European Commission has agreed to pay some of the costs.

The program lasted two days. **********The decision, taken late Thursday by President Ernesto Zedillo, drew whoops of joy from lawmakers and community leaders representing Mexicans in the United States, who had protested that the plan imposed a humiliating burden on them and would block many from returning to Mexico for Christmas with their families. **********''We are celebrating,'' exulted Luis Eduardo Pelayo Gomez, president of the Concilio Hispano, a Mexican group based in Chicago. ''This is the first time the Mexican community here managed to bring this kind of pressure on Mexico. It shows that we can use our power and make changes.'' **********The plan apparently arose from some confusion within the government when officials failed to calculate the impact on Mexicans living north of the border. As many as two million are expected to come home for the holidays, many in their own cars. **********Mr. Zedillo responded within hours to a resolution passed on Thursday by the Mexican Senate, with support from both the opposition and leaders of his own party, calling on him to cancel the plan. The lower legislative house was set to pass a similar resolution. **********The announcement from the Interior Ministry said the plan was ''delayed until further notice.'' **********Officials said that Mr. Zedillo ordered his government to start again and find a more viable measure to address the issue at the heart of the first plan: the huge illegal flow of foreign-purchased vehicles into Mexico. The new deposit, which ranged from $400 to $800, was intended to force travelers to take their cars back out of Mexico instead of leaving them illegally in the country."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/18/news/island-continents-challenge-23000-miles-of-poorly-guarded-coastline.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Richardson", "pub_date": "1999-05-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Island Continent's Challenge /23,000 Miles of Poorly Guarded Coastline : Australia Takes Steps to Halt Illegal Immigrants", "print_headline": "Island Continent's Challenge /23,000 Miles of Poorly Guarded Coastline : Australia Takes Steps to Halt Illegal Immigrants", "body_text": " **********SYDNEY\u2014                     Australia's reputation for having an easygoing, affluent lifestyle has its downside, especially when many countries in Asia and the Middle East are struggling with economic difficulties and political tensions. **********After a recent spate of landings of hundreds of illegal migrants by boat, and a much larger inflow of such people by plane masquerading as tourists, Australian officials are acting to tighten coastal surveillance and increase their powers to deport clandestine migrants without delay. **********Officials say most of the illegal boat migrants are smuggled in by syndicates in China and the Middle East after they pay thousands of dollars for passage. The new arrivals hope to join relatives already in Australia or simply to melt into the large Chinese and Middle Eastern migrant communities that are well-established here and find work. **********On Monday, a ship carrying more than 80 illegal immigrants was intercepted on Sydney's doorstep. Last week, 54 illegal immigrants were taken to Darwin and sent to a detention center after being dumped by boat on Ashmore Reef, a group of uninhabited islands about 600 kilometers (360 miles) off the northwest coast of Australia. **********A Coastwatch patrol \u2014 an air and sea surveillance system organized by the Australian Customs Service, the military and civilian contractors \u2014 spotted the group several days after they had been left on the reef by the smugglers. **********Their arrival followed the landing of 60 Chinese immigrants at Scotts Head, halfway between Sydney and Brisbane, last month, and 26 others near Cairns in northeastern Australia in March. **********That was the first time the Asian smugglers, using old fishing or tug boats, were known to have landed illegal immigrants on Australia's populated east coast, close to major cities. Although the passengers were quickly detained, the fact that the landings had gone undetected caused a furor. **********\"It illustrates the growing trend of unlawful people movement and the fact that Australia is increasingly becoming a target,\" said Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock. **********He said the Chinese smugglers were highly organized, charging their passengers around 60,000 Australian dollars ($40,000) for the boat and 3,725 dollars per person for the voyage. **********\"The passengers are well-dressed; they carry Australian currency and can more easily assimilate into the population,\" he said. **********As the smuggling of people has risen, so has that of illegal drugs. **********Several of the country's biggest drug seizures have been made along the same stretch of the eastern coast where the illegal Chinese immigrants were found. In Coffs Harbor in December, 225 kilograms (495 pounds) of cocaine was found by officials in the hull of a small boat. Two months earlier, police made Australia's largest heroin haul yet, near Port Macquarie. **********\"There is a definite link between the importation of drugs and the importation of illegal immigrants,\" said Mick Keelty, national operations general manager of the Australian Federal Police. \"The organizers can use the money raised from this to fund drug imports, and vice versa.\" **********Officials estimate that as many as 55,000 illegal immigrants are currently in Australia. A further 80,000 are being allowed to settle legally in the fiscal year ending in June. About 12,000 illegal entrants were found and expelled in 1998. **********Many of those who enter Australia illegally from Asia, the Middle East and other parts of the world subsequently claim to be fleeing persecution at home and seek asylum. **********Mr. Ruddock said recently that the government would change the law to limit the access of such people to judicial review. He argued that Australia must have a system to ensure that unlawful arrivals did not frustrate and delay their removal by resorting repeatedly to court action. **********He said that Australia would also consider asking some foreign tourists who were considered to be \"high risk\" as potential overstayers of their visas to pay a cash bond for their entry visa that would be refunded when they returned to their country of origin. **********In the past 10 months, 21 boats carrying more than 400 illegal Asian immigrants, mostly Chinese, have arrived in Australia. Officials say all the would-be immigrants were detained and will eventually be sent home. **********The Scotts Head arrivals, for example, were sent back to China early this month. \"They risked their lives on a journey that was never going to work,\" Mr. Ruddock said. \"That is why it is imperative we return illegal boat people as quickly as we can, so that others will see that such a trip is not only dangerous but futile.\" **********But the task of policing Australia's 37,000 kilometers (23,000 miles) of coastline, much of it remote and practically unpopulated, is daunting. **********Critics say Australia should consider copying the United States by setting up a well-equipped coast guard separate from its military. The present Coastwatch system has only eight vessels and 14 aircraft that are immediately available. **********\"The lack of a professional coast-guard service with adequate resources means the whole process of external intelligence-gathering and analysis, surveillance, detection and interception is shared by too many agencies,\" said Michael O'Connor, executive director of the Australian Defense Association. \"The navy, for example, does virtually all the interception work with just 15 aging patrol boats, and this is only a small part of its national task.\" **********He said that the U.S. Coast Guard had an annual budget of $6.3 billion, 42,000 uniformed and civilian personnel, 175 patrol vessels and 211 aircraft to police 20,000 kilometers of coastline, barely half the length of the Australian coast. **********Mr. O'Connor said an effective Australian coast guard would need about 4,000 personnel and a range of armed patrol vessels, planes and helicopters with sensors. He estimated that the annual operating cost of such a force would be about 1 billion Australian dollars. **********\"It is not good enough for Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock to argue that, of the 100 or so boats that arrived in Australia in the past couple of years, only four were undetected. How do we know?\" The Australian newspaper asked recently. \"There are good grounds for doubting whether either Coastwatch or the Customs Service is sufficiently well-equipped, in technology and in personnel, to know exactly who is landing on our shores.\" **********Prime Minister John Howard announced last month that he had set up a task force, including top defense and intelligence officials, to recommend improvements in coastal surveillance procedures and systems. It is to present its report next month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/28/business/private-sector-in-this-corner-a-clever-promoter.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Smith", "pub_date": "1999-02-28", "snippet": "Profile of Cedric Kushner, boxing promoter; he has eight world champions in his stable of 55 fighters, but admits he makes his momey mostly with volume; he promoted 57 fights in 1998 and is aiming to increase that this year; photo (M)", "word_count": 789, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In This Corner, a Clever Promoter", "print_headline": "PRIVATE SECTOR; In This Corner, a Clever Promoter", "body_text": " **********ALL three telephones in the apartment office of Cedric Kushner, the boxing promoter, were ringing off the hook one morning last week. A crisis had arisen: One of Mr. Kushner's fighters was thinking of backing out of a bout because his mother had become convinced that demons were intent on attacking her son through air-conditioning vents. Executives at HBO, the cable network that was supposed to broadcast the match, were in a high state of anxiety. **********But Mr. Kushner remained calm. **********''If a boxer doesn't fight, what am I going to do? Jump out of a window?'' he asked as he coolly took another sip of Tab.''There will always be other bouts.'' **********Well, yes, if you are Cedric Kushner, that is. Mr. Kushner promoted 57 fights last year in the United States and Europe, a huge number by the standards of the industry. Although he doesn't represent household names like Evander Holyfield or Oscar De La Hoya, he boasts 8 world champions in his stable of 55 fighters. And few can match him for sheer tenacity. Mr. Kushner says he never turns off his cell phone because it's always business hours somewhere in the world. **********''I've made some money with good talent, but mostly with volume,'' said Mr. Kushner, who is 49. ''I believe that volume will lead me to the opportunity to sign the next Evander Holyfield.'' **********Actually, he is setting his sights much higher than that. He wants nothing less than to restore boxing -- now a scandal-tainted sport dominated by a handful of flamboyant promoters -- to its glory days. The crux of his strategy is simple: Win over more fans. He has created a television program of boxing matches called ''Heavyweight Explosion'' that is broadcast twice a month on satellite and cable TV, including the MSG Network. He is also organizing 10 boxing shows for the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan this year. **********Mr. Kushner has hired Park Avenue Productions of New York to find corporate sponsors for his bouts. **********''I don't think anyone in the sports marketing and advertising business can ignore this sport anymore, especially when you look at a major conglomerate like Time Warner and the major investment that they have made in the sport,'' said Robert Crawford, Park Avenue Productions' vice president for sports and entertainment. **********Mr. Kushner, a South African grocer's son,  dropped out of school in the sixth grade and came to this country at the age of 21 with no clear idea of what to do with himself. He worked as a Ferris wheel operator on the Jersey Shore and as a pool cleaner at a Miami hotel before finding a niche in rock-and-roll in the late 1970's and early 80's, promoting concerts by groups like Styx and Fleetwood Mac. He got hooked on boxing, he said, when he signed his first fighter, ''Irish'' Teddy Mann, who was actually Polish. Mr. Kushner won't say how much he is now worth, but he has offices and homes in Manhattan and the Hamptons. **********Now, as co-promoter of a fight next Saturday in Atlantic City between David Reid, the only American boxer to win a gold medal in the 1996 Olympic Games, and Lou Savarese, he is nipping at the heels of the big boys. He has no illusions about his competition -- ''You'd better sharpen your teeth with barbed wire to compete with the likes of guys like Bob Arum and Don King,'' he says. But he isn't intimidated by them, either. **********Right now, Mr. Arum, the president of Top Rank Boxing Inc.; Mr. King, the owner of Don King Productions, and the Duva family, the owners of Main Events, dominate an industry that is governed neither by a league nor a commission and that is only loosely regulated by state commissions. With annual revenues of just $500 million, it pales next to sports like baseball and basketball. But there are big-money events, like the planned heavyweight fight in Madison Square Garden between Mr. Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, a bout that could generate $70 million. **********So far, Mr. Kushner's biggest draws are Shane Mosley, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, and Shannon Briggs and Mr. Savarese, a pair of New York area heavyweight contenders. But he has the inside track at promoting Prince Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant featherweight from Sheffield, England, who wows crowds with his gyrating dances to the ring and his front flip over the top rope. **********IN some ways, Mr. Kushner comes across as an outsider in the rough-and-tumble world of American boxing. His measured speech makes him sound almost like a diplomat. But that doesn't bother him. ''I'm involved with boxing,'' he said, ''but that doesn't mean I should be walking around with a Q-tip behind my ear, not being able to put three words together without cursing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/14/business/company-news-firstcity-financial-is-selling-mortgage-operations.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-08-14", "snippet": "Firstcity Financial Corp to sell its mortgage operations (S)", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FIRSTCITY FINANCIAL IS SELLING MORTGAGE OPERATIONS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; FIRSTCITY FINANCIAL IS SELLING MORTGAGE OPERATIONS", "body_text": " **********The Firstcity Financial Corporation said yesterday that it planned to sell its mortgage operations, saying the business did not ''fit the company's long-term strategy.''

At the same time, the Pentagon will not oppose a separate bid by Litton, which already makes Navy destroyers, to acquire Avondale Industries, a New Orleans-based maker of auxiliary naval vessels. **********''The Navy has indicated to all interested parties that the Navy, in principle, has no objection to Litton's acquisition of Avondale Industries,'' said a top Pentagon official. ''The Litton-Newport News transaction is more complex and presents numerous challenges for the Navy'' that the official said ''could not be overcome.'' **********Litton, which is based in Woodland Hills, Calif., had proposed earlier this month to acquire Newport News for $1.3 billion, plus the assumption of $600 million in debt, and to buy Avondale for about $500 million. **********Specifically, the Navy was concerned that there would be two competitors, not three, for most classes of Navy ships and it was not convinced that possible cost savings from a Litton-Newport News merger would be sufficient to justify the reduction in competition. In addition, the Navy was concerned that the bulk of its research and development dollars would largely be directed to one shipyard if the Litton-Newport News deal were approved. **********Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Defense Department spokesman, said that the Pentagon was not asked to make a formal evaluation of the proposed deal but, ''when we learned of the merger plan, we made this preliminary assessment and this is how we came out.'' **********''We have informally conveyed these preliminary views to these three companies and to interested parties on the Hill,'' he said. **********Captain Doubleday said that with the Litton-Avondale merger, ''there were no significant anticompetitive effects and there was substantial potential for savings.'' **********In the case of a Litton-Newport News merger, he added, ''the effects on competition were in no way offset by the savings.'' **********The Pentagon's decision comes at a time of musical chairs in the military shipbuilding business. First, Newport News made a bid for Avondale. Then, General Dynamics made a bid for Newport News -- and found that bid blocked earlier this year by the Pentagon on antitrust grounds. Now, Litton is finding that the Pentagon will let part of its double bid for Newport News and Avondale to go through, while opposing the biggest part of it. **********This turn of events leaves Avondale in the position of now having two suitors -- a $500 million offer from Litton and a $470 million offer from Newport News. **********It would also leave the nation with, potentially, three large shipbuilders: General Dynamics, best known as a maker of nuclear submarines; Newport News, the sole maker of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and Litton, one of two makers of Navy destroyers and the eight largest military contractor before this round of bidding began."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/06/business/martin-davis-72-created-modern-paramount.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1999-10-06", "snippet": "Martin S Davis, executive who reshaped unwieldy conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries into entertainment and publishing giant Paramount Communications, dies at age 72; photo (M)", "word_count": 869, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Martin Davis, 72; Created Modern Paramount", "print_headline": "Martin Davis, 72; Created Modern Paramount", "body_text": " **********Martin S. Davis, the fiery executive who reshaped the unwieldy conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries into the entertainment and publishing giant Paramount Communications, died Monday in Manhattan. He was 72 and lived in Westport, Conn. **********The cause was a heart attack, said Jerry Sherman, a spokesman for the Davis family. **********From a start in 1947 as a $35-a-week office boy at the New York headquarters of Samuel Goldwyn Productions, Mr. Davis climbed to the top of the entertainment and corporate worlds. Along the way, he shepherded the careers of some of the entertainment industry's top executives, including Michael Eisner, Barry Diller, Brandon Tartikoff and Jeffrey Katzenberg. **********That many executives who worked for Mr. Davis gained their greatest successes after departing his company is testament to Mr. Davis's legendary temper, which he described as an unwillingness to brook what he saw as shortcomings among those who worked for him. **********''If I'm considered a tough manager, I think it is accurate; I won't object, '' he told The New York Times in 1986. ''I am demanding. I want team players, I want results.'' **********A propensity to never shy away from a fight led Mr. Davis into public tangles with renowned corporate takeover artists like Carl Icahn and Carl Lindner, both Gulf and Western shareholders. And Mr. Davis's ultimately unsuccessful 11th-hour bid in 1989 to take Time Inc. out of the hands of Warner Communications was a fitting coda to the great takeover battles of the 1980's. **********Mr. Davis long maintained that each of his decisions was made with a single purpose: to produce the greatest possible value for public shareholders. And by that measure, he accomplished much. From the time he assumed control of Gulf and Western in 1983 until he sold the company, renamed Paramount Communications, to Viacom Inc. in 1994, the value of Paramount's shares increased at more than double the rate of the stock market. **********Upon taking over Gulf and Western after the death of Charles Bluhdorn, the company chairman, Mr. Davis began selling businesses. At the time, ''the company's operations literally spanned the alphabet, from A to Z, auto parts to zinc,'' Mr. Davis said in 1987. **********Among the industries in which Gulf and Western had a stake were agricultural products, metals and chemicals, financial services, motion pictures and auto parts distribution. **********Mr. Davis's divestitures reaped nearly $3 billion in cash for the company, much of which he used to repurchase stock. And while undertaking the sales, the company still managed to record earnings growth of 30 percent a year. **********''The assets that he kept, he managed reasonably well, and the segments flourished,'' said Mario J. Gabelli, a mutual fund manager who was a longtime Paramount shareholder. ''But he did lose some good people who went out and became very successful elsewhere.'' **********A native of the Bronx, Mr. Davis attended the City College of New York and New York University, but did not graduate. At 20, he joined Goldwyn's publicity department, where he clipped newspaper articles. After working his way up to assistant to the president, he joined Allied Artists Pictures in 1955 as Eastern advertising and publicity manager. Three years later, he moved to Paramount. **********Gulf and Western completed its acquisition of Paramount in 1966, and soon Mr. Davis was all but anointed the heir to Mr. Bluhdorn. While serving in the legal, human resources, corporate finance and general administration departments, Mr. Davis gave few hints that much of his business acumen was self-taught. A favorite practice, colleagues said, was to quote articles from legal journals to lawyers hired to advise the company. **********A four-year investigation of the company's financial and accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission resulted in civil charges of fraud against the company and two of its top officers in 1979. **********It was left to Mr. Davis to try to keep Gulf and Western's image from being too tarnished by the allegations, and he largely succeeded. In October 1981, the company and the officers reached a settlement with the S.E.C. that called for no restitution, although Gulf and Western agreed to adopt new accounting procedures and to make changes to its corporate bylaws. **********Mr. Davis ascended to the chairman's post as two trends were emerging in corporate America: the dominance of service companies over manufacturing industries, and the failure of the conglomerate. He overhauled Gulf and Western's structure to focus on three businesses -- entertainment and publishing, consumer and commercial finance, and consumer and industrial products. **********In 1985, the consumer and industrial products group was sold for $1 billion. And in 1989 the remainder of the financial unit, Associates First Capital, was sold. The company, which was renamed Paramount Communications, retained film and television studios, the publisher Simon & Schuster, and entertainment properties including the USA Network and Madison Square Garden. **********In 1993, as Mr. Davis entertained an offer to merge with Viacom, Barry Diller, then the chairman of QVC and one of Mr. Davis's former subordinates, began a bidding war for Paramount. Though ultimately won by Viacom, the battle produced a debt-burdened company that did not have room for Mr. Davis. **********Since 1995, Mr. Davis had been a managing partner of Wellspring Capital Management, a private investment firm in New York. **********Mr. Davis is survived by his second wife, Luella Davis, and a son,  Philip, of Arlington, Va."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/26/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-applebee-s-account-put-into-review.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-05-26", "snippet": "Applebee's International, which operates 950 restaurants under name Applebee's Neighborhood Bar and Grill, has placed its advertising account in review after seven years at Wyse Advertising (S)", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Applebee's Account Put Into Review", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Applebee's Account Put Into Review", "body_text": " **********Applebee's International in Overland Park, Kan., which operates 950 restaurants under the name Applebee's Neighborhood Bar and Grill, has placed its account in review after seven years at Wyse Advertising in Cleveland.

But even bigger increases -- of 300 percent or more -- are appearing for some remedies that are not on insurers' lists of approved drugs. **********Drugs may be omitted, or dropped, from such lists because they are deemed nonessential, like those for male impotence, baldness or wrinkles, or to help people quit smoking. But in many cases, insurers are refusing to endorse more costly new versions of life-sustaining drugs when cheaper alternatives exist. **********This double-barreled increase means that if patients insist on a certain drug, they might see the cost skyrocket from, say, $10 to $50. **********But will patients always do better with the latest, most costly drug, or is a flood of advertising making them think they will? Conversely, is a generic version of a drug, or a cheaper name brand, equally as good just because Federal regulators and health plans say it is? Those questions are open to debate. **********Drug makers insist that their new drugs are better and have fewer harmful side effects. By pushing cheaper, older drugs, they say, health plans ultimately drive up costs for hospital stays, nursing homes and doctors. **********Employers and managed care executives counter that they must slow the explosive spending for prescription drugs, which rose 15 to 20 percent in each of the last two years as an array of costly new drugs hit the market. Demand for those drugs, they say, was fed by thousands of promotional visits to doctors, and $1.3 billion in consumer advertising. **********Asking Congress to address the problem, President Clinton said in his State of the Union speech last week that ''affordable prescription drugs'' should be included in a restructured Medicare program. **********Many of the debate's ambiguities can be seen in the case of Jacqueline Lawrence, 70, of San Carlos, Calif. She used to pay a total of $16 a month for drugs for high blood pressure and bronchitis. But when she was forced recently to switch her Medicare health plan to Aetna U.S. Healthcare, she found neither drug on the list. She tried the alternatives, but ''all kinds of side effects'' forced her back to her original drugs. As a result, her monthly costs tripled to $50. **********''If a third drug that I take goes up to that extent, I don't know how I will manage,'' Ms. Lawrence said. Her 88-year-old mother, Lucille Warren, has faced similar problems. ''My mother worries about it,'' she said, ''and that makes her feel worse.'' **********While the choice used to be between generics and name brands, there is now a three-tiered system for many drug plans, with many of the biggest plans charging $50 or more for drugs not on their lists. In a letter to members in small businesses, Oxford Health Plans explained the new system, using blood pressure drugs as an example. **********An Oxford member typically used to pay $5 at the store for captopril, a generic version of Capoten, an old drug made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, or $10 for most brand-name drugs. Now, the typical Oxford member's payment for generic Capoten would be $7. For Accupril, made by Warner-Lambert, or Monopril, also made by Bristol-Myers -- both on the preferred list -- she would pay $15 or $20 or the retail price, whichever was less. **********Oxford members who work for large employers now typically pay $20 for all brands, although some big companies still subsidize $10 payments. **********But in small businesses in New York, if the patient went off the list -- for drugs like Merck's Vasotec, or the original Capoten -- she would pay $50 or the retail price. That would be $50 for Capoten (retail price $94.95 for a month's supply) and $34.99 for Vasotec, the retail price at the Seventh Avenue Pharmacy in Park Slope, Brooklyn. (The pharmacy receives only a flat $1.75 fee, regardless of the brand, said Bert Drachtman, the owner.) **********Even small increases hurt. ''To go to $20 from $10 is a big jump,'' said Max Daniels, community events director of Hospital Audiences, a small nonprofit agency in New York that is covered by Oxford. ''My doctor can't prescribe generics for me.'' **********''Direct advertising by drug companies is feeding consumer demand,'' said David Hom, executive director of corporate benefits at Pitney Bowes, which covers 26,000 employees in the United States. ''We could see people shifting from Mevacor to Lipitor,'' a heavily promoted new cholesterol-lowering drug. **********Dr. Nicholas Hanchak, head of pharmacy management for Aetna U.S. Healthcare, said the drug companies were using advertising and thousands of visits to doctors to promote ''higher-cost items.'' The newer drugs are often essentially the same as older, cheaper ones, he said, as determined by Federal regulators and the company's own physician and pharmacist review board. **********''Newer is not necessarily better, it's just better marketed,'' said Patricia Wilson, a consultant on managed drug plans in Rosemont, Pa. **********Spokesmen for drug makers, which are far more profitable than other health care industries, say consumers get valuable information from the ads, which they can take to doctors. But managed care executives say patients often demand advertised drugs that are not appropriate or no more effective than cheaper alternatives. **********One factor influencing the lists is that H.M.O.'s often make deals with drug makers, negotiating lower prices in return for pushing a particular drug. **********Paul Pochtar, a managed care marketing director at the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, added that charging employees more ''will give them a greater appreciation for the drug benefit.'' He said, ''Most people with coverage take the drug benefit for granted.'' **********Dr. Lee Newcomer, medical director of Unitedhealth Group, one of the biggest managed care companies, said United added expensive new drugs to its preferred list if they produced unique benefits. **********Drugs accounted for 12 percent of Pitney Bowes's health costs last year, a big jump from 7.5 percent six years ago. The company has just introduced a new payment schedule: Employees now pay 30 percent of the retail cost of brands not on the preferred list, 20 percent for brands on the list, and 10 percent for lower-priced generics. But there is no charge for drugs at Pitney Bowes clinics in Connecticut, where the company has 6,000 employees. **********Even with the higher costs for patients, industry analysts see little hope of slowing the increases in 1999. ''It's still going to be double-digit,'' said Mary Sevon, a pharmacy benefit consultant based in Fairless Hills, Pa. ''We saw 18 percent increases last year and we are predicting the same level for this year.'' **********She said some health plans are refusing to help pay for any drugs except those on their list in ''categories that cost the most -- cardiovascular, nonsteroidal painkillers for arthritis, and antidepressants'' like Prozac. Patients will have to pay the full cost, which can be $60 a month or more, for these types of drugs if they are not on the preferred list. **********Health maintenance organizations on the West Coast often offer a list called a closed formulary, said Virginia White, vice president of Integrated Pharmaceutical Services, a division of Foundation Health Systems. H.M.O.'s typically pays for drugs not on the list only if a doctor can persuade the health plan to make an exception when the preferred medication has not worked. **********Kaiser Permanente, for example, recently switched its California members from Coumadin, a DuPont blood-thinner that protects against stroke, to warfarin sodium, a generic the Food and Drug Administration said was biologically equivalent. Dr. David Campen, a Kaiser pharmaceutical executive, said the change had saved Kaiser several million dollars in California, where it spends $1 billion a year on drugs. **********Despite the F.D.A. ruling, DuPont persuaded regulators in several states that the generic would cause problems for patients now taking Coumadin, preventing H.M.O.'s from making the switch in North Carolina, Virginia and Texas. **********Win some, lose some. Regulators in California and New York overruled Kaiser when it tried to exclude payments for Viagra, Pfizer's popular impotence treatment. **********Susan Palomba, manager of health care planning and administration at the Timken Company, based in Canton, Ohio, said that ''some H.M.O.'s in some locations are being much more aggressive in introducing closed formularies.'' But Timken still offers most employees an ''open formulary,'' from which they can get any drug for a moderate payment. **********Ms. Palomba said Timken's drug costs have been growing 20 percent annually. The company tries to minimize the spending by reviewing the kinds and amounts of drugs its employees take and sometimes recommending changes. **********Some California H.M.O.'s are squeezing the closed lists even further, said Debi Reissman, president of Rxperts, a managed care consulting firm in Irvine, Calif. ''Instead of offering three to six products in every therapeutic class, for example, antidepressants or blood pressure drugs, they are moving down to two or three products,'' she said. **********''Certain plans may pay for the generic only and offer zero coverage for brand-name drugs,'' said Neeraj Kanwal, executive medical director of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, based in Indianapolis. He said other plans pay only the relatively low cost of the generic, say $7, while the patient pays $53 for a $60 brand. **********But he said there was ''a backlash against closed formularies.'' **********''They are not a popular item for customers,'' Mr. Kanwal added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/15/business/company-briefs-876534.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP., Bethesda, Md., said it had been awarded a contract from the Navy for operation and maintenance of its systems equipment at two training operations.

Despite repeated promises from Jakarta, the security forces have done nothing to stop the violence by military-backed local militias.

He said renegade troops may include some of about 6,000 soldiers who are native to East Timor and who do not want to see it break from Indonesia. **********In an indication of the tenuousness of Mr. Habibie's political position, Jakarta was swept today by rumors that he was being forced by the military to step down. **********Both Mr. Habibie and Mr. Alatas canceled longstanding plans to attend the annual summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council, which began today in Auckland, New Zealand. **********In Jakarta, where local news reports have presented a politically skewed picture of the situation in East Timor, there were signs of a growing backlash against foreign pressure. **********In one of several demonstrations in the last two days, protesters climbed a wall into the grounds of the Australian Embassy today, lowered the Australian flag, burned it and replaced it with an Indonesian flag. **********''The imposition of martial law has done nothing to improve the situation,'' said David Wimhurst, a United Nations spokesman. ''We are running out of supplies of food and water. When we tried to get to warehouses today we were attacked by heavy weapons, while the armed forces who were with us did nothing.'' **********Mr. Alatas said Indonesia would only accept an armed United Nations presence in East Timor after the Indonesian Parliament formally endorses the vote for independence at a session scheduled for November. **********His abrupt dismissal of mounting international demands drew widespread condemnation from abroad. **********Prime Minister Antonio Guterres of Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor, said, ''Asking to wait until November is absolutely crazy because it is obvious that in November there will be nothing left there to create a new country.'' **********In Auckland, a series of foreign ministers voiced their outrage as they arrived for the meeting of the economic council. **********''It's very important that what we need to do is to start to assemble, ourselves, the capability to provide security to East Timor and we need to make it clear to the Government of Indonesia that they need to accept such a force,'' said Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain. **********But with Indonesia rejecting a deployment of foreign troops, the options of foreign nations to try to halt the terror and killings were limited. **********''The Indonesians have made it perfectly clear that they would militarily resist that,'' Mr. Downer said. ''That would be a very, very difficult military conflict. That is, in a word, war.'' **********He conceded that it was extremely frustrating for foreign nations to have to sit back and watch the carnage continue. **********Relief agencies said up to 200,000 people had been forcibly evacuated from the territory of 800,000 people in a campaign that baffled many outside analysts. Some suggested that the campaign could have the extraordinary ambition of removing local East Timorese -- nearly 80 percent of whom voted for independence -- and replacing them with a new, pro-Indonesian population. **********Many of the evacuees were being trucked to neighboring West Timor, which is part of Indonesia, where they were being placed in guarded camps to which foreigners were denied access. Others were being put on inter-island ferries heading for remote parts of the Indonesian archipelago. **********''We know that tens of thousands of people have been forcibly removed from East Timor and we don't know what their fate is at all,'' said Mr. Wimhurst, the United Nations spokesman. **********A parallel campaign of killings and destruction appeared to be aimed at devastating the territory, perhaps as a lesson to other Indonesian provinces where there are separatist movements and perhaps in a gesture of spite toward foreign critics of the 24-year-long occupation. **********In the largely evacuated capital, Dili, witnesses said the tiny central business district had been destroyed along with public buildings and utilities including the telephone exchange.

The Government is trying to prove that the browser and operating system are two products, illegally bundled together mainly to stifle competition. **********But the Justice Department and 19 states suing the Microsoft Corporation face an uphill struggle to confirm that allegation. In a related case, a Federal appeals court ruled last June that Microsoft had virtually unlimited freedom to include anything it wanted in its products. The decision pointedly noted the ''undesirability of having courts oversee product design.'' **********In the current trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court is not necessarily bound by the appeals court ruling. But it does suggest that the Government must make some very convincing arguments to prevail. **********David Boies, the lead trial lawyer for the Justice Department, spent hours today trying to show that Microsoft's position on the issue was contradicted by the company's own internal documents and by common sense. Using other products as examples to illustrate his point, Mr. Boies insisted that it was possible to do what Microsoft says is nearly impossible -- draw a boundary line in software code, separating one product from another. **********Microsoft, Mr. Boies said, could do the same thing with its popular word-processing program, Word, as it did with its Internet Explorer browser. ''But the mere fact that two programs share some software code -- and a company can make it difficult to disentangle that code'' -- by no means proved that they were a single product, Mr. Boies said. **********Mr. Boies directed question after question at Microsoft's first witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, an economist who is the dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********The Justice Department lawyer noted that even Michael Dertouzos, the director of M.I.T.'s Computer Science Laboratory -- who was initially on Microsoft's witness list but was later dropped -- had testified in a deposition that he considered the browser an application program, separate from the operating system. **********Mr. Schmalensee held his ground, however, cautioning the court against immersing itself too deeply in software code. ''One thing this industry teaches is that the borders between products vary over time as technology advances,'' he said. **********At another point, he explained that he did not give ''any particular weight'' to the testimony from expert witnesses that the browser and operating system were separate products. ''Testimony as to the way things are,'' Mr. Schmalensee said, should not be binding in determining ''guidelines that are going to affect the evolution of this industry'' -- a nod to the expectation that whatever the verdict for Microsoft, the case will have a far-reaching effect on the nation's high-technology economy. **********The Government argues that Microsoft's decisions to bundle its browser with Windows and to place contract restrictions on personal computer makers add up to anticompetitive behavior. **********Pursuing that line, Mr. Boies asked Mr. Schmalensee if Microsoft had bundled its browser with Windows in part to increase the distribution of its browser. ''It certainly had that effect,'' the witness replied. **********Next, Mr. Boies asked if one purpose for the bundling was to make it more difficult for a Microsoft rival, the Netscape Communications Corporation, to distribute its browser. **********''Yes,'' Mr. Schmalensee replied, ''but that would have happened anyway.

And in determining whether business practices are legitimate competition or anticompetitive predation, Mr. Schmalensee emphasized that ''the touchstone has to be ultimate impact on consumers.'' **********The Government contends that Microsoft's practices effectively limited Netscape's access to mainstream channels of distribution where most people obtain their browsing software -- from computer makers who load it onto new PC's and from Internet service providers. **********''And that harms consumers because it deprives them of choice,'' Mr. Boies said today on the courthouse steps."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/04/business/fund-expenses-they-re-going-down-down-down-conventional-wisdom-belied-numbers.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Oppel", "pub_date": "1999-07-04", "snippet": "Mutual fund average expense ratios are falling, trend that flies in face of conventional wisdom that expenses have been flat, or rising; trend reflects investor shift to index and other low-cost funds and emergence of more low-cost competitors; so...", "word_count": 2261, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fund Expenses: They're Going Down, Down, Down; Conventional Wisdom Is Belied By the Numbers", "print_headline": "Fund Expenses: They're Going Down, Down, Down; Conventional Wisdom Is Belied By the Numbers", "body_text": " **********ASSETS were not the only things increasing at Fidelity Contrafund through the early 1990's. While the fund grew sixfold, its expense ratio also climbed. **********But after peaking at 1.06 percent in 1993, the ratio began to fall. Now, Contrafund charges investors 0.61 percent every year to manage their money, the lowest amount in more than a decade. **********Contrafund investors are not alone. The fees that the average mutual fund investor pays are going down. **********The trend flies in the face of conventional wisdom, which holds that expenses have been flat, or even rising. Indeed, the industry has come under heavy public criticism for its high fees, which long allowed fund companies' stocks to outpace their funds' returns. **********But the decline in fees is real. Kanon Bloch Carre, a mutual fund consulting firm in Boston, calculates that the average expense ratio paid by investors is down 16 percent over the last six years. **********There are several explanations: Many investors have shifted assets to low-cost funds -- a byproduct, to a large degree, of their embrace of index funds. Corporate executives who negotiate terms for their companies' 401(k) plans have increasingly favored funds with lower fees. And new, low-cost competitors have joined the market. **********Some industry analysts say fund companies will keep facing pressure to lower fees. After all, price competition is typical in maturing industries, as the battle for market share increases and growth slows. **********But don't pity the fund companies. They **********haven't lost their license to print money, with many fund companies seeing annual returns on equity that still top 25 percent. **********You may have heard that fees are on the rise. For example, Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, has reported that expenses on the average United States diversified stock fund rose last year to $1.44 for every $100 of assets, from $1.35 in 1993. **********But such comparisons treat a $10 billion fund the same as a $10 million fund, and thus do not measure the average investor's costs. With new funds being rolled out at the rate of almost 10 a week for much of this decade -- some of them low-cost funds but most of them small, often esoteric funds charging higher-than-average expenses -- it should not be a surprise that unweighted average expense ratios rose. **********By contrast, Kanon Bloch uses asset-weighting in its calculations, giving twice as much weight to a $100 million fund, for example, as to a $50 million one. On that basis, the average United States diversified stock fund now charges 77 cents in annual expenses for every $100 invested, down from 88 cents three years ago and 92 cents in 1993. Such stock funds constitute the lion's share -- 80 percent -- of stock mutual fund assets. **********The calculations include only the share classes with the most assets or longest records -- usually the class A shares. But William Dougherty, president of Kanon Bloch, said the expense ratio of other share classes, which make up less than 20 percent of domestic diversified stock fund assets, have also been falling. Moreover, the firm's calculations do not include sales charges, or loads, which have also been in decline. **********Mr. Dougherty acknowledged that Kanon Bloch's findings may seem surprising, but said the trend has been clear for years. He calculates that investors are saving $3.8 billion this year because of the decline in asset-weighted expense ratios. **********SKEPTICS might say the industry's fees look lower under asset-weighting because of the frugality of the Vanguard Group, the index fund king. Vanguard, as a mutual company owned by its customers, does not have to make a profit for public shareholders. The total asset-weighted expense ratio for Vanguard's domestic diversified stock funds declined by one-fifth during the last six years, to 28 cents for every $100 invested, according to Kanon Bloch. **********But it isn't just Vanguard. And it isn't just the Kanon Bloch figures. In a report this year, Scott Cooley, a Morningstar analyst, found that even excluding low-cost index funds and institutional shares, asset-weighted costs for investors have dropped by one-quarter since 1984 for load funds and by about 9 percent for no-load funds. He attributed much of the decline to investors' seeking out lower-cost fund families. **********In fact, asset-weighted expenses have fallen at the four biggest fund families -- Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, American Funds and Putnam Investments, which, combined, have 43 percent of the total United States diversified stock fund assets. That decline has come in part because swelling assets have touched off break-point clauses in fund management agreements that call for lower fees. Fidelity, for example,  charges a two-pronged management fee, one part of which declines as the company's total assets rise. That part of the fee was 0.2863 percent of assets in December 1998, down from 0.2942 percent the year before and 0.3243 percent at year-end 1993. The company has also given up a portion of its fees to some investors in recent years, because performance has not met targets. **********From May 1993 to May 1999, Fidelity's expense ratio for diversified stock funds fell by one-third, to 0.63 percent, while the ratio at the American Funds group declined 11 percent, to 0.61, according to Kanon Bloch. It even fell at the relatively pricey Putnam, to 0.95, a 15 percent drop over the period. **********Of course, whatever the fee cuts at some fund companies, they pale next to huge revenue gains, as assets under management in stock funds soared 44-fold, to $3.2 trillion, in the 15 years ended in May, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group. **********Noting such huge profits, critics say fees should have plunged, not just drifted downward. A Congressional subcommittee heard testimony last fall, and now the General Accounting Office is investigating the matter at the request of Representatives John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Michael G. Oxley, an Ohio Republican. If any legislation is proposed, it will most likely seek to improve disclosure of fees to investors, Congressional aides say. **********Mutual fund officials defend the industry's fees, noting that a study last year by the Investment Company Institute found that fund companies had, in fact, been passing along savings to fund shareholders. **********Regardless of what Congress does or does not do, the outlook for investors is good. Plenty of factors already at play suggest that investors will, on average, pay lower fees in the future. The factors include these: **********INDEXING -- Increasingly sought by investors, index funds accounted for an astonishing 43 percent of all new cash flows into stock funds so far this year, according to AMG Data Services, a mutual fund researcher. The expense ratios on funds that track the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index generally range from 0.18 to 0.40. **********The popularity of index funds is being tested, now that many actively managed funds are outperforming the S.& P. 500 over several months for the first time in a half-dozen years. But if history is any guide, the outperformance of the actively managed funds will eventually lapse. **********GROWING SOPHISTICATION -- Individual investors are becoming savvier about fees, especially as they notice commissions for on-line stock trades dropping sharply. **********In February, Mr. Cooley of Morningstar took the mutual fund industry to task for not passing along its huge economies of scale. He also noted that investors were increasingly factoring fees into their fund-buying decisions. **********''There is this misconception out there that all investors are stupid, that they chase performance and don't pay attention to fees,'' Mr. Cooley said. But, he added, ''we found that people were migrating toward lower-cost funds and lower-cost families.'' **********At Charles Schwab, the huge San Francisco-based discount broker, executives creating an in-house funds group a decade ago studied institutional money managers and observed that they emphasized low management fees more than the retail market did. Figuring that small investors would eventually follow suit, they decided to make index funds their primary offering. That bet proved prescient. **********''As investors have become more and more educated about the role of fees, we are beginning to see a trend of fees being more of a determinant in fund selection,'' said Bill Klipp, president of Charles Schwab Investment Management. **********COMPETITION -- More low-cost fund options are becoming available. Schwab's funds have become top sellers, posting the ninth-largest net sales of any fund group in the first five months of the year, according to the Financial Research Corporation, an investment researcher in Boston. **********Barclays Global Investors, meanwhile, the huge San Francisco-based institutional money manager that specializes in indexing, plans to sell about 50 index funds on the American Stock Exchange beginning next year. **********And TIAA-CREF, the low-cost fund and annuity provider that already dominates the retirement markets at colleges and universities, has gotten off to a strong start with a new line of very low-cost retail mutual funds that combine indexing with active management. The expenses on the funds range from 0.30 to 0.49 percent, according to Morningstar. **********Over all, however, there has been a slowdown in the number of new funds -- the kinds that seem to have skewed expense ratio tallies in the past -- as well as in the total net assets flowing into mutual funds. Only 11 new funds were rolled out in the first three months of 1999, about one-tenth the rate of the last three years, according to Cerulli Associates, a financial-services consulting firm in Boston. **********401(K) MUSCLE -- The shift to low-cost funds has been particularly pronounced among the executives and consultants who select investments for 401(k)'s and other employer-sponsored retirement plans. Analysts estimate that these plans contribute about one-third of the new cash flowing into mutual funds. **********In years past, analysts say, expenses played less of a role in the selection of funds for 401(k)'s by corporations. But that is changing. ''I would say fees to participants have moved up'' in importance, said Steve Butler, president of Pension Dynamics, a pension consulting firm in Lafayette, Calif. ''In smaller companies where owners and key managers have a major proportion of the assets, I would say costs are the No. 1 factor.'' **********CONSOLIDATION -- If analysts are correct and the fund industry is maturing, consolidation of fund companies could also play a role in allowing them to reduce costs, if they care to. After all, the trend lets them spread a greater amount of assets over a similar base of fixed costs. **********But more important for building economies of scale has been the high number of mergers involving funds themselves. Hundreds of funds combine every year. While that should raise a red flag to investors -- fund companies can merge a poor performer with a good one and then use the better fund's track record for marketing purposes -- it also makes it easier to lower expenses. **********And the merger trend is expected to continue. ''I suspect you'll see more of that,'' said Mark L. Constant, a fund industry analyst with Merrill Lynch in San Francisco. **********THE MARKETS -- Many analysts think that stock market returns will revert to their historical averages. And when that happens, investors are certain to pay more attention to fees. Over the last decade, the S.& P. 500 has risen an average of almost 20 percent a year. That compares with its post-1926 average of about 11 percent a year. Given that almost anyone in a diversified stock fund has made a lot of money in recent years regardless of the fees he paid, it is surprising that investors have paid any attention to costs. **********But ''there's going to be a growing cost awareness if the rates of return available in the marketplace turn out to be a lot lower in the next decade,'' said James F. Rothenberg, president of Capital Research and Management, the Los Angeles investment-advisory firm for the American Funds group. ''Then I think people will start to focus a lot more on what are the elements of their results, including what are the costs.'' **********Funds with higher expense ratios will, of course, take a much bigger slice of an investor's profits when returns are lower: losing 1.5 percent of your return to expenses is easy to shrug off when your fund returns 25 percent a year, but not when it returns 7 or 8 percent. **********And the cost of fees is compounded over time, even if all other factors remain equal. **********Consider the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which has had annual expenses of about 20 cents for every $100 in assets invested over the last decade. Had you invested $10,000 each year, beginning at the start of 1989, you would have had almost $332,000 after 10 years. **********But if you took the same fund and replaced Vanguard's low expenses with the average expense ratio of United States diversified stock funds, which was 1.44 percent last year, you would be left with about $311,000, or a difference of $21,000, according to Pension Dynamics. **********Despite the asset-weighted numbers, some industry officials, even those who proselytize for lower fees, scoff at the idea that the industry has been broken of greedy habits. **********John C. Bogle, Vanguard's founder, bluntly describes the industry's attitude this way: ''Croupier, croupier, croupier, where is thy rake?'' **********And John H.

Yet he has not attended a match in person for eight years, disgusted with the concrete slab seating and the irate fans who lob urine-filled plastic cups and brawl with supporters of rival clubs. **********''I tired of getting urine tossed on my back,'' said Mr. Faloppa, a 39-year-old executive at a magazine publisher. Now he watches soccer only on television. **********Years of mismanagement and neglect have left Brazilian soccer in disarray, with only diehard fans, mostly young males, mustering courage to attend matches live. The situation is not much better for players, who are subject to a punishing schedule of games, bound by an archaic system limiting their ability to negotiate lucrative contracts and often threatened with violence on and off the field. **********Even so, foreign and Brazilian investment firms increasingly see opportunities to transform Brazilian soccer into a moneymaker. For example, Nationsbank -- now Bank of America -- purchased the licensing rights of the Vasco da Gama club of Rio de Janeiro. And in the most widely publicized transaction, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., the Dallas-based buyout firm with investments throughout Latin America, announced a deal in April giving it the marketing and licensing rights for Corinthians, Sao Paulo's largest team. **********''Soccer in Brazil is like baseball, basketball and football put together,'' said Charles Tate, the firm's president. The transaction gives Hicks, Muse all licensing rights of the club's name, enabling it to sell items like caps or T-shirts emblazoned with the Corinthians insignia as well as the opportunity to negotiate deals for the TV broadcast of games. Hicks, Muse has already entered into pay-TV ventures in Brazil and in neighboring Argentina that could facilitate such deals. **********Mr. Tate said Hicks, Muse would use its knowledge from experiences in the United States, where it has interests in sports ranging from professional baseball and hockey to rodeo. **********The entrance of American companies like Hicks, Muse into Brazilian soccer is the latest chapter of a wide-reaching transformation that began largely with efforts by the most famous soccer player in Brazil, Edson Arantes do Nascimento, better known as Pele. After retiring from the game, Pele was named Minister of Sports in 1994 by the newly elected President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. He strongly encouraged clubs to treat players, many of whom came from poor backgrounds, with greater respect. He also sought to limit corruption in clubs by spurring them to make the leap from nonprofit organizations into for-profit companies. **********Pele, now 58, convinced Congress last year to approve legislation that requires greater transparency of club finances and better accounting procedures. This change has paved the way for potential investors to consider deals with some of Brazil's larger teams. Another part of the legislation, known as the Pele Law,  phases out an antiquated system in which players had little freedom to negotiate contracts. **********''The Pele Law laid the groundwork that investors needed to start taking Brazilian football seriously,'' said John Michael Streithorst, the director of new business ventures at Banco Icatu, an investment bank based in Rio de Janeiro, which had negotiated with Corinthians before the club's deal with Hicks, Muse. **********Mr. Streithorst likens the situation in Brazil to that in England in the 1980's, an era when English soccer was widely known for the violent clashes among rival fans. With the entry of private investors into the sport, however, and with lucrative pay-TV licensing contracts, soccer's image improved, and a broader array of fans began to attend games. **********Another domestic authority on the Brazilian soccer business, the talk show host and newspaper columnist Juca Kfouri, has estimated that it may be possible for sports to generate 4 percent of Brazil's gross domestic product in a few years, up from 1.5 percent today. ''Thank God capitalism is winning out against the feudal attitudes that have prevailed in this sport for too long,'' Mr. Kfouri said. ''With the talent produced here, Brazil could have the N.B.A. of world soccer.'' **********That potential, combined with the transformation of soccer in recent years in Europe, where some clubs have gone so far as to sell stock to the public, has not limited investors only to contracts with individual clubs. For instance, the Globo media group and several Rio de Janeiro investment banks have invested $30 million in Lance!, a daily sports newspaper founded in 1997 along the lines of France's L'Equipe and Italy's Gazzetta dello Sport. Although Lance! publishes some articles about other sports, including auto racing and volleyball, soccer dominates. And the newspaper unabashedly supports efforts to improve team management. **********''Having more private capital in clubs should act like a benevolent virus, in which the good cells expel the bad cells,'' said Walter de Mattos, the newspaper's publisher. **********One large problem facing those hoping to transform Brazilian soccer is the way games are scheduled. In Brazil, a club can play up to 90 games a year, compared with 60 or 70 in Europe. Players often complain of the effects of the grueling schedule. And there is an array of championships and other tournaments, making schedules confusing. **********Regardless, soccer as a business is expanding even outside the two largest cities, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. In the northeastern state of Bahia, Opportunity, an investment group, formed a venture with the state's largest club. Even Pele is considering similar deals. He has left his post as Minister of Sports and now dedicates part of his time to  Pele Sports and Marketing, which is searching for possible ventures."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/28/technology/news-watch-bad-news-for-e-mail-addicts-it-s-play-by-mail-scrabble.html": {"writer_name": "Matt Richtel", "pub_date": "1999-01-28", "snippet": "Hasbro Interactive to market Scrabble and other games newly made playable via E-mail; games will include virtual game boards that appear as attachment; photo (M)", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bad News for E-Mail Addicts: It's Play-by-Mail Scrabble", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Bad News for E-Mail Addicts: It's Play-by-Mail Scrabble", "body_text": " **********Until the world's dictionaries formally embrace ''E-mail,'' it may not be appropriate to use on a Scrabble board.

Bonds were little changed, reflecting conflicting effects from the data, and the dollar, despite its gains against the yen, fell against the euro. The single European currency rose to $1.0415 from $1.0298 **********As long as the U.S. economy was growing at a 4 percent annual rate and much of the rest of the world was expanding at less than half of that, there was sufficient overseas demand for American stocks and bonds to balance out the trade deficit, Ms. Mills said. **********In effect, Americans were the buyer of last resort for other countries' exports. Investors around the world were willing to finance those purchases by sending money to the United States to be put to work in the financial markets there. But now there are signs of growth resuming in Europe and of a bottoming to Japan's long decline, causing a reassessment of the situation, Ms. Mills said. **********The growing trade deficit is also a political problem for Washington, though the data released Tuesday did not exacerbate the situation, according to Harvinder Kalirai, senior economist at IDEAglobal.com, an economics consultancy. **********Industries that feel they face unfair competition from foreign companies selling goods below the cost of production have put pressure on the government to protect them, and President Bill Clinton recently has moved to restrict imports of steel from Brazil and lamb from Australia and New Zealand in response to complaints from U.S.unions and farmers that their livelihoods were threatened. **********Although Japan's trade surplus with the United States has been a contentious issue, it did not figure in the surprisingly bad trade statistics from the Commerce Department on Tuesday. The U.S.-Japan imbalance actually narrowed in May, to $5.26 billion from $5.64 billion in April **********Analysts also said the New York Fed's sales of yen for dollars did not indicate that the U.S. government approved of the intervention. The Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, has suggested that Tokyo needs to pursue policies to encourage growth in its domestic economy rather than seek to spur exports by limiting the value of the yen. Mr. Summers said Tuesday that U.S. policy, which has favored a strong dollar, was \"unchanged.\" **********The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported last week that the Fed had turned down a Bank of Japan request to intervene against the yen early in July, urging Tokyo instead to concentrate on its domestic economy. But analysts in New York said Tuesday that the Fed would not normally refuse such a request. **********\"There are dangers to premature yen strength, and the United States recognizes those,\" said Allison Montgomery, a currency analyst at IDEAglobal.com. Japanese investors, she said, have been buying euro-denominated bonds in recent months, and there is speculation that they have not entirely hedged those positions against currency fluctuations. Although the intervention Tuesday was against the dollar, it puts upward pressure on the yen against other currencies as well. **********Ms. Montgomery was among those analysts who did not read any significance into the Fed's agreement to intervene against the yen, but she did say there were subtle messages contained in the action. For example, the Bank of Japan chose to intervene in the U.S. market during American trading hours. It has been selling yen for several weeks, mostly in Japan with some intervention in Europe.

The bottlers, to be renamed the American Bottling Company, were expected to consolidate the fragmented independent bottler network on which Cadbury heavily depended to get its products into stores. **********But American Bottling is running into problems, in part because of Cadbury's ownership of a 40 percent stake in a joint venture with the Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm. Cost-cutting, a byword in the Cadbury corner office, resulted in the closing of five of the company's nine factories in the spring. **********Now, in what is normally the peak selling season for soft drinks, the bottler has been unable to meet demand. In fact, some of its orders have been subcontracted out to other independent bottlers, a spokeswoman, Christina Meyers, said. **********And as for driving additional consolidation, there has been almost none. One small bottler was acquired and a few territories were added, but American Bottling shows no signs of soon becoming a behemoth like Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler, or the Pepsi Bottling Group, which Pepsico spun off earlier this year. **********The slow pace of consolidation, combined with Cadbury's sale of its brands in most overseas markets to Coca-Cola as part of a strategy that favors expanding Cadbury's confectionery operations, is fanning the theory that Cadbury will leave the United States soft-drink business before long. One analyst, Bill Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein, says that in the next two years, Cadbury will sell either its concentrate company, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, or the entire concentrate-and-bottler package -- a move that Cadbury's chief executive, John M. Sunderland, has repeatedly denied is part of his strategy, although some inside Dr Pepper/Seven-Up think the opposite. Mr. Sunderland is holding meetings today in New York with Wall Street analysts at a time when Cadbury's American depository receipts, which closed yesterday at $25.375, are barely $1 above their 52-week low. **********''When you look at the way the endgame is closer to being played out in the U.S. in soft drinks than in the confectionery business abroad, they are better off going into the confectionery business,'' Mr. Pecoriello said. ''We don't envision Dr Pepper being acquired by Coke or Pepsi. The bottling company could be combined with the concentrate company, or you could have two separate companies.'' **********That move cannot happen now, he added, because problems at Seven-Up -- where volume has declined 3 percent despite increased advertising and other marketing efforts -- still need to be corrected. Then there are the difficulties at American Bottling, which ''aren't helping,'' Mr. Pecoriello said. **********He also says that profit goals set by Cadbury executives in London will erode the American beverage business in the long run. ''Cadbury wants 10 percent earnings growth, but proper investment in the U.S. soft-drink business would only allow 7 percent to 8 percent earnings growth,'' he wrote in a report issued on Monday. ''In the short run, a concentrate company can cut back on media or limit marketing support for its bottlers and deliver attractive profit growth,'' as in the 9 percent profit surge Cadbury reported for the first half of this year. ''In the longer term, this strategy will starve the bottler network and result in a death spiral for the non-Dr Pepper brands.'' **********Mr. Sunderland, reached in New York, dismissed the report as ''the most flawed piece of analysis it has ever been my misfortune to read,'' calling it ''riddled with what I would call illogical deductions.'' He said the problems at American Bottling were almost resolved, and added, ''There is absolutely no intention on our part to exit the business in the U.S.'' **********Many industry experts say that American Bottling is trying to acquire the highly successful Dr Pepper and 7-Up bottling business in Dallas run by Jim Turner, who would then take over the management of American Bottling. The move would parallel one made in 1991, when the struggling Coca-Cola Enterprises bought the bottling company run by Summerfield Johnston Jr., whose management team took control of Coca-Cola Enterprises and is credited for turning it around. **********''Turner would be a huge positive,'' said Michael Bellas, chief executive of Beverage Marketing, an industry consulting company and data base. ''Once you get someone like that in place, it makes a big difference.'' Mr. Sunderland said he could not comment on the status of talks with Mr. Turner, but added: ''We have not reopened talks with him on management control. It's all nonsense.'' **********Mr. Turner could not be reached for comment yesterday. But earlier this year, he predicted that Cadbury would sell its United States soft-drink business. He made the statement a few weeks after Cadbury announced in December that it would sell most of its overseas brands to Coca-Cola for $1.85 billion, noting that Cadbury's willingness to do that ''opens up a lot of questions in terms of Cadbury's long-term plans in the United States.'' **********The deal has since been trimmed back, after opposition from European regulators, to exclude most European Union countries. But it is still running into roadblocks: Mexico and Australia, two of Cadbury's largest markets, have rejected it, although Coca-Cola and Cadbury say they hope they will be able to revise the deal there and win approval for it. **********The current deal is worth $1.1 billion to Cadbury, and about $705 million of that was closed last Friday. The brands are not expected to add anything to Coke's earnings for at least a year; about 60 percent of the volume, estimated at 300 million cases, will be handled by Pepsi bottlers under existing agreements, which Coke agreed to honor until they expire. **********The deal, while it puts cash into Cadbury's pockets, also leaves the company with a knottier business plan than was envisioned when the original deal was announced.

Dropping to his knees, he extended a plump green apple to a miserable little boy who hugged the cane of his elderly grandfather. **********''Please,'' Mr. Pazner said today, during an Israeli relief mission. ''Please, take this little bit of kindness.'' **********Mr. Pazner, a worldly Israeli in a dapper business suit, stared into the old man's eyes and lost his bearings a little. A Holocaust survivor, Mr. Pazner said he felt dizzied by the echo of his own history in the plight of the man, Haser Shala, an ethnic Albanian refugee wearing muddy shoes with no laces. **********''I feel like I'm going back in time,'' Mr. Pazner said. ''I feel so close to these people. I don't speak their language, and they are Muslim. But I have the impression I visit my people here. I think all the time about these people as Jews.'' **********Israelis and Palestinians alike have been mesmerized by the images of the ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo trekking across borders, stripped of their belongings, their homes and the documents that confirm their identity. **********Glued to television news accounts, the Israelis and Palestinians have watched with bounding empathy what both groups, in different ways, see as a late 20th-century replay of their own horrors -- for the Israelis the Holocaust and for the Palestinians the flight into exile in 1948, when the Jewish country was founded. **********Even if their governments have not been as quick as they would like to condemn the Serbs and spring into action, many Palestinians and Israelis have felt personally compelled to help. The Israelis are setting up a field hospital in Macedonia, while the Jewish Agency, a nonprofit group, flew in the first of what will be three planeloads of relief supplies to Albania this week. **********And the Palestinians, who are usually the recipients of aid, began planning a relief lift of their own. **********For some, emotional reactions are overshadowed by complicated political realities. Some Israelis believe, for instance, that they should remain loyal to the Serbs, who defended Jews during World War II. But for many the identification with Kosovo refugees is so undeniable that it is painful, like a bitter reminder that the lessons of history are not always learned. **********''When I see the people in Kosovo fleeing, I can only hope that their destiny will not be like our destiny and that they will not live in refugee camps for 50 years,'' Samir Abughazaleh, a Palestinian accountant in Jerusalem, said on Monday. **********Salai Meridor, the acting chairman of the Jewish Agency in Israel, said the sight of trains loaded with ethnic Albanian refugees was so chillingly evocative of the Holocaust that he felt compelled last week to organize a relief effort. **********In several days the agency raised $375,000 in donations, set up a radio telethon and a rock concert fund-raiser to be held on Thursday and, with the help of the United Jewish Appeal in the United States, organized the relief planes. **********At 5 A.M. today Mr. Meridor stood between cartons of blankets, tents and baby formula buckled like passengers into a charter flight from Tel Aviv. ''I feel proud,'' he said. **********When the small Israeli plane landed in Albania, though, it was immediately shown up by a Saudi Arabian jumbo jet filled with blankets and carpets. The Israelis were made to feel the measure of their small country's effort, which they quickly pointed out could never compare in size but was a genuine and heartfelt grass-roots effort. **********''We come in the name of the Jewish people,'' Mr. Meridor told the Albanian Foreign Minister, Paskal Milo, who relayed horror stories that the refugees were telling, like those of children forced to watch the beheading of their parents. **********The Israelis left Mr. Milo's office feeling another connection, this one to the Albanians, who they said were a scattered people, just like the Jews, with most of the population living in a diaspora. **********While their donations traveled to a warehouse to be sorted for distribution, the Israelis drove empty-handed to the tent city by the cracked, weed-infested swimming pool in downtown Tirana. **********Again, what they saw first was jarringly familiar: refugees poring over posted lists of the camp's refugees, running their fingers down the inky pages, searching for the names of relatives from whom they had been separated. **********''We had this in Israel after the Holocaust for years,'' said Mr. Pazner, a former Israeli diplomat in France and Italy and a member of the aid delegation. ''Lists on walls, lists in newspapers, lists on the radio.'' **********Mr. Pazner is a native of Danzig, a target of Hitler's aggression that later became Gdansk, Poland. When he approached Mr. Shala, he found that the elderly man had been a German prisoner of war during World War II. They chatted in German, the Jewish man in a natty business suit, the Muslim refugee in a tattered pinstriped one, confessing that he felt old, ''kaput.'' **********Mr. Shala and his family fled their village of Zoqishti at the gunpoint of masked Serbian policemen who told them to go to Albania, or America, or NATO, they said. They wore a dazed, exhausted look, squatting on the concrete outside their tent in a refugee camp that was surreally erected beside a small amusement park. **********Told that their visitors were Israelis, Mr. Shala's niece smiled faintly. ''That's nice,'' she said. ''They know what it's like.'' **********In Israel, Shlomo Arad, a photographer who lost his parents in the Holocaust, said on Monday that he felt obliged to follow the Kosovo crisis. ''How well we know the feeling of leaving everything behind and in five minutes you're nobody,'' he said. ''Nothing we can do is enough: a field hospital with 50 soldiers, a donation into a bank account. But we must be witnesses. We must not turn away, like most of the world did in World War II.'' **********For some right-wing Israelis the matter is not so simple. Many identify with the Serbs, respect what they see as their right to Kosovo -- ''their Jerusalem'' -- and resent what they see as pro-Muslim world news media. **********''We will be alert and attentive to what is happening in Kosovo, as it may be a general rehearsal for what could happen here if we don't give the Palestinian terrorists a state with Jerusalem as its capital,'' said Elyakim Haetzni, a lawyer, in an opinion piece last week for Channel 7, the radio station of the Jewish settler movement. **********And, with a different lens, the Palestinians are watching closely too. ''Unfortunately when we faced our tragic situation in 1948, nobody was paying attention to us,'' Mr. Abughazaleh said. ''But now the whole world is following these events. So we hope that NATO will be able to let these people return back to their homes and properties.'' **********In Tirana, Mr. Shala's family expressed that wish too. And his grandson, with tears streaming down his face, took a timid bite of the green apple that an Israeli well-wisher had left behind."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/business/international-briefs-sanwa-bank-to-raise-stake-in-toyo-trust.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-02-13", "snippet": "Sanwa Bank will raise stake in Toyo Trust and Banking Company by $870 million (S)", "word_count": 120, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sanwa Bank to Raise Stake in Toyo Trust", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Sanwa Bank to Raise Stake in Toyo Trust", "body_text": " **********Sanwa Bank Ltd., Japan's fifth-biggest bank, will raise its stake in the Toyo Trust and Banking Company by 100 billion yen ($870 million), making Sanwa the largest shareholder in the trust bank. **********Toyo Trust has asked Sanwa to buy 80 billion yen in preferred shares and 20 billion yen in common stock, though the trust bank must obtain shareholder approval before it issues more stock.

A former Justice Minister, out of office for two years, is arrested on charges of fraud and embezzlement. **********Then the police confirmed tonight that they had found evidence of illegal wiretapping during a citywide raid of offices and apartments linked to Boris A. Berezovsky, Russia's best-known businessman and ace political intriguer. He is also the most public target of what seems to be Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov's opening shot in a crackdown against economic crime and corruption. **********Mr. Primakov sent out a warning signal last week when he said an amnesty of 94,000 prisoners would free the cells needed to house an incoming wave of corrupt officials and business executives. **********But as Mr. Berezovsky noted in response, economic crimes can easily be twisted to political purpose. Mr. Berezovsky, who has openly boasted about his role in making and breaking successive Russian political fortunes, has already seen the Primakov Government methodically chip away at his power base, starting with an attempt to push him out of Russia's largest television station, now virtually bankrupt. **********No sooner did he call on Mr. Primakov to cool his threats than armed federal agents in black ski masks this week swooped through the offices of Sibneft, an oil company controlled by Mr. Berezovsky, and Atoll, a Berezovsky-controlled security concern. Atoll has been accused of serving as Mr. Berezovsky's private intelligence agency, secretly spying on top Russian officials and even members of President Boris N. Yeltsin's family. **********The raids, widely seen as the final blow to Mr. Berezovsky's influence,  took place Tuesday, the day that Mr. Yeltsin accepted the resignation of Chief Prosecutor Yuri Skuratov. It was also the day that Mr. Yeltsin, still convalescing from a bleeding ulcer, unexpectedly made a brief appearance in the Kremlin, his first this year, where in keeping with past practice he promptly dismissed four of his aides. **********If, as some believe, the events are linked, then they suggest that Russia is undergoing another bout of old-style political intrigue, which as a  Soviet expert once said, is as difficult to decipher as a wrestling match under a rug. **********''To outside observers, all this smells of deep medieval political barbarity, thickly mixed with an uncivilized reckoning of accounts between opponents,'' said a political commentator for Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a newspaper with close ties to Mr. Berezovsky. **********In private conversations, Kremlin aides acknowledge that there was more to Mr. Skuratov's abrupt exit than a bad heart, the ailment with which he was admitted to the Kremlin hospital on Monday night. They said Mr. Yeltsin's displeasure had been a long time building, first over the failure of Mr. Skuratov to bring Russia's most publicized crimes to trial, and, more recently, over his failure to move against Russia's outspoken neo-fascist and anti-Semitic politicians. **********''It was not a sudden phenomenon,'' one Kremlin aide said. ''It was a sum of all the cases, several of them important, that were not solved.'' The prosecutor's foot-dragging in bringing a case against Albert Makashov, a Communist lawmaker who last October called for Jews to be driven from Russia, was linked to the resurgence last weekend of a small splinter neo-fascist group on the streets of Moscow. **********Although Mr. Skuratov has not solved any of Russia's more notorious murders, he did recently begin  well-publicized investigations into the former leadership at Russia's Central Bank and into some of Russia's biggest privatized companies, earning himself enemies among liberal reformers and friends among Russia's Communists. **********But the most prevalent theories about his resignation seem to revolve around Mr. Berezovsky, whose political influence stems in large part from the fact -- or the illusion --  that he has close ties to Mr. Yeltsin's family, in particular Tatiana Dyachenko, the President's daughter. **********According to one version, Mr. Skuratov, fearing the influence of Mr. Berezovsky, had dawdled over the investigation into his wire-tapping operations, even after they were reported in a newspaper. According to another, contradictory version, his attempts to investigate Mr. Berezovsky alarmed Mr. Yeltsin, who has reasons to want to stop any leaks of evidence of his family's financial dealings that might be in Mr. Berezovsky's possession. **********But others believe that the real driving force behind Mr. Skuratov's ouster may have been Mr. Primakov, who after four months in office wants to make headway on his threats to crack down on corruption. **********As if to illustrate the Government's new vigor, the Interior Ministry announced tonight that it had arrested a former Justice Minister, Valentin Kovalyov, on charges of embezzlement, two years after he resigned from office under the cloud of a sex scandal. **********At an assembly of law enforcement officials that was to have been addressed today by Mr. Skuratov, the acting Prosecutor General, Yuri Chaika, said corruption among Russian bureaucrats had reached unprecedented levels, with Russia now ranked as the fifth-most corrupt country on earth."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/business/investing-ogden-s-new-tack-divide-and-conquer.html": {"writer_name": "Joanne Legomsky", "pub_date": "1999-04-25", "snippet": "Profile of Ogden Corp, New York-based conglomerate that has stumbled through much of 1990's with confusion collection of mediocre businesses, from stadium concession stands to contract manufacturing, and remains largely shunned by investors; photo...", "word_count": 841, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ogden's New Tack: Divide and Conquer", "print_headline": "INVESTING; Ogden's New Tack: Divide and Conquer", "body_text": " **********THE Ogden Corporation is paying the price for breaking the 11th commandment, analysts say. For years, they contend, Ogden neglected the imperative to maximize shareholder value, and though the company seems to have finally gotten religion, it remains largely shunned by investors. **********A New York-based conglomerate with $1.7 billion in worldwide sales, Ogden stumbled through much of the 1990's with a confusing collection of mediocre businesses -- from stadium concession stands to contract manufacturing -- and with sluggish profit growth. **********''They lost their credibility,'' said Peter S. Jacobs, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, a brokerage firm in Seattle. ''Earnings were in a rut, and the stock was going nowhere.'' Investors criticized R. Richard Ablon, the chief executive, and Ogden's board as not moving quickly to find new opportunities while growth slowed at the company's core business of waste-to-energy power plants. **********Quintin G. Marshall, an Ogden spokesman, attributed the company's poor stock performance to various regulatory changes in the waste-to-energy business that hurt that industry's growth prospects. Ogden's complexity obscured its promising business lines, he said. ''The underlying trends of growth may not have been readily apparent to the Street,'' Mr. Marshall said. **********Despite periods of outperformance, Ogden's shares have returned a paltry 2.7 percent a year since 1990, on average, through March 31, compared with 18.0 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. **********''They had to do something to spark interest again,'' Mr. Jacobs said. **********Not that Ogden, under Mr. Ablon, hadn't done some spade work. Since late 1995, it has sold off $1 billion of sundry operations. It emerged with three focused businesses, analysts say, each with a solid franchise. **********The biggest is its energy unit, with $804 million in sales, which develops, owns and operates 27 waste-to-energy plants as well as other power sites. Its operating earnings will grow 10 to 15 percent annually, according to analysts. The aviation services unit, with $310 million in sales, provides cargo handling and other services to airlines and airports; its earnings are expected to grow 15 to 20 percent a year. And the entertainment division, with $486 million in sales, owns and runs water parks among other things; its earnings are expected to grow 15 to 20 percent annually. **********Frustration with the company's share price prompted management to announce a plan on March 11 to split Ogden into two separate public companies. One would consist of the energy business and the other the entertainment and aviation services units, which have grown to a size that analysts believe will make for a viable public company. Ogden expects an initial offering of 15 percent to 20 percent of the entertainment and aviation services unit's shares this fall, with the remainder to be distributed as a tax-free dividend to shareholders by year-end. **********Ordinarily, investors hail such strategies for unlocking shareholder value. But in this case, Wall Street has yawned. Ogden shares seem locked in the pre-announcement trading range of $23 to $27 a share. **********Analysts say the stock, which closed Friday at $25.875, has been constrained by uncertainty about the new entities' capital structures, the status of the dividend -- now a bond-like 4.83 percent -- and the fact that the Internal Revenue Service has yet to approve the tax-free status of a spinoff. But Mr. Jacobs said the release of a definitive business plan, expected by July, ''should go a long way to boost interest in the stock.'' **********JAN LOEB, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella, said that the split-up signaled a shift in management philosophy, and that the stock was undervalued relative to Ogden's assets and earnings prospects. He values the post-split companies at $36 a share and expects earnings of $2.50 a share for 2000. **********David Wolfe, managing director with CIBC Oppenheimer, said the split-up would make it much easier for investors to get their hands around Ogden's true value. ''You have two businesses -- entertainment and aviation -- growing in excess of 20 percent a year,'' said Mr. Wolfe, ''but they're masked by the more mature energy unit,'' which generates about 60 percent of operating earnings. In 1996, aviation and entertainment contributed 24 percent to operating earnings. Next year, he expects those businesses to contribute 41 percent. **********Mr. Wolfe thinks his 12-month price target of $32, or 15.7 times projected 2000 earnings of $2.03 a share, could prove conservative. Still, that is a total return of 27.8  percent. Mr. Jacobs expects the stock to hit $34 in 12 to 18 months. **********Mark Foster, chief investment officer at Kirr, Marbach & Company, an asset management firm in Columbus, Ind., who has owned the stock for about two years, sees the split-up as a step in the right direction. ''There really isn't much downside risk,'' Mr. Foster said. **********Many analysts expect management to trim the dividend but they predict that yield will remain an important component of total return. **********Will Ogden be able to reinvent itself? ''As I see it, cash flow is strong, and the businesses are growing nicely,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''The shares trade at half the market multiple, so downside is limited, and upside is substantial. Meanwhile, I'm getting almost 5 percent to wait.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/30/world/fears-rise-for-chechen-refugees-as-winter-nears.html": {"writer_name": "Celestine Bohlen", "pub_date": "1999-10-30", "snippet": "International aid agencies in Chechnya express concern over fate of almost 200,000 refuges fleeing homes as winter nears, amid intensified attacks against Islamic insurgents by Russian forces; have additional concerns, notably kidnapping and viole...", "word_count": 1414, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fears Rise for Chechen Refugees as Winter Nears", "print_headline": "Fears Rise for Chechen Refugees as Winter Nears", "body_text": " **********An early autumn chill has already descended on the border regions around Chechnya, fast on the heels of fighting that has forced almost 200,000 Chechens to flee their homes as Russian troops bomb and strafe their breakaway republic. **********For Haji Zubarev and his extended family of 25 people, who fled the Chechen town of Sernovodsk two weeks ago, home is now an empty field here about a mile inside the Ingushetia side of the border. At night, when the temperatures drop, the men huddle for warmth on the back of an open truck, while the women gather in a beat-up van, bundling up their infants in layers of clothes. **********The creeping cold is a major worry of the few international aid agencies working to help refugees. Chechens have been fleeing their homes in droves since late September, when Moscow began its military campaign against guerrillas whom it blames for attacks in neighboring regions and for masterminding bombings in Russian cities. **********Most of the Chechen refugees have come to Ingushetia, and they have found lodging with the local population, in some cases paying exorbitant rents. About 15,000 are housed in railway carriages and tent cities set up by Russian authorities. But another 12,000 people are still sleeping in bus and rail stations, in sheds and warehouses or, like the Zubarev family, inside their vehicles. **********''Shelter and winter, these are very important and serious worries,'' said Viktor Andreyev, a Moscow-based policy adviser for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which has delivered $600,000 worth of food, tents and other assistance to refugees from Chechnya since the fighting began. **********The Russian Government, which initially was slow to react to the flow of refugees from Chechnya, resists calling it a crisis, or even asking foreign organizations for help. **********But international agencies have additional concerns in the North Caucasus and those are kidnapping and violence, which over the last several years, have driven nearly all foreign aid and human rights workers out of Chechnya and its surrounding regions, including Ingushetia. **********Soon after the 1994-96 war here, when Russian troops tried unsuccessfully to put down a secessionist movement in Chechnya, the region was swept with a wave of lawlessness, as Chechen warlords -- some of them former war heroes -- turned to  hostage-taking as a way to finance their operations. **********One of the most shocking cases of violence was the murder in December 1996 of six foreign hospital workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who were killed by armed assailants in their dormitory in the Chechen town of Novye Atagi. In January 1998, the director of the United Nations refugee agency's office for the North Caucasus, in northern Ossetia, was kidnapped and held hostage for 11 months. **********All told, Russian security officials say that more than 2,000 people -- including Chechens, Russians and foreigners -- have been taken hostage in and around Chechnya since 1996. **********''There was one case after another,'' said Mamar Melzouk, who heads the Moscow-based mission of Doctors Without Borders, the French organization that recently was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its work in war zones around the world. ''The humanitarian world became a target. It is obvious that the risk is very, very high.'' **********Doctors Without Borders maintained a large and visible mission in the region during the 1994-96 war, in which tens of thousands of civilians were killed. But in 1996, when the war ended with a victory for the Chechen rebels, the organization withdrew from the region, soon after two of its employees were kidnapped. **********So far in the current conflict, Doctors Without Borders has not returned. ''The security and access to beneficiaries are not assured and because of those criteria, we are not planning to intervene for the moment,'' said Mr. Melzouk. ''We know problems are arising, especially with the oncoming winter. But it is a very complicated issue.'' **********According to Ingush security forces, no kidnappings are known to have taken place in the region in the last two months, although a reporter for the newspaper Moscow News, who has been missing for two weeks, was last seen in Ingushetia. But local authorities concede that the situation is dangerous, and they provide armed guards to journalists and aid workers who come in for short trips to the border regions. **********''You can go for a few days but not longer, and it is better to go without warning,'' said Samuel Marie-Sanon, general coordinator for Doctors of the World, another French medical aid organization, who made his last trip to Ingushetia two weeks ago. ''You make the opportunities rare so as to limit the risks.'' **********[Doctors of the World, the last foreign aid agency to maintain a presence in the Chechen capital, Grozny, withdrew its Chechen staff  on Thursday.] **********According to Mr. Marie-Sanon, Chechen doctors -- left in charge when his group's French doctors left Grozny in 1998 -- continue to monitor the estimated 4,000 refugees living in camps inside Chechnya, where he said medicine is in critically short supply, especially for people suffering from chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease. **********The International Committee of the Red Cross, in cooperation with the Russian Red Cross, has brought in 60 tons of food as well as other aid supplies to the border region from its stockpiles in Nalchik. **********But the biggest burden has fallen on Ingushetia itself, a region with a population of about 300,000 which is still coping with refugees from the previous Chechen conflict, in addition to the 65,000 Ingush refugees who arrived here in the early 1990's from North Ossetia. **********''We have to feed an entire city,'' said the Ingush President, Ruslan Aushev, who has continually pressed the Russian Government to step up assistance for a ''catastrophe'' that Moscow refuses to recognize. ''I keep telling them, this is not my problem, it is your problem, one that you created, not me.'' **********[At a news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Mr. Aushev said that more than 10,000 refugees have received medical care, and 1,500 have been hospitalized, including 50 who were wounded in the fighting, the Interfax news agency reported.] **********According to Mr. Marie-Sanon, the cold weather has already compounded health problems among the refugees, with cases of respiratory diseases rising sharply among children and the elderly. He said the current fighting has also set off a rise in mental health problems, especially among children. ''We are seeing children who can't sleep, who have nightmares, and show aggressive behavior,'' he said. ''For them, the sight of an airplane can be a real trauma.'' **********For the Zubarev family, the latest war is merely a continuation of the first. When the Russian planes started attacking Sernovodsk, Mr. Zubarev, a 42-year-old chauffeur, drove his family into nearby Ingushetia, leaving them near the border so he could go back and forth to check on his house and livestock. **********When he went back the last time, he said, Russian troops had intensified their attacks. **********''I wouldn't be sorry if they were going after the guerrillas, but they are attacking the civilian population,'' he said. ''I don't know if there were any guerrillas in Sernovodsk, but if there were, they are gone now, and the only ones left are old people.'' **********As Mr. Zubarev talked to reporters, one of his relatives, a young woman with her black scarf tied around her hair, interrupted the conversation. ''For eight years now, we have been giving interviews,'' she said, her voice shifting to a shout. ''Talking isn't enough.

''We will provide you with medicine if you fall sick and cannot afford such care.'' **********But the transaction is not as straightforward as it sounds. Many Haitians who visit the clinic are at once patients and subjects of United States-financed medical research, and circumstances that are bad for their health are sometimes best for research results. **********That conflict is especially true in Cornell's most tantalizing research in Haiti, a study of sex partners, only one of whom is infected with the AIDS virus. Researchers, seeking clues to developing a vaccine, study the blood of both partners, particularly the uninfected ones who continue to be exposed to the virus through unprotected sex. They are trying to find out whether some people have natural protections against infection with the AIDS virus that could be replicated in a vaccine. **********The Haitians are ideal research subjects, largely because they are not receiving the kind of care now standard in the world's developed countries. Condom use is low in Haiti, for cultural and other reasons. Anti-retroviral drugs that are successful at suppressing the virus are unavailable except to the very wealthy, and are not included in Cornell's promise to provide medicine. **********Nearly 20 years after Cornell opened the clinic, it provides some of the best AIDS treatment available in a country devastated by the epidemic, fighting the myriad illnesses that result from AIDS. But that is a lower standard of care than patients receive routinely at American institutions, including the hospital affiliated with Cornell in New York City. **********If the research were done in the United States, experts agree, the physicians would be obligated to prescribe the anti-retrovirals and deliver the most effective possible counseling against unprotected sex. **********The ethical questions posed by Cornell's work among Haiti's poor are at the heart of a global debate about AIDS research that is roiling international health organizations from Geneva to Thailand, challenging ethics formulations established decades ago. **********''It's really like a Faustian bargain,'' said Marc Fleisher, a member of the committee at Cornell that reviews research on humans. ''It's like, since we're making this a better place, we're going to exploit it in a way we could never get away with in the United States,'' said Mr. Fleisher, the outside member on a board made up mostly of university employees who are doctors. **********Cornell doctors defended the couples study as vitally important and stressed that its subjects receive the same counseling about the dangers of AIDS and the same care as other patients at the Haitian clinic. **********United States standards for research on humans were strongly influenced by outrage over the Tuskegee syphilis study earlier this century, which misled impoverished black subjects for years while tracking their disease, and withheld treatment even after penicillin was discovered. **********Today's subjects are not to be pressured to participate in research, according to Federal regulations. They are to be fully informed about the research's purposes and risks. They must receive the best available therapy for their illnesses and be told about any findings relevant to their health. **********In theory, the same rules apply to federally financed studies overseas. But an examination of 15 years of records related to the Haiti couples research shows that it has received scant scrutiny from Government officials in Washington. **********And the Government's rules barely address the moral ambiguities of AIDS research in indigent countries. **********Should participants receive the best treatment available in the United States or in Haiti, one of the poorest countries on earth? How forcefully should researchers who are documenting the progress of the AIDS virus warn subjects about the dangers of rejecting condoms? **********Dr. Warren D. Johnson, the chief of international medicine and infectious diseases at Cornell, called the couples study ''a very high priority,'' though he said it had been temporarily suspended while the university concentrated on other research in Haiti. ''This is the critical group in the world -- couples -- that's where the war is to be fought,'' he said. **********At least 97 couples have been enrolled in the blood study since 1991, records show, but Dr. Johnson said only 30 couples are still being followed. The study will be expanded to new couples early next year, he said, and coordinated with AIDS vaccine trials, which are expected to start in Haiti this fall using similar couples as subjects. **********Cornell's clinic in Haiti offers strong inducements to subjects. It is the only center in the country providing free screening and treatment for H.I.V., venereal disease and tuberculosis, a common complication of AIDS. The thousands who flock to it are too poor to buy food, let alone the simple medicines and vitamins that serve as ''a powerful incentive for study participation,'' in the words of one Cornell grant report. **********The head of the clinic, Dr. Jean William Pape, is a Haiti native and Cornell professor who has studied AIDS in Haiti for two decades. Dr. Pape, who trained at Cornell, defended the treatment of research subjects in the couples study, saying they benefited from the same counseling and free condoms available to everyone who visits the clinic. **********Dr. Pape said that offering the life-saving drugs to the handful of research subjects would be an unethical lure to participate. Treating all H.I.V.-infected citizens, he said, would cost 10 times Haiti's health budget. **********If the research on couples succeeds, he said, it could help lead to a vaccine against AIDS. ''You have to take into account people who mean well for their country and not impose on them things that you feel are good for Western ideas,'' he said. **********The Research **********Tracking the Path Of an Epidemic **********Cornell's presence in Haiti dates from 1979, when Dr. Pape returned to his native land and took a job at a pediatric hospital where 40 percent of the babies were dying of endemic diarrhea. **********''A man would come to pick up the bodies three times a day, with a big bag,'' he recalled, bending his tall frame in a scooping gesture. ''The noise of the skulls in that bag was unbearable.'' **********Using the latest treatment, oral rehydration, Dr. Pape cut the death rate to 1 percent. But the next year his Haitian colleagues asked him to help fight an enemy that would prove far more formidable. **********Adults were mysteriously falling ill with persistent diarrhea, harbinger of a new, deadly disease. Suddenly, Dr. Pape and Cornell found themselves on the front lines in the fight against a global epidemic: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. **********Dr. Pape had the credentials to lead the effort. Part of an elite Haitian family long prominent in medicine, he had received an undergraduate degree from Columbia University and a medical education from Cornell. Supervised by Dr. Johnson, his Cornell mentor, Dr. Pape set up a local group to study the new disease and soon won Federal financing. In 1985, Cornell was awarded a major Federal grant to conduct a study, ''The Natural History of H.I.V. Infection in Haiti.'' A succession of these five-year grants eventually brought Cornell more than $7 million in research money and hundreds of thousands more in related training grants. **********The studies produced some important early findings. Researchers dispelled an early theory that Haitians were unusually vulnerable to the disease. They also helped show that AIDS could be transmitted through heterosexual contact. **********AIDS testing at the research clinic followed the United States model of the mid-1980's. Haitian patients with the virus, mostly heterosexual men, were offered condoms and counseling. It was left up to patients to inform their sexual partners, and at least 60 percent never did so, researchers said. **********The hope was to get Haitians to practice protected sex, but by the early 1990's it appeared this approach was not working. Dr. Pape said the data persuaded him that only a vaccine could stem Haiti's epidemic, then speeding from high-risk men to women whose only risk was an unfaithful partner. **********Looking closer at several hundred couples in which only one partner was infected, he found that AIDS was transmitted annually in about 7 percent of the couples having unprotected sex. That was about twice the rate of similar couples in the United States and Europe, but even so, it suggested an unexplained resistance to infection. **********The Haitians were valuable for another reason. Unlike AIDS patients in the United States and Europe, they were not receiving the anti-retroviral drugs that proved effective in halting the disease's progress. **********The lack of those drugs ''may allow identification of novel findings not easily studied in the U.S.A.,'' Dr. John L. Ho, a Cornell immunologist, wrote in an application for Federal funds. In 1995, the Federal Government awarded Cornell an extra $60,000 to expand this part of the Haitian couples study. **********Grant records show that by 1996, 5 of the 31 previously uninfected partners studied most closely by Cornell tested positive for the AIDS virus. But Cornell's blood tests found something to ponder: In two of the cases there was a substantial delay between transmission of the virus and actual infection -- 11 and 49 months. And among those who still tested negative, it seemed in several cases that a version of infection had occurred but that the virus had disappeared again, at least temporarily. **********Cornell researchers called these results, similar to findings by scientists elsewhere, ''tantalizing'' and ''intriguing.'' They hypothesized that certain levels of sexual exposure to H.I.V. might be triggering an infection that blocked transmission, aborted infection or at least weakened the effects of disease -- all clues to vaccine development. **********Research plans approved last year include further study of 19 high-risk Haitian partners who still test negative for H.I.V. but show intermittent signs of the virus in their blood samples. Cornell researchers estimated that over five years, at least 36 partners would contract the virus. One report to the National Institutes of Health anticipated that 15 to 20 H.I.V.-infected women from the study would become pregnant each year. Those children, Cornell officials wrote, could be subjects for another study examining the high mortality rate of H.I.V.-infected infants. **********The Subjects **********Offering Counseling Of Its Own Design **********Outside the gates of the research clinic at 33 Truman Boulevard, the dirt sidewalk is crammed with people by midmorning. Charcoal smoke, flies and sewage stench mix with cooking smells as vendors sell beans by the scoop to waiting patients. **********Thousands of men and women have made their way to the clinic over the years, many desperate for relief from sickness, others sent by lovers to be tested for venereal disease and the AIDS virus. **********All are potential research subjects. But the most interesting to science are patients like the couple identified in clinic records as No. 1986, a man with AIDS, and No. 1986C, his uninfected, pregnant wife. **********Ethical standards for Federally financed studies require that patients be told why researchers want to study them. But the written consent form approved at Cornell and read aloud in Creole to each potential subject does not mention that the study focuses on couples in which one sexual partner has tested positive for H.I.V. **********The form tells subjects their blood is being tested because ''you live in an area where AIDS may be common.'' It promises all patients that H.I.V. test results will be kept confidential. **********Dr. Pape said that in the case of the couples study, the clinic makes a practice of disclosing results of AIDS tests to the uninfected partners. He said they are informed orally by a doctor at the clinic that their spouse or lover has H.I.V. **********Research subjects, Dr. Pape said, are given the same counseling about the dangers of AIDS as other patients. The clinic offers free condoms, and videos about protected sex are shown in the crowded waiting room. **********Those who contracted the virus while being studied by Cornell ''have no one to blame but themselves, because they were provided with everything,'' he said. **********Researchers in Europe, the United States and Africa said consent forms and research outlines in comparable studies typically spell out detailed procedures for informing partners and dealing with the clashes that might arise. A joint consent form used as early as 1988 in Zambia, for example, specifies: ''One of you is infected with the virus and the other is not,'' adding, ''It is possible that during the study, the partner who was uninfected will become infected with the AIDS virus. This is distressing and can cause depression, anger and marital problems.'' **********A review of Cornell's materials found no written procedures for disclosing a partner's infection, or for forcefully counseling partners as a couple about the dangers of their situation. Dr. Pape said study subjects choose to reject condoms even though they are fully informed of the risks. To demonstrate, he provided a one-page questionnaire dated Dec. 3, 1992. It belonged to patient No. 1986C, then three months pregnant. **********''Are you still sexually active with your partner?'' it begins. The only record of the woman's replies are a clinic worker's check marks and scribbled notations. Yes, said the woman, she planned to continue having sex with her husband. No, they were not using condoms. No, she did not want a free supply. The reason was scrawled in English: ''He does not like it and she's afraid of condom.'' **********The document, administered at three-month intervals to subjects gathered from their shantytowns by social workers paid by the United States, did not contain the word AIDS or H.I.V. It asked, ''When have you been aware of the infection of your sex partner?'' The answering notation: ''At entry into the study.'' **********After reviewing clinic materials, Marie Saint Cyr, a native of Haiti who now directs an AIDS program for women in Harlem, said there was a ''clear conflict of interest'' between the desire to collect information from research subjects and the obligation to effectively warn patients at risk. **********''If you know somebody is positive and is having sex with a partner who is negative, you have a life and death situation in front of you,'' she said. ''You have to do individualized counseling to really tap into what those people value in life, to confront them with the reality of H.I.V. and AIDS. This in no way addresses those serious things.'' **********The World Debate **********Balancing Sickness And Science **********When Cornell researchers came to Haiti to collect blood, they stayed high above the swarming slums of Port-au-Prince, at a colonial, gingerbread-style hotel called the Kinam, where purple bougainvillea spills over a sunlit swimming pool. **********At a conference at the hotel in April 1998, the president of the National AIDS Council of France challenged Dr. Pape to rethink the way the disease is treated in Haiti, particularly in patients who are research subjects. **********The French official, Dr. Alain Sobel, said the French Government could provide anti-retroviral drugs to Haiti, as it does already for nearby French islands like Martinique and Guadeloupe. **********Dr. Pape, according to both men, replied that the multiple drug cocktail that had been so effective in treating the disease in developed countries could not be feasibly used in Haiti. The country's health care system, he insisted, was not organized enough to properly distribute the drugs or make sure that patients too poor to eat regularly take a pill before or after certain meals, as the demanding regimen requires. **********Dr. Sobel did not disagree. But he argued that Dr. Pape's clinic, with thousands of patients enrolled in various long-term studies, was the obvious place to make a start. **********''They are really the only institution that can do this in Haiti,'' Dr. Sobel said later in a telephone interview from Paris. He said that since Cornell's patients are participating in research, ''they deserve to be treated.'' **********Dr. Pape disagreed. Asked about this argument in an interview, he said offering such treatment to clinic patients would be ''an inducement to become infected.'' He questioned how long a foreign government's commitment to provide such expensive drugs --  about $15,000 yearly per person -- would endure in an economic or political downturn. **********The clash between Dr. Pape and Dr. Sobel reflects a larger international debate over clinical trials in third world nations, which has intensified in the era of AIDS. **********In 1997, The New England Journal of Medicine sharply criticized research in Thailand and Africa that gave placebos to pregnant women infected with H.I.V. as part of a search for a cheaper way to stop transmission of the virus to newborns. **********The placebo trials were halted in February 1998, when one of the studies in Thailand showed that transmission could be prevented with a short course of the drug AZT costing as little as $50. **********The finding came at a price. Pregnant women pass on AIDS to their children in about 35 percent of cases, and in the studies, half the women were given dummy pills, the others given much less AZT than in the proven regimen used in the developed world. **********Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor of The New England Journal, had likened the trials to the Tuskegee study of syphilis, in which public health officials withheld effective treatment from a cadre of black men for 40 years. **********Many research scientists defended the placebo trials as a shortcut to giving poor nations a new weapon against AIDS. **********More recently, world health officials have clashed over how to test AIDS vaccines whose effectiveness is best assessed with subjects exposed to the disease and not treated with anti-retrovirals because of poverty. **********''If in Malawi, why not Appalachia?'' asked Dr. David Rothman, a professor of social medicine at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. ''You have serious investigators trying to do good, trying to save hundreds of thousands of lives, but I consider it ultimately destructive of the investigator's integrity and the well-being of all of us to have an ethic of human experimentation that changes as it travels.'' **********Dr. Pape said decisions about treating third world patients can be unusually complicated. For example, he was critical of a proposal by a United Nations group to give pregnant women at the Haitian State Hospital AZT last year. **********That proposal, he said, did not address the problem of H.I.V. transmission through breast-feeding. The danger, he said, is that infected Haitian women who are told of the risks to their children will not nurse their infants. In a country where safe formula is a relative rarity, he said, this could put children at an even greater risk of death. **********''The ethical issues sometimes are torturing me,'' he said. **********Dr. Sobel attributed Dr. Pape's lack of enthusiasm for anti-retrovirals at least in part to his commitment to developing an H.I.V. vaccine. In 1998, Dr. Pape became the principal investigator in a $619,000 Federal contract to prepare for preliminary vaccine trials in Haiti as early as this year. **********''I told him this was completely utopic,  since the vaccine is not ready and will not be ready for many years,'' Dr. Sobel said. **********The experimental vaccines, which have been developed elsewhere, are at best only partially protective, many scientists say.  Even so, Dr. Pape said he considers it crucial for Haitians to be among the first in line to test them to establish Haiti's moral claim to an affordable supply of an effective vaccine when -- or if -- one is developed. **********Dr. Frantz Large, the vice president of the Haitian Medical Association, which is collaborating on the plans for vaccine trials, called Dr. Pape a great patriot. **********''He would never do anything unethical,'' Dr. Large said. ''But if he had to choose between the survival of 10 people and the survival of a nation, he would probably choose the survival of a nation, and I would, too.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-movado-expands-ag-relationship.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-11-03", "snippet": "Movado Group expands relationship with AG Worldwide by awarding AG its Movado brand, which had previously been handled in-house; billings estimated at $12 million (S)", "word_count": 51, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Movado Expands AG Relationship", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Movado Expands AG Relationship", "body_text": " **********Movado Group in Lyndhurst, N.J., expanded a relationship with AG Worldwide in New York, formerly Arnell Group Brand Consulting, by awarding AG its Movado brand, which had previously been handled in-house.

But the real star of the show is more likely to be the Internet. **********For years, audiences at events like ''We Are The World'' and ''Farm Aid'' have gathered and listened to wealthy entertainers sing, play and plead for the more fortunate to help out the less so. But after the last note dissolves into history, the public's commitment to the cause of the day usually evaporates quickly. **********Netaid's principal creators and organizers, the United Nations Development Program and Cisco Systems, are planning to make the 10-hour event the exception. To do that, they say, they will take advantage of the Internet's ability to be informative, immediate and intimate. **********''We want to use the computer to help change how the world looks at poverty and motivate people to help,'' said Djibril Diallo, public affairs director for the United Nations agency, which began examining ways of combining music, high technology and altruism more than a year ago. **********As the Internet broadens its reach, Amnesty International, Habitat for Humanity and other humanitarian and philanthropic groups have been turning to what may be the planet's biggest soapbox, hoping to raise money materials and find volunteers. **********In the case of the United Nations agency, which has the stated mission of eradicating extreme poverty, the Web site (www.Netaid.org) is a clearing house of information on the state of world poverty and the agency's programs as well as a means of raising money. **********''The difference between this and earlier concerts is that we created a vehicle for people to come back, not just on the night of the concert with the one check they write,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, the new administrator of the the development program. ''But instead, here's a site they're going to come back to time after time.'' **********Using techniques and technologies more commonly found on sites devoted to electronic commerce, the site, which was opened last month  with President Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former President, logging on, is expected to  make global philanthropy more efficient, its designers say. **********Netaid's organizers say they are hoping to draw millions of people to the site by using it for a Webcast of the concerts being held Saturday at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Wembley Stadium in London and Palais des Nations in Geneva. While the concerts will also be broadcast over a global network of conventional radio and television stations, the Webcast is scheduled to offer exclusive interviews and peeks backstage. **********To accomplish the task, the site, created through a partnership led by  Cisco Systems with Akamai Technologies and KPMG, is expected to use more than 125,000 simultaneous live streams to reach an anticipated on-line audience of more than 10 million people, said Douglas Graham, a partner with KPMG, a New York-based professional services firm that designed the site. **********The largest previous Webcast was a lingerie fashion show last winter done by Victoria's Secret using 12,000 live streams. That number proved inadequate, leaving throngs of potential viewers unable to view the show. By contrast, Mr. Graham said, the Netaid site has the capacity to handle enormous amounts of Internet traffic, including 60 million hits an hour, and process 1,000 donations a second. The site, which is built on a network created by 1,500 servers in more than 90 data centers around the world, is prepared to handle a billion hits, Mr. Graham said. **********Over time, Mr. Malloch Brown said, the Netaid site could be used to help give contributors a clearer accounting of how donations are used. ''We're looking at developing reporting systems where they'll be able to log on and check how their money is being used by a set of projects,'' he said. **********Larry Lang, vice president of service-provider marketing for Cisco Systems, which through its corporation and foundation has donated $20 million to Netaid, said the site might  soon have a high-tech, active matching system born in the financial markets. **********The system will permit groups and people with particular needs to register them in a Netaid database. It will also allow people who are willing to donate particular skills or materials to register them in the database. Technology that is used to match buyers and sellers in the financial world could then match those in need with those willing to fill those needs by introducing one to the other by way of automatic E-mail messages. **********''One thing that is good about this effort,'' Mr. Lang said, referring to the Netaid project, ''is that it reminds people that the Internet is a powerful tool to amplify human capabilities and to demonstrate the better sides of our nature.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/15/business/world-business-briefing-americas-big-order-for-embraer.html": {"writer_name": "Simon Romero", "pub_date": "1999-06-15", "snippet": "Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA wins orders for passenger jets potentially worth as much as $6.2 billion; Embraer, as company is known, wins orders mainly from European carriers like Crossair of Switzerland and Skyways of Sweden; Embraer will...", "word_count": 171, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BIG ORDER FOR EMBRAER", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AMERICAS; BIG ORDER FOR EMBRAER", "body_text": " **********Latin America's leading aerospace manufacturer, Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica S.A., won orders for passenger jets potentially worth as much as $6.2 billion, fueling the Brazilian company's turnaround from a state-controlled behemoth.

It will involve developing a new application for a Mitsubishi Pad PC -- a kind of souped-up Palm Pilot, originally designed for tasks like taking inventory in factories and warehouses. **********Users will carry a Pad PC through the exhibition and, with the touch of a finger or stylus, have access to audio, text and high-resolution color video and film programmed to accompany specific pieces of art. Looking at Alfred Steiglitz's ''Steerage'' photograph of immigrants, for example, a viewer could see film footage of Ellis Island and a portrait of Steiglitz, then read a brief biography and listen to audio clips of immigrants who, like those in the picture, were rejected by the United States and shipped home. **********The modified Pad PC will eventually incorporate a Web browsing device that will be able to pull information off the museum's Web site through a wireless network inside the museum. With many of this country's museums investing millions of dollars building extensive Web sites, it makes sense for visitors to be able to have access to that information from inside the galleries. **********The Whitney experiment is just one example of how technology is transforming the museum experience and how museums are using technology to compete for visitors. Paul Trapido, an independent museum exhibition designer, developed a device called Arif that has some of the same features of the Whitney device and is being used at a science museum in Kuala Lumpur. **********A modified Apple Newton, Arif has a Web browser and can run animation. Mr. Trapido's device also allows you to ''save'' items as you see or hear them. At the end of your tour of the exhibition, you can walk out with a computer printout of your museum experience. It is even possible for visitors to load  photos of their faces into the device. Then, when they come to an exhibit of a helicopter, for example, they can project their own faces into an image of the cockpit. **********''This device allows you to become interactive in a way that's really personal,'' Mr. Trapido said. **********Equipping museum visitors with visual devices, however, causes some consternation among many museum directors, who want visitors to look at the original object, not a reproduction on some other object. ''We don't want to monkey around with aura of work of art by introducing gadgetry,'' said Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum, who described himself as  curmudgeonly when it comes to technology in galleries. ''But we must be open to possibilities.'' **********Adding multimedia devices may not be a matter of choice for museums if they want to attract young people. ''This is more a generational issue for me,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''My 3-year-old son grew up playing video games. I need to think about how he's going to experience an art museum, not old duffers like me.'' **********The goal of these devices is to enhance the museum experience. And as museum audio tours have already demonstrated, technology can lengthen time spent on selected works. On their own, museum visitors will spend about six seconds looking at the painting, excluding the time it takes to read the label. With an audio tour, those same visitors will spend between 60 and 90 seconds on a work of art. **********''Museum technology is not an oxymoron,'' said Chris Tellis, chairman of Antenna Audio, one of two companies that dominate the museum audio tour industry. Mr. Tellis's clients include the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum, the Rijksmuseum and the National Gallery of Art in London. ''The technology is supposed to help you have a more intimate experience with the art,'' Mr. Tellis said. ''It's not meant to get in the way.'' **********Audio tours have become more sophisticated since the days of single tapes of a lone museum director droning on. Nor do you have to follow a prescribed linear course through an exhibition, with that inevitable cattle-like clumping in front of selected paintings and neglect of others. **********''A lot of people still think audio tours are art for dummies, but there's always something to learn with the equivalent of a half-dozen experts at your side,'' Mr. Tellis said. **********Today's audio tours are highly produced soundscapes recorded on CD or other digital hardware that meld music with the voices of experts and famous actors. Random access lets you hopscotch at your will through an exhibition: punch in a number of a particular art object and the tour jumps to the corresponding sound track. Skip the Monet, linger on the Manet. You can always go back to the main exhibition narrative. It's like seeing London from a double-decker tourist bus. You can get off, explore a bit and then get back on when you're ready. **********What if you skip the bus, take a cab and miss the overview? To insure you hear those can't-miss messages, as you pass from one gallery to the next, infrared transmitters above the door beam messages that trigger your device, like ''It's now 1870, and Van Gogh has moved to Paris,'' or maybe some mood-setting music -- Gregorian chants as you walk into the medieval armor show, for example. Sometimes, of course, it is a message from the exhibition's sponsor. **********Of the half-dozen or so kinds of museum-guide devices available, the most advanced also have infrared or radio receivers that let you walk up to a video installation and pick up the audio through your earphones -- in your own language. **********For example, at the Royal Belgium Institute of Natural Sciences in Brussels, where the antenna audio tour for an exhibition on the environment is offered in six languages, you can walk up to any one of nine screens, and in three seconds, your device picks up infrared signals, allowing the audio to synchronize with the video. In the language of your choice, video soundtracks on glaciers and tropical rain forests are piped into your ears. This technology will soon be available at the Tower of London and the new Museum of Scotland. **********Mr. Tellis said he foresaw a day when audio tours would offer some customized features. You might be able to choose the tour narrated by Philippe de Montebello, your teen-aged son could get one narrated by Michael Jordan, and the toddler could get Kermit the Frog. **********In the meantime, the devices are becoming lighter and offering better sound quality. Acoustiguide, another large audio tour manufacturer, recently introduced a new gadget at the National Gallery's John Singer Sargent show. Called the Flash System, it uses flash memory, the kind used in some digital cameras, to provide clear, skip-free audio accompaniment. This fall, Antenna Audio plans to introduce the X-plorer, a device that can upload MP3 audio files from the Internet and is small enough to fit in most patrons' pockets. **********With new technology providing a lure to museum-goers, even more conservative institutions are finding the devices hard to resist. **********Last summer, the Frick Collection, housed in a historic mansion overlooking Central Park, started offering audio tours. They were not exactly welcomed by many Frick members with headset bias. ''The Frick is one of the last bastions of nostalgia,'' said Samuel Sachs 2d, director of the Frick. ''Things have forever been unchanging here, including how to portray a work of art to the viewer.'' **********Even so, he said that 94 percent of visitors now use the tours and that ''these tours open worlds of enjoyment that people might otherwise be missing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/08/business/17-syllables-to-share-and-a-captive-audience.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1999-01-08", "snippet": "Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson begins session of Microsoft Corp antitrust trial by reading haiku alternatives to Microsoft's error message; they are part of fictitious article circulating on Internet that purports to announce that Sony has come up ...", "word_count": 228, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "17 Syllables to Share, And a Captive Audience", "print_headline": "17 Syllables to Share, And a Captive Audience", "body_text": " **********Opening today's session of the Microsoft antitrust trial, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson advised the lawyers that he had recently been handed a news item that it turned out had been circulating on the Internet in one form or another for years. **********The fictitious article, which Judge Jackson read into the court record, purported to announce that Sony had come up with a new operating system: **********''Instead of producing the cryptic error messages characteristic of Microsoft's Windows 95, 3.1. and DOS operating systems, Sony's chairman, Asai Tawara, said, 'We intend to capture the high ground by putting a human, Japanese face on what has been -- until now -- an operating system that reflects Western cultural hegemony.'

Last week, the Cypriots backed down. **********Turkey cannot claim full credit for staring down the Cypriots, because the United States and several European countries had also urged that the deployment be canceled to avoid dangerous friction between two NATO members. **********But in other areas, Turkish leaders have won important battles on their own. **********In October Turkish generals and political leaders demanded that Syria expel a Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has directed a 14-year guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey. They strongly hinted that Turkey would attack Syria if it did not comply, and massed soldiers along the Syrian border. **********With an alacrity that some in the region found astonishing, Syria quickly knuckled under and expelled Mr. Ocalan. **********Syria ''couldn't have resisted an attack by Turkey and it didn't want to be humiliated, especially with Israel watching,'' said a European diplomat with long experience in the Middle East. **********From Syria Mr. Ocalan flew to Russia. Turkish officials warned Russia that if he was allowed to stay there, they would demand instant repayment of Russian debts and force the scores of Turkish companies operating in Russia to cease operations immediately. Within days, Mr. Ocalan was in the air again, this time headed to Italy. **********Turkish leaders demanded that Italy send him home to face trial. But Italy, which is governed by a left-leaning coalition that includes some who sympathize with Kurdish rebels, proved less pliant and refused. **********Outraged Turks have threatened to ban Italian imports, which are worth many millions of dollars to Italian companies, and to reject Italian bids for huge Turkish military contracts. Newspapers here predict that Italy will soon see the error of its ways and send Mr. Ocalan away. **********Turkey is also using high-pressure tactics to persuade foreign oil companies that they should build their main export pipeline for Caspian crude oil through Turkey.

But Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen of Finland warned at a summit meeting here that \"the long and heavy hand of the taxman\" would eventually catch up with evaders. **********Seeking to stop tax evasion in Europe's single market, 14 of the ministers broadly agreed with a two-year-old proposal to levy a 20 percent tax on savings and investments in order to prevent Europeans putting their money in unidentified and sometimes secret accounts in other EU countries. A large numbers of Germans, for example, are believed to be stashing money in secret Luxembourg accounts. **********An alternative option to a new Europe-wide tax was to report investment income to the home governments of the investors concerned. **********But Britain refused to accept either taxation or reporting on private investments in Eurobonds; such investments make up about 5 percent of London's dollars 3 trillion Eurobond market. Institutional investors form the bulk of this market and unlike private investors they already report to home tax authorities. **********Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, argued that either a tax on private investments or reporting requirements would drive the Eurobond market to other financial havens, and drive thousands out of work in London. **********\"We are insisting that the Eurobond market must be protected,\" Mr. Brown, said. The market \"should not move out of Britain as a result of mistakes made in Europe.\" **********After failing to agree in a meeting that lasted much of the night, the finance ministers decided they would continue **********seeking a compromise solution during the first six months of next year. **********The alternative, said the Finnish finance minister, Sauli Niinisto, would have meant abandoning the EU's attempts to close the tax loopholes that are thought to distort the European single market. **********Mr. Niinisto said the British had made a slight concession by acknowledging that in theory that Eurobonds should be taxed like other investments. **********\"All citizens resident in a member state of the EU should pay all the tax due on all their savings income,\" the ministers said in a join statement. **********Clearly referring to Britain, Mr. Lipponen said there had been a lot of talking at Helsinki, but that no government should think it could duck the tax issue forever. **********\"The long and heavy hand of the tax man is inevitably going to land on this kind of income no matter how long it takes,\" he said. \"We are determined.\" **********But the British even turned down a Finnish compromise that would have limited the reporting requirement to merely handing over the names and addresses of private investors. **********Prime Minister Tony Blair, although he has called for a spirit of constructive engagement with Europe, showed no signs of compromising either. \"If we are isolated,\" he said, \"and we are right, then that is the correct position.\" **********Officials said British leaders were in no mood to compromise after France this week announced that it was continuing a ban on British beef because its scientists were still worried about \"mad cow\" disease. **********The failure to agree on the investment tax blocks any overall package aimed at reducing tax evasion, including a code of conduct intended to stop governments from luring businesses across frontiers by offering \"unfair\" tax advantages. **********\"If the U.K. problem, the problem of Eurobonds, cannot be solved, we cannot go forward with the tax package,\" Mr. Niinisto said. **********Some EU finance ministers did not shy from expressing their frustration with Britain. **********Gerrit Zalm, the Dutch finance minister, said that if it had been left to the British, \"Al Capone would never have been caught.\" **********His German counterpart, Hans Eichel, said he was \"extraordinarily disappointed,\" but that the leaders would eventually return to the issue. **********A spokesman for the European Commission said, \"It is very difficult to see where we can go from here.\" **********Officials said they could not move forward on other forms of tax evasion while exempting the Eurobond market from withholdings or controls. Such an exemption, they say, would create a huge tax haven in London. **********The lack of agreement, officials said, holds up plans to shift taxation away from labor and toward capital as a means of reducing Europe's high unemployment. **********Without an agreement on tax evasion, the 11 countries that have adopted the European single currency cannot proceed with talks on \"tax harmonization,\" a concept long opposed by Britain."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/business/worldbusiness/IHT-hong-kong-set-to-resume-land-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Segal", "pub_date": "1999-02-13", "snippet": "The Hong Kong government said Friday that it would end a 10-month suspension on sales of public land, the commodity that underpins the region's economy and stock market, in a move that analysts said was aimed at benefiting real estate developers a...", "word_count": 2395, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hong Kong Set to Resume Land Sales", "print_headline": "Hong Kong Set to Resume Land Sales", "body_text": " **********The Hong Kong government said Friday that it would end a 10-month suspension on sales of public land, the commodity that underpins the region's economy and stock market, in a move that analysts said was aimed at benefiting real estate developers and eventually home buyers. **********The government, which owns almost all the land in Hong Kong, suspended its sales program in June in an attempt to stabilize the falling real estate market, but analysts said the modest amount of land being put back on the market beginning April 1 was unlikely to depress apartment prices further. **********As Hong Kong battles its most severe recession in a generation, real estate prices have fallen by 50 percent or more since their peak in mid-1997, just before the Asian financial crisis began, but are still among the most expensive in the world.

But her mail was somehow intercepted, she said, and the loan check was cashed without her knowledge. It took nearly two months to clean up the mess. **********Mrs. Keenan said the company eventually told her not to worry about the bill any longer. But in the meantime, the Keenans feared that a blight on their credit could prevent them from buying a new house. ''I was afraid it was going to affect the mortgage we were applying for,'' said Mrs. Keenan, 56, an administrative assistant who lives in Woburn, Mass. Not only did she have trouble setting things straight, but she says the stress contributed to a mild heart attack her husband suffered. **********Avco has since been sold to the Associates First Capital Corporation, and a spokesman for Associates said the company could not comment on the Keenan case because it ''predates our purchase of Avco.'' **********Stories of the misuse of checks -- as well as other reports, some involving desperate consumers buried under mountains of expensive debt -- are behind a fresh push to outlaw loan checks, formally called live-check loans by mail. The loans, typically for a specific four-figure amount, are negotiable checks from a bank or other lender with which the recipient has had no relationship. By signing and cashing them, the recipients are effectively borrowing money at interest rates as high as 25 percent, according to the Consumer Federation of America. **********A similar product, called a convenience check, is issued by companies with which the consumer already does business. These checks, typically mailed in sets of three, let the recipient write in the amount of cash he wants to borrow. Issuers often send them during the holiday shopping season, but sometimes attach them to monthly bills, too. **********No one knows how many Americans have been victims of loan-check fraud or have used the checks to borrow beyond their means. Last summer, a General Accounting Office report said that there were no comprehensive figures on the extent of loan-check use, but that one institution, Fleet Financial Group, had provided some data. Between 1995 and 1997, Fleet mailed 4.35 million live-loan checks; about 155,000 borrowers cashed checks, thereby accepting loans totaling more than $680 million. Fleet told the G.A.O. that there were 68 confirmed cases of fraud. **********Consumer groups and some legislators are urging measures to ban loan checks. ''These checks serve no useful purpose while endangering many consumers,'' said Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection for the Consumer Federation of America. ''The nation is awash in consumer credit that is readily available to all who can afford it -- and to many who cannot.'' **********Calling the checks ''pernicious,'' she compared their issuance to the mailings of credit cards that were outlawed in 1970. The mail is still full of card offers, but the consumer must respond to the offer before being sent  a card. ''Instead of sending unsolicited credit cards, now they're sending unsolicited live checks,'' Ms. Fox said. **********Lenders stoutly defend loan checks, saying that they are convenient and useful for millions of people and that there has been  relatively little fraud or abuse. **********''Consumers ultimately make the final decision about these offers -- if they don't want them, they can simply tear them up and throw them away,'' said Randy Lively, president of the American Financial Services Association, when first faced with a hostile Federal bill in 1997. He reiterated that position last week. The 1997 bill went nowhere, but it did prompt the association -- a trade group that includes finance companies and credit-card issuers but not banks -- to create voluntary standards for disclosure and fraud protection. Minnesota incorporated the voluntary standards into law and Massachusetts legislators are collecting information for possible action. In New York, the legislature has been unable to pass a bill regulating the practice. **********''Lending institutions have crossed the line,'' said Cheryl Jacques, chairwoman of an investigative arm of the Massachusetts Senate, noting that consumers sometimes confuse the checks with government benefits or insurance reimbursements. **********This summer, Representative John J. LaFalce, Democrat of Buffalo and the ranking minority member of the House Banking Committee, introduced a new, more narrowly focused bill to ban loan checks. Quick Congressional action is unlikely, however. **********While critics contend that the industry has neither confined solicitations to financially qualified consumers nor lived up to its standards -- for example, requesting that offers not be forwarded by the post office -- government regulators have expressed little urgency on the issue. **********Unsolicited loan checks are less prevalent than unsolicited credit cards were in the late 1960's, the Federal Reserve told Congress two years ago, and some consumers undoubtedly value the ability to get credit instantly without making a formal application.

Pellets of the stuff were found in the grassy plot where the birds once pecked and cooed, although the killer and his motive remain unknown. **********The shocking news was instant grist for front-page headlines in Beijing's major newspapers and trumpeted on the evening news. Ever since, generally fractious Beijingers -- not known for their kindness to each other -- have selflessly rallied in support of the birds in a period of outraged mourning. **********High school students have biked into town to give their pocket money to a memorial fund. Old men have offered their pet pigeons as replacements. The owner of a feed company turned up at the shopping center with two bags of seeds for the 600 surviving birds. The deputy general manager of an environmental engineering company offered free ''environmentally friendly'' cremation for the deceased, including a large cake frosted with the image of a pigeon. **********Officials at Modern Plaza, the shopping mall, have been besieged by so many offers of memorial plaques and statuettes that they are still deliberating how to commemorate the tragedy. **********It says a lot about Beijingers and their birds. **********''Many people have come to express their concern and offer help, which has been a great source of moral support to me,'' said Wei Guangsheng, owner of the Beijing Happy Wings Company, Pigeon Technology and Service Center, which specializes in providing birds for public places and had originally placed the birds that died. **********''This has been a very hard time,'' he said, tossing mung beans to the remaining strutting, whirring members of the flock, indistinguishable from their reviled brethren in Central Park. ''But on the bright side, this whole weird incident shows how much Beijing people love these little creatures and how far they are willing to go for them.'' **********It is difficult to capture what Mr. Wei called the intimate relationship between Beijingers and their feathered friends. The pet of choice in urban China, birds are to Beijing people what lap dogs are to French matriarchs, at once an extension of persona and an object of lavish attention. But it is more mystical than that. Birds are to Beijingers what cows are to Hindus -- creatures that command near god-like respect. **********Beijing's parks are filled with old men carefully carrying blue covered cages -- out for a walk with their birds. The city's old neighborhoods  seem to reverberate with an odd humming sound, made by tiny whistles tied to pet pigeon's legs. High-rise apartment balconies are given over to pigeon cages. New Yorkers may call them rats with wings, but here they are treasured friends. **********''Pigeons are the animals closest to human,'' Shao Hean, general director of the An Shi pigeon breeding farm, told Beijing Evening News as he announced that he would replace the 118 dead birds free of charge.  ''They are an expression of the bond and harmony between nature and civilization and humanity.'' **********Wei Hongbin, a trendy 20-year-old in a red ski jacket, jeans and cowboy boots, shook his head in disbelief at the killings as he parked his mountain bike alongside Modern Plaza to contemplate the survivors. **********''The Chinese have a good feeling toward birds, and in some of the old courtyard neighborhoods half of the households raise them -- it's part of Beijing tradition,'' he said, noting that he himself had 12. ''These birds deserve a memorial. I can't imagine what kind of person would have hurt them.'' **********Of course, it is easier to get sentimental about pigeons in a city where few roam free and where the only ''public pigeons,'' as they are called, are the result of meticulously planned releases into a handful of parks and malls over the last few years. **********The pigeons at Modern Plaza, for example, each receive three to six months of training. And special workers have been appointed to deal with guano. **********''This is not going to become like Trafalgar Square,'' said Mr. Wei, owner of Happy Wings. ''In America, they are dirty. Here it is different: they are a symbol of peace.'' **********Although raising birds has long been popular in China, it was banned for many years as a bourgeois pastime, decadent and wasteful. But in the last two decades, bird breeding has rapidly re-emerged, reinforced by the fact that urban Chinese generally have neither the space nor the money to support larger pets. Anyway, in Beijing, all but tiny dogs are still illegal. **********''Pigeon raising is becoming more popular every year since it is so good for you and Chinese are becoming more conscious of their emotional selves,'' said Zhou Zujie, 66, a former president of the Chinese Homing Pigeon Association. **********But public pigeons have been slower to catch on, often meeting with a ''not in my backyard'' attitude. In the late 1980's, the city government proposed releasing pigeons in Tiananmen Square. The plan was shot down by the central Government for fear the birds would defile nearby structures, from the Great Hall of the People to the Mao Mausoleum. **********When Mr. Wei, a former advertising man, first introduced pigeons to Modern Plaza in 1996, there were other glitches. In this country rife with contradictions, pigeons are at once revered -- and also eaten. Several dozen of Mr. Wei's earliest releases were captured and ended up as dinner. **********''When the square first opened people didn't understand the value and importance of the little creatures,'' he said with a sad shrug. **********The birds at Modern Plaza are carefully trained not to stray from the grounds of the shopping mall. Using secret methods that incorporate a whirring call and pigeon food, they learn to fly in spirals from the top of the shopping center to a fenced-in area of the parking lot and back again. **********''After a while you develop a close personal relationship with the birds and they obey your commands,'' Mr. Wei said. **********''In fact these birds have established a close personal relationship with all people, as you see here,'' he added, pointing to the perpetual crowd of bystanders who were cementing the relationship with mung beans and seeds. ''So they are not likely to stray.'' **********On a recent frigid afternoon, the crowd included Dong Zhenli, a 30-year-old kindergarten teacher who had brought her 3-year-old daughter all the way across Beijing to pay their respects. **********''It was very sad that the birds died,'' Ms. Dong said.

A student standing amid the tables of glowing computer screens murmured that this was the ''kind of science'' students usually only ''heard about'' in school. **********With a few clicks of a mouse, Daniel Sandri, the 14-year-old in charge of controlling the microscopic image, zoomed to the tip of the insect's hairy leg, then its abdomen and face. These students were inspecting a bug they had found and mailed away to be examined as part of Bugscope, a new program offering classrooms free Web-based access to a $600,000 environmental scanning electron microscope at the Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. **********Bugscope (bugscope.beckman.uiuc.edu/bugscope99)is among several programs offering elementary-school and high-school students Internet and modem access to advanced scientific technology. Other students beyond the Dodson Middle School classroom have used similar programs to remotely operate a 24-inch optical telescope, a radio telescope, a magnetic resonance imager and NASA-designed robotic devices. Students using such resources have produced real data about stars and Jupiter's atmosphere, created digital libraries about chick embryology and insect anatomy, and provided hours of testing for the Mars rover. Some are making educational CD-ROM's. **********''What has come along, much bigger than us, is the Internet, which has changed everything about participation,'' said Louis Friedman, co-founder of the Planetary Society, (planetary.org), which sponsors one of the granddaddies of remote learning activities, Red Rover. A Lego robot that can be controlled by Internet and computer, Red Rover reaches about 400 classrooms that have paid $700 each to take part. The latest project, Red Rover Goes to Mars, will allow 40 selected students to control the Mars rover in 2002, while other projects will buy $200 Lego simulation programs that mimic rover activities. **********Most of these projects, except Red Rover, are offered free on a first-come, first-served basis, or at a modest cost to schools because the projects' producers obtain grants from NASA and private businesses. But there are hidden costs. There is no extra pay built in for teachers to run the programs, so they often end up working on their own time, and they often need training. And schools need Internet or modem connections and up-to-date computers to run some of the software. **********For all its potential, such remote-controlled technology is something of a hothouse flower of educational technology. Each project requires extraordinary coordination between educators and scientists, and tremendous financial and intellectual generosity. Fitting it into the school curriculum is the hardest part. **********''The use of such 'gee whiz' learning scenarios needs support for teachers in terms of their own understanding of the science,'' said Roy Pea, director of the Center for Technology in Learning at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif. **********The educational impact of the programs is unknown, but some educators believe that giving students a taste of real-life science, complete with its scheduling headaches and detailed coordination chores, is important. **********''I've always been interested in science, but it's having kids learn things that are real, not just memorizing things out of the books,'' said Jim Roller, a public high-school teacher who oversees the Goldstone Apple Valley radio telescope at the Lewis Center for Educational Research, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles (www.avstc.org). **********Mr. Roller's radio telescope program, backed by a NASA grant and other government and private financing, offers free to schools a six-day training program at his site followed by six hours of telescope access that may be used over a few months. Universities pay $50 for the program. Today, 18 schools participate, but Mr. Roller hopes to expand to 500. **********Remote-access projects have positive effects on student motivation and appeal to non-science students, educators say. ''I think it's been a kind of demystifying process for them,'' said Cassie Dunham, an outreach coordinator at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. She oversees the Field Integrated Design and Operation project -- FIDO -- a pilot project that selected a few dozen high-school students from Los Angeles; Phoenix; Ithaca, N.Y., and St. Louis to test the next Mars rover (wundow.wustl.edu/rover). ''This project awaits further backing from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Planetary Society,'' Ms. Dunham said, but its data will be available to students participating in the Red Rover Goes to Mars project.'' **********The pilot program's chief costs are borne by the teachers, who donate dozens of hours of their time. **********During vacations and after school, FIDO students remotely control a test rover at a secret location in the California desert. Steven Dworetzky, a robotics teacher at the Thomas Starr King Middle School in Hollywood, said his students have become experts in the computer language that commands the rover, sometimes troubleshooting for scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. **********A physics teacher, Joe Wise, who runs the W. M. Keck Math/Science Institute at Crossroads School, a private secondary school in Santa Monica, Calif., has his students working on remote optical and radar telescopes (www.kmsi.org/astro /variable.html). The projects broaden students' view of learning, he said. **********''Kids see high school as jumping through hoops,'' Mr. Wise said, ''and so they want to know what they have to do in the quickest time, the shortest route. This thing tends to create an ambiguous route with more time.'' **********To keep prices low to schools, the universities and research laboratories that produce such projects chase down grants and volunteers. The Telescopes in Education, or TIE, project (tie.jpl.nasa.gov/tie /index.html) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is one of the largest and oldest remote access programs. Offered free to elementary and secondary schools since 1993, it has reached 240 schools. TIE's director and co-founder, Gilbert Clark, has kept the program low-tech and free to schools through hours of donated development work on the prototype technology, NASA's annual $100,000 support and a 200-volunteer network. To expand the program, he plans to hit the grant trail again soon, raising enough to buy other telescopes around the world, each costing as much as $120,000. **********Bugscope is expected to grow from a few classes to two to four classrooms a week, using high-school student volunteers and charging schools about $50 to prepare the bug for examination and provide two hours on the microscope. **********Bugscope producers designed the program to run on volunteer time at minimal cost. An earlier effort at the Beckman Institute, Chickscope, which involved having individual schools submit fertilized eggs for periodic inspection under a magnetic resonance imager, was phased out because of cost and personnel demands, said Clint Potter, the program director. But despite such obstacles, student enthusiasm keeps remote technology projects alive. **********''It's kind of funny,'' said 18-year-old Aaron Parker, one of Mr. Wise's students. ''One of the best parts is knowing that I have access to a telescope that discovered the center of the Milky Way, and I can spin it around if I want to.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/10/business/new-crop-is-said-to-aid-nutrition.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-12-10", "snippet": "Monsanto Co says it has developed genetically engineered rapeseed, crop used to make cooking oil, that can raise level of vitamin A in humans; rapeseed would be one of first genetically engineered crops to produce direct benefits for consumers; it...", "word_count": 262, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Crop Is Said to Aid Nutrition", "print_headline": "New Crop Is Said to Aid Nutrition", "body_text": " **********The Monsanto Company said today that it had developed a genetically engineered rapeseed, a crop used to make cooking oil, that can raise the level of vitamin A in humans. **********The rapeseed, which would be one of the first genetically engineered crops to produce direct benefits for consumers, is years away from being marketed.

American officials say one of the questions on the test, on which he was shown to be deceptive, related to his computer use at Los Alamos, where he worked since 1978. **********Mr. Lee had not deleted the enormous files earlier, but had moved them out of the lab's classified computer, renamed them and stored them in an unsecure system years earlier, the officials said. **********The Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered the deleted files in March, after Mr. Lee gave the bureau permission to search his office computer. The administrator of the computer systems at Los Alamos then helped the bureau to recreate the deleted files. Officials say that after the polygraph test, Mr. Lee,  apparently aware that investigators were suspicious of his computer use,  deleted between 1,000 and 2,000 files. **********Mr. Lee was fired from his job at Los Alamos on March 8 for security violations, but has not been charged with any crime. **********Mr. Lee has denied wrongdoing. His lawyer could not be reached tonight. **********Experts from the F.B.I. and Los Alamos said they were horrified when they began to sift through the files that they say Mr. Lee transferred and then deleted. He had downloaded what amount to the keys to the American nuclear arsenal, officials said. **********The computer codes and data were, in effect, the distillation of more than a half-century of research on how to perfect nuclear weapons, they said. They included the so-called legacy codes that enable scientists to generate computer simulations of nuclear explosions. When coupled with data on the performance of specific warheads, they create a virtual blueprint of the nuclear explosive parts of a nuclear weapon. **********American officials contend that Mr. Lee transferred files out of the classified computer and into an unclassified computer network at Los Alamos between 1983 and 1995. Most of the reported transfers took place in 1994 and 1995. **********Investigators have not determined whether China obtained the computer data.

They knew they had maxed out the potential of the backwater burg where they had founded the company. To keep attracting the number and caliber of skilled employees they needed, they had to move the company to where the action was. **********Yes, it was time for Broadcom to forsake sleepy little Los Angeles and make its mark in the high-technology metropolis of Irvine, an hour's drive south. **********''We were reaching a critical mass; we had to go somewhere that's suited to building a big high-tech company,'' explained Henry T. Nicholas, who with Henry Samueli started Broadcom, a communications chip and cable modem maker, in 1992 when the two men were professors at the University of California at Los Angeles. **********Mr. Nicholas, Broadcom's chief executive, says he misses the city's night life and cultural ambiance. But, recalling how hard it was to recruit people to move to Los Angeles, he felt he had little choice. ''It's hard to relocate techies to L.A.,'' he said. ''It's the congestion, expensive housing -- and there's a certain stigma to it.'' **********Irvine, on the other hand, is what you might call a nerdistan: a suburban enclave of subdivisions, shopping centers and business parks where scientists, engineers and technicians feel comfortable living and working. For technology companies, it is everything a traditional urban center should be but isn't: a strategic location where the relevant partners, competitors, money and knowhow are all close at hand. **********Most nerdistans have appeared on leafy peripheries of metropolitan areas, close to major airports, universities and science-based industries but far from inner-city problems and annoyances. High concentrations of technology workers and companies have flocked together in suburbs of Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina, and in Silicon Valley, the original and still champion nerdistan. **********Like Irvine, most nerdistans are less bedroom communities than what the Purdue University historian Jon C. Teaford calls post-suburbia -- economically and culturally self-sufficient areas that ring traditional core cities but are largely insulated from them. This pattern is clear in sprawling Los Angeles County, which leads the nation in the number of high-technology jobs but ranks 15th in technology workers as a share of the work force, according to a study by researchers at WEFA, an economic research organization; neighboring Orange County, where Irvine is, ranks seventh. A map of Los Angeles County's technology companies finds a vast majority in peripheral areas miles from the center of the city. **********Similarly, despite media buzz about Silicon Alley, most technology jobs in the New York City area are in the suburbs, not in Manhattan. The periphery's share of the region's computer-related jobs grew to more than 80 percent in 1996 from 68 percent in 1982, according to a study at the University of Miami. Sections of Fairfield County, Conn., and northwestern New Jersey rank among the top 15 places in the country for most technology workers per capita; New York City ranks 80th, according to WEFA. **********NERDISTANS can also be defined by what they generally do not have, said John Kasarda of the University of North Carolina. There are no ports or railroad yards, but technology work does not require them. There are no venerable art museums or symphony orchestras, but technology workers generally do not miss such amenities. And there are usually no homeless people or derelict buildings in sight. **********''You get rid of the problems of the city by charging for the exits,'' said Mr. Kasarda, who has studied the movement of high-technology companies in the Raleigh-Durham area and elsewhere. ''For these people, the city is superfluous.'' **********Once they get started, nerdistans snowball. Richard Holcomb, president of the Raleigh-based Haht Software, said the presence of a herd of big technology companies like Data General, I.B.M. and Burroughs-Wellcome provides a pool of seasoned workers for start-ups to tap. ''You can get a great job, and if this one doesn't work out, you can just go down the road,'' he said. **********Given the technology sector's generally high pay, nerdistans are evolving into centers of wealth, with demographics to match. In Irvine, which is also home to a University of California campus, almost two-fifths of households earn more than $75,000 a year, and more than half the adult population is college-educated, compared with one-fifth for the country as a whole. Not quite as ''white bread'' as its reputation, Irvine has a population of 122,000 that is 70 percent Caucasian and 22 percent Asian. **********Not all nerdistans are alike, though. Older, unplanned centers like Silicon Valley and  southwestern Connecticut are becoming victims of their own success, plagued by congestion, housing shortages and struggling public schools. Newer planned communities like Irvine and the Research Triangle seem to be coping better, Mr. Kasarda said. And that translates into a competitive advantage in recruiting scientists and engineers, especially those with children. **********''It's a very planned place,'' said Nancy Venable, a technology support engineer and divorced mother of a teen-age girl who moved last year from Charlotte, N.C., to take a job at Wonderware, a factory automation company based in Irvine. ''You don't have to join an association to get to a pool, and everything has been placed close to where you live. The schools are good. It's safe, it's clean, it's easy to get around, and it's new.

In fact, several participants in the meetings described the return of an atmosphere of calm about the state of the world economy, a calm that one official said ''might make you think we had not just been through a devastating world economic crisis.'' **********Most of the meetings were filled with talk of a modest agenda of changes for the International Monetary Fund and its member states, mostly requiring greater disclosure by countries about their finances, in hopes of preventing the kinds of surprises that fueled the Asian economic crisis. **********But there was no urgent talk, as there was six months ago, about the risks of deflation. European officials offered no new agenda for turning around a slowdown that has already led to a slide in the value of the new European currency, the euro. And a clear divide emerged between the United States and Japan over whether Tokyo had already done enough. **********No sooner had the Group of Seven nations issued their traditional communique this afternoon than Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his Japanese counterpart, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, began to interpret the deliberately vague wording about Japan's economic strategy in strikingly different terms. **********The communique, agreed upon by all of the nations well before the start of today's meeting, stated that Japan should ''implement stimulus measures until growth is restored, using all available tools to support strong domestic-demand-led growth.''  Mr. Miyazawa, a former Prime Minister and one of Tokyo's canniest politicians, told a news conference here this evening that the wording ''has nothing to do with anything new.'' It should not be read to suggest, he said, that Japan was ready to take further steps to stimulate its economy. The I.M.F. predicts that Japan's gross national product will shrink 1.4 percent this year, while the Japanese Government officially says that there will be modest growth. **********Mr. Rubin appeared to have a different view from that of Mr. Miyazawa. Speaking at the Treasury, he insisted that the communique, in his interpretation, committed Japan to ''continue to take important measures'' until ''solid, domestic-demand-led growth is resolved.'' **********There is an enormous political gap laid bare by their statements. Mr. Miyazawa knows that the Government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who visits here next week, has no political capital left to persuade Japanese lawmakers to spend more on stimulating the economy and bailing out failed banks. But Mr. Rubin has repeatedly said that the United States cannot continue to soak up exports from Japan and the rest of Asia, sending the American trade deficit soaring. **********''This is not indefinitely sustainable economically,'' Mr. Rubin said today, ''and certainly not politically.'' He referred to the divergent positions as a ''slight difference of emphasis.'' But it was a difference that had been kept well below the surface for nearly a year. **********Throughout 1997 and the first half of 1998 Mr. Rubin rarely missed an opportunity to criticize Japan's slowness to react to its troubles, despite overwhelming evidence that the country's recession was worsening the angst in Asia. But after the Japanese protested that he was undercutting confidence, Mr. Rubin muted those comments and often praised Prime Minister Obuchi for pushing through bailouts of Japanese banks. **********But the fear now is that Japan is not ready with a second phase of measures if the first run out of steam. That is what happened three years ago, when Japan briefly showed signs of recovery only to fall into its deepest recession since the end of World War II. **********Japan, though, was hardly the only shrinking economy that commanded the group's attentions today. **********The finance ministers stopped well short of publicly endorsing new loans to Russia to keep the country from defaulting in coming months. Nonetheless, officials say they expect a $4.2 billion loan will be delivered by June, the first aid to Russia since it devalued its currency and President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed an economic reform team last August. **********In their communique, the ministers said that they remained ''concerned about the country's ongoing financial and macroeconomic instability,'' and, in the typically understated wording of such documents, urged Russia to adopt ''a credible economic program.'' But Mr. Rubin clearly remains skeptical about the ability of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to deliver on Russia's commitments. **********''Assuming that the actions agreed to are real,'' Mr. Rubin said, referring to Russia's promises to the I.M.F. to rein in its government spending, ''then I think that would be a substantial fiscal accomplishment.'' But he quickly warned that ''agreement is one thing; implementation is another,'' a clear reference to Russia's past promises. **********Mr. Rubin said that the ministers spent very little time discussing exchange rates. There was some discussion of the economic impact of the air war in Kosovo, but no agreement on how the cost of rebuilding the region might be shared. Most of the session was devoted to questions of increased financial disclosure, with hints that all the countries would soon adopt new rules regarding hedge funds, the huge pools of money that some blame for accelerating the Asian crisis and the flight of cash from Russia and Brazil."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/29/business/company-news-geerlings-wade-agrees-to-a-deal-with-liquid-holdings.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-09-29", "snippet": "Geerlings & Wade Inc agrees to be acquired by Liquid Holdings Inc for about $40 million in cash (S)", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GEERLINGS & WADE AGREES TO A DEAL WITH LIQUID HOLDINGS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; GEERLINGS & WADE AGREES TO A DEAL WITH LIQUID HOLDINGS", "body_text": " **********Geerlings & Wade Inc., the leading United States mail-order seller of fine wines, agreed to be acquired by the closely held Liquid Holdings Inc. for about $40 million in cash.

Mr. Barak arrived on Sunday night. Mr. Clinton arrived early this morning and Mr. Arafat was expected later in the day. **********If things go right in two days of ceremonies, meetings and corridor conversations, the preparatory work by Mr. Roed-Larsen, who was the main go-between in the secret 1993 Palestinian-Israeli talks in Oslo, will have paid off. He hopes that Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak will leave with fresh confidence in their February-to-September timetable for a final accord. **********That the meeting is taking place in the city where secret negotiations that led to the 1993 breakthrough accord were held has created an aura of warmth. That Mr. Roed-Larsen, who is described by many involved in the 1993 talks as the glue that held them together, is back on the scene has also added trust. **********This time the talks are not secret and there are no safe houses, ruses or disguises. **********Mr. Roed-Larsen is the first to caution that this very public Oslo gathering, endowed with all the pomp of a presidential visit and blessed by the Norwegian royal family, is not expected to result in a milestone conclusion. The ultimate  issues to be decided by September -- the borders of the Palestinian-controlled area, the future of Jerusalem and what will happen to Palestinian refugees -- are too monumental to get anywhere near that. **********Instead, he said the timing was auspicious for Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat to meet with each other and with Mr. Clinton. After a bright start with the election of Mr. Barak and the signing of an agreement at Sharm el Sheik in Egypt in September, the situation has stalled, with little contact between the two leaders or their representatives. **********Mr. Arafat has angrily denounced the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Mr. Barak delayed announcing the leader of his negotiating team until last week. **********And in the lobby of the Grand Hotel here on Sunday night, the Palestinian negotiator, Yasir Abed Rabbo, gave a sense of the obstacles ahead. He yelled at Mr. Roed-Larsen in front of television cameras about the Israeli settlements and suggested that negotiations were futile if settlement activity went ahead. ''What can be achieved is to solidify the new confidence that is building between the parties since Mr. Barak's election,'' Mr. Roed-Larsen said. ''Timing is the main reason all the main actors are coming from the United States and the Middle East to Norway -- to the backwoods of Europe.'' **********Mr. Roed-Larsen also hopes that the Israelis and Palestinians will be able to agree on steps for reaching a framework agreement by mid-February. On Friday the two sides announced that they would hold their first formal negotiating session for the February agreement on Sunday. Mr. Roed-Larsen hopes that they will agree to more sessions, more benchmarks, by Tuesday. **********''In the Middle East it is always a complicated process of who does what when,'' he said. ''Sometimes organizing the process is more important than the substance.'' **********In the 1993 talks, Mr. Roed-Larsen was a diplomat with the Norwegian Foreign Ministry. He still is, but in September he was appointed the United Nations special coordinator for Middle East peace efforts. He is also Secretary General Kofi Annan's representative to the Palestinian Authority and is playing his intermediary role while based in Gaza. **********The 1993 secret talks in Oslo culminated in the historic handshake on the White House lawn by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and Mr. Arafat. In two books by Israelis, Mr. Roed-Larsen is described as the indispensable believer who kept the often irascible, nervous sides talking. **********David Makovsky, now the executive editor of The Jerusalem Post, who wrote ''Making Peace with the PLO,'' (Westview Press/HarperCollins, 1996), said Mr. Roed-Larsen and his wife, Mona Juul, also a Norwegian diplomat, were the ''body and soul'' of the 1993 effort. **********''Terje and his wife gave the talks the human empathy that are not the stuff of big-power politics,'' said Mr. Makovsky. ''They were almost the wailing walls.'' Mr. Roed-Larsen, a sociologist and philosopher by training, is in a position to do the same again, Mr. Makovsky said. **********Mr. Roed-Larsen has kept in touch with the major figures, including the United States special envoy to the Middle East, Dennis B. Ross. The two diplomats worked on details of these new talks. **********Unlike Mr. Ross, Mr. Roed-Larsen is not a negotiator, but has acted as a back channel and sounding board.  Now the situation is much different from that in 1993. Then, the Israelis were forbidden by law from meeting with the Palestine Liberation Organization. There were no phone lines between the P.L.O., then based in Tunis, and Israel. For the parties to talk, they had to go to the Norwegians. Now the two sides can talk directly ''if there is a will,'' Mr. Roed-Larsen said. **********On the Israeli side, there is a complete change in the cast of characters. Mr. Rabin, who made the pivotal decision to go ahead in 1993, is dead -- it is the fourth anniversary of his assassination that Mr. Clinton, Mr. Arafat and Mr. Barak will commemorate here. Shimon Peres is in a lesser role. And Mr. Barak has made clear that ''interpreters,'' as he calls intermediaries, are not needed. **********More than anything else, Mr. Barak has emphasized that he is his own man. If there is a secret channel this time -- and all sides say that it is an essential ingredient -- it will be between Mr. Barak and a Palestinian delegated by Mr. Arafat, or Mr. Arafat himself, Israeli and American officials said. **********On the Palestinian side, the key negotiator at Oslo in 1993, Ahmed Qurei, also known as Abu Ala, is now speaker of the Palestinian Council in Ramallah, but he will be with Mr. Arafat here. **********In describing how the talks toward a final agreement might unfold, Clinton administration officials paint a picture of steps similar to those that led up to the Oslo accord of 1993 and a later one in 1995. **********First, in 1993, a declaration of principles was outlined -- not unlike the framework agreement that is supposed to be finished in February -- and then an agreement was worked out to put it into effect. But this time, American officials have acknowledged, the stakes are higher and the time schedule much tighter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/business/world-business-briefing-asia-korean-bank-shares.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-08-03", "snippet": "Hanvit Bank of South Korea sells $1 billion of global depository receipts at 25 percent discount to July 30 closing share price; sale, which had collapsed July 30 because Government balked at steep discount, was revived after stock fell sharply (S...", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KOREAN BANK SHARES", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; KOREAN BANK SHARES", "body_text": " **********Hanvit Bank, South Korea's No. 2 commercial lender, sold $1 billion of global depository receipts at a discount of 25 percent to Friday's closing share price.

La Haye Sr., a leader in developing technologies to help people see better, died Sunday when his private plane crashed in Pennsylvania on its way to New Jersey from Seattle. Mr. La Haye was 59 and lived in Medina, Wash. **********Mr. La Haye was on his way to a board meeting in New York of Orbis International, a charity group that promotes eye health in developing nations, a spokesman for Mr. La Haye said yesterday. The cause of the crash, which also killed the two pilots on board, is unclear. **********Born in Montreal, Mr. La Haye dropped out of high school but went on to help pioneer the development of plastic lenses for people suffering from cataract diseases, to develop dietary supplements for people with eye diseases and to develop stick-on magnifying lenses for sunglasses. **********Mr. La Haye's ventures made him wealthy. Earlier this year, he attracted national media attention when he put his waterfront estate -- a quarter-mile from that of William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft -- up for sale for $45 million, one of the highest prices asked for a home in the United States. The property remains on the market. **********But Mr. La Haye's roots were more humble. After leaving high school and serving briefly in the Marine Corps, Mr. La Haye moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950's. **********While working in a gas station, Mr. La Haye lobbied hard for a job at Bell & Howell, the optical and information technology company. **********''They got so tired of seeing me, they hired me,'' Mr. La Haye told The Puget Sound Business Journal in 1996. **********After a series of jobs, including a position as a production manager at Xerox, Mr. La Haye struck out on his own in the early 1970's, and in 1973 began developing lenses to be implanted in cataract patients. By the late 1970's, his company, Iolab, controlled almost 50 percent of the global market for such lenses and Mr. La Haye sold the company to Johnson & Johnson in 1980. **********A spokesman for Mr. La Haye declined to comment on the value of that deal. **********After selling Iolab, Mr. La Haye retired from business and moved from California to Washington, where he could park his boat in front of his house. **********But in 1986, prompted largely by tales from missionaries who had worked with cataract patients in Ethiopia and Pakistan, he founded La Haye Laboratories. The laboratories have developed anti-oxidant supplements for people with degenerative eye diseases under the slogan ''Promotes Healthy Eyes.'' That product line was sold to an affiliate of Nestle S.A. last year. **********In 1995, Mr. La Haye founded another company, Neoptx, which makes removable reading lenses for sunglasses and diving masks. **********Mr. La Haye is survived by his mother, Martha Sonois, of Sherbrooke, Quebec; his wife, Sandy; three brothers, Paul, of Kennebunk, Me.; Bernard, of Montreal; and Richard, of St. Bruno, Quebec; a sister, Monique Deroches, of Sherbrooke; two sons, Peter Jr., and Derrick, both of the Seattle area; one daughter, Kristine La Haye Wood, of the Seattle area; and seven grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/07/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-voices-no-one-is-planning-a-parade-as-a-war-s-end-nears.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Sachs", "pub_date": "1999-06-07", "snippet": "Americans polled regularly over course of NATO bombing campaign against Serbs say there is little to celebrate as war's end nears; say there are no winners, only losers; some had supported bombing, others had opposed it; none have relatives or fri...", "word_count": 932, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No One Is Planning a Parade as a War's End Nears", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: VOICES; No One Is Planning a Parade as a War's End Nears", "body_text": " **********The end of NATO's war on Yugoslavia seems to be in sight, but among a group of Americans who have been following the news, there is little exultation. **********Dilia Theodosakia, a retired secretary who long ago abandoned her initial support for the bombing, sees no winners, only losers. **********''They are all criminals in their own way, not just Milosevic,'' she said, lumping in the leaders of NATO countries with Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Yugoslavia. ''They are all responsible for escalating suffering. The Albanians in Kosovo had problems before, but once the bombing started the killing got worse and the Serbs suffered terribly, too.'' **********Unlike Mrs. Theodosakia, Martha McCauley has remained steadfast in her belief that only military force could stop Serbian violence against the Albanian population in Kosovo. But the price will be high, she said. **********''If the refugees go back, and their houses are all gone, what will we do?'' said Mrs. McCauley, a retired I.B.M. worker and busy grandmother. ''Who is going to pay for the rebuilding of that country? I think Milosevic and Yugoslavia should pay for that. It's their fault.'' **********Over the course of the NATO bombing campaign against the Serbs, Mrs. Theodosakia, Mrs. McCauley and several of their neighbors in White Plains have been asked regularly to discuss their opinions about the war. **********None have relatives or friends in the military. So without a personal stake in the conflict, they have been paying less attention to what has been happening in Yugoslavia. They all expressed relief that the Yugoslav leadership appears to have accepted NATO's terms for ending the bombing, but they are skeptical about whether NATO's aims have been accomplished. **********Mrs. Theodosakia, who describes herself as a conservative, has come full circle in her views about the war. At first mistrustful of President Clinton's motives, she came to rally to the NATO cause, believing it a moral mission to save the Kosovo Albanians. Then, as casualties mounted in the NATO bombing, so did her sympathies for the Serbs as victims. **********Now, Mrs. Theodosakia, who at age 57 is about to start a new career as a nutritionist, is once again deeply suspicious of the motivations of NATO leaders. **********''In every war, there's something behind it -- politics or selfishness on somebody's part -- and yet civilians are the ones who suffer,'' she said. ''I'd really like to know the truth, why they were doing this just in Yugoslavia when there are people suffering all over the world.'' **********From reading several newspapers, listening to radio talk shows and discussions with relatives, Mrs. Theodosakia said she had reached her own conclusions about what the situation in Kosovo was before the NATO bombing began. **********It was not a holocaust in the making, as portrayed by President Clinton, but a conflict between the Yugoslav Government and the Kosovo Albanian separatists, ''who used force and terror because they wanted a piece of the country,'' she said. **********NATO did not resolve that conflict by bombing. ''What did they accomplish?'' she continued. ''What I say is this: send the leaders to war. Let them feel the pain.'' **********Bill Clark, an employee of the Westchester County Board of Elections, tuned out weeks ago to the war against Yugoslavia. ''I'm just fed up with it,'' he said, after hearing that a peace accord had been reached. ''We have exhausted our stay over there, as far as I'm concerned.'' **********Mr. Clark, a trim 58-year-old, served in Vietnam as a marine and that experience still marks his views. He looks with a skeptic's eye at any war, no matter how noble sounding its goals, and recalled his own war days as a time when he ''saw kids dying like flies.'' **********During the more than two months of the Kosovo war, he has had very little patience with what he sees as the bombast of military commanders. So when NATO missiles began occasionally to go astray, killing Serbian civilians and in some cases Kosovo Albanians, Mr. Clark considered his cynicism well founded. **********''There have been so many civilian casualties,'' he said. ''Friendly fire -- I told you that was going to happen. Once you go to war, even if you have all these high-tech weapons, as long as you're human, you're going to have errors.'' **********In the early days of the bombing, Mr. Clark paid close attention to the war, almost in spite of himself. ''In the beginning I was interested,'' he acknowledged. ''But after it got so prolonged, I just wasn't interested anymore.'' **********The only way he could explain his indifference was, again, to reach back to his own memories as a soldier. ''I knew what the outcome was going to be before it happened,'' Mr. Clark said. ''I knew no one would really win. Been there. Done that.'' **********Mrs. McCauley's interest, on the other hand, never flagged. An avid reader before the war, she added an extra daily newspaper to her morning regime to stay informed. **********At 69, she is old enough to remember her father serving in the Army in World War II. Moved and angered by the Serbs' expulsion of Kosovo Albanians, she saw the NATO war against Yugoslavia as an echo of her father's good fight. And while the casualties and the destruction wrought by NATO bombs saddened her, they never dented her pride that the United States ''helps people.'' **********So was it worth it? she was asked after Yugoslavia accepted NATO's terms for ending the bombing last week. **********Mrs. McCauley did not like that question. ''It was war,'' she said, ''and you never think of anything as being worth war. But I just don't think Milosevic would have done anything without this war. He would have just gone on with his ethnic cleansing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/01/world/crisis-balkans-overview-nato-plans-weeks-bombing-break-grip-serb-leader.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1999-04-01", "snippet": "NATO opens its expanded bombing campaign against Yugoslavia; officials are planning weeks of air strikes intended to undermine President Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power; say stepped-up bombing of broader range of sites as second week of air str...", "word_count": 1253, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATO PLANS WEEKS OF BOMBING TO BREAK GRIP OF SERB LEADER", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW; NATO PLANS WEEKS OF BOMBING TO BREAK GRIP OF SERB LEADER", "body_text": " **********NATO opened its expanded bombing campaign against Yugoslavia today, and alliance officials said they were planning weeks of air strikes intended to undermine President Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power. **********The stepped-up bombing of a broader range of sites as the second week of air strikes begins is intended to give the alliance a more effective tool to press Mr. Milosevic to halt the Serbian onslaught in Kosovo, NATO officials said. **********NATO plans to bomb throughout Yugoslavia, with some exceptions, and the alliance's military commanders were quick to use their expanded authority today. **********Kenneth H. Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, said at the Pentagon that allied bombers had struck the headquarters of the Special Unit Corps, the Yugoslav equivalent of the American Special Forces. **********''I believe it was the closest to downtown Belgrade that has been struck to date,'' Mr. Bacon said. He also reported that several tanks had been struck. **********In unusually blunt language, the German general who is chairman of the alliance's military committee outlined the goal of the stepped-up attacks, which may take aim at command posts and Government buildings, including those in downtown Belgrade. **********''We clearly intend to loosen his grip on power and break his will to continue and, as weather permits, to chip off his assets in Kosovo.'' Gen. Klaus Naumann said of Mr. Milosevic. **********''If we start to chip away at the institutions that keep him in power, he may think it over,'' the general said in an interview. **********The bombing of Yugoslavia has had the opposite effect so far. Serbs, including some who oppose Mr. Milosevic, have united behind their leader, who has cast himself as a heroic David against a bullying Goliath. **********NATO's change in tactics stems from its continuing inability to halt the Serbian advances in Kosovo. Up to now, NATO has concentrated on bombing air defense sites and on striking the Serbian forces that are pressing the attack on ethnic Albanians in the province. **********With bombing there hampered by bad weather, alliance officials were searching for other ways to compel Mr. Milosevic to call off his attacks. **********''The more the action moves closer to Belgrade and other population centers, the more we will rattle the rather exuberant nationalist opinion,'' a Western official insisted. **********NATO officials also hope that Yugoslavia's deteriorating economy, coupled with reluctance within the country's army to stand by as its bases and equipment are destroyed, will add to the pressure on Mr. Milosevic. **********Mr. Bacon said NATO planes had reported hitting several tanks and other armored vehicles in Kosovo, although he said there had been no confirmation by reconnaissance planes. He said there were about 400 tanks in and around Kosovo. **********''I don't think that anybody would expect to hit them all at once,'' he said. ''But we are, as we have said many times, systematically attacking these forces, and we will continue to do that.'' **********Mr. Bacon said NATO had struck ''a major ammunition manufacturing plant'' in the town of Cacak, 60 miles south of Belgrade. Reporters there were shown what the authorities called an appliance factory damaged in a strike. **********With the flood of refugees into neighboring countries growing, NATO officials said there were reports of Serbian tank and artillery units shelling fleeing columns of Albanians in Kosovo. **********France said it would detail 10 fighter planes to try to protect the refugees on their way to Albania and Macedonia, while other countries pledged logistical and financial support for the refugees. **********Russia announced that it was sending some of its aging Black Sea warships into the Mediterranean to ''monitor'' the Balkan crisis, a gesture that United States officials said they did not consider a military threat but feared might lend moral support to the Milosevic Government. **********The ships include an intelligence vessel that could provide some information to Belgrade on NATO military operations in the Adriatic Sea. **********Officials said today that NATO's classified order setting the terms of the air strikes called for a campaign to ''break the will'' of Serbia's leadership if Belgrade did not back away from attacks against ethnic Albanians. The officials said they were planning for a brutal test of Mr. Milosevic's resolve that could go on for weeks. **********Javier Solana, the NATO Secretary General, said he hoped that the campaign could be concluded before the alliance's summit meeting, which is to begin on April 23. Other officials were not so sure. **********NATO leaders gave their military commanders the broader authority to attack Yugoslavia at a meeting here that ended early this morning. **********The expansion of the target list came after a closed-door debate among the NATO allies. The United States proposed that the alliance open a new, more offensive stage of operations that would enable allied warplanes to attack military and industrial sites throughout Yugoslavia and Government ministries in downtown Belgrade. In NATO, that stage was referred to as Phase 3. **********But allies like Italy and Greece have been uneasy over the bombing campaign, and a compromise was worked out giving the alliance a broader range of targets, but not as much flexibility as the United States had proposed. **********''As always in NATO decisions, there was a compromise,'' a senior NATO official said. ''What we got will give the executing commanders sufficient leeway to act.'' **********Using its new targeting authority, NATO will be allowed to broaden its strikes to include command-and-control centers throughout the country and Government headquarters in the Yugoslav capital. **********''No facility, no unit which is currently being used to plan, conceive, direct or carry out operations is going to be a sanctuary,'' a NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said today. **********NATO commanders used their new authority just a few hours after the alliance approved it this morning. And a NATO official said the alliance appeared to have deflected pressure from Greek and Italian diplomats, as well as the Vatican, for a pause in the bombing for Easter. **********But the air operations will fall short of the Phase 3 plan that the United States had wanted to carry out. Some of Yugoslavia's military-industrial complex and infrastructure north of the 44th parallel will remain off-limits for now. **********The alliance will not attack Yugoslavia's television broadcasting system without further discussions among NATO members, a Western official added. **********The presidential palace used by Mr. Milosevic also cannot be attacked, according to the guidelines. NATO officials said that as the palace of the former King of Yugoslavia, it is considered to be a historic and cultural site. Also, it has a Rembrandt on its first floor. **********''How can we win the hearts and minds of the people of Yugoslavia if we destroyed the palace?'' a NATO official said. **********Even though military experts are debating the use of ground forces, NATO officials said there were no current plans to send them as a invasion force to take over Kosovo or for the less ambitious mission of protecting enclaves of refugees within Kosovo. **********The fight in Kosovo has emerged as one of the clearest tests of air power. Some Air Force officials have long argued that laser-guided bombs and cruise missiles would enable technologically superior powers to win a victory through air power. **********Pinpoint strikes against command centers, communications links and internal security forces, these officials have insisted, could destroy the levers of power that the enemy leadership needs to control its society. At the same time, punishing raids would generate unrest within its military. **********The theory was put to the test against Iraq during the Persian Gulf war of 1991 when the United States used F-117 stealth fighters and cruise missiles to take their attack to downtown Baghdad. But President Saddam Hussein was still in power after six weeks of air strike, and eight years later he still is."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/17/business/market-watch-are-the-glory-days-over-for-the-dip-buyers.html": {"writer_name": "Gretchen Morgenson", "pub_date": "1999-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 543, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Are the Glory Days Over For the Dip-Buyers?", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; Are the Glory Days Over For the Dip-Buyers?", "body_text": " **********WILL they or won't they buy the dip? **********It has become a Wall Street truth that whenever share prices drop, bargain hunters throng to the stock market, providing a floor to equity prices and relief to damaged portfolios.

According to these people, investors today are less likely to jump in when stock prices fall. **********There are several reasons for this. Most important, the level of cash that investors have on hand to put into the stock market is low. For most of the major investor groups, cash reserves are near the low end of their 45-year ranges, according to Christine A. Callies, chief United States market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. **********In the second quarter, cash in American  households stood at 3.59 percent of total financial assets, a new low and well down from 3.96 percent in the third quarter of 1998. Borrowings to buy securities, meanwhile, are at a record $155 billion, compared with $78.6 billion in 1995. **********Other investors have diminished cash holdings as well. Cash held by managers of mutual funds stands at around 2 percent of funds' total financial assets, down from 2.56 percent in the third quarter of last year. And cash available for investment at non-life insurance companies is 4.51 percent of total financial assets, the lowest since 1984. **********The only investors with a greater cash hoard are life insurance concerns, a group not known for aggressive forays into stocks. **********Even if investors had more funds to devote to stocks, Ms. Callies suspects that they would not be the asset of choice. ''I think that some investors will still buy the dips but less than would have been the case four or five months ago,'' she said. ''Confidence in high valuations tends to erode once investors realize that interest rates are going up.'' **********Dip-buyers have been AWOL in mutual funds as well. Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services, said equity funds had net outflows of $1.1 billion in the seven days ended on Wednesday. **********Investors have also been abandoning high-yield bond funds, a place where they had been happy to park their funds during previous periods of market turmoil. Last fall, for instance, when the Russian collapse roiled the stock market, investors still felt comfortable putting money into high-yield funds. But in the week ended on Wednesday, 168 funds reported net outflows while 125 funds reported inflows. **********So, it seems that well before Thursday, when Alan Greenspan wondered aloud whether investors were aware of increased risks in stocks, mutual fund investors had been recoiling from risk. **********As Mr. Adler said: ''When the stock market collapsed last year, money that left the equity markets was reallocated to debt. This October, there is no evidence of a reallocation. Risk aversion is spreading.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/25/world/vietri-sul-mare-journal-eco-monster-hotel-bites-the-dust.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1999-05-25", "snippet": "Italian environmentalists win important 30-year battle to demolish The Fuenti, huge, ultramodern concrete hotel perched atop Mediterranean in Vietri sul Mare which many regarded as country's worst 'eco-monster' and particularly shameless example o...", "word_count": 992, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vietri sul Mare Journal; 'Eco-Monster' Hotel Bites the Dust", "print_headline": "Vietri sul Mare Journal; 'Eco-Monster' Hotel Bites the Dust", "body_text": " **********The ''eco-monster'' that ate the Amalfi coast is sinking back into the sea. **********For years environmentalists have pointed to the Fuenti, a huge, ultramodern concrete hotel perched high on a rocky cliff overlooking the Mediterranean, as Italy's worst ''eco-monster,'' an eyesore that is also a particularly shameless example of abusivismo, the Italian art of illegal construction. **********The battle to demolish the hotel, which began almost as soon as the first girders went up in 1968, took 30 years and countless lawsuits, and even prompted Parliament to pass a special law to insure that the Fuenti would be razed. It is one of the most important victories for Italian environmentalists in decades. **********But it also illustrates one of the deeper complexities of conservation, Italian style. ''In Italy we have 150,000 laws,'' a lawyer said, ''and we can use them to reward our friends and punish our enemies.'' **********Despite the fierce objections of the owner, as well as local officials and residents, who hoped that the hotel would create jobs in a region troubled by high unemployment, the environmentalists won. In April bulldozers and specially built cranes began tearing at the hotel walls and concrete terraces, which are supposed to vanish by late June. **********The Environment Minister, Edo Ronchi, recently flew over the site in a helicopter to make sure demolition crews were doing just that. After that show of force, unemployed workers from Naples who had earlier occupied the site to try to block the bulldozers began passing out shards of tile, cement and faucets as souvenirs of their protest. **********The Fuenti, which was labeled one of Italy's 10 most hideous ''eco-monsters'' by Legambiente, Italy's largest conservation group, is a milestone in the organization's effort to correct architectural and zoning abuses of the postwar period. **********It is only one of hundreds of similar illegal constructions, and a drop in the bucket when set against the 20,000 to 25,000 new illegal buildings that go up every year in Italy. But the Fuenti's infamously jarring modern architectural style set on one of Italy's most picturesque coasts has made it an international cause celebre. **********''We had to win this one,'' said Michele Buonomo, a local Legambiente activist. ''The hotel had to be torn down. This is just too important a symbol.'' **********And that is exactly what infuriates opponents, who assert that the Fuenti was singled out to make a political point at the locals' expense. **********They would have preferred to remove some of the more offending parts of the hotel, disguise the rest behind lemon trees and shrubbery and put it to profitable use. **********''Let's say you have a daughter and she is really ugly,'' said Dante Mazzitelli, the owner whose father built the hotel. ''O.K., maybe you get her a nose job, a chin implant,'' he said passionately. ''But you don't kill her.'' **********Italy is a country with a widely shared sense of beauty, and esthetics plays as large a role in Italy's efforts to reclaim historic landscapes as abuses of the zoning laws. **********The charms of the seven-story, 35,000-square-foot Fuenti are perhaps more suited to downtown Riyadh than a winding coast dotted by famous fishing villages like Ravello and Positano. The Fuenti is in Vietri Sul Mare, a lovely seaside town famous for its handmade ceramic tiles and pottery. **********Asked if he considered the Fuenti ugly, the Mayor of Vietri, Cesare Marciano, shrugged. ''Let's say it is classic 60's style,'' he said. **********He long sought to delay the destruction, which he says is less a symbol of the state's power than of its underlying impotence. **********''They didn't pick Fuenti because it was the worst case,'' Mr. Marciano said. ''I can show you a hundred buildings down the coast to Positano that are as bad or worse. They chose it because they had a better chance of success here than anywhere else.'' **********Environmentalists do not disagree. Legambiente has not yet succeeded in dismantling the illegal houses built on the perimeter of the famous Greek temples of Agrigento in Sicily, or tearing down a large unfinished hotel in Cinque Terre. Throughout Italy -- particularly in the south, where organized crime is deep-rooted -- unchecked construction has contributed to landslides, flooding and lethal mudslides. **********Though it took 30 years, the razing of the Fuenti was possible in part because the hotel was never fully operational. Except for four years from 1980 to 1984, when the Government contracted with the hotel to house homeless victims of the 1980 earthquake in Irpinia, the Fuenti has remained empty. **********The Government did not have to put people out of work to tear it down. **********In 1968 the owner had a building permit, but he did what was a common practice then, and still now: he built higher and wider than his permit allowed. Italian law almost encourages such disobedience. **********Obtaining all the correct paperwork to build or remodel is a nightmarish crawl through red tape. Organized crime has perfected the short cuts, but many ordinary citizens also end up on the wrong side of the law. **********Every few years, Italy issues amnesties for illegal construction, allowing even flagrant abusers to pay a relatively small fine for their infractions. **********Many apply to pay the fine even before they begin building. In 1994 in Catania, in Sicily, there were so many requests for advance pardons that the Mayor demanded that petitioners submit a photograph of the building for which they sought amnesty. In response, arsonists burned down the archives of the city planning commission. **********''The owners of the Fuenti were unlucky,'' conceded Ermete Realacci, the president of Legambiente. ''So many people bet on their chances of getting an amnesty, or sliding past bureaucratic inertia, and win.'' **********Mr. Realacci said he hoped the razing of the Fuenti would serve as an example. So, in a way, did Mr. Mazzitelli, the owner. As he stonily watched a crane crush through the fifth story of his hotel, Mr. Mazzitelli said: ''If they want to apply the law, great. Then let justice be applied without distinctions. They should tear down half the buildings along the Amalfi coast.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/01/business/personal-business-the-other-retirement-choice.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-08-01", "snippet": "Gerontologists and other experts comment on need for middle-aged Americans to decide in advance what activities they want to pursue in retirement; note that while many are putting money aside, few are focusing on life changes as longevity increase...", "word_count": 921, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Other Retirement Choice", "print_headline": "PERSONAL BUSINESS; The Other Retirement Choice", "body_text": " **********MANY middle-aged Americans have taken to heart the advice to plan for retirement -- by socking money away in 401(k) plans, I.R.A.'s and other investments. But few have given much thought, experts say, to a long-term plan for their lives -- how they'll spend their time and energy. With longevity increasing, that can be just as important. **********''Think about life itself -- how you'll want to allocate your time and resources,'' said Dr. Margery H. Silver, a clinical instructor in psychology at Harvard University Medical School. **********''Someone who wants to start a business at age 55 will need a chunk of money,'' Dr. Silver noted, as will someone who wants to go back to school to prepare for a new career. And those who want to focus on family and volunteer work will need enough income from pensions and investments. **********Which of these life choices is best depends on the individual. The worst direction is the loneliness and inactivity often faced by those who drift into retirement with no clear agenda. ''You can't use the models of your grandfather or your fathers and mothers,'' said Dr. James E. Birren of the University of California at Los Angeles. ''They didn't have the gift of long life that we have.'' **********Dr. Birren, who founded the gerontology program at the University of Southern California in 1965, is now associate director for the Center on Aging at U.C.L.A. ''I'm 81, but I haven't learned how to spell retirement yet,'' he said. **********Jack A. Berman, 84, of Los Angeles, has reduced his work hours but enjoys an activity-filled life. A former business professor at the Chicago campus of Northwestern University, he moved to Los Angeles in 1953 and opened his own business as a manufacturers' representative in electronics, but also kept teaching others in his field. **********In 1980, Mr. Berman sold his business, but he has continued teaching, having conducted 11 seminars in Tokyo, for example, for the International Marketing Council of Japan. ''Transition is a better word than retirement, Mr. Berman said. ''You need to plan ahead so you can make the transition to something that is new and creative.'' **********Mr. Berman mentioned a friend who retired as a physician but, having also been a musician, organized a chamber orchestra. ''Others I have known have stopped working at the traditional 65 and died within five years,'' he said. ''Those who have separate interests in life are extremely fortunate.'' **********To help adults in transition think productively and to define their interests, Dr. Birren has organized classes in what he calls ''guided autobiography.'' **********He asks the participants to chart how much time they spend in 10 areas: family, friends, health and body, homemaking, career and work, money, education, religion, leisure and public service, as well as personal pursuits like travel and crafts. **********Dr. Birren, a co-author of ''Where to Go From Here: Discovering Your Own Life's Wisdom in the Second Half of Your Life'' (Simon & Schuster, 1997), advises using that list to consider where to add or cut back. **********Dr. Silver of Harvard, who also advises keeping a time diary, said the goal ''is to live your full life potential in good health,'' learning how to handle and shed stress, devoting time to exercise and proper nutrition and, most of all for those over 50, ''seeking a new infusion of ideas.'' **********MR. BERMAN seems the personification of those goals. ''It would be a terrible thing for me to wake up in the morning and wonder what I was going to do today,'' he said. But he is hardly all work and no play. **********''As we get older, it is even more important to have fun,'' he said, ''do challenging things, exercise the brain.'' Thirteen years ago, Mr. Berman, then a widower, met Pearl Brown, a widow and clinical psychologist. They married two years later -- after taking dancing lessons so they could do a head-turning waltz at the reception. **********Now they go dancing twice a week, having appeared two years ago in a dance scene in the Jack Lemmon-Walter Matthau film ''Out to Sea.'' ''I'm definitely younger than I was when I met her,'' Mr. Berman said. His wife, who still has a three-day-a-week psychology practice, water-skis on the days they are at their summer home at Lake Arrowhead, Calif. **********While such activity may be unusual in their generation, it may not be when younger generations reach their age. There are 70,000 centenarians in the country today, Dr. Silver said, but ''we know that something like three million baby boomers are going to live to be 100,'' and that the fastest-growing population group is 85 and older. **********''That has broad implications for retirement planning,'' said Dr. Silver, who with Dr. Thomas Perls wrote ''Living to 100'' (Basic Books, 1999). Such longevity, she said, may mean second or third careers. **********Edmund Aleks, 59, who retired four years ago from the Los Angeles District Attorney's office, is already on his second career,  running his own investigative service. ''It was a great job, a great department,'' he said. ''I left a happy guy.'' A good pension and a couple of lucky investments let him  strike out on his own, working as he chose. **********Citing the importance of health, he said he works out at least four times a week at the Los Angeles Athletic Club and plays racquetball with old friends from work. Most important, he has more time to talk with his son, a third-year resident in anesthesiology in San Francisco. ''I don't think any father in the world,'' he said, ''thinks he spends enough time with his son or daughter.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/01/business/lucent-in-deal-to-develop-digital-radios.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-09-01", "snippet": "Lucent Technologies Inc says its radio division will join Harman International Industries and Recoton Corp in developing radio receivers that can read digital signals; Lucent Digital Radio says it is also in talks with Pioneer Corp of Japan for si...", "word_count": 149, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lucent in Deal to Develop Digital Radios", "print_headline": "Lucent in Deal to Develop Digital Radios", "body_text": " **********Lucent Technologies Inc. said today that its radio division would join two other consumer electronic companies in developing radio receivers that can read digital signals. **********The partners are Harman International Industries and the Recoton Corporation. **********The companies plan to offer the digital-radio receivers to consumers who want higher-quality sound. **********Digital radio, as opposed to traditional analog radio, will lift FM radio broadcasts to compact-disk-quality sound and make AM broadcasts sound like the current FM. **********Lucent Digital Radio, a joint venture of Lucent Technologies and Pequot Capital Management Inc., is competing against the closely held USA Digital Radio and Digital Radio Express to establish the dominant standard for digital radio. **********Lucent Digital said it was also in talks with the Pioneer Corporation of Japan for a similar agreement to make digital receivers. **********Lucent Digital expects to have its digital receivers ready to sell to consumers by the end of next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/26/technology/news-watch-newspaper-web-sites-that-look-like-print.html": {"writer_name": "Bruce Headlam", "pub_date": "1999-08-26", "snippet": "Newzprint, new service from Infopager Technologies, downloads news from more than 30 newspapers, then reformats it into something that resembles newspaper on computer monitor, with columns, bold headlines and even illustrated thumbs holding paper ...", "word_count": 207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Newspaper Web Sites That Look Like Print", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Newspaper Web Sites That Look Like Print", "body_text": " **********Now that most newspapers regularly post at least some of their articles on the Web, an Israeli company wants to make your computer screen look more like a newspaper.

Take heart. Dog day-care centers, where dogs are left while their owners run errands, head to the office or simply clean house, are popping up all over. **********The American Board and Kennel Association estimates that of the more than 8,500 kennels nationwide, 500 specialize in day care. And that care often provides far more than a cage, a bowl of chow and a rubber ball. The centers may offer an array of amenities, from massages and baths to swimming lessons, off-leash exercise, even pedicures. **********''In today's world, we tend to think of our pets as our children,'' said Dr. Kay Cox, an animal psychologist in Phoenix. ''Leaving your dog alone for the day is just like leaving a small child alone. Dogs and children need socialization and interaction.'' **********Penelope Wong of Oakland, Calif., chief executive of an advertising agency in San Francisco, happily acknowledges spoiling Wabbi, her 9-month-old soft-coated wheaton terrier. Wabbi is enrolled at K9 to 5, an upscale center in San Francisco. **********Dog day-care, Ms. Wong said, ''is good for the mental health of the dog,  because it's incredibly lonely for a puppy to be left alone all day.'' **********K9 to 5, which offers training, grooming and walking, is so popular that it has a waiting list of more than nine months. **********Most clients come from upper-middle-class, single-dog households. ''Our customers are mostly professionals with no children,'' said Marc Helsing, owner of Downtown Dogs' Daycare in San Jose, Calif. **********Dog day-care is growing in popularity, he added, because of Americans' changing work habits. ''People don't work a standard 9-to-5 shift anymore,'' he said. ''They are out of the house more often, and sometimes they're too tired to take their dog for a walk when they come home from the office.'' **********Gary Kercher, owner of Yuppy Puppy in Troy, Ohio, said, ''Dog day-care is a place where dogs can play ball, go for a walk and build relationships with other dogs, just like a regular kids' day care.'' **********Some veterinarians aren't as enthusiastic. Dr. Charles Myer of the Dog and Cat Clinic in Leavenworth, Kan., is not convinced that dogs need such pampering. ''It's certainly not for the dog's benefit,'' he said. ''It's more for the psyche of the owner.'' **********But many dog owners swear by it. Ona Wigginton, membership coordinator at the Denver Museum of Natural History, brings her miniature dachshund, Heidi, to Big Back Yard, a dog day-care center in Denver. ''Heidi gets right in the car and knows where she's going in the morning,'' Ms. Wigginton said. ''She usually needs a couple of days' rest after being there; she just plays all day long.'' **********Americans are spending more than ever on pets -- $7 billion alone on veterinary expenses, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Thirty-eight percent of Americans own dogs, according to the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council, and in 1998, owners spent nearly $300, on average, on their pets, not counting veterinarian bills. **********DOG day-care may not be for the thin of wallet: A single visit to K9 to 5 can cost up to $40. Grooming and one-on-one interaction with a trained specialist cost more. **********To put the figures in perspective, a massage for humans at a reputable day spa in New York City costs about $80 an hour; at the New York Dog Spa and Hotel, a tony dog day-care business in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, a massage is $60 an hour. A pedicure for humans at a beauty salon runs about $30; one for the dog is $15, polish optional. **********''It can get real fancy,'' said Mr. Kercher, whose Ohio center also offers nail care. ''We have 28 colors to choose from.'' **********Many centers have a grueling admissions process. Downtown Dogs' Daycare, for example, requires owners to complete a three-page questionnaire about their dog's medical and behavioral history. **********The questionnaire serves as a character sketch that details everything from the dog's known commands to its fears. The next step is a meeting at which the dog is tested for his reaction to other dogs of varying temperaments. Dogs have been expelled from day care for fighting and other disruptive behavior. **********''We have had several dogs removed from the program,'' Mr. Helsing said in a regretful tone. ''Some dogs just aren't a good fit, unfortunately.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/business/portfolios-etc-imagining-the-dow-at-36000.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1999-09-05", "snippet": "Jonathan Fuerbringer Portfolios etc column on belief by Kevin A Hassett and James K Glassman, authors of new book Dow 36,000, that rise in Dow Jones industrials will continue speeding up; graph (M)", "word_count": 1348, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Imagining The Dow At 36,000", "print_headline": "PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; Imagining The Dow At 36,000", "body_text": " **********IS the sky the limit? **********The answer from James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett, the authors of the new book ''Dow 36,000,'' is an unqualified yes. And many investors may be too ready to agree, with the Dow Jones industrial average seemingly heading for an unprecedented fifth consecutive year of double-digit returns. **********In their analysis of why the stock market's bull run should only get faster, they sweep aside the naysayers and assert that 36,000 is a perfectly reasonable level right now for the Dow, which closed on Friday at 11,078.45. And, they say, the rest of the stock market could join it in such a takeoff. ''Stock prices could double, triple, or even quadruple tomorrow and still not be too high,'' the two write in excerpts of their book (published by Times Books) in the current issue of The Atlantic Monthly. **********Their contention raises a question that has troubled market strategists and investors since the bull market hit high gear in 1995: Is the stock market overvalued and, if it is, will it fall? **********The issue is of immense importance. The valuation of the stock market is a guidepost on which the market's best strategists depend to decide if stocks can climb higher. But valuations are hotly debated, and many of the traditional measures have been dismissed -- rightly -- as flawed during this bull market. **********Over the last several years, fear that the market was overvalued led many analysts to pare back their exposure to stocks. One who did was Charles I. Clough Jr., Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist, who just announced his retirement. **********At the same time, Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, has employed her own valuation methods to conclude the opposite -- that stocks are fairly valued and still have room to rise. **********Now, though, the Dow Duo -- Mr. Glassman is a financial columnist and Mr. Hassett is an economist -- have decided to go boldly where no man has gone before. Their assertion that the Dow could be beamed up to 36,000 makes another new book, ''Dow 40,000'' by David Elias (McGraw-Hill), look downright stick-in-the-mud. **********Mr. Elias, the president of Elias Asset Management, expects to get to 40,000, but figures that it will take until 2016. ''It will take time, patience, and wise money management by investors, corporations, and government entities before the economy and the market can support price levels of that nature,'' he writes. **********What is especially provocative is Mr. Glassman's and Mr. Hassett's view of how to value the stock market -- and how that affects the outlook for stocks. They reject the generally held Wall Street belief that the sharp swings that characterize the stock market make equities more risky than bonds. The authors contend that over the long term, stocks are no more risky than bonds, because the returns from stocks match or outdo bonds. **********Using the research of Professor Jeremy J. Siegel of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the Dow Duo point out that over the worst 20-year periods, the inflation-adjusted return for stocks was an increase of 1 percent while the worst for Treasury bonds was a decline of 3.1 percent. Looking at a wide range of returns over many years, Mr. Siegel's data indicate that the risk of owning a portfolio of stocks falls to that of bonds at around 20 years. **********Because investors are willing to pay more for less risk, Mr. Glassman and Mr. Hassett say stocks can go much higher than previously assumed before they become too pricey or overvalued. **********Investors, they contend, could be comfortable even if price-to-earnings ratios, the traditional valuation barometer for the stock market, were now nearing 100. The P/E ratios for the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are currently around 30, well over the historical average of 14 to 15. **********And while they know that the Dow really can't get to 36,000 tout de suite, they think it will be there pdq. In an interview, Mr. Glassman said he and Mr. Hassett see Dow 36,000 in three to five years -- a pace that assumes annual returns even greater than the unmatched performance of the last four and a half years. They did not inform their readers of this caution in the Atlantic excerpts, however, leaving them to think that warp-speed gains are possible. **********Wow! Three to five is still fast. If true, it means that millions of investors who missed some of the stock bonanza since 1995 still have a chance to strike it rich. **********So what should investors think? **********Clearly there is a need to look at stock market valuations in new ways. But it's not likely that even those who favor some sort of adjustment to the usual methodologies are as exuberant as Mr. Glassman and Mr. Hassett. **********In a speech late last month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, endorsed a new way to account for software investments in figuring P/E ratios. That change makes the stock market look only slightly overvalued compared with history, rather than extremely overvalued. **********But in the same speech, Mr. Greenspan sounded what could be taken as a warning about assuming that investors will always be focused enough on long-term returns to believe that stocks are no more risky than bonds, the key to the ''Dow 36,000'' theory. ''History tells us that sharp reversals in confidence happen abruptly, most often with little advance notice,'' the chairman said. ''Panic market reactions are characterized by dramatic shifts in behavior to minimize short-term losses.'' **********Ms. Cohen of Goldman has adjusted her valuation methods to bring them in line, in her view, with the way the economy works today. Lower inflation, she has argued, both improves the quality of corporate earnings and makes higher valuations less threatening. ''You have to make sure the valuation approach is meaningful,'' she said. **********Although Ms. Cohen has lowered the risk premium for stocks compared with bonds in her computer model, she has not eliminated it, as Mr. Glassman and Mr. Hassett have. And her analysis shows that the stock market is ''fairly valued'' now -- not undervalued. **********Professor Siegel of the Wharton School applauds the Duo's work but disputes the conclusions; the authors, he says, assume that all stocks can be given P/E ratios that should be reserved for Internet stocks. **********But leave this debate over P/E ratios of 100 to the experts, who will clearly disagree; that is what makes a market. There are still good -- if not new -- lessons to learn from ''Dow 36,000.'' **********What Mr. Glassman and Mr. Hassett tell you -- especially in the rest of the book -- is that being a long-term investor in stocks is smart, because it reduces the negative impact of the short-term volatility of the equity market. This is an argument Professor Siegal has been making since 1994, when the first edition of his book, ''Stocks for the Long Run,'' came out. Mr. Glassman has done the same in his columns for years. **********But the converse is also true -- and that is another lesson not to forget. If an investor has a shorter-term view, the risk of stocks rises, compared with bonds. That means that high P/E ratios become a problem much sooner. In other words, ''Dow 36,000'' and P/E ratios of 100 are not for short-term investors. **********There are reasons -- even if they are not the ones the book spends the most time on -- to think that the stock market can go higher. If the Fed can keep inflation in check and the economy growing, the market can move higher over time, even if Fed interest-rate increases cause temporary downswings. But don't bet on the Dow hitting 36,000 soon. **********''I worry,'' Mr. Glassman said in an interview, ''that people will get carried away with the notion that the Dow will be 36,000 tomorrow and assume they need to be in the market only six months to cash in. **********''The message of the book,'' he said, ''is be a long-term investor -- and that the stock market is undervalued, so you can be comfortable being a long-term investor.'' **********That's a good message. And just the kind of cautionary tone the Atlantic excerpts needed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/07/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-new-lowe-executive-is-leaving-agency.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-01-07", "snippet": "Robert Kantor, president for US operations at Lowe & Partners/SMS, is unexpectedly leaving after less than five months; circumstances of Kantor's departure are in dispute (S)", "word_count": 233, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Lowe Executive Is Leaving Agency", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; New Lowe Executive Is Leaving Agency", "body_text": " **********Robert Kantor, president for United States operations at Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, is unexpectedly leaving after less than five months. **********The circumstances of his departure from Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, are in dispute. **********Mr. Kantor, 41, joined Lowe from the New York office of Publicis, a unit of Publicis S.A., where he had been chairman and chief executive.

Rubin, the chief architect of the Clinton Administration's economic policy during one of the strongest periods of American prosperity in decades as well as financial turmoil abroad, announced today that he was resigning. **********President Clinton said he would nominate as Mr. Rubin's successor Lawrence H. Summers, currently the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. His selection was intended, White House officials said, as a clear signal to the markets that there would be continuity in both economic policy and the management of a fragile global economic system. **********Mr. Summers, a former Harvard professor, has served as the day-to-day manager of a succession of international financial crises that have rocked the global economy over the last three years. [Page C1.] **********While the stock market dropped 200 points when word circulated this morning that Mr. Rubin's departure was imminent, the Dow Jones average closed the day down only 25.78 points. **********A fiscal conservative who managed to move the Democratic Party toward a new embrace of free markets, Mr. Rubin was almost universally praised on Wall Street, Capitol Hill and in many foreign financial centers as a stabilizing influence on the financial markets and on the erratic Clinton White House. **********But in the world's emerging markets, particularly in Asia, the view is quite different. When the Asian crisis hit in 1997, many people there protested the Rubin-Summers brew of high interest rates and major cuts in Government spending that were the prerequisite for American-backed aid from the International Monetary Fund. Those policies, many in Asia argued, led to high unemployment and a more severe recession from which a number of countries are still struggling to recover. **********Moreover, some economists contend that the Treasury Department's prescription of rapid globalization of markets may have carried the seeds of many of the difficulties that emerged in Asia and elsewhere because they proceeded too fast without adequate safeguards. **********Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers -- and many outside economists -- argue that the free movement of capital encourages growth and that the formula for recovery is working. Two of the nations have bounced back rapidly, Thailand and South Korea. But Indonesia and Russia remain mired in economic chaos, for which they blame Washington's unbridled market philosophy and for which Washington blames their own political instability. **********At home, though, Mr. Rubin, 60, has been viewed as an anchor for the White House. Time and again the  President's populist political advisers clashed with Mr. Rubin on matters of tax policy and budgetary discipline. Mr. Clinton acknowledged today that whatever credibility he had with Wall Street and fiscal conservatives he owed largely to Mr. Rubin and his economic philosophy of budgetary restraint, which helped fuel the market's astounding rise. **********Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee,  who frequently clashed with Mr. Rubin on tax cuts and other issues, said: ''Of all the officials in the Clinton Administration, he has had more credibility with me, and I think with Congress, than any other official. He will certainly be missed.'' **********While Mr. Rubin's advice usually won the day in Administration policy debates, he remained insulated from the President's political travails and personal scandals. Often, from his office in the Treasury, he would gesture out the window to the East Wing of the White House and talk about the chaos ''over there,'' making it clear that he intended to keep his distance. **********''This has been a remarkable experience, but I was ready to go, ready to return to New York,'' Mr. Rubin said late this afternoon, in the dining room behind his office. He said he had ''only some very vague plans'' about what to do next, though he ruled out seeking elective office, a step many Democrats in New York had urged him to consider. **********His resignation comes as the stock market is at an all-time high and global financial turmoil appears to have waned, though perhaps only temporarily. Mr. Rubin, one senior White House official joked at the Rose Garden ceremony where Mr. Clinton lauded him, ''made his fortune selling at the top of the market.'' **********He was never one of the President's confidants, and freely said so. But he enjoyed enormous freedom within the Administration -- including the responsibility to navigate the United States through some of the scariest episodes in recent world financial history, particularly when the world financial architecture seemed on the brink of seizing up last September. **********''He built a spirit and a belief that we could actually make this economy what it ought to be for our people,'' Mr. Clinton said today in the Rose Garden ceremony, which turned into a reunion of former Clinton Administration officials who had returned to bid Mr. Rubin farewell. ''That will be his enduring achievement -- along with the fact that everybody believed as long as he was Secretary of the Treasury, nothing bad could happen.'' **********Mr. Rubin said he had the privilege to serve during a period of remarkable economic growth and praised the President for helping to balance the Federal budget and understanding the degree to which global forces were reshaping the American economy. **********Mr. Clinton was effusive in his praise of Mr. Summers, who many in the Administration had initially regarded as too brash and outspoken to become Mr. Rubin's successor. But those doubts have washed away as Mr. Summers has been groomed for the job, and today the President called him ''more than ready to steer our nation through the strong and sometimes turbulent currents of the new economy.'' **********The President also said he would nominate Stuart E. Eizenstat to succeed Mr. Summers in the No. 2 post at the Treasury. Mr. Eizenstat, who served in the Carter White House, is now Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and coordinator of the effort to force Swiss banks and other European institutions that once cooperated with Nazi Germany to compensate Holocaust victims whose assets were seized during World War II. Mr. Clinton said Mr. Eizenstat would continue to play that role in his new post. **********Mr. Rubin came to know Mr. Clinton in 1991, and soon signed on as both an adviser and fund-raiser for the 1992 Presidential campaign. His first post was as head of a newly created institution, the National Economic Council, which he used to arbitrate among the conflicting voices in the Administration -- and to battle with political advisers who wanted to spend billions of dollars in new Federal money on a variety of social programs to fulfill campaign promises. Mr. Rubin insisted that deficit reduction must come first, provoking a fierce struggle for the President's mind that he ultimately won. **********Paul Begala, a campaign adviser, warned in early 1993 that Mr. Rubin's conservative fiscal approach might reduce the deficit and win the respect of Wall Street, but it would be politically devastating for Mr. Clinton among traditional Democratic voters. **********''Rubin was right, but I was right, too,'' Mr. Begala said today. The economy soared -- and the Democrats lost control of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years. **********''It became a standing joke between us,'' Mr. Begala said. ''He was just a lot happier about it.'' **********In early 1995, Mr. Rubin became Treasury Secretary -- and was immediately propelled into a crisis. The Mexican peso collapsed, and many feared an economic disaster there would spill over America's southern border and perhaps inflame the rest of Latin America. Congress refused to back a bailout, so Mr. Rubin persuaded the President that he had to act on his own authority, ultimately lending $12 billion to Mexico from an obscure exchange-rate fund under the Treasury's control. It was a high-risk gamble that ultimately paid off; Mexico has largely recovered, and its reforms, part of the deal, helped inoculate it from the financial earthquake to come. **********Mr. Rubin's dominance of the Mexico debate accelerated the shift of foreign policy-making to the Treasury from the State Department. In some ways that transition seemed natural in a post-cold war world driven as much by the rapid movement of capital as by the traditional balance of military power. But it led to many internal conflicts, in places as far-ranging as Indonesia and Russia, where America's diplomatic interests and its economic interests often diverged. **********Mr. Rubin was cautious about committing American funds, perhaps too cautious in the case of Thailand, the first Asian country hit by what became known as the ''Asian contagion.'' To this day, Thais chafe at the fact that the Treasury refused to come to their aid. There were constant arguments over how to help Russia, and how fiercely to publicly criticize a longtime ally, Japan. **********In all these arguments the Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, often seemed to steer clear of entanglements with Mr. Rubin -- perhaps calculating that she would not win. But some State department officials argue that the Treasury's growing powers led to a bias toward a market-driven foreign policy. And many critics argue that Mr. Rubin was too cautious in containing the power of markets after the Asian crisis. **********The nation's domestic economic performance will also be part of his legacy, resulting both from his early demand for fiscal caution and from extraordinary good luck. When Mr. Clinton took office, domestic unemployment was at 6.9 percent, the nation's budget deficit was at $255 billion and the Dow Jones industrial average was below 4,000 points. **********Unemployment now stands at 4.3 percent, the nation will have a budget surplus estimated at $79 billion this year and the market recently topped 11,000 for the first time, creating a huge pool of new wealth for tens of millions of Americans. **********In part, Mr. Rubin's power emanated from an uncanny ability to disarm, matched with an unexpected talent for political manipulation. After the shutdown of the Government in 1995, he spent months fencing with a Republican majority that threatened not to increase the debt limit -- the Treasury's authority to borrow. For a while it seemed as if the United States might actually default on some debt payments, a prospect Mr. Rubin deftly put on the shoulders of the Republicans. They backed down. **********There were constant struggles over the budget: Republicans in Congress and members of the White House wanted to cut taxes while Mr. Rubin wanted to concentrate on eliminating the budget deficit and paying down the national debt. J. Dennis Hastert, the Speaker of the House, noted today that ''Secretary Rubin and I disagreed on many things, mainly the importance tax cuts play in keeping our economy growing.'' **********''But,'' he added, ''we also agreed on many things, and he generally did his best to keep the more liberal elements of the Clinton-Gore Administration in check.'' **********But Mr. Rubin's biggest challenge was to grapple with the forces of the global economy and the risks that they posed to the United States and the markets that were his world. His strategizing on this subject often came at a weekly breakfast and occasional dinner with the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Mr. Summers. **********This afternoon Mr. Rubin recalled one of those dinners, in December 1997, when South Korea appeared on the verge of default and many wondered whether its collapse would damage much of Japan and the rest of Asia. ''It was one of the scariest moments,'' Mr. Rubin said, describing how a plan was put together to get the world's major banks to keep South Korea whole. **********Mr. Greenspan, never particularly effusive about anything, said of Mr. Rubin today, ''He has been one of the most effective Secretaries of the Treasury in this nation's history.'' And he praised Mr. Summers as ''a person of extraordinary talent and judgment, who will continue the important work Bob Rubin initiated.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/05/business/the-markets-bonds-treasury-prices-move-little-as-investors-await-jobs-data.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1999-03-05", "snippet": "US Treasury securities are little changed; price of benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slips 2/32, to 93 21/32; its yield is unchanged at 5.69 percent; graph on tax-exempt yields; chart on US key interest rates (M)", "word_count": 485, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Prices Move Little As Investors Await Jobs Data", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: BONDS; Treasury Prices Move Little As Investors Await Jobs Data", "body_text": " **********Treasury securities were little changed yesterday, as anxious investors awaited the release of the Government's monthly jobs data today. **********The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped 2/32 , to 93 21/32 .

Three inventors have patented a system that allows those who haven't made the leap from printed paper to computer screens to receive digital data on their televisions simply by turning the pages of a book, newspaper or magazine. **********Spencer Rathus and Lois Fichner-Rathus, both from Short Hills, N.J., and Jeffrey Nevid of New York, figured that just about everyone peruses books, magazines and catalogues. Many goods, services, companies and organizations that now appear on Web sites are also featured in print advertisements and articles. So the three inventors decided that the computer-reluctant public ought to be able to simply touch an icon printed on those pages and access World Wide Web sites, data bases and software. The icon contains a sensor that sends a message requesting data from a remote server. **********In this country, computer use continues to spread among adults, and an argument can be made that an entire generation of children exposed to computers at school, home and game arcades will not shun them later in life. But the Rathuses and Mr. Nevid believe that plenty of people will continue to be stymied by computers ''despite significant advances in user-interface technology such as mouses, windows, menus and the like.'' **********''Indeed, it is clear that the number of programming choices available to the user of such technology will be far greater than the number of choices involved in programming a VCR, a task already demonstrated to be too complicated for the average user of present-day user-interface technology,'' they write in their patent application. **********The printed icon containing the sensor also holds a transmitter. The sensor is activated by the turn of a page, tap of a finger or pass of a pointer or mouse-style device. The transmitter then sends a coded signal that identifies the icon to a microprocessor. The microprocessor in turn forwards a command to a remote video server. The inventors allow for many ways of accomplishing this last link -- the command might travel via telephone, cable, modem, satellite, cellular, microwave or infrared connections. The form chosen depends on the bandwidth necessary to send the reply data. The server sends the requested digital data to the user's television or other monitor. **********The patent also covers use of a scanner that could read bar codes or magnetic strips on a page and send a similar coded signal to the microprocessor. **********The inventors say that people who shop through catalogues could join the world of electronic commerce with their system. Instead of gaining access to a retail Web site, a buyer could press sensors embedded in a catalogue and prompt the retailer's remote server to send sales information to the buyer's TV, call the customer or process an order. They also believe textbooks and other instructional publications like cookbooks or manuals could come with sensors that would link readers to data bases or tutorials. **********The inventors say users would pay for the data either by volume, like on-line service providers do now, or according to the type of material requested, like cable television pay-per-view programming.

But it does cause at least one complication: how to carry an assortment that might include a cellular telephone, a personal organizer, a beeper and other hardware. Not everyone wants to take a purse or briefcase everywhere they go. Pockets are one answer, but not all garments have the right size pockets in convenient places. **********Thus, Jeffrey Richards offers his portable pocket. Mr. Richards, an inventor from Las Vegas, Nev., has patented a pocket that can be added to any piece of clothing, moved or removed completely, without altering the clothes with adhesive or hook and loop fasteners like Velcro. **********The pocket attaches to a base plate made of metal, rubber or plastic, which in turn is affixed to a flat back plate. The back plate is designed to be inserted under a garment, and the pocket base plate rests on the outside of the garment. The fabric is sandwiched between the two plates. The plates have attachment points and are held in place with multiple pins, snaps or magnets, and a spring-loaded sliding lock so they don't move. **********The pocket -- which can have a flap, a zipper or hang open -- hides the base. The back plate is adjustable to accommodate different thicknesses of fabric.

Rubin, expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Barak's interest in the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon, saying, ''We want to close the circle of peace in the Middle East and we want to do it expeditiously.'' **********Many experts on the Middle East agree that the opportunities for a  settlement are better than they have been. But some caution that the Administration, in its eagerness for a deal between Israel and Syria, may be giving short shrift to working out security arrangements with President Hafez al-Assad. **********''Assad is willing to get the Golan Heights back, but what is he willing to pay for that?'' in terms of the depth of the withdrawal of the Syrian army and other strategic arrangements, asked Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Studies. **********Mr. Barak has also demonstrated that he intends to live up to his reputation of being his own man. Just before leaving for Washington, Mr. Barak said he wanted the United States to play a reduced role in the Israeli- Palestinian relationship. He singled out what he said was the overly intrusive role of the Central Intelligence Agency in monitoring security in the Gaza Strip, a task assigned at the American-brokered land-for-security deal in the fall in Wye, Md. **********Administration officials insisted today that Mr. Barak's criticism was not unexpected, although the bluntness of its delivery on the eve of his visit appeared to set some in the Administration on edge. The officials said the American involvement in the intricacies of enforcing agreements between the Israelis and the Palestinians was a product of the poor relationship between Mr. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat. The intrusion could be easily adjusted in the new atmosphere, officials said. **********The high anticipation for Mr. Barak is framed in part by the historic goals that he has set and by what one senior Administration official called the new leader's desire ''to break the mold.'' **********Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Barak was prepared, the official said, to persuade the Israeli public that it should swallow ''two wrenching, traumatic decisions,'' on the shape of a Palestinian entity and an accord with Syria, that would determine the future of Israel. **********Senior Administration officials are also intrigued by the man himself,  whom they do not know well. But they have some glimmers. **********One of Mr. Clinton's advisers on the Middle East who knows Mr. Barak from his days as head of Israeli military intelligence and then as army chief of staff, said the Administration held few illusions about the peace that he was seeking. ''This is a man who is tough, curious and also wants to make peace for his soldiers,'' the adviser said. **********Mr. Barak and Mr. Clinton are scheduled to meet alone for three hours Thursday afternoon at the White House residence, without aides or a note-taker, according to Administration officials. At the meeting, the President expects to learn how Mr. Barak wants to proceed with negotiations, his advisers said. One important question will be the timetable that Mr. Barak envisions and how the two leaders can mesh their expectations. **********In his election campaign, Mr. Barak told voters that he wanted to  have Israeli soldiers out of southern Lebanon in a year, a pledge that proved popular. Moving the soldiers out of southern Lebanon is wrapped into the overall negotiations with Mr. Assad. **********The Syrian leader has said two times since Mr. Barak's election that he is prepared to enter into talks with the Israelis, and his foreign ministry said recently a settlement could be completed in ''a matter of months.'' **********In letter to Mr. Arafat in May, Mr. Clinton set a one-year target for what are known as final status negotiations on security, territory and the disposition of Jerusalem. Mr. Clinton also wrote that the United States was prepared within six months after the Israeli elections to convene a summit meeting for those negotiations. **********Mr. Barak is expected to lay out his ideas on the putting into effect the Wye memorandum, which the Clinton Administration is eager to see fulfilled but which Mr. Barak has indicated may need a slower pace. **********In tune with Mr. Barak's insistence that the United States step back from the Palestian-Israeli negotiations, a State Department official said Mr. Clinton was highly likely to tell Mr. Barak that Washington would be on hand to diminish the pain of tough decisions. **********For Mr. Barak, the five-day visit also entails meeting American Jewish organizations and Congress. He is spending less time with both than some would like. Mr. Netanyahu courted the two constituencies. In contrast, Mr. Barak's schedule appears to show polite deference. **********He will meet with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the major lobbying organization here, and in New York with the Israel Policy Forum, a more liberal group, and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. **********Mr. Barak will stay at Blair House. He and his wife, Nava, are to be whisked on Thursday night to Camp David for dinner with Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. On Sunday night, 400 people have been invited to a White House dinner, a signal that after Mr. Netanyahu, the relationship between Mr. Clinton and the Israeli Prime Minister is back on track, White House aides said. **********Mr. Barak is scheduled to meet the Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, as well as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, and the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger. **********One outcome of Mr. Barak's visit is expected to be a visit by Ms. Albright to the Middle East next month. ''This is going to fly,'' a senior Administration official said.

The Chancellor's Social Democratic Party has been hammered in a series of state and municipal elections. **********In a blistering commentary, the influential center-right newspaper Die Welt said today that Mr. Schroder's ''Berlin Republic'' was directionless. ''The motto of the mambo Chancellor is two steps forward, one step back -- or vice versa,'' it said. **********Die Welt is no friend of the Social Democrats, but the view is widespread that Mr. Schroder's first year in office has been largely squandered because of internal conflicts in his Red-Green coalition and his apparent difficulties in deciding whether his most important constituency is big business or the working class. **********Businesses have applauded Mr. Schroder's plans to reduce the size of the state -- which accounts for close to 50 percent of the country's economic activity -- through budget cuts of about $16.6 billion, affecting almost all departments. The plan, which is before Parliament, also calls for a freeze on pensions and a tight hold on wage increases. **********But public employees -- including teachers, police officers and Government agency workers -- have been alarmed and angered, prompting today's demonstration. **********''Schroder, go home,'' one banner said in English, expressing the disenchantment of many Social Democratics with what they see as a Chancellor who has betrayed his party's roots.

Their resistance to the austerity program appears to have left Mr. Schroder unsure of whether he can garner enough new votes in the center to compensate for the loss of traditional supporters. **********Mr. Schroder said today that he would not change course. ''The Government will not change its policies,'' he insisted. ''The slow growth of salaries is part of the belt-tightening package.'' **********But, prodded by aides who are alarmed by the slump in his support, the Chancellor has appeared to wobble. He seems determined to woo the left once more, or at least to damp the anger of a substantial wing of his party. **********He has agreed to a study a proposal from Germany's largest union, IG Metall, that would lower the age at which a worker can retire to 60 and thus, in the union's view, help create jobs. It is not clear how such an idea can be squared with Mr. Schroder's insistence that pension payments must be capped. **********''Those who are living longer cannot retire earlier,'' said Wolfgang Schauble, the leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party. ''This idea is absurd.'' **********IG Metall has said earlier retirement could be financed by payments from workers into a special fund. The Chancellor now says that if such revenue can indeed be found, early retirement may be helpful in tackling Germany's 10 percent unemployment rate. **********He has also agreed to submit a wealth tax proposal to a Social Democratic Party convention in December. It is extremely unlikely that such an idea, or anything like it, would ever become law. But Mr. Schroder's indecisiveness over the wealth tax appears to reveal once more his profound uncertainty over what Germany's Social Democracy now stands for."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/business/investing-with-edward-p-owens-vanguard-health-care-fund.html": {"writer_name": "Carole Gould", "pub_date": "1999-09-12", "snippet": "Investing With column offers investing advice from Vanguard Health Care fund manager Edward P Owens; graph; photo (M)", "word_count": 966, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING WITH: Edward P.

The Standard & Poor's health care composite index fell 20.4 percent from its peak in mid-April through early August. **********But more than a few pockets of strength remain. ''The selloff was concentrated in big-cap stocks that had done well for many years,'' said Edward P. Owens, who runs the $10.65 billion Vanguard Health Care fund. ''The biotechnology and Japanese drug sectors have been strong through the year.'' **********Looking ahead, he sees health care stocks tracking the general market. ''It's pretty unlikely that the 30-plus percent gains of the last four years will continue,'' Mr. Owens said from his office overlooking Quincy Market in Boston, where he is senior vice president at Wellington Management, a money management firm. **********The best values may be found in a hard-hit group -- health care services stocks, like drugstore chains, pharmaceutical distributors and hospitals. ''Health care services has been left far behind,'' he said, ''and probably will be the best-performing part of the health care sector over the next three or four years.'' **********The fund has managed to stay in positive territory this year, returning 6.7 percent through Sept. 3, compared with 6.0 percent for the average specialized health care fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, and 0.25 percent for the S.& P. health care index. For the three years ended Sept. 3, the fund returned 28.7 percent, annualized, versus 16.9 percent for its peers, according to Morningstar, and 32.5 percent for the index. **********Vanguard closed the fund to new investors in February, when it hit $10 billion in assets, and has no plans to reopen it, a company spokesman, John Demming, said. **********Mr. Owens takes a measured approach to health care investing. ''I'm a very conservative, fundamentally oriented investor with a value approach to a growth sector of the economy,'' he said. The fund also maintains an unusually low turnover rate of 11 percent, far below that of the average health care fund. **********Mr. Owens checks a computer program that shows relative valuation, price movement and other characteristics of 1,600 health care companies worldwide, but usually concentrates on corporate developments. **********''I spend most of my time studying medical and trade journals and analyst reports,'' he said. ''I don't have any hard 'sell' or 'buy' points.'' **********And Mr. Owens asks many questions of companies' management. He meets with executives of three or four companies in his office each day, travels to others and sees 15 to 20 companies a day at four or five annual health care conferences. One focus is on research and development. ''The drug pipeline is a leading indicator of changes in growth rates,'' he said. ''You can see a company improving ahead of everything else if you see a pipeline that's big relative to the company's size.'' **********He is not wedded to a particular measurement of value and looks at factors ranging from balance-sheet strength to price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow ratios. **********ABOUT 21 percent of the fund is invested overseas, the high end of its historical range, including 9 percent in Japan, the highest level ever. ''In the last three or four years, the Japanese F.D.A. tightened drug approval procedures and created a major slowdown in drug approvals,'' Mr. Owens said, referring to the Japanese equivalent of the United States Food and Drug Administration. ''They're coming out of that now, and approvals will start to increase.'' **********He bought Eisai, a Japanese drug company, in late 1998 and early 1999 at an average cost of $16 a share.  ''We think the pipeline will allow it to become a global pharmaceutical firm over the next decade,'' he said.  Eisai brought to market Aricept, the first effective palliative for Alzheimer's, marketed with Pfizer, and has launched a new ulcer drug, Aciphex, marketed worldwide by Johnson & Johnson, he said. He expects annual earnings growth of 15 percent over the next three years. On Friday, the stock closed at 2,585 yen, or $23.7505, 33.9 times his 2000 earnings estimate of 70 cents a share. **********In April, Mr. Owens increased fivefold his position in McKesson HBOC, the drug distributor based in San Francisco. McKesson's purchase in January of HBO, a health care information company, was a ''disaster,'' he said, because financial results had to be restated as a result of accounting irregularities at HBO. That led to a big charge as well as the ouster of some top executives and pulled McKesson's price down to $32 a share by the end of April, from a high of $89.75 in January. **********But he said that McKesson's distribution business is sound, and that, despite the problems, HBO remains a leading provider of health care information technology. ''We think the reaction to the bad news was excessive, and over the next year or two the correct valuation will surface,'' he said, adding that he expected the share price to rise 30 to 50 percent in two years. **********He estimates an earnings growth rate of 30 percent a year over three years. The stock is now at $34.125, 19 times his 2000 earnings estimate. **********Mr. Owens recently added to his position in Monsanto, whose Searle division produces Celebrex, the first of a new class of arthritis drugs. ''I think success with this drug will make them one of the better-performing drug companies over the next two years or so,'' he said. The company's agricultural division, which does work in genetics, is a worry for investors because of opposition to genetic engineering of crops.  ''We think the value of the stock is supported by the pharmaceutical division alone,'' he said. **********He estimated annual earnings growth of 25 percent over three years.

Just after midnight, Mr. Thaci, the political leader of the rebel army, left the headquarters of the NATO peacekeeping force for an hour. An aide said he had consulted field commanders and returned intending to sign the agreement with General Jackson. **********Under a postwar accord reached in June with NATO, the Kosovo Liberation Army undertook to demilitarize within 90 days, hand in its weapons, and discard uniforms and insignia. In return, its commanders were promised an alternative force, originally described as a national guard, and now being called a civil emergency service. **********Gen. Agim Ceku, chief of staff of the rebel army, was expected to sign a declaration confirming the demilitarization of his force midmorning Sunday, but suddenly delayed that until the midnight deadline, which ticked away with neither his declaration nor the overall agreement being made public. The announcement of a new civilian force, tentatively named the Kosovo Corps, was to follow later today. **********The issues that have dogged the final negotiations appear to be substantial. According to Lieut. Col. Robin Clifford, spokesman for the commander of the NATO-led peacekeeping force, they include the exact number of weapons the new force will have, the selection procedure for members and even the force's name. The rebels' leaders are insisting on a name in Albanian that is closer to the concept of an army than the English word corps, according to a diplomat close to the negotiations. **********Disputes over the exact number of guns to be retained by members of the Kosovo Corps, and the number of weapons to be kept under NATO's lock and key, proved the final stumbling block, sources close to the talks said. **********The 5,000-member Kosovo Corps will be allowed some 200 weapons, mostly handguns for personal protection, and to guard sites and equipment. Individuals in Kosovo are also allowed to apply for permission to carry a firearm for personal protection and that provision appears to be  the wrangle. **********The 9,000 men of the rebel army face several choices now. They can go into the Kosovo Corps, which is said to be aimed at coping with civil emergencies like floods, mountain rescues and earthquakes. Or they can apply and train for the Kosovo police service, which will include some 4,000 members within two years. Others still can look for help from foreign advisers sent here to organize job training and to reintegrate former fighters into society. **********The selection procedure for the civilian corps is to be overseen by the United Nations, a point that has increased the irritation openly voiced by rebel army leaders like Mr. Thaci about the United Nations administration of the province. The former guerrilla fighters are unhappy that they apparently will have little say in the recruitment process. **********Such issues are emblematic of the tough negotiations that have been necessary even to get to the signing of the agreement. Just three months after Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo, the Kosovo Liberation Army, which grew into a full-fledged force after open rebellion erupted against the Serbs last year, remains obsessed with retaining a defensive capability of its own. Its leaders, some of whom say they are going to search for a political role in Kosovo but are still more men of action than words, are describing the new force as a part of Kosovo's future army. **********The NATO-led peacekeepers and the United Nations mission, meanwhile, are set on dismantling the guerrilla army, while recognizing that, in order to maintain cooperation with the former rebels, they must allow them a civilian force. **********In an interview last weekend, General Jackson admitted that the rebel army would never have agreed to disarm without the paragraph offering them a national guard. ''Without that, they would not have signed the undertaking,'' he said. **********So far, General Jackson's peacekeepers have succeeded in getting the leaders of the former guerrilla force to accept demilitarization. But the United Nations mission, which now takes over responsibility for the new civilian force and negotiation with the political leadership, is almost guaranteed a bumpy ride. **********A sign of the trouble ahead came with comments made by Mr. Thaci, who is introduced by aides as the head of the provisional government in Kosovo, during a visit to the United Nations headquarters in New York last week. He sharply criticized the United Nations special representative in Kosovo, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, for not consulting the local leaders enough. **********Mr. Thaci returned from New York to attend what was billed as the rebels' final parade through the streets of Pristina on Saturday. It was an impressive display of force, with several hundred men in uniform marching behind General Ceku and his top commanders through the city to the football stadium, where they joined hundreds more fighters in front of a jubilant crowd of 50,000, feting the men who style themselves as the liberators of Kosovo's Albanians after what Albanians call decades of Serbian repression. **********The speeches were short but strongly worded. ''There are a lot of problems ahead,'' General Ceku told the fighters on parade. ''The K.L.A. is transforming as the international community asked, and together with them we will build a new defense phase. Now we have to convince everybody that we can do our job in peacetime.'' **********He added, ''But if our freedom is ever threatened, you can be sure we will be here.'' **********Mr. Thaci spoke in the same vein. ''The liberation mission of the K.L.A. is ended; there is a new mission ahead,'' he said. Of the new force, he said, ''It will be a defense force for all citizens of Kosovo.'' **********Mr. Thaci addressed the key political issues that remain unsolved for the Kosovo Albanians, namely the division of the northern city of Mitrovica, continued Serbian threats to re-enter the province, and the detention of thousands of Albanians from Kosovo in Serbian prisons. **********Many of the commanders and ordinary soldiers of the rebel army  seem to accept the plans for demilitarization and transformation, but are not ready to disband totally. **********There are some signs that the Kosovo Liberation Army is splintering. While some officers and men say they plan to join the Kosovo Corps, some fighters and commanders are vowing to continue an underground existence. One NATO official said that ''anything between a few and the majority of K.L.A. commanders'' are intent on keeping some part of the rebel army intact as a military force, although it was not clear if this would be any kind of organized body, or very small groups of individuals."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/15/business/us-drops-a-joint-venture-for-internet-access-to-its-data.html": {"writer_name": "Jeri Clausing", "pub_date": "1999-06-15", "snippet": "Commerce Department has officially pulled out of partnership with Northern Light Technology after project raises concerns about fee-based access to Government documents; service, which was designed to let paying customers find Government informati...", "word_count": 361, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Drops a Joint Venture For Internet Access to Its Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Drops a Joint Venture For Internet Access to Its Data", "body_text": " **********The Commerce Department has officially pulled out of an Internet partnership with a private company after the project raised concerns about fee-based access to Government documents. **********The service, which was designed to let paying customers find Government information on the Internet quickly and easily, was officially started today, but as a strictly private venture. **********The Commerce Department's National Technical Information Service had planned to begin the service last month with the private company, Northern Light Technology, but the venture was held up after critics questioned whether it contradicted the Clinton Administration's pledge to make the Internet and Government information more accessible. **********So while top-level Commerce officials who had been unaware of the partnership investigated the matter, Northern Light began offering free trials of the search service. **********The lack of Government participation in the venture will not constrain what is offered through the service, since it searches publicly available data bases and no license is required.

Yet he is deliberately fighting on several fronts at once, using an atmosphere of crisis  to exert his personal authority in new ways. **********Faced with an exceedingly difficult political challenge from Taiwan, where President Lee Tung-hui seems to be spoiling Beijing's dream of reunification, Mr. Jiang is not retreating, but is rather taking the offensive. **********At the same time that he threatens force against Taiwan, Mr. Jiang is conducting twin political campaigns: one against Falun Gong, the spiritual movement that was outlawed last month, and the other against laxness in the Communist Party apparatus. **********Today, state media reported a major policy address by Mr. Jiang, his first since the leadership emerged from an annual summer conclave at the seaside report of Beidaihe. Mr. Jiang spoke not about Taiwan or Falun Gong, or even about Communist Party discipline. Instead, he ventured into a fourth area where he would like to make a personal imprint: economic reform. **********Why juggle so many balls in the air at one time? With the Taiwan issue virtually unsolvable, political experts here say, Mr. Jiang is taking the offensive in other areas to extend and strengthen his authority in case Taiwan does not turn out well. **********''October 1 is the key date,'' a political analyst in Beijing said, referring to the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule, an occasion for an enormous political pageant. ''Jiang is reacting to events, but he is also asserting himself in a way that makes him the unquestioned leader at an important time.'' **********Each year, when China's leaders conclude their highly secretive summer conclave, experts look for clues to what was decided, and characteristically come up with little. While many guess at whether moderates or conservatives scored more points, all appearances this year point to a stronger hand for Mr. Jiang, who likes to portray himself as being simultaneously in the middle and above it all. **********On Monday, political experts in Beijing were surprised by a headline that streamed across the top of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece: ''Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin Discuss Materialism and Atheism.'' **********That might sound like so much Communist Party drivel to an outsider, but party historians doubtless noted the milestone. It was the first time that the newspaper had placed Mr. Jiang on an even stage with Mao and Deng, each considered giants of China's revolutionary struggle, and the timing of such a grand assertion can hardly be coincidental. **********When Deng passed ultimate control of China's leadership to Mr. Jiang in the early 1990's, Mr. Jiang chose Taiwan as one of the main issues that would define his leadership. The goal of reunifying Taiwan with mainland China had been beyond the grasp of Mao and Deng, and this was clearly an issue where Mr. Jiang could distinguish himself. **********Mr. Jiang chose his trusted mentor, the former Shanghai Mayor Wang Daohan, to open negotiations with Taiwan. Mr. Wang, a flexible and creative politician, began talks with a Taiwan counterpart in 1993. **********Yet Taiwan has proved more difficult than Mr. Jiang seemed to expect. President Lee rebuffed repeated attempts to give the talks substance, and then shocked Beijing in July this year by asserting that Taiwan would now see China in a ''special state-to-state relationship,'' discarding the earlier framework that saw the two as part of one conceptual nation. **********Seeing Mr. Lee's move as an possibly irreparable step away from reunification, Mr. Jiang now faces an excruciating dilemma. Acquiescing to Mr. Lee's action opens Mr. Jiang to attack from hawkish critics that he is losing Taiwan. Yet taking military action risks the great humiliation that would come from an effective counterattack by Taiwan's forces, and from drawing United States forces to Taiwan's defense. **********A major element of Mr. Jiang's leadership has been to bring China into closer cooperation with the United States, China's biggest trading partner. That stance could be ruined by a conflict with Taiwan. **********Chinese officials recently warned Washington that they may be forced to ''punish'' Taiwan with some kind of military strike, a message that China's media have been trumpeting for weeks, apparently in the hope that Washington might force Mr. Lee to retract his stance. Yet Mr. Lee shows no sign of retreating. **********Mr. Jiang may try to muddle through a middle ground, making a limited military move that satisfies China's hawks, without causing the disruption that would come from an all-out war. Yet on such a delicate issue, mixing the potentially explosive matters of sovereignty and military might, the situation is highly unpredictable. **********Another plank of Mr. Jiang's leadership is economic growth, which many experts believe is crucial to maintaining the acceptance of Communist Party rule by restive workers in urban areas, where unemployment is growing fast. Economic growth could also be severely damaged by any military action. **********In today's policy address, Mr. Jiang seemed to try to steer a middle course, stressing the need for economic growth while being vigilant on military issues. **********''Competitiveness in our overall national strength is increasingly a decisive factor in shaping a country's fate,'' Mr. Jiang said. ''We are on the verge of a new and rare opportunity, but at the same time we face grave new challenges. **********''Only by unceasingly enhancing our economic strength, defensive strength and national cohesiveness can we establish an unbeatable position in international competition that grows more intense each day, and effectively protect our national sovereignty and national dignity.'' **********Until recently, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji was seen to be in charge of  China's economic reform program. Yet Mr. Zhu's position appears to have been weakened after his trip in April to the United States, where he was accused by conservative rivals of having offered too many concessions to try to win China's entry to the World Trade Organization. **********On Thursday, appearing at an international horticultural exhibition in Kunming, in China's southwest, Mr. Zhu denied reports that he might resign. Yet while other leaders met at Beidaihe, he was pictured prominently in the media as he inspected flood waters in central China. **********Mr. Zhu was also conspicuously absent from the stage in northeast China where Mr. Jiang delivered his policy address on economic reform, where several other leading officials did appear. Instead, Mr. Zhu was pictured in today's media at the horticultural exhibition. **********Although Mr. Zhu does not appear to have been completely sidelined, his authority over economic reform seems to have been curtailed. That paves the way for a greater hand in economic reform for Mr. Jiang. **********Some Chinese experts believe that Mr. Jiang opened the campaign against Falun Gong 10 days after the Taiwan crisis erupted in order to engage in an easily winnable political movement to draw attention away from a more difficult one. **********Yet Mr. Jiang appears to have detected in Falun Gong a genuine threat to the Communist Party's role as the undisputed power in the nation, and also saw an opportunity to mobilize the Communist Party apparatus behind him as Falun Gong is stamped out. **********Meantime, China's official bluster about Taiwan continues. One newspaper, the China Business Times, devoted its front page on Thursday to an analysis of potential military conflict, confidently predicting that Taiwan forces would not be able to withstand an onslaught from the mainland for more than four or five days. **********Military experts say, however, that the Chinese Army is woefully inequipped for an amphibious assault on Taiwan. That may be why, during the last crisis in 1996, China lobbed a few missiles into the ocean near Taiwan, talking tough as it took essentially harmless action. **********Limited military action is still possible, military experts say, like the seizing of one of the small islands that Taiwan controls, even though they hug the coast of China. But tough-sounding threats from Beijing have been part of official policy for 50 years, during which China has yet to actually move on Taiwan."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/business/business-diary-the-engine-can-search-but-can-it-really-dance.html": {"writer_name": "Patrick Lyons", "pub_date": "1999-09-12", "snippet": "David Emanuel, spokesman for Internet search engine Alta Vista, says new ads featuring inquiries in conversational English were not meant to be taken literally (S)", "word_count": 307, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Engine Can Search, But Can It Really Dance?", "print_headline": "BUSINESS: DIARY; The Engine Can Search, But Can It Really Dance?", "body_text": " **********Alta Vista, the Internet search engine majority-owned by CMGI Inc., is running ads -- its first -- in magazines like Business Week.

Down a hallway of administrative offices, several doors feature bumper stickers crowing ''I Love Wood.'' **********Steinway is a company devoutly committed to the craft of woodworking. Many of its 600 employees arrived at the factory as teen-agers, and in the course of their tenures there -- some decades long -- have become masters at molding, chiseling, shaping and bending some of a Steinway grand piano's 12,000 parts. **********Steinway calls each piano it builds ''a handmade work of art,'' and the number of instruments it produces each year (2,500 grands and 500 uprights) remains more or less unchanged from 100 years ago. In fact, much of the sprawling, 440,000-square-foot factory looks as it might have 100 years ago. During a recent midmorning break, a worker napped, sprawled across a cast-iron veneer-cutting machine whose latticework reveals its industrial-age origins, though it is still used today. The sun streamed down through skylights onto hardwood floors that would be wildly out of place in many a modern factory. Yet little by little, technology has been wending its way onto the factory floor, helping the woodworkers do their jobs -- not necessarily  faster, but certainly more efficiently and with greater precision. **********Although most parts are still assembled by hand, computer-run climate control rooms, chip-driven multipurpose machines and three-dimensional measuring arms are also entering the process. **********''We're not at the point where we're pulling switches and watching parts come out the other end,'' said Bruce Stevens, Steinway's president and chief executive. ''It still takes us a year to craft one of these things. But technology is assisting us in making more precise parts that our people can assemble. It's helping us create a better instrument.'' **********The ultimate consumers -- the players and the listeners -- may notice these innovations in small ways; whether the changes have made a difference in how Steinway pianos sound and feel to the touch is debatable. Although many artists and technicians say that Steinway pianos are built more solidly and reliably now than in years past, some say that increased reliability has led to a slight drop in the number of quirks that make each piano unique. **********''I think they're getting better,'' said the pianist Emanuel Ax, who has been playing almost exclusively on Steinway concert grands for more than 25 years. ''The best Steinways have always been pretty fabulous, but for a time there you were finding one good one in a number of not so good ones. Now there's a lot less variability between pianos. There are still differences in sound quality -- some are brighter, some are not as bright -- but they're all a notch better than they were.'' **********Mr. Stevens said the company was achieving a balance between handicraft and technology-driven processes. ''But we're careful not to sacrifice the quality of our instrument for the expediency of modern technology,'' he added. **********A Steinway grand piano is 85 percent wood. Each temperamental piece requires long periods of time to dry in warm, dark rooms, or it will become too ''stressed'' to work with. **********Whether it is hard rock maple, Alaskan sitka spruce or East Indian rosewood, all of Steinway's raw lumber is dried to a moisture level of 6 percent to make it suitable for building. A 6 percent moisture level insures that the final product, whether it resides in  Florida or New York, won't warp, blister or splinter because of stresses in the wood. For the last several years the company been developing new ways to tightly control the drying process with computers. **********When a load of 30,000 board feet of hard rock maple arrives from a Vermont sawmill, for example, it is air-dried under sheets of clear plastic in a lumberyard for several months, in a process little changed by technology. The wood then goes inside a large kiln, where a combination of steam, temperature and ventilation systems continues the slow drying process. **********At that point, computer-driven machinery enters the picture. The drying kiln is controlled by a programmable logic controller, or P.L.C., located in a room adjacent to the kiln. The controller makes automatic adjustments to the temperature and humidity in the kiln room. **********Once the maple reaches the magical 6 percent moisture level, it is cut into laminates measuring 6 inches wide, 3 16 -inch deep and 8 to 10 feet long, depending on the size of the grand piano. **********The laminates are then taken to the rim processing department on the second floor, which creates the grand piano's frame, or rim, with its characteristic left-hand straight edge giving way to an elegant curve down the right. The rim encircles the action, hammers, strings, soundboard, tuning pins and other interior parts of the piano. The entire circumference of a rim is made of stacks of two or three long pieces of high-grade maple laminate, carefully joined at the edges. **********Steinway presses about 11 rims each day. During the process, which takes about 20 minutes, the department foreman, Raphael D'Alleva (a 38-year Steinway employee who is known for only three cracked rims in his career), and six other men stand in a line as the laminates emerge one on top of another from a glue applicator on a conveyor belt. When the 18th layer is aligned, the six men hoist the finished book over their shoulders and carry it over to the piano-shaped rim press, where they align it and bang it into the clamps with big red hammers. **********Once the glue sets, the rim is taken to one of the factory's 13 conditioning rooms for a minimum of eight weeks. Programmable logic controllers in each room contain sensors that adjust the temperature and humidity levels every five minutes. All the controllers are connected to a 75-megahertz Pentium PC in an office about 50 yards away. By monitoring the computer screen, a supervisor can control even the slightest variations in temperature and humidity. If the system goes down (which it occasionally does), the supervisor must go to each room, check its wet- and dry-bulb thermometers and make adjustments manually. **********''Monitoring the conditioning rooms from a central computer allows us to make micro adjustments constantly,'' said Robert Berger, director of quality for Steinway. ''It helps us avoid going into one of the rooms and saying, 'Oh, wow, this room's been going out of control for a couple of hours now,' which used to happen on occasion.'' **********In other areas of the factory, ''machining centers'' -- where machines that contain microprocessors and are driven by programmable logic controllers can be ordered to perform several different repetitive jobs -- are replacing manually operated machines that perform one function at a time. That is the case particularly in the action department, the part of the factory that makes wooden shapes that measure no more than a few inches and look as though they belong in Santa's toy sack. Of the 85 different machines used to build the piano's action, about 10 of them are run by programmable logic controllers, said Chris Arena, a supervisor in the department. **********''With the older machines, you're relying on an operator with 30 years' experience to reset switches if you want to reprogram it,'' he said. ''Even then, there's a danger that if something's running incorrectly, he won't be able to stop it in enough time to avoid damage to the machine. With the P.L.C. machines, we can make adjustments in a snap by programming changes.'' As a result, Mr. Arena said, the tolerances in the parts have decreased, and fewer parts are being thrown away. **********Even the stringing of the piano is now done with the aid of a P.L.C. The stringing machine has a set of push-button controls that let the operator tell the machine to begin the cycle of winding the string around the tuning pins and then driving each pin into the tuning blocks. Before this stringing machine was put into use in 1997, the stringer did it all with his index finger, a wrench and a mallet. **********Discussing the effects of the production changes, Barry Douglas, a concert pianist in Paris, said that more than 10 years ago, certain Steinways might have been right for playing only certain kinds of music. ''You could argue that the older Steinways had a more individualistic type of tone and voicing within each piano,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''One might have had a certain deep sound that made it perfect for playing pieces from the Romantic period.'' **********Because many of these innovations are relatively new, it remains to be seen whether they will enable Steinway to speed production. In most cases, it takes several months between the time a Steinway piano is ordered and the time it shows up on the doorstep. According to a report from the Piano Manufacturers Association International, Steinway produced and sold fewer than 10 percent of the 28,356 grand pianos sold in the United States in 1997. **********Other piano manufacturers, including Yamaha, Baldwin and Samick, produce thousands more pianos per year than Steinway and sell them for significantly less money. (Steinway baby grand pianos start at $31,000, for example, while Yamaha baby grands start at less than $12,000.) **********Yamaha said it continues to hold the largest United States market share (in both units and dollars) by automating the plate-making, rim-building and tuning-pin installation processes. ''We still take over a year to build a concert grand, but by automating some of our functions, we're able to build more pianos than other companies,'' said Terry Lewis, a senior vice president at Yamaha. **********But building more pianos is not a high priority for Steinway. ''The technology we're developing now gives us some amazing abilities in terms of machining,'' Mr. Berger said, ''but there are still many aspects of piano making that are better done by human hands.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/news/deutsche-bank-predicts-growth-and-the-euro-at-115-in-2000.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1999-08-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1284, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Deutsche Bank Predicts Growth And the Euro At $1.15 in 2000", "print_headline": "Deutsche Bank Predicts Growth And the Euro At $1.15 in 2000", "body_text": " **********FRANKFURT\u2014                     Confidence in Europe's economic upswing and its common currency gained new adherents Monday when Europe's biggest commercial bank gave an upbeat outlook for the first year of the next millennium. **********The report of Deutsche Bank AG's top economists brightens the bank's previous growth estimates for the 11-nation euro bloc and predicts new strength for the euro, forecasting that the currency will rise to about $1.15 by the end of next year from around $1.07 now **********The bank thinks the seven-month-old currency can extend the gains of the past two weeks, which halted six months of losses.

Now, optimism is emerging as the consensus. **********\"The general view is turning much more optimistic as the prospects for a cyclical recovery are coming ever clearer,\" said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. **********Salomon Smith Barney Inc. likewise characterized European trends as \"gaining momentum\" in its latest analysis, which sees a faster-than-expected 2.7 percent pace of expansion next year. **********And the Industrial Bank of Japan wrote recently, \"Euroland on the course to recovery.\" **********Deutsche Bank said Monday that it had revised its Year 2000 forecast for the gross domestic product of the euro-zone countries to 3 percent from 2.8 percent. The GDP estimate is 2 percent this year. **********For Germany, recently derided by economists as the \"sick man of Europe,\" Deutsche Bank lifted its 2000 forecast to a similarly brisk 3 percent pace, which would be the fastest expansion since the 1991 boom that was fueled by unification. **********Germany, which is expected to grow only about 1.5 percent this year, accounts for one-third of the economic activity in the euro bloc. **********But the bank raised a red flag \u2014 the prospect of a tightening of credit in Europe as soon as this year. **********Noting that inflation is moving up toward 2 percent, the most that the European Central Bank has said it will tolerate, Deutsche Bank said it expected the central bank to raise its main money-market benchmark by a full percentage point next year, to 3.5 percent. **********\"A first hike before the end of this year is not out of the question,\" Deutsche Bank Research said in its report. **********Europe's economies appear to owe their present buoyancy to a cyclical upswing that was engineered by the European Central Bank through a combination of low interest rates and toleration of a weak euro, which effectively led to a discount on European exports. **********Adding a note of caution, the economists at Deutsche Bank agreed that a handful of risks could rain on the optimism. Those include the fragility of the recoveries in Japan and Latin America and the possibility of another abrupt change of ideological direction by the German government. **********Norbert Walter, the German bank's chief economist, said the latest economic plan presented by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had helped to restore some confidence. But he said that Bonn's leaders fell short of any \"vision\" for an overhaul of the German welfare system. **********\"This is a budget of necessity, not a strategic budget,\" Mr. Walter said. **********Mr. Schroeder, whose government came in last October promoting new economic regulations and higher taxes on business, has been trying to steer his center-left Social Democratic Party to the political center and loosen the influence of his party's labor wing and left-guard. **********\"The new German government has changed its rhetoric from being scary to being market-friendly and reform-friendly,\" Mr. Schmieding said. \"That is a significant change,\" he said. \"And if indeed we were to see a major change in German government policy to match the change in rhetoric, then one could start to think about the sick man of Europe getting better for good.\""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/28/business/a-quieter-new-yorker-under-new-editor-less-buzz-less-lunch-but-will-it-work.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Kuczynski", "pub_date": "1999-06-28", "snippet": "Profile of David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker magazine, who is far different breed of editor than was Tina Brown, who resigned last July; Remnick says he is inescapably dogged by the 'old comparison that Tina was the glitz, and I'm at home wa...", "word_count": 2183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Quieter New Yorker; Under New Editor, Less Buzz, Less Lunch.

But Will It Work?", "body_text": " **********David Remnick -- the editor of The New Yorker magazine and Pulitzer Prize winning author -- wanted to talk to a reporter over breakfast. But where? Mr. Remnick, a self-scrutinizing former newspaper reporter who understands the art of the dramatic setup, had doubts about the message his chosen venue would send. **********After running through two or three options, he said: ''How about a plain coffee shop? Is a plain old coffee shop O.K.? Does that send any kind of message?'' **********In a way it does. Mr. Remnick's eventual, if slightly tortured, choice -- a plain old Upper West Side coffee shop, complete with plain old tepid coffee -- sent the clarion-clear message that Mr. Remnick is a far different breed of editor than was Tina Brown, who resigned suddenly from the stewardship of the 74-year-old magazine last July, and who decisively favored the Four Seasons over formica counter tops. In the words of Mr. Remnick, he is inescapably dogged by ''the old comparison that Tina was the glitz, and I'm at home watching PBS.'' **********The gulf between Ms. Brown's glitzy style and frenetic pace and Mr. Remnick's more earnest, relaxed mien has become the defining hallmark of his first year at the magazine. (His first anniversary will be on July 14.) Ms. Brown, a churner of the elusive marketing ingredient known as ''buzz,'' favored show business articles, sometimes shocking photography and incendiary covers, and her magazine made news -- not necessarily within its pages -- just as her new venture, Talk, did last week landing on the front pages of both New York City tabloid newspapers when the Mayor refused to allow a party introducing the new magazine to be held on city property. **********By contrast, Mr. Remnick does not attract much publicity. And at his version of The New Yorker, there are no guest editors, no sultry photographs of the neighborhood dominatrix, no cloying fascination with celebrity. As one executive with Advance Publications' Conde Nast, which owns the magazine, said with a sniff befitting Eustace Tilley, the monocled mascot of The New Yorker, ''The big difference is that with David, you don't have to read in the morning papers about who he had dinner with last night.'' **********The author of four books, including ''Lenin's Tomb,'' which won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize, Mr. Remnick favors longer pieces and has added more local political coverage, more international political coverage, more criticism, even more words in general (he has added extra editorial pages, at extra cost to the magazine) -- and little of it has generated the noisy, often outraged clamor in the news media that many advertisers appreciate. **********David Verklin, chief executive at the Carat North America media services agency in New York, which has clients like Pfizer, Chanel and Philip Morris, said that Mr. Remnick's quieter magazine was harder to sell to the young media planners who allocate advertising budgets.  ''Has it lost its buzz?'' he said of the magazine. ''No. It has lost its Tina. When you come after the sun, even a 1,000-watt bulb can look dull.'' **********The 1,000-watt bulb defended his approach. **********''I tell you, that goes to stereotypes of what she did and what I am beginning to do,'' Mr. Remnick said, munching on a twice-toasted bagel. He wore an oxford shirt and no tie. ''Tina introduced, visually, a lot of elements. She introduced color in a major way. And we have to push both of those elements farther. But much more importantly, I thought we needed better coverage of the city. We needed to expand the geography of the magazine, and we needed to strengthen the critics.'' **********Mr. Remnick praised Ms. Brown's magazine, which featured many respected writers like Connie Bruck, Richard Preston, William Finnegan and Henry Louis Gates Jr. But he said that ''we had no art critic,'' adding: ''There was the occasional piece by Simon Schama or Adam Gopnik. But our identity as a magazine is based in culture.'' **********''My feeling about The New Yorker is that it is not a magazine of utility,'' Mr. Remnick said. ''It is not a magazine you use, like a business magazine, where you must keep up with such-and-such an industry. You get The New Yorker first and foremost for entertainment, to be lifted out of the dullness, the ordinariness of the day.'' **********As far as she is concerned, Ms. Brown said it was something of a relief not to have to be the guardian of such an august, closely monitored reputation. ''Editing The New Yorker was about being the custodian of a treasure, as opposed to inventing from the ground up,'' she said, adding that Mr. Remnick ''has taken my template, after much creative frenzy, and is now doing something wonderful every week and getting the best work out of the talent there.'' **********Mr. Remnick's major changes, at first, seemed barely detectable. He moved the humor column from the last page of the magazine to the middle. He hired several new writers, including an art critic, Peter Schjeldahl, from The Village Voice; a film critic, David Denby, from New York magazine; and the book critic Nicholas Lemann. He hired Pete Hamill ''to write whatever he wants,'' Mr. Remnick said. To cover local and international politics, he hired Elizabeth Kolbert and Michael Specter from The New York Times, where Mr. Remnick's wife, Esther B. Fein, works. He shifted staff writers to the critics' section, including Joan Acocella and Daphne Merkin. And he has added design elements -- photographs and art -- to enhance the fiction, a category of writing overlooked in Ms. Brown's era. **********''The New Yorker used to assault you,'' said John Seabrook, a staff writer who has written for three editors -- Robert Gottlieb, Ms. Brown and Mr. Remnick. ''Under David, I am sort of relieved by the lack of breaking news stories.'' **********Under Mr. Remnick, however, The New Yorker, does not always shy from breaking stories. Today's issue announced in a ''Talk of the Town'' item that President Clinton might run for the Senate from Arkansas in 2002. **********But staff members say the difference in managerial style between the two editors is striking. **********Ken Auletta, a staff writer, said: ''Tina was more rush, rush, more willing to pick up the magazine and alter it at the last minute. David is more relaxed, and is a very popular figure among the staff. He's a guy who walks around in casual clothes and plops into people's offices.'' **********Mr. Seabrook, who is writing a book about the culture of American taste as it is reflected in The New Yorker, said that Ms. Brown ''opened everything up, from lowbrow to highbrow.'' **********He continued: ''Now it is up to Remnick and all of us to make the most of that situation -- to figure out a new set of values for The New Yorker, one that is good for editorial and good for the marketing. I'm not sure whether we know what this looks like yet.'' **********While writers celebrate Mr. Remnick's casual demeanor, his aversion to celebrity and the fact that he will never invite a sitcom actress to guest-edit the magazine (like Ms. Brown did with Roseanne Barr), advertisers are wary. **********Mr. Verklin of Carat North America said that The New Yorker ''has become a bit more cerebral and a bit less pop cultural, and more centered on its serious journalistic tradition;  That makes the publisher's job harder, because you're selling more steak and less sizzle.'' **********Gene DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media, which places ads for clients like BMW -- which neglected to place a campaign in The New Yorker last year even though it had in the past and even though BMW ads appeared in virtually every other appropriate Conde Nast magazine -- said that he was disappointed by the new regime and its lack of unified vision. He said that David Carey, the magazine's publisher, continued to rely on inserts and advertorials, which he said were placed haphazardly, without regard to the editorial content, throughout the magazine. **********''They're both extraordinarily competent,'' he said of Mr. Remnick and Mr. Carey. ''On the other hand, the fiction issue looked as though it fell down the stairs. It seemed very helter-skelter. I haven't been concerned until the last issue.'' **********There is some room for concern. The magazine continues to lose money, according to executives at Conde Nast, although it no longer loses close to the $32 million a year it did during the last year, 1992, that Steven T. Florio, now the president and chief executive officer of Conde Nast,  was president of the magazine. In addition to losses estimated at a minimum of $10 million in 1998 by one Conde Nast executive, Mr. Remnick has added extra editorial pages each week -- often as many as 10 -- which adds an additional burden of about $3 million each year. The editorial budget alone is $35 million each year, said a Conde Nast executive. **********S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast, said of Mr. Remnick's magazine: ''Readers have responded and if it took extra pages, that's fine with me. David has a lot of latitude.'' **********Under Ms. Brown, the magazine bulked up circulation -- largely with discounted subscriptions that still do not make money for the magazine -- from a low of 628,000 in 1992 to a high of 858,000 in 1996. For 1998, the average circulation was 813,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. And ad pages have slipped, from 2,141 in 1997 to 1,960 for 1998, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. From January to May 1998, the magazine carried 793 pages of advertising, and for the same period this year, 710 pages, a decline of 10.5 percent. **********Mr. Carey said that figure was not entirely reflective of the magazine's health because there was one fewer issue in the time period measured for 1999. In the end, he said, ad pages will total more for 1999 than they did for 1998, in part because The New Yorker has been sold to advertisers in a package with other Conde Nast magazines since January. The policy attracts advertisers into the magazine because if they want to place an ad in Vanity Fair or Architectural Digest, they have to buy a package that includes space in The New Yorker. A recent example: Weber grills, which in the magazine's recent fiction issue boasted a six-page spread, complemented by the work of New Yorker cartoonists probably not used to writing witty lines about barbecue grills.(''It's an amicable divorce,'' read one caption underneath a cartoon showing two men lounging by a grill. ''She keeps the house, the furniture, and the car, and I keep the grill.'') **********In broad terms, the magazine industry is less vital than it was during the period following World War II, when Americans relied almost exclusively on magazines like The New Yorker for their most provocative literature, an era when The New Yorker, not coincidentally, sold 7,000 pages of advertising a year. This number has slid from decade to decade, to 6,000 in the 1960's, then 3,000 in the 1980's, settling in at around 1,900 pages for last year. **********''That has happened with every magazine,'' Mr. Carey said. ''There are a million more options today. I don't care if you're The New Yorker or if you're Forbes or Time, you're fighting many more competitors as categories get sliced and diced.'' **********If not through thousands of pages of advertising, one way that The New Yorker could make money for Mr. Newhouse would be to go to a biweekly schedule, an option that Mr. Carey has examined and that has been a subject of debate inside the magazine. One former Conde Nast executive who has studied the magazine's circulation model said that The New Yorker would not make a profit as a weekly until it sold 3,000 pages of advertising a year, sold subscriptions for $45 and sold more copies on the newsstand. Subscriptions now cost less than $40, ad pages do not approach 3,000, and newsstand sales make up only 5.3 percent of the magazine's total circulation. **********If the magazine shifted to publishing every other week, it could make a profit by carrying just 1,500 pages of advertising a year, and cut its production costs in half. Anecdotal evidence from readers, say editors at The New Yorker, suggests they would respond favorably -- ''almost with a sense of relief,'' said one editor -- to the idea. **********Mr. Newhouse said he had no immediate plans to alter the magazine from its 46-issue schedule. **********At Mr. Remnick's magazine, there is a sense of relaxation. Most of the covers are already planned for the rest of the summer, Mr. Remnick said. Hendrik Hertzberg, an editor who will have spent 30 years at the magazine this year, said: ''The car runs more smoothly now. We don't hit as many potholes.'' **********And Mr. Seabrook, in the meantime, is at work on two articles that may not have found a place in Ms. Brown's New Yorker. He said that his next published article in The New Yorker would be about sleep. **********''Everybody talks about it,'' he said. ''Everybody's obsessed with it. Under Tina, could I have written about sleep? Well, maybe. I don't know. And you know what? Now, I'm working on a story about weather.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/11/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-kosovo-update.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-06-11", "snippet": "Update on Kosovo developments (S)", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KOSOVO UPDATE", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS; KOSOVO UPDATE", "body_text": " *********** NATO suspended its 78-day air campaign after confirming that Yugoslav troops had begun withdrawing from Kosovo.

It does mean that there is more access for savvy investors who watch the money flows. **********- **********Q: How about the small-cap sector? Does the fact that fewer people are following the stocks mean that there are greater opportunities for truly informed investors? **********A. The small-cap sector definitely has a lot of anomalies for the savvy manager to exploit. The opportunities come in two flavors: overvalued and undervalued. **********Look at Manuel Asensio. He has done very well by focusing exclusively on shorting securities. He is able to piece together information in a different way and find companies that have something wrong with them, such as an involvement in a fraud case.

What is your advice to would-be great investors? **********A. Most people are overconfident about their own abilities. That is probably a good thing.

Most investors should work at becoming a lot more savvy about their own risk perspective. Then they should turn to the experts. **********- **********Q.

She was only 9. **********''I was still young,'' she said. **********Naataosim, foal-thin in her green school uniform, is 10 now. This is her second year in the A.I.C. Girls Primary Boarding School, where she is a pupil rather than a very young bride. The school, on a dusty plateau in southern Kenya, is circled by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, meant not to deter thieves but the fathers of the girls from sneaking them away. **********The school has become a haven for girls seeking to escape early marriage, a practice not at all unusual among the Masai, perhaps the most fiercely traditional and independent of the 42 tribes in Kenya. And so, the school has found itself at the heart of an unending argument here about how the modern world is gaining ground on traditional life in Africa. **********The Masai may still dress in plaid shawls, but more and more they are giving up nomadic life, as their land is parceled off and the plains fill with houses. The Kikuyu, the largest tribe, have a saying that sums up the inching forth of change: Even the Masai are wearing underwear now. **********But many Masai families do not understand why that change must extend to one of their most precious and pliable resources, their daughters. And that has made it hard for the school, where three-quarters of the girls are Masai, and its headmistress, Priscilla Nangurai. **********''I think there are more problems than successes,'' she said by way of weary introduction to her school. ''They feel that when a girl goes to school she gets spoiled because she gets to a point where she is equal to the men. But she's not supposed to be equal. She's not supposed to make her own decisions.'' **********''Most men are afraid of that, of their not getting married at all,'' she added. ''To them that is like you are an outcast. A woman should get married. She should have children.'' **********Thus the fence, which went up six years ago, as well as rules that allow families to visit the girls only two times each term. During Mrs. Nangurai's 18 years there, the school has become well known for taking in girls in trouble. Some are victims of sexual assault. One girl who will enroll soon is the daughter of a woman killed in December by her policeman husband, a case that has heightened concern about domestic violence. **********Mrs. Nangurai said she is not on a crusade to destroy Masai culture, even though she has been accused of that. Despite her abhorrence of female genital cutting, for example, she said she does not try to stop it. Nearly all her students have undergone one form of genital cutting or another. ''We are telling them at least to do it on the holidays,'' she said, ''so the girls can have some time to heal before they come back.'' **********While Mrs. Nangurai said some people have softened on the school, it was clear from interviews around the town of Kajiado that there is much suspicion of education for girls. Nantayio Sonto, 35, a market vendor, said girls were more respectful in the ''older'' days. **********''But the girls of today, once she goes to school and gets an education, she will not listen to her elders,'' she said. ''She might even elope.'' **********The school was founded in 1959 by Protestant missionaries from the African Inland Church, though it no longer supports the school. The idea was that the Masai could leave their daughters behind for schooling while the rest of the family followed their cattle to fresh grazing lands. The school is now financed through fees from parents who can pay and grants from outside groups. **********From 20 girls at the start, the number had grown to 412 by the time Mrs. Nanguria became headmistress in 1981. But she said there was still much suspicion about the school, so much that she had to recruit for first graders. **********Now there are 650 girls there, and many of their stories follow a similar script. ''My father wanted to marry me off,'' said Jedida Nkadoyo, who was only 10 when her father mysteriously forbade her to go to school in her home village. A week later, she said, her mother told her, ''Today you are going to your husband's place.'' Her dowry was one cow, a crate of bottled beer and 40 liters of home brew. **********''I'm a girl who is going to school so I can get my education,'' she said she told her father. ''My father said, 'That's nonsense.' '' **********The marriage lasted one day, and by some circumstance she is still not completely aware of, she ended up at the school. **********Christine Shuaka was 14 when her father told her she was to be married one day after she came home from school. She refused. **********''He thought I was just playing,'' she said. ''He said, 'You are going to be married because you are old enough to get married now.' '' **********At the start, her father would not visit her at the school. But slowly he came, just as, Mrs. Nangurai said, people are slowly changing their minds about the school. He does not talk about marriage anymore. She wants to be a lawyer. **********''He has seen now that I have done a good job,'' she said. ''He has said it is very important for me to be educated.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/business/world-business-briefing-europe-german-cable-bidders.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-10-15", "snippet": "Deutsche Telekom AG draws up short list of possible buyers for its cable television network from 23 original bidders and will begin negotiations in November; Mannesmann AG and Viag AG confirm that Deutsche Telekom has rejected their bids (S)", "word_count": 80, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GERMAN CABLE BIDDERS", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; GERMAN CABLE BIDDERS", "body_text": " **********Europe's biggest phone company, Deutsche Telekom A.G., said it had drawn up a short list of possible buyers for its cable television network from the 23 original bidders and will begin negotiations in November.

But it has appeal. If an insomniac investor wants to sell his stock in the wee hours, why shouldn't he be able to? **********The reality of after-hours trading, at least for now, is not compelling. That is because the rules and regulations protecting investors who buy stocks during market hours may not be applied as assiduously during extended trading. **********After-hours trading began in earnest on Aug. 25, when MarketXT, an electronic trading network backed by large Wall Street firms, instituted an evening trading session from 6 P.M. to 8 P.M. Volume in the 200 stocks on the network has not been huge, but there have been no glitches, building confidence in the idea that trading after hours can work. **********But can it work well? Investors who have bought or sold during evening hours in recent weeks have probably been subject to wilder price moves in shares and have had trouble getting trades done. Anytime there are few participants trading, stock prices jump around and spreads between bids and offers loom large. **********Making matters worse is the dispersed nature of after-hours trading. Michael Cormack, manager of equity trading at American Century Mutual Funds in Kansas City, Mo., said getting trades executed outside normal trading hours has been difficult. ''Now you have four or five different entities trading after hours, and it's a fragmentary mess,'' he said. That increases the likelihood of an investor's trade failing to find the best price. **********But an even greater concern is that rules intended to protect investors may be ignored by players in after-hours markets. **********Consider, for example, a guideline instituted by the National Association of Securities Dealers to insure that a brokerage firm holding an order from a customer to buy or sell a stock at a specific price would not trade that stock for its own account ahead of the customer when the prevailing market for the stock would satisfy the customer's order. Known as the limit-order protection interpretation, it was put into effect in 1995 and made Nasdaq a fairer place to trade stocks. **********But the interpretation is in force only during the hours that Nasdaq is open, until 5:15 P.M. now and 6:30 P.M. as of Oct. 4. As a result, some market players fear that firms handling investors' trades after hours may ignore the guideline and put their own trading ahead of their customers'. **********Another investor protection rule that traders may be flouting in after-hours trading has to do with short sales, transactions by investors who are betting that a stock will fall. **********Traders who want to sell shares short are  allowed to do so only when the stock's most recent transaction took place at a price the same as or higher than its previous trade. This is called the uptick rule, and was instituted to protect stocks from being manipulated downward by relentless short-selling. **********In after-hours trading, however, there is no consolidated record of trades taking place among the disparate firms and markets. So traders say short sales are very likely taking place even when a stock is dropping in price. **********Investors who buy and sell stocks after hours are probably unaware of these troubling inconsistencies.

It also would gain a foothold in the country's swiftly consolidating banking sector. **********INA, Italy's No. 2 insurer, holds key stakes in large commercial banks. Its investment banking ally, San Paolo-IMI SpA, was working on a plan to merge with INA before Generali made its bid. San Paolo-IMI's board will meet next week to review possible moves to counter Generali's offer. **********But the significance of Generali's bid goes beyond the impact on insurance and banking sectors. It will affect the power struggle among the country's leading corporate players. **********What was most remarkable was that the bid came not from a brash newcomer, but from a cornerstone of the Italian business establishment \u2014 Generali, often referred to in the Italian press as the \"Lion of Trieste.\" **********Umberto Agnelli, the head of the Agnelli family's industrial holding company, which controls Fiat, said Generali's bid was \"arrogant\" and that it did not follow the \"traditional style\" of the insurance giant. **********Generali's bid clearly has the fingerprints of Enrico Cuccia, 92, honorary chairman of the powerful Milan merchant bank Mediobanca SpA \u2014 Generali's top shareholder and financial adviser. He is often referred to as the \"high priest\" of Italian finance. For decades he has worked to knit a web of corporate cross-shareholdings among Italy's top industrial families, from the Agnellis to the Pirellis. **********But Mr. Cuccia and Mediobanca have been forced to change their secretive style in recent years, as competition has begun to eat away at their dominance of Italian deal-making. Mediobanca helped Olivetti organize its hostile bid for Telecom Italia and effectively broke ranks with the Agnelli family, which is part of San Paolo-IMI's inner core of shareholders. **********Francesco Micheli, who challenged Italy's corporate scene 15 years ago with the first hostile takeover of a family-owned company, sees the possibility of San Paolo-IMI organizing a friendly counteroffer for INA, but he does not see them ultimately winning. **********Mr. Micheli, now an adviser for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., the U.S. investment bank, said the boldest defense would be for INA and its allies to make a public bid for Generali. \"But I doubt they have the guts to do that,\" he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/04/technology/game-theory-video-fishing-game-means-no-slimy-bait.html": {"writer_name": "J.

You're standing on the edge of your boat with a bass tugging madly on your hook! To make things even more realistic, the fish are hyper-intuitive. Sunlight reflections bounce perfectly off ripples in the lake, as realistically rendered wiggling fish, complete with blank stares and moving gills, swim about in the lake's murky depths, testing your ability to 'lure' them in.'' **********But when there's a piece of code on one side of the screen and a human being wrestling madly on the other, it's not clear who's being hooked. There is a live thing attracted to an artificial thing. You're the live thing. Ostensibly, you're the angler. But there are many eerie moments when you feel like the bass. **********After all, the environmental lures are so pretty. Once the line is cast, you have a spectacular underwater view, transforming the mundane fish-catching process into a Jacques Cousteau expedition. And the fish themselves are incredibly alluring -- beautifully fashioned bait for the wild and wiley gamer. **********They bite. But then, so do you. When you feel a tug on the other end of a force-feedback fishing reel, you're hooked. As in fishing, there is a frisson associated with that event. Frankly, the ''I've got a bite!'' moment is surreal in a virtual environment. We've had force feedback forever -- vibrations triggered by impact or explosions, moving images that push you. But it's radically different when you're being pulled. It conjures all kinds of sci-fi fantasies about being sucked into the screen. **********That's something we're afraid of. It's also something we want -- to plunge through the surface and tussle with whatever is lurking underneath. That's why virtual reality is appealing as a concept. (In practice V.R.'s appeal, like that of fishing, is tempered by the prospect of motion sickness.) That's the drama of ''The Matrix'' or ''Tron,'' or ''Moby Dick'' for that matter. Ultimately, it's about landing the Big One, at risk of life or limb. **********In the case of Sega Bass Fishing, it's risk of limb. You grip the controller in your left hand while you turn the reel with your right hand. (There is no left-hand version.) And every time you combat one of those monster bass, the rod sends vibrations up and down your arm. After a marathon fishing session, you've got a pretty acute case of tennis elbow. The manual warns you not to play for more than 30 minutes. I required painkillers after an hour. Your mileage may vary. **********Assuming your tendons survive the showdown, your prize specimens are weighed and ranked (Small, Medium One, Big One or Huge) and your name is entered in the Big Bass Ranking List. Again, it's not clear who's the trophy. It's your name and data up on the board -- in some sense, the players are hung above the mantel. **********Either way, the game utterly fails to provide the social context that makes fishing such a hallowed institution. You can't fish with another player on the same console -- there's no two-player mode. And despite the Dreamcast's much touted connectivity, there is no attempt to make this game a communal experience. In the arcade, Sega Bass Fishing is a performance sport -- everyone gathers around to watch whoever is wrestling the fish on screen. There is discussion. There is backseat driving. It's a social event. **********If there was ever a leisure activity that mandated conversation, it's fishing, but there is no online chat capability. There are no networked tournaments that allow remote contestants to fish from the same digital lake. None of your rankings are posted on the Internet. You can't even tell virtual fish stories online. This is supposed to be a revolutionary networked game console. Where are the downloadable lures? Why are we fishing by ourselves? **********The other technology that Sega likes to brag about is its visual memory unit (V.M.U.), the Tomagotchi-like keychain toy that plugs in to the game pad. A cross between Nintendo's Gameboy and a Playstation memory card, the V.M.U. is designed to give console games a portable dimension. Bass Fishing ignores this hardware capability as well. There's no mini-game, no portable tackle box or pocket bass farm. With regard to Bass Fishing, the V.M.U. is a red herring (sorry). **********Throw it back. **********Sega Bass Fishing, for Dreamcast, $39.95; all ages; fishing controller, sold separately, $34.95."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/06/business/media-talk-news-executive-leaving-it-behind-for-a-baseball-life.html": {"writer_name": "Felicity Barringer", "pub_date": "1999-09-06", "snippet": "Media Talk column: publisher Michael Gartner will sell The Tribune--10,000-circulation newspaper in Ames, Iowa--to become part owner of Iowa Cubs, AAA minor-league franchise of Chicago Cubs; photo (S)", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Media Talk; News Executive Leaving It Behind For a Baseball Life", "print_headline": "Media Talk; News Executive Leaving It Behind For a Baseball Life", "body_text": " **********''It's fun to be a small-town editor, especially when you own the newspaper,'' Michael G.

Why is he selling The Tribune -- the 10,000-circulation newspaper in Ames, Iowa, that he has edited for six years and owned for 13 -- and becoming a full-time baseball executive? **********Well, when it comes to writing for newspapers, Mr. Gartner has done all right. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his editorial writing in 1997. He was the page-one editor at The Wall Street Journal in the early 1970's and later the editor of The Des Moines Register. **********But owning them, or trying to, has been problematic. When he tried to buy The Des Moines Register while he was serving as its president in 1985, he was outbid by the Gannett Company. Now, he said, the death of a partner, David W. Belin, and the tax consequences for Mr. Belin's family ''made it clear we were going to have to sell.'' **********So sometime this fall, Mr. Gartner will be leaving the profession he has worked in since the 1950's, and going into a whole new line of work as part-owner of the Iowa Cubs, the AAA minor-league franchise of the Chicago Cubs. **********Mr. Gartner has been The Tribune's editor since he resigned in 1993 as president of NBC News, which is owned by General Electric. His departure followed the revelation that -- unbeknownst to him -- an explosion of a General Motors pickup truck videotaped for use in a ''Dateline'' program had been staged. **********He returned to Ames, the college town 35 miles north of Des Moines where he and The Tribune's publisher, Gary G. Gerlach, had teamed with Mr. Belin in 1986 to buy the newspaper. An article in the American Journalism Review describes his posting of the text of the First Amendment and quotations of Thomas Jefferson on the newsroom walls, and he went on to secure jobs for alumni of the 20-person editorial staff on newspapers like The Baltimore Sun, The St. Petersburg Times, USA Today and The New York Times. **********In a brief interview, Mr. Gartner said he did not yet know how his life was going to change once he was out of the business. ''I've never run a baseball team,'' he said. ''I expect to have fun and enjoy myself.'' He said he had played a little baseball long ago. Then, with a trace of self-consciousness, he delivered a line he has used before, a soundbite that he recognizes is virtually irresistible to a journalist. **********''My problem as a shortstop,'' he said, ''is the same problem I had as an editorial writer.

It combines TV Guide's access to programming information with Gemstar's technical ability to create what are called interactive program guides that will help viewers navigate a much wider television universe with hundreds of cable channels. It also offers the potential for electronic commerce through the television set. **********The deal also ends six years of legal battles between Gemstar and TV Guide over patents for program guides, the television features that offer daily schedules, highlights of upcoming specials or pay-per-view movies and commercials. **********Under the deal, TV Guide stockholders will receive 0.6573 shares of Gemstar stock for each share they own of TV Guide.  Based on Gemstar's Oct. 1 stock price of $83.625, the deal values TV Guide at about $9.2 billion. The new company will be called TV Guide International. Mr. Murdoch, through the News Corporation, now owns 44 percent of TV Guide; Liberty Media also owns 44 percent. **********Mr. Murdoch, who at one time owned a stable of magazines in the United States, including New York Magazine, now owns only The Weekly Standard, a conservative political magazine. **********Gemstar was founded in 1990 by Henry Yuen, a lawyer who despite his training as a mathematician could not figure out how to program his videocassette recorder, and a partner. Confounded by the intricacies of a standard VCR, Mr. Yuen developed VCR Plus, a program enabling a consumer to record television shows at the touch of a button. It is licensed to dozens of consumer electronics companies, from Aiwa to Sony, and comes as a standard feature with most VCR's. **********In 1997, Gemstar bought a company called Starsight, which owned patents for interactive program guides, or I.P.G.'s for short. An I.P.G. allows viewers to organize onscreen television listings by channel, category or time, a device that may not yet be essential, but may prove to be in the increasingly likely world of 500 cable channels. A theory behind the deal is that the guide will become a source of advertising revenue of its own. **********TV Guide and Gemstar have been enemies for a long time, said Joseph Arsenio, a managing director at Hambrecht & Quist. ''Now they are joining forces to take advantage of of the obvious opportunities to leverage an interactive program guide.'' **********Tom Eagan, a cable and satellite analyst for Paine Webber Inc., said that the merger ''will offer the magazine more formats to publish in and to experiment with new kinds of features in evolving electronic formats of the guide,'' he said. **********The merger is subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- which both TV Guide and Gemstar do not expect to happen until the second half of 2000. With the possibility of broadband digital technology becoming widely available to consumers, both Gemstar and TV Guide have started to develop programs with interactive and E-commerce capabilities, which would allow viewers in the future to purchase products showcased on television programs. Under such a system, a television viewer could purchase a movie soundtrack, or the brand of sweater worn by, for example, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' through their television. **********''The interactive guide then becomes the pivotal point for a consumer who sits down in front of their television,'' said Peter C. Boylan 3d, the president of TV Guide.

Mr. Chavez has maintained that the constitutional panel enjoys unlimited powers. Earlier this month, he symbolically offered the assembly his own resignation to demonstrate its power to dismiss or reconfirm him. **********In a televised speech today that was largely devoted to analysis of an economic situation that has worsened considerably since he took office in February, Mr. Chavez defended the assembly. **********''In Venezuela, democracy is being born,'' he said. ''Venezuela is coming out of tyranny. The entire world should recognize that.'' **********Mr. Chavez, 45, who was elected with a sweeping majority last December, is a former Army paratrooper who was cashiered and imprisoned in 1992 after leading an unsuccessful coup attempt in which dozens of people died. He has vowed to carry out a peaceful ''social revolution'' in his country, which has the largest reserves of oil outside the Middle East and is the United States' main source of imported oil. **********His opponents accuse him of seeking to install a left-wing military dictatorship. Mr. Chavez has submitted a draft Constitution that would extend his term to six years, and allow him to succeed himself in office and to promote military officers without the Senate's approval. **********Among ordinary Venezuelans, however, Mr. Chavez remains wildly popular, with an approval rating above 70 percent. In the July 25 balloting to elect the Constitutional Assembly, 121 of 131 seats went to his supporters, including his wife, a brother, several former military colleagues and five former members of his Cabinet. **********At first, it was expected that the assembly would focus exclusively on drafting a new Constitution -- the 26th in the country's turbulent history. By law, the body is required to finish work within six months and submit the document to a referendum for approval. But the assembly has spent much of its first three weeks extending its control over existing branches of Government. **********Popular dissatisfaction with the two dominant parties and Congress, which have been criticized as corrupt and inefficient, has mounted in recent years. After the assembly was elected last month, Congress, recognizing it had little support and wishing to avoid a confrontation, decided to go into recess until October and even offered the assembly its chamber as a meeting place. **********''There are times when resistance just for the sake of resistance makes no sense,'' Enrique Capriles, 27, a Copei deputy and the speaker of the lower house, said in explaining the legislature's action. But he also contended that ''the constituted powers retain their character until the new Constitution'' goes into effect, and warned that if the assembly tried to dissolve Congress, ''we will react.'' **********Ignoring that warning, the assembly voted Wednesday to limit the legislature's work to matters such as supervising the budget and communications. Lawmakers immediately responded by declaring their summer recess ended, and said that they would reconvene on Friday. **********Meanwhile, the assembly proceeded with its moves to restructure the judiciary. Nearly half of Venezuela's 4,700 judges, clerks and bailiffs are estimated to be facing accusations of corruption, and the assembly has vowed to resolve those cases. **********''The Constitutional Assembly has absolute powers,'' said Manuel Quijada, a lawyer whom the assembly has placed in charge of a special commission to revamp the courts. ''The objective is that the substitution of judges take place peacefully, but if the courts refuse to acknowledge the assembly's authority, we will proceed in a different fashion.'' **********On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled, by an 8-6 vote, that the assembly did not act unconstitutionally in assuming judicial powers. The Chief Justice, Cecilia Sosa Gomez, resigned on Tuesday, lamenting the disintegration of what she called ''the last control on constitutionality and legality that existed in Venezuela'' and accusing judges and Congress of caving to political pressure. **********''The court simply committed suicide to avoid being assassinated,'' she said in a nationally televised news conference. ''The result is the same: it is dead.'' **********In an interview published today in the Spanish newspaper El Pais, Carlos Andres Perez, the former President whose overthrow Mr. Chavez sought in 1992, predicted that Mr. Chavez would himself fall from power before his first term expires. Saying that ''the concentration of powers is anti-democratic,'' he accused Mr. Chavez of seeking ''a military government that will totally wipe out the triumphs of the Venezuelan people. **********''I am not one to encourage coups or violent attitudes, but it is clear what is going to happen,'' said Mr. Perez, who ran for a seat in the assembly but suffered a humiliating defeat. ''I think the upheaval we are in will last two years, and afterward Venezuela will begin to get back on its feet, but without Chavez at its head.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/06/business/company-news-sears-stock-up-after-turnaround-specialist-is-named.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-03-06", "snippet": "Shares of Sears, Roebuck & Co rise for a second day as much as 4.3 percent after it appoints Julian C Day, corporate turnaround specialist, as its chief financial officer (S)", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SEARS STOCK UP AFTER TURNAROUND SPECIALIST IS NAMED", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SEARS STOCK UP AFTER TURNAROUND SPECIALIST IS NAMED", "body_text": " **********Shares of Sears, Roebuck & Company rose for a second day as much as 4.3 percent yesterday after it appointed Julian C.

China, one American participant in the talks reports, has offered ''more market-opening concessions in the past three weeks than in the past three years.'' **********Even as bombs were falling in Kosovo, President Clinton met his top economic advisers late this afternoon to review the status of the negotiations, according to Administration officials. **********Only a few weeks ago the White House was pressing for a deal as a diplomatic triumph to accompany the April visit of China's Prime Minister, Zhu Rongji. Now, however, the Administration is riven with second thoughts. **********America's assent for China to join the trade organization will require at least the indirect approval of Congress, with the amendment of the law that currently requires an annual renewal of China's trade status. In the current atmosphere on Capitol Hill, where investigations into China's  suspected nuclear thefts are intertwined with long-running concerns over human rights, Tibet, Taiwan and a soaring trade deficit, many of the President's advisers fear Mr. Clinton could be forced to expend scarce political capital on a losing battle. **********''For the longest time the problem was that the Chinese wouldn't give,'' one participant in the talks said this week. ''Now the Chinese are giving -- not enough, but they clearly want a deal -- and the White House has cold feet.'' **********In public, Administration officials say they are committed to getting China into the trade group -- if the Chinese make politically and economically painful concessions. Allowing a far greater range of foreign investment in China, sharply reducing protective tariffs and agreeing to open markets to imports of everything from cars to wheat could remake the way the world does business with the Chinese. But major sticking points remain, including whether China will loosen restrictions on foreign insurance companies to sell policies in China, open the telecommunications and financial services markets to wide-scale foreign investment, and reduce or eliminate China's requirements that outsiders deal through state-run companies. **********For Mr. Zhu and President Jiang Zemin, the negotiation has enormously high stakes, especially at a time of economic slowdown and surging unemployment in China. Mishandled, a rapid opening of the market to foreign competition could worsen China's precarious economic condition. But failing to strike a deal has costs -- in prestige and in foreign confidence that China is committed to economic changes that will aid foreign investors. **********At a White House meeting last weekend, however, it became clear that the political calculus was equally complex here. President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, has pushed hardest to win a deal, viewing it as the only area in which Washington and Beijing can achieve a major diplomatic victory in the waning years of the Clinton Presidency, senior Administration officials say. The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin have also pressed for a deal, though only on the condition that the Chinese make significant concessions that will insulate the agreement from political attack in Congress, according to officials who have attended the meetings. **********But Mr. Clinton's domestic advisers, including the White House chief of staff, John Podesta, and the head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, now worry no deal will satisfy the growing chorus of China critics in Congress, some of the participants in the internal debate say. ''Before the latest China controversies we needed a good deal,'' one senior official said, ''and now we need a spectacular one.'' **********Others in the White House worry that a battle over China policy in Congress would unite liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who, for different reasons, bitterly oppose a trade deal with Beijing. **********Mr. Sperling, playing down the reports of dissent, insisted in an interview that ''there is unanimous agreement that if China were to meet the high test we are setting for them, then we should go forward.'' **********But the question of whether China has given enough will be a matter of interpretation. **********''The test will come from the reaction of the business community,'' Ms. Barshefsky, who is considering traveling to China this weekend to push a deal along, said on Wednesday. ''If the agricultural community, or the telecommunications industry says it's inadequate, then its inadequate. It's that simple.'' **********But in China's 13-year effort to join the organization that sets global trading rules and arbitrates disputes, nothing has proved simple. The next two weeks seem bound to be marked by brinksmanship, economic calculation and geopolitical strategizing that may have to do more with politics in both nations than with trade. **********For China, the immediate advantages of joining the trade organization are modest. There is the issue of national prestige, fueled by the fear that Taiwan might be admitted before the mainland. China would get a measure of protection against unilateral trade sanctions imposed by the United States or other nations. Beijing would be able to challenge American trade restrictions in front of trade organization judges. **********Most of China's 1.2 billion people work in agriculture, so the arguments over opening the market to agricultural imports has been particularly bitter. And China has sought to replicate Japan's strategy in automobiles and industrial machinery: import technology, but restrict foreign competition until a domestic industry flourishes. **********China's strategy until recently was to promise market openings, but insist on lengthy transitions -- up to 15 years, for example, to open the auto market fully. Gradually, Mr. Zhu has switched course, promising most market openings within three to five years. And in the last few days, China has also offered to allow foreign companies to hold up to 35 percent of telecommunications companies. Until now, foreigners have been barred from investing in telephone companies. The United States is insisting on 50 percent foreign investment. **********But as Washington's nervousness increases, so does the pressure on Ms. Barshefsky to deliver an impressive deal -- or no deal. **********''As compared to six months ago, or even three weeks ago, the deal has to be more bulletproof,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and one of the country's leading scholars on the Chinese economy. ''There are people in Congress who don't want to know the details, because they are so angry about other things.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/15/business/media-business-advertising-goldberg-moser-o-neill-plans-revamping-bid-make.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-01-15", "snippet": "San Francisco-based Goldberg Moser O'Neill is reorganizing to gain higher profile among advertisers; at center of shake-up is reorganization involving account planning department (M)", "word_count": 804, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goldberg Moser O'Neill plans revamping in a bid to make itself better known as a creative shop.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Goldberg Moser O'Neill plans revamping in a bid to make itself better known as a creative shop.", "body_text": " **********A LEADING San Francisco agency, Goldberg Moser O'Neill, is reorganizing to gain a higher profile among advertisers. **********Goldberg Moser, partly owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, was founded in 1990 as a spinoff of the San Francisco office of Chiat/ Day, now the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of Omnicom Group. Billings have grown from an estimated $58 million then to an estimated $450 million now from clients like Booz-Allen & Hamilton, the Cisco Systems Corporation, the Coca-Cola Company, the Dell Computer Corporation, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream and the Kia Motors America unit of Hyundai Group. **********And this month, Goldberg Moser has already landed two plum accounts: the Lucas Arts Entertainment Company in San Rafael, Calif., a software developer and publisher owned by the film director George Lucas, with billings estimated at $15 million to $20 million, and the Soma Corporation in Seattle, the operator of an Internet pharmacy site on the World Wide Web, www.soma.com, with billings estimated at $8 million. **********Still, there is a perception that Goldberg Moser has been an underachiever in the intensely competitive San Francisco and West Coast advertising markets. Several agencies generally acknowledged as among America's leading creative shops are neighbors, including Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, owned by Omnicom, and Publicis & Hal Riney, part of Publicis S. A. **********Indeed, Goodby, Silverstein was recently chosen by Dreyer's to handle a so-called superpremium ice cream brand, though Goldberg Moser continues handling the Dreyer's and Edy's brands. **********Goldberg Moser also faces challenges from big agencies that have or will have full-service offices in San Francisco: the BBDO Worldwide and DDB Needham Worldwide units of Omnicom and Lowe & Partners/SMS, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic. And there are feisty smaller shops, too, like Butler, Shine & Stern in nearby Sausalito, Calif., and the San Francisco office of the British agency Leagas Delaney. **********''We've done better creatively in the last three or four years and we're extremely profitable,'' said Fred Goldberg, chairman and chief executive at Goldberg Moser. ''Yet we're not getting the recognition we think we deserve.'' **********The reason? ''The work we're doing is not at the level we want it to be across the board,'' said Mr. Goldberg, 57. ''So we've decided to shake the whole thing up.'' **********At the center of that shake-up -- perhaps a charged word to use in San Francisco -- is a reorganization involving the account planning department. Account planners are responsible for gathering insights from consumers on their opinions about brands and products, then sharing that information with the creative department to help produce more effective campaigns. **********Goldberg Moser is renaming account planning as brand planning, with the brand planning directors paired with creative directors to form brand-planning teams. **********''There's a big opportunity here to figure out how to marry them together in more meaningful ways,'' said Mike Moser, 45, executive vice president and account planning director, who becomes executive vice president in charge of brand management. He will work with Catrina McAuliffe, senior vice president and chief marketing officer. **********''We want to focus planning back on being much more of a creative tool instead of an account management tool,'' said Ms. McAuliffe, 42. **********The analytical aspects of the planning directors' jobs are being shifted to an accountability group. Katheryn Silverthorn, 54, becomes associate director for accountability; she had most recently worked at G2 in Huntington Beach, Calif., a unit of Grey Advertising that closed. **********Other executives named to new posts include Nancy Hill, 40, vice president and business development director, who has worked at agencies including the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, and Brian O'Neill, 46, who has been promoted to president and chief creative officer from executive vice president and creative director. **********''There is a bit of a pull between wanting to be a creative agency,'' Mr. O'Neill said, ''and wanting to be a responsible agency making sure the work works.'' **********''We want to create a buzz for the agency so that we'll be mentioned in the same breath as a Goodby, a Chiat/Day, a Fallon McElligott, a Wieden & Kennedy,'' he added, ''which helps to energize how your clients feel about the work you're doing for them.'' **********And ''it's easier to hire people when you have that buzz,'' Mr. O'Neill said, adding that Goldberg Moser plans to expand the creative department. A third associate creative director has joined the agency: Rob Bagot, 35, a former senior copywriter at Goodby, Silverstein who had most recently been chairman and creative director at the Seattle office of a creative boutique, Big Bang Idea Engineering. **********One long-term goal for the reorganization, Mr. Goldberg said, is to more than double billings, to $1 billion. **********''I don't think it's unrealistic that we could reach that in three years,'' he said, adding, ''But if we don't, that would be O.K., as long as we achieve getting our recognition up at a much higher level than it is now.'' **********To be continued in January 2002."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/23/business/company-news-profits-down-schlumberger-will-cut-2500-more-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-23", "snippet": "Schlumberger Ltd will cut 2,500 more jobs by end of June as first-quarter profit fell 53 percent; company says it has already cut 7,500 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force, since July; it expects latest cuts to help it save $300 million a year, ...", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROFITS DOWN, SCHLUMBERGER WILL CUT 2,500 MORE JOBS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PROFITS DOWN, SCHLUMBERGER WILL CUT 2,500 MORE JOBS", "body_text": " **********Schlumberger Ltd., the world's second-largest oilfield services company, said yesterday that it would cut 2,500 more jobs by the end of June as first-quarter profit fell 53 percent.

The title comes from a term commonly used to describe potentially lucrative patents that sit collecting dust in a company's file cabinets. **********The authors, Kevin G. Rivette and David Kline, emphasize the strategic importance of intellectual property by giving example upon example in which patents (or their lack) have been crucial to the fortunes of such companies as Texas Instruments and Kodak. **********They urge companies to follow the example of Xerox, which was smart  enough to learn from its legendary failure to patent a graphical user  interface that later became the basis for Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows operating systems. **********G. Richard Thoman, the current chief executive of Xerox, was hired  in part for his intellectual property savvy, Mr. Rivette and Mr. Kline write. By contrast, they say, ''most businesses today still concentrate patent responsibilities in the legal department -- the one group in the company, ironically, that is specifically not trained to make business decisions.'' **********At its core, this book is a how-to manual for ferreting out valuable information from huge patent data bases that are now easily accessible on line (indeed, this is the essence of a new business, Aurigin Systems, which Mr. Rivette recently co-founded). And to think that only a few years ago, one had to clip patent  abstracts out of the Official Patent Gazette and hand-collate them to analyze patent trends or figure out what the competition was up to. This is no longer true. ''New electronic patent data bases, combined with automated data-mining and visualization tools, have reduced the time needed for intellectual property analysis from months to just hours,'' the authors write. **********The most obvious use of such patent analysis is to help a company get stronger patents to protect its new or existing products. But, as Mr. Rivette and Mr. Kline point out, this information can be used for more than simply protecting one's latest widget. Using what the authors call ''patent mapping,'' a company can more efficiently build a thicket of patents around a competitor's products. Or a company can determine which of its own patents are frequently cited as ''prior art'' in other inventors' patent applications -- and thereby identify patents for which they might want to try to extract licensing fees from other companies. **********Similar analysis can yield potential buyers for a company or even help poach hot engineering talent from other companies. **********So who in the technology sector has been particularly smart about intellectual property? The answer, according to the authors, is Dell Computer, which patented the manufacturing, distribution and marketing methods used in its build-to-order computer sales system. **********The focus of Seth Shulman's ''Owning the Future'' (Houghton Mifflin) is also intellectual property. But its gloom-and-doom outlook stands in sharp contrast to the gold-digging enthusiasm of ''Rembrandts in the Attic.'' Indeed, Mr. Rivette and Mr. Kline, a bit defensively, devote several pages to critiquing Mr. Shulman's book, which was published earlier this year and which argues that, unless society curtails intellectual property rights, we will see ''nothing less than an uncontrolled stampede to auction off our technological and cultural heritage.'' **********Mr. Rivette and Mr. Kline contend that Mr. Shulman's book contains errors and misrepresentations. Alas, they are right. Some of the information in ''Owning the Future'' is either old or simply incorrect or, more worrisome, sometimes used misleadingly to bolster the author's arguments. **********But while Mr. Rivette and Mr. Kline are trained on the relatively narrow question of how to squeeze as much value as possible out of a patent portfolio, Mr. Shulman does attempt to wrestle with issues that hold great societal import. Should companies be able to stake commercial claims on the natural processes of the human body? Will the stampede to the Patent Office by software inventors and on-line businesses result in a legal gridlock of the industry? These are important questions, which few people aside from Mr. Shulman are raising."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/22/business/international-business-venezuelan-leader-pledges-payment-of-all-debts.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Fuerbringer", "pub_date": "1999-09-22", "snippet": "Venezuela's Pres Hugo Chavez, in effort to reassure foreign investors, says his Government will make all of its debt payments while at same time work on market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current debt over longer period of...", "word_count": 488, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Venezuelan Leader Pledges Payment of All Debts", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Venezuelan Leader Pledges Payment of All Debts", "body_text": " **********In an effort to reassure foreign investors, Venezuela's President said yesterday that his Government would make all its debt payments while at the same time work on a market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current debt over a longer period of time. **********''We will continue to service our foreign debt, but we want to reduce the profile,'' President Hugo Chavez said through a translator at a New York news conference, held in part to give him a chance to clear up misconceptions about his economic policies. **********His comments came as investors keep a close watch on emerging markets in Latin America. Ecuador is struggling to avoid a default on its foreign debt and Brazil is still working to come back from the devaluation of its currency in January. **********Venezuela's news conference was organized by J.

The Russians have effectively defaulted, and Ecuador is scrambling to work out a debt-restructuring plan that would avoid a Brady bond default. Brady bonds, which are named for Nicholas F. Brady, a former Treasury Secretary, were designed as a way to repackage the billions of dollars in unpaid bank loans to many Latin American countries that they effectively defaulted on in the early 1980's. The repackaging into bonds made the old loans more attractive to investors because they could be traded easily and came with guarantees on the principal and interest of the bonds. **********A 30-day grace period for Ecuador to pay $96 million in interest and principal it owes on its Brady bonds ends next Tuesday, right in the middle of the International Monetary Fund's semiannual meeting. **********Ecuador has not yet proposed how it will rework its current Brady bonds, although there have been reports that future oil revenue may be used as collateral.

And their spending spree is putting continued upward pressure on market interest rates, with long-term yields jumping to a 19-month high yesterday. **********Automobile and furniture buying helped push retail sales up 1 percent in May, the Government reported yesterday. **********A separate economic report showed that prices paid to producers of finished goods rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, suggesting that inflation was still in check. But price increases outside the oil sector in crude goods, like wheat, and intermediate goods, like flour, could signal a turnaround in the global economy. Such a turnaround would mean more demand for credit and would put even more upward pressure on interest rates. **********The prospect of an economic rebound in Asia gained credibility this week after Japan reported that its economy grew a surprisingly strong 1.9 percent in the first three months of the year. Economists found reason for optimism even after the Japanese Government rushed to play down the size of the increase, suggesting the growth rate would not be sustained. **********''We agree with everyone that first-quarter G.D.P. overstates the rate of revival in Japan,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company. ''But we buy the notion that Japan is now rebounding.'' **********The data from this country and Japan strengthened the view of many analysts that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates to slow economic growth and prevent any surge in prices. Economists expect a rise of a quarter of a percentage point when the Fed's policy makers meet at the end of the month. **********Like many of his colleagues, Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, expects the central bank to push rates up yet another quarter-point later in the year. ''The question now,'' he said, ''is what will the Fed do after that'' second rate increase. **********The new data and growing concern about how far the Fed might go to slow the economy helped send interest rates higher again yesterday in a very jittery market. **********The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond jumped to 6.16 percent, its highest since November 1997, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1 7/32, to 87 22/32. This selloff capped the worst week for bonds in three and a half months; the yield on the 30-year-bond was 5.96 percent last Friday. The yield has now risen nearly 1.5 percentage points from the 30-year low that was set last October. **********And as interest rates moved higher yesterday, the stock market tumbled. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 130.76 points, or 1.2 percent, to finish at 10,490.51. **********Talk of bond sales by big investors, which was not confirmed, and other rumors about hedge fund troubles pushed the bond market sharply lower in the afternoon. Some traders said the Japanese were selling, while others said that big money managers who had waited too long to sell were jumping in to stop their losses. **********The market should continue to be volatile as investors await next week's report on May consumer prices, scheduled for release on Wednesday, and the appearance of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before Congress the next day. ''There is a lot of nervousness about that,'' said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J. P. Morgan Securities. **********The Consumer Price Index jumped seven-tenths of 1 percent in April, and many analysts say that even if the May increase is more  moderate, the Fed will still raise interest rates. **********Based on various market monitors, investors seem to be expecting an increase of at least half a percentage point in the Fed's short-term target for Federal funds, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. But one barometer is leaning toward a bigger move. The yield on the two-year Treasury note jumped yesterday to 5.69 percent, which leaves it almost a full percentage point above the central bank's current Federal funds target of 4.75 percent. **********If that yield moves just a little higher, it will indicate that some investors are expecting a total move of three-quarters of a percentage point in a series of steps. Such a move by the central bank would erase all three of the quarter-point rate cuts made last fall in a successful effort to calm global financial markets after the devaluation of the Russian currency and the near-collapse of a major hedge fund. **********Mr. Barbera of Hoenig & Company contends that long-term rates could edge toward 6.50 percent, rather then the 6.25 percent peak many analysts are discussing. He contends that much of the rise in market rates this year reflects increasing demand for credit as the economy grows, not just concerns about inflation. If this is the case, he said, a revival of the global economy will put much more pressure on interest rates than expected. **********The 1 percent increase in retail sales in May came after what had appeared to be two anemic months. But yesterday's report from the Commerce Department also included an upward revision in April sales, to an increase of four-tenths of 1 percent from the initial report of one-tenth of 1 percent. Retail sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent in March. **********The May increase was led by a 2.7 percent jump in automobile sales, a 1.1 percent climb in sales of furniture and other home furnishings, and a rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent in department store sales, adjusted for differences related to the seasons, holidays and number of business days. Over the last 12 months, retail sales have risen 7.8 percent. **********On producer prices, the increase of two-tenths of 1 percent that was registered in finished goods in May followed gains of half a percent in April and two-tenths in March. The big difference between May and April was the price of energy. In April, when the price of oil climbed above $18 a barrel, prices for finished energy goods, like gasoline, jumped 5.1 percent. But last month, when crude oil prices dropped back to $17 a barrel, finished-goods energy prices were unchanged. The gasoline index dropped 2.7 percent, after a record 29.1 percent increase, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in April. **********The core producer index for finished goods, which excludes energy and food, depicted a more restrained situation. It has risen one-tenth of 1 percent in each of the last two months and through the first five months of the year is unchanged at an annual rate. In the same period the overall finished-goods index is up at a 2 percent annual rate after being unchanged in 1998. **********''This lift in commodity prices and the revival in the early stages of processing does reflect that the global economy is on the mend,'' Mr. Berner of Morgan Stanley said, ''and that is consistent with inflation moving higher.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/24/world/new-indonesian-security-law-sets-off-protests-by-students.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1999-09-24", "snippet": "Indonesian Parliament approves security law that opponents say could grant strong new powers to military; approval unleashes surge of protests in Jakarta and other cities, some of which turn violent (M)", "word_count": 761, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Indonesian Security Law Sets Off Protests by Students", "print_headline": "New Indonesian Security Law Sets Off Protests by Students", "body_text": " **********In a hastily arranged vote just before it was to go into recess, Indonesia's Parliament today approved a security law that opponents say could grant strong new powers to the military. **********The approval, which was expected, unleashed a surge of protests in Jakarta and other cities, some of which turned violent. More than 5,000 students here tried to march to Parliament, clashing with riot policemen and soldiers who fired plastic bullets and tear gas to turn them back. **********Chanting ''Reformasi!'' the rallying cry of Indonesia's democracy movement, the students hurled stones and firebombs as the police advanced with truncheons and water-cannon trucks. About 30 people were wounded by the plastic bullets and tear gas, witnesses told Reuters. **********Protests also broke out in Indonesia's second-largest city, Surabaya. Witnesses told Reuters that two students were seriously wounded when 1,000 people clashed with policemen who were swinging batons and firing tear gas. **********The battles continued well into the night, with students hurling firebombs at riot policemen on a major highway in front of the University of Atma Jaya. The protest paralyzed traffic in central Jakarta for most of the day. **********The new law will allow Indonesia's President to declare a state of emergency in a province if it is requested by the local governor or legislature. Such a decision requires ratification by Parliament, but the President is not required to consult as many parties as under the existing 1959 law. **********Indonesia's top military commander, General Wiranto, defended the new law as being ''in line with democracy and human rights.'' As Defense Secretary, he introduced the legislation. **********''This bill is not for the need of Government, the national police or Indonesian soldiers,'' General Wiranto said. ''It is for the country.'' **********At a time when the Government is facing violent unrest in East Timor and other provinces, it has contended that the law needs updating. In an odd bit of timing, the law was approved on the same day that Indonesia's President, B. J. Habibie, lifted martial law in East Timor. **********The Government noted that the bill had been diluted from its original form. For instance, it no longer allows the military to restrict the news media during a state of emergency. Indonesia's press has regained its voice in the last 18 months, after years of repression under the former President, Suharto, who was forced from office last year. **********It is not so much the content of the law as the manner of its passage that has angered people. Parliament is scheduled to go into recess on Friday, and is to be replaced on Oct. 1 by a new legislature elected in June in the country's first genuinely multiparty ballot. **********Critics say General Wiranto and Mr. Habibie rammed the bill through in an effort to shore up the Government as political change sweeps through the country. **********''It's a reflection of how weak the Government is,'' said Salim Said, a military expert. ''It shows how much the Habibie Government is like the Suharto Government, always ready to use force.'' **********Mr. Said said the new law was less severe in some respects than the 1959 law, which was drafted at a time when Indonesia was riven by conflict. For instance, the old law did not require the President to obtain the consent of the House of Representatives before imposing a state of emergency. **********Still, Mr. Said questioned why the military would push for the law now, when it is trying to redefine its role in Indonesian life. The army has accepted a reduction in its number of seats in Parliament, and General Wiranto has been removing officers from key political posts in the provinces. **********''It shows you that our military is not politically well advised,'' Mr. Said said. ''Whatever they do, the students won't trust them.'' **********Certainly, the military had no allies on the streets today. **********Students goaded the riot police and soldiers by throwing stones and bottles while chanting: ''We won our independence! Now we must stay independent!'' **********Pamphlets on the street warned: ''If this law is approved, then the democracy we have struggled for is dead. The military can take control of the country anytime it wants.'' **********In Jakarta, at least, the police and soldiers seemed generally in control of the situation. At one point, a police commander could be heard ordering his troops: ''Don't shoot. Don't throw back the stones.'' **********Street demonstrations are a daily ritual in Jakarta, but the unrest has picked up markedly since an international military force arrived in East Timor this week. Now, on most days, demonstrators can be found in front of Parliament, at the Australian Embassy and at the offices of the United Nations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/28/business/offerings-scheduled-this-week-in-equity-market.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-06-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 531, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Offerings Scheduled This Week in Equity Market", "print_headline": "Offerings Scheduled This Week in Equity Market", "body_text": " **********The following equity and convertible debt offerings are expected this week: **********3Dshopping.com, Venice, Calif., Two million units, consisting of one common share and one warrant.

Dioxin contamination. Now, a scare over Coca-Cola. Shoppers in Europe might be forgiven for hesitating before even setting foot in a grocery store. **********And therein lies a serious problem for food manufacturers and retailers alike. **********Each new food scare causes immediate dislocations, of course, as grocers empty shelves, consumers hunt for alternatives and producers eat the losses and scramble to salvage their reputations. **********But underlying the headlines are more fundamental concerns: why food scares seem to be happening more often, what the cumulative impact will be on consumers and the food industry, and, not least, whether consumers are justified in their growing suspicions about the safety of their food. **********Ray Goldberg, the Moffett Professor of Agriculture and Business at the Harvard Business School and head of the agribusiness program there, surveyed the causes and implications last week.   CONSTANCE L. HAYS **********Q.  What is it about food scares that causes so much anxiety in people so readily? And why do there seem to be so many lately? **********A.  You basically have people changing the kinds of foods they want and not believing in the authorities who are supposed to protect them. It's a terrible combination. **********In Europe in particular, the credibility is very low. In the United Kingdom, the handling of mad cow disease destroyed the credibility of the Government, the scientists and, to some extent, even the news media. It was downplayed, and they really believed that you couldn't have such a disease transmitted from animals to humans. **********In the United States, the F.D.A. and the E.P.A. and the U.S.D.A. have done a better job. But even so, there are other factors that have caused these problems. We want more fresh prepared foods. We prefer unpasteurized fruit juices. So certain kinds of problems didn't exist before because of the various controls on processes. **********Q.  Why do the reactions to food scares in Europe seem so much more dramatic? **********A.  The reason is twofold. First, many of these countries are reluctant to admit they have a problem, for political reasons. With mad cow disease, the European Union knew about it, and almost went out of its way to hide the information, so there wouldn't be a scare. **********But then the immediate reaction of other nations, when they find out about it, is that the problem must be worse than they say. **********And in the case of genetically modified foods, especially, Europe seems to be much more sensitive. It goes back to World War II and genetic experimentation by the Nazis. The word ''genetic'' is almost a red flag. **********The other thing is that, in Europe, they cannot get people to comply. In the middle of mad cow disease, there were people grinding up dead animals and putting that back into the food system. Even when they have good rules and regulations, they can't get people to comply. **********Q.  Is there any hope that the recent wave of scares in Europe will lead to greater compliance? **********A.  It is changing. The problem is so bad that is has to change. And they have got a whole new generation of men and women who are just fed up with the politics of the past and the mistakes of the past. **********I just came back from an agribusiness conference in Italy. And do you know what the theme was? Trust. We had business leaders and the heads of consumer organizations, and in every case they were reaching out to each other. **********Q.  And they were sincere? **********A.  Absolutely. I would say they were extremely sincere. **********Q.  On the technology side, are there advances coming that might cut down on the frequency of food scares in the future, or help keep them from getting out of hand? **********A.  Traceability is becoming much more important in our food system. In the not too distant future, we are going to be able to bar-code every product, from a grain of cereal to a loaf of bread. These huge multinational corporations that have huge plants throughout the world have to lead the way. **********Also, there are firms that basically have developed ways to test and protect the authenticity of products that are being sold. Just as you have knock-offs of designer jeans and luggage, you have knock-offs of food. So people are constantly testing to reassure themselves. **********And as consolidation grows in the food system, it will become safer, because the unethical parts of the system will try to cut corners, but they will find themselves left out of the system."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/08/business/technology-patents-throw-away-that-cell-phone.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1999-11-08", "snippet": "Randice-Lisa Altschul patents technology that she says can be used to manufacture cellular telephones so inexpensively that they could be sold for fixed amount of air time and then tossed in garbage once minutes have been used up; claims her techn...", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Throw Away That Cell Phone", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY: PATENTS; Throw Away That Cell Phone", "body_text": " **********WE may live in a disposable society, but is the world ready for throw-away cell phones? Randice-Lisa Altschul thinks so. **********Ms. Altschul, a full-time inventor in Cliffside Park, N.J., has patented a technology that she says can be used to manufacture cellular phones so inexpensively that they could be sold for a fixed amount of air time -- as long-distance calling cards are -- and then tossed in the garbage once their minutes have been used up. **********Ms. Altschul, with the help of consulting engineers, essentially took a flexible circuit, which forms the innards of many cell phones today, and elongated it. **********This, she says, enables the flex circuit to be folded back upon itself, much like a large ribbon, thereby eliminating the need for most of the plastic housing found in other cell phones. **********''The circuit itself becomes the body of the unit,'' Ms. Altschul said. ''And it becomes its own built-in tamper-proof system because as soon as you cut it open, you break the circuits and the phone goes dead.'' **********Moreover, she contends, her technology can be used to greatly reduce the costs of manufacturing any electronic device that uses a flexible circuit. **********Patent 5,965,848 was granted in October to Ms. Altschul and Lee Volte, a former senior vice president for research and development at the toy maker Tyco. **********Ms. Altschul, 39, hit her first invention home run when she was 25. She had created a cops-vs.-cocaine-dealers game that took place on a map of Miami, and she persuaded the executive producer of the ''Miami Vice'' television series to let her call it the Miami Vice Game. Since then, Ms. Altschul has invented numerous other games, most notably Barbie's 30th Birthday Game. **********She has also recently patented other children's gear. Applause Inc. is selling her patented stuffed animals, which feature pocketlike arms into which children  can insert their arms. These enable the child to wave the stuffed animal's arms or to make it seem as if the animal is capable of giving hugs. **********And Ms. Altschul is looking to license her ''interactive cereal'' -- cereal sculpted into monster shapes that crumple into soggy heaps when doused with milk. **********So how did a toy-and-game inventor come to think up a new cellular phone technology? **********''I was driving in my car, and I kept losing my cell signal, and I wanted to throw my phone out the window. And -- bingo -- I came up with the idea,'' Ms. Altschul said. She immediately called her patent lawyer to see whether anyone else had patented such an idea. No one had. **********''The greatest asset I have over everyone else in that business is my toy mentality,'' she said. ''An engineer's mentality is to make something last, to make it durable. A toy's life span is about an hour, then the kid throws it away. You get it, you play with it and -- boom -- it's gone.'' **********Indeed, Ms. Altschul says her phone, which wouldn't require any entangling contracts or billing agreements, would appeal primarily to children, to harried mothers and to travelers who don't want to have to worry about keeping track of yet another expensive electronic device. **********She estimates that a phone with 60 minutes of air time could be produced for about $14 and would retail for about $20 -- perhaps not through normal retail channels, but, rather, as a marketing gimmick. To lure more lunch customers, for example, a restaurant like McDonald's might sell, at cost, a phone imprinted with the golden arches logo. **********''It's the ultimate in-your-face advertising,'' Ms. Altschul said. **********For that kind of money, though, don't expect any frills. The phone, powered by a six-volt battery, works for outgoing calls only, and it doesn't have a liquid crystal display. **********Ms. Altschul said the same technology could be used for a host of electronic devices, from hand-held electronic games to programmable fast-food debit cards. **********One of these might be a card sold for use with state lotteries or given away by casinos as promotional freebies. ''It's basically a slot machine in your pocket,'' she said. **********She also says her cellular phone could double as a credit card when it has a magnetic strip built into it. **********''The customer could swipe the phone instead of a credit card and upon approval of his purchase receive instant gratification in the form of more free air time,'' Ms. Altschul said. ''The more he uses his cell phone as a credit card, the more air time he will get.'' **********This would, of course, require an arrangement between retailers, cellular service providers and a credit card company. It would require a longer-lasting power source than the 60-minute battery Ms. Altschul envisions with the purely disposable cell phone. **********Ms. Altschul says she comes up with as many as 20 to 30 new ideas a week, but for the moment she is focusing most of her efforts on the phone and its various manifestations. **********So far she has sunk more than $1 million of her own money into the project. ''I'm talking to investors,'' she said. ''I'm at the point where I need the guys with deeper pockets.

Your focus should be to reduce the fear that just because you're a new manager you're going to make changes. **********Let the employees know where you stand on things and what you expect of them, Mr. Buys suggested.

Few workers have vented their frustrations by taking their own lives, and Mr. Nonaka, who leaves a wife and two grown daughters, is certainly an extreme case. But his suicide underscores the psychological distress that workers, managers and their families are undergoing as the country struggles to revive and restructure its economy. **********''It's a kind of performance,'' said Hiroyoshi Ishikawa, a professor of social psychology at Seijo University. ''It's a kind of protest to the company policy of restructuring.'' **********In modern Japan, hara-kiri, or seppuku, is almost entirely the stuff of Kabuki drama, and Mr. Nonaka's violent suicide is not seen as a sign of a grisly trend. But ritual disembowelment was part of a rigid code in which samurai warriors killed themselves by sinking their swords diagonally across their stomachs to avoid disgrace, dishonor and the indignity of defeat. **********When the Meiji Emperor died in 1912, Gen. Maresuke Nogi, a hero in the Russo-Japanese war, committed seppuku, killing his wife along with himself. **********Today, in a discussion that lasted about an hour in the executive offices with Yoichiro Kaizaki, Bridgestone's president, Mr. Nonaka had submitted a letter of complaint about the company's policies on retirement and resignation, the police said. **********Suddenly Mr. Nonaka became very agitated. He stripped off his clothes to the waist, took out a pair of  knives and screamed that he was going to commit hara-kiri. **********Mr. Kaizaki escaped from the room, where at least two other Bridgestone employees remained. At least 40 local police officers were sent to Bridgestone, along with riot policemen and other patrolmen, a police spokesman said. Mr. Kaizaki returned, and along with police officers, he tried to dissuade Mr. Nonaka from doing anything rash. But Mr. Nonaka suddenly stabbed himself.  He died later in the afternoon. **********The last celebrated case of seppuku was in 1970, when Yukio Mishima, a famous writer known for his psychologically violent novels, killed himself in samurai style after he failed to take over a command post to protest Japan's military policies. **********In 1989, a cook was found dead by his family's cemetery plot. In a will left near his car, he said he had committed suicide because of the death of the Emperor Hirohito. **********Mr. Nonaka, whom officials at both Bridgestone and its affiliate described as ''normal,'' sincere and serious, was two years short of retiring from the affiliate, Bridgestone Sports Co.. He had no record of prior disturbance, and Osamu Tezuka, a spokesman at the affiliate, insisted that the company had no intention of  forcing him into early retirement. **********But two years ago, Mr. Nonaka was demoted and his pay was cut, and in October, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a national daily, he was told by the company to step aside. This morning, Mr. Nonaka sent an E-mail to all employees in his company, but it was erased before employees could read it. **********''He seemed to be frustrated at his early retirement, even though this happens at other companies,'' said a Bridgestone spokeswoman, referring to his leaving the main company in 1992."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/20/business/outlook-2000-international-after-hard-year-latin-america-looks-for-better-times.html": {"writer_name": "Larry Rohter", "pub_date": "1999-12-20", "snippet": "Latin American nations experienced a difficult economic year in 1999, but signs are emerging that worst may be over; capital flowing into Latin America fell to $57 billion in 1999, only slightly more than half the $107 billion in 1997; chart of ca...", "word_count": 1341, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "After a Hard Year, Latin America Looks for Better Times", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK 2000: INTERNATIONAL; After a Hard Year, Latin America Looks for Better Times", "body_text": " **********On the theory that things cannot get much worse, Latin America is looking to the start of the new decade with anticipation. The last year has been a difficult one, more onerous even than the crisis that followed the Mexican meltdown starting in December 1994: It began with a currency collapse in Brazil, included a bond default in Ecuador and, with the numbers now toted up, is concluding with most of the region's large economies struggling to emerge from recession. **********''This has been a really lousy year, especially for South America,'' said Ricardo Hausmann, chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank, the lending agency based in Washington. ''We have seen traumatic declines in growth rates for all of Latin America, the result of a collapse both of international capital flows and commodity prices.'' **********Indeed, with the exception of oil, prices paid for the primary products that remain the backbone of the continent's exports, notably copper and coffee, dropped to near-record lows in 1999 before recovering slightly at the end of the year. And even with the price of oil climbing -- from less than $7 a barrel for Venezuelan crude in February to more than $23 currently -- the Venezuelan and Ecuadorean economies are expected to have contracted by more than 5 percent, a markedly worse performance than in hard-hit countries not dependent on oil, like Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. Consequently, Latin American governments have faced an increased need to turn to external financing to cover yawning current-account deficits, at the same time that direct investors and lenders have been pulling back from the region. **********According to the Inter-American Development Bank, capital flows into Latin America have fallen to $57 billion in 1999, slightly more than half the record $107 billion in 1997. Most of the money that is arriving has gone to the region's two giants: Brazil, which expects to close the year with $25 billion in direct investment, and Mexico. **********''Though the catastrophe initially foreseen during the Brazilian crisis in January has not occurred, overall capital flows have been for lesser amounts, more irregular, more costly and for shorter terms,'' said Jose Antonio Ocampo Gaviria, secretary general of the Economic Commission for Latin America, a United Nations organization based in Santiago, Chile, and known in Spanish as Cepal. ''The situation is clearly not yet normalized.'' **********There have been bright spots in this generally dismal picture. During 1999, Mexico grew at about a 4 percent clip, slightly less than 1998's rate but a standout by regional standards, and the Dominican Republic and countries of Central America also registered positive numbers. Not by coincidence, all those economies are more closely linked to the United States -- through the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico's case and a thriving maquila, or assembly, sector in the others -- than their South American counterparts. **********''Mexico was the star performer this year and is likely to repeat that role next year, but it has to be considered a special case,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, director of the Center for the World Economy at the Getulio Vargas Foundation here, Brazil's leading economic research center. ''They have corrected some of the serious problems from 1995, and they have also benefited from navigating in the wake of the incredible expansion of the American economy.'' **********Signs are emerging that the worst may be past for South America. Most forecasts for the coming year are predicting combined growth of at least 3 percent, led by increased demand for Latin American commodities and manufactured goods in Europe and East Asia. Inflation has generally been contained, despite pressure on exchange rates, which in the case of Brazil, Chile and Colombia have been made more flexible, and interest rates are dropping. **********''I'm very optimistic about 2000 for Latin America, though it is important to stress that what we are going to be seeing is a recovery, not a full-blown expansion,'' said Walter Molano, director of research at BCP Securities in Greenwich, Conn. ''The fall has been broken, portfolio inflows should pick up very strongly again next year, and we may see a real expansion begin by 2001.'' **********As always, much depends on Brazil, which has endured two consecutive years of stagnation. Just as Germany is the locomotive for the European Union, Brazil, the eighth-largest economy in the world, is the motor for South America, especially for its neighbors and partners in Mercosur, the customs union that includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay as full members and Bolivia and Chile as associate members. **********''If market sentiment toward Latin American countries improves and Brazil's competitiveness gains are preserved,'' a report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development concluded, ''strengthening exports, declining interest rates and a payoff from structural reforms undertaken over the past year will underpin a return to positive growth next year and provide impetus for rising expansion in 2001.'' **********For all that to come to fruition, though, regional commerce needs to pick up again. After expanding markedly throughout the first half of the decade, thanks to the emergence of Mercosur and the Andean Pact, trade within South America dipped about 30 percent in 1999, according to Cepal's calculations, as countries sought to contain their imports. **********Furthermore, given the Clinton administration's inability to gain sufficient support in Congress to liberalize trade and the fact that an election year is starting in the United States, the 2005 deadline for the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas that would stretch from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego seems an increasingly difficult objective. As a result, Latin America's search for alternatives outside the hemisphere seems to be accelerating, and is expected to intensify as a result of the recent failure in Seattle. **********Mexico, for instance, has just signed a free trade agreement with the European Union, which has also opened similar talks with Mercosur. ''Countries are all of a sudden realizing they need to compete on a global, as opposed to regional, scale,'' Mr. Molano said. ''This is actually healthy because it is what they should have been doing all along.'' **********The political situation throughout the region remains imponderable. After a decade of belt-tightening, voters are demanding results for their sacrifices, and to express their growing impatience and dissatisfaction have elected people like Hugo Chavez, the former paratrooper and coup leader who is now president of Venezuela, or voted heavily for more traditional leftists like Tabare Vazquez of Uruguay or Ricardo Lagos of Chile. **********''Chavez is not an aberration'' but the harbinger of ''a revisionist movement such as we saw earlier in Eastern Europe,'' warned Jerry Haar, director of the Inter-American Business and Labor program at the University of Miami. ''Neoliberal reform takes no prisoners, and a lot of these governments have failed to provide a safety net or focus on the tax and regulatory policies necessary to make free market development work and target allocations to those in need.'' **********The region needs more capitalism or opening of markets, he maintains. For that reason, he and other specialists emphasize, Latin American governments need to move ahead on the so-called second generation structural changes that they may be tempted to postpone in the face of political doubts: in tax rates and collections, regulatory policies and accountability in revenue-sharing with states. **********''The process of recovery within the region is going to continue to depend on new types of institutional reform,'' Mr. Langoni, a former president of the Brazilian central bank, said. Indeed, he argues, one reason Brazil has proved so resilient in bouncing back from January's 40 percent currency devaluation, compared to the past, is that ''the opening of the economy, with the lowering of tariff rates and the elimination of indexation measures, has helped greatly in absorbing the impact of these exchange-rate crises.'' **********Still, to a larger extent than in advanced industrial regions, Latin America may not be fully the master of its own fate. As the fallout from crises in East Asia and Eastern Europe in recent years has shown, all that would be needed to erase many of the gains expected in 2000 is the appearance of new problems in, say, Indonesia and renewed skittishness among investors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/17/business/company-news-unisys-plans-to-add-4000-to-work-force-in-coming-year.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-12-17", "snippet": "Unisys Corp plans to add about 4,000 employees next year, expanding its work force by 11 percent; about 85 percent of new employees will work for Unisys's service business; rest will work in computer manufacturing (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "UNISYS PLANS TO ADD 4,000 TO WORK FORCE IN COMING YEAR", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; UNISYS PLANS TO ADD 4,000 TO WORK FORCE IN COMING YEAR", "body_text": " **********The Unisys Corporation plans to add about 4,000 employees next year, expanding its work force 11 percent.

To have troops numbering about 150,000 in place in the region by mid-August, decisions to deploy them would have to be made by mid-June, the officials said. **********A senior Pentagon official said that even mid-June might be too late for a decision. **********And the time for deciding is narrowing as leaders focus on the diplomatic summit meeting on June 18 of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations and Russia in Cologne, Germany, where the Kosovo conflict is expected to dominate the agenda between Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. **********The White House has repeatedly tried to avoid public discussion of combat forces, fearful of public opinion polls that show there is little appetite for such a venture and of a likely backlash against American casualties that would inevitably occur. **********The American commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, has made little secret of his belief in the need for an invasion force. The Pentagon told him last week not to come for the White House meeting on Thursday, a NATO official said. **********''They don't want a vigorous presentation of what they know he will present and what he thinks is necessary to win,'' the official said of the Administration's reluctance about an invasion force. **********Leaving open the threat of deploying ground troops could increase pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to agree to a diplomatic settlement. **********In another effort to increase pressure on Mr. Milosevic, the Administration and NATO agreed last week to move more troops to Macedonia in preparation for a role as part of an expanded 48,000 peacekeeping force in Kosovo if a settlement is achieved. **********The Washington meeting is set for the day after President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland is to meet with Mr. Milosevic to discuss a peace settlement. **********But with a successful diplomatic outcome still far from certain, NATO officials said the Administration has to look at the options for an invasion force to defeat the Yugoslav military and clear Kosovo for the return of more than 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees. **********The meeting on Thursday between Mr. Clinton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton; the Vice Chairman, Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, and the heads of the four branches of military service would cover the gamut of military options for Kosovo, with the invasion force being the newest element on the agenda, officials said. **********Since the conflict began, Mr. Clinton has often met with General Shelton and General Ralston, but not with the full complement of military advisers. **********The Joint Chiefs are said to have deep reservations about mounting an invasion of Kosovo, but are not necessarily opposed to the exercise of planning such an operation. **********Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and General Shelton reflect the Pentagon's wariness over the question of a ground campaign. **********Members of the Joint Chiefs have generally been reticent in public about ground troops. But Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, the Army's Chief of Staff, said last week that it was uncertain whether the air campaign would prevail and, without specifically mentioning ground troops, said, ''my view, in general terms, is that if you're going to use military force, using the total military force available to you is the right way to go.'' **********The Administration continues to concentrate its efforts on the air strikes coupled with diplomacy and would like to have a diplomatic solution in place by the time of the meetings in Cologne between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin. **********But if Mr. Milosevic proves to be intractable during the meeting with Mr. Ahtisaari and the Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Administration will, at the very least, have to consider an invasion force. **********And if the Cologne conference fails to produce a diplomatic solution, the Administration should be ready with a decision on an invasion force, a NATO diplomat said. A decision on an invasion force cannot ''drop from the sky,'' but has to be prepared now, the diplomat said. **********''In the next few days, a week, there will be serious discussion of ground troops for the first time,'' an Administration official said. ''People are coming to the point of very sobering talks about ground troops. It's all coming to a point of convergence.'' **********In that context, ground troops means a contingent of more than 150,000 troops, which would come mostly from the United States, Britain and possibly France, NATO officials said. **********NATO can mount such a force with only some partners if the other members do not veto the idea. **********In Bonn last week, Mr. Cohen discussed the option of an invasion force with his colleagues from four NATO countries. **********He did not advocate an invasion force and did not mention the number of troops that the United States would be willing to commit, a NATO official said. But he laid the ground work for a possible invasion force by asking Germany to refrain from saying that it would block NATO from sending one, a NATO diplomat said. **********Two weeks ago, the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, declared an invasion by combat troops ''unthinkable'' and said his Government would block such a move. In the last week, German officials have been less outspoken against combat troops and have been pushing a diplomatic solution. **********At the Bonn meeting attended by Mr. Cohen and in other talks, NATO officials said Britain had offered 50,000 troops for an invasion force. **********NATO officials said General Clark had briefed the defense ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy early last week on how an invasion force would operate. **********The timetable for getting troops to Albania and Macedonia, the most likely staging areas for an invasion of Kosovo, would be dictated largely by the onset of winter weather there in October. The Serbian troops would have to be out of Kosovo by October for there to be any reasonable chance for the refugees now squatting in tent cities in Macedonia and Albania to return home. **********The mounting of an invasion force presents a huge logistical operation involving decisions on what forces are to be used and how much is to be spent on transportation by sea or air in getting them to the theater. Decisions have to be made on which reserves to mobilize and what armor and ammunition to ship. **********Plans at NATO for combat troops call for the soldiers to enter Kosovo from Macedonia and Albania, a NATO official said. **********''If you want to use ships, you've got to start moving things to ports,'' the official said, ''and you have to do it very soon. The Administration knows very well the window is not open much longer.'' **********But the official said he was not confident that the White House would agree to an invasion force. Nor did he predict that the air campaign would achieve the stated objective of getting Mr. Milosevic to withdraw his troops from Kosovo. **********''Hillary Clinton recently visited the ethnic Albanian refugees in Macedonia,'' the official said.

If the issue were narrowly about trade and economics, the two sides would probably have little trouble shaking hands. **********China, one of the world's major trading powers, wants membership in the organization that sets and adjudicates the rules. The Clinton Administration thinks that is just fine -- as long as China agrees to open its borders widely to imports and foreign investors. There is plenty of economic room for a deal. **********But Mr. Clinton and Mr. Zhu are hemmed in by politics. The President must look over his shoulders at the Republicans who want no accord at all and the Democrats who want the deal to satisfy every one of their constituencies. Mr. Zhu faces domestic problems from those within the Communist Party who are not enthusiastic about market reforms and from managers and workers in protected sectors who risk losing their jobs. The problem is that neither side appears to know exactly where the other side's bottom line lies. **********What is known is that China wants to insure that its critical textile and apparel industries are not discriminated against as global quotas are relaxed. At the same time, it is looking for enough time to conform to international trading rules so that its authoritarian leaders can minimize internal disruption and resistance. The United States wants to quickly knock down dozens of barriers that keep American goods, services and investors out of China's potentially vast markets. But beyond the generalities are layers of confusing and contradictory forces. **********Take the argument by some Republicans leaders, from Gary Bauer, a Presidential hopeful, to Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, that China should not be awarded entrance into the world's trading community in the wake of human rights violations, accusations of nuclear espionage, illegal campaign contributions to President Clinton and burgeoning trade surpluses. But to many economists, this argument makes little sense. **********''The big winner is the United States -- or at least American corporations. The United States has few carrots to offer the Chinese to sign a deal,'' says Nicholas Lardy of the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''The economic benefits of W.T.O. membership for China are relatively meager.'' **********Mr. Lardy's point is that American markets are already essentially open to China. So are every other country's. China gains little by entering the World Trade Organization.  But many of China's markets are closed. High tariffs, bans on agricultural imports, rules that shut out foreign firms and restrict foreign investors, loose enforcement of copyright protections and regulations that prevent foreign companies from selling goods directly to Chinese customers combine to keep American exports low. Last year, China ran a huge trade surplus with the United States of nearly $60 billion, only slightly behind Japan's. **********Though bilateral trade deficits are economically benign, economists say, they are politically incendiary. One way for Mr. Clinton to chip away at the trade deficit with China is to make China friendlier to American exports. **********It is important to keep the economic argument in perspective. Extra trade with China will not do much for the average American. Even trade worth more than $85 billion a year between the United States and China is simply too small -- little more than 1 percent -- to make much of a dent in an $8 trillion American economy one way or the other. But Mr. Clinton's chief trade official, Charlene Barshefsky, has spent years negotiating on behalf of excluded insurance, pharmaceutical, farm and telecommunications interests. Hard bargaining could do wonders for specific companies, even certain sectors, but not for the economy as a whole. **********The other payoff for the United States is political. The trade organization, whose fair-trade rules disproportionately help American exporters, will suffer without the cooperation of China, already one of the largest trading countries. The United States would be better off if China were inside the World Trade Organization tent rather than disrupting it from the outside. **********For the United States, the main drawback would be that it could no longer easily impose unilateral sanctions for China's sins. In most instances, the United States would be obligated to first bring its complaint before an international judicial panel. But that is not much of a burden: those panels have provided effective relief so far in every case where Washington has brought valid complaints. **********Some Democrats will oppose China's formal entry into the global trading regime for the same protectionist reasons they opposed a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Yet the argument that trade with low-wage countries hurts American workers was weak when applied to Mexico -- the United States' second-largest export market after Canada -- and weaker still when applied to a distant, less pervasive trade partner. The data show, Mr. Lardy says, that imports from China come largely at the expense of other Asian exporters. **********China's benefits from membership are more distant. The Chinese are among the world's lowest-cost producers of textiles. But their exports are limited by quotas imposed by the United States and many other countries. These quotas will, by international agreement, be phased out within the next few years under rules that will be set by the World Trade Organization. China knows it can best protect its interest if is part of the organization that will draw up the rules. **********Beyond that, the big payoff of membership may well be to consolidate China's move to the market and thereby cement Mr. Zhu's position within the Chinese political establishment. Prof. Barry Naughton of the University of California at San Diego says that it is ''absolutely clear that Mr. Zhu is driving toward markets.'' As proof, he cites Mr. Zhu's willingness to see one of seven workers in state-owned factories thrown off his job to close worthless state-owned enterprises. Moreover, nearly all goods in China are now traded in markets free of price controls. **********No one knows what economic model Mr. Zhu has in mind. It might include a heavy government hand, as in South Korea. It might include large government-run sectors in transportation and health. ''Yet Mr. Zhu's overall direction is clear,'' Professor Naughton said. '' An international accord that locks China into market-opening reforms may make it easier for Mr. Zhu to fend off attempts to slide back into government planning.'' **********Though economists are mostly enthusiastic about China's entry into the World Trade Organization, they flag possible pitfalls. ''There is danger in demanding too much from China,'' said Dwight Perkins, a professor at Harvard. ''A country with half of its population in agriculture cannot be expected to open up its food markets entirely. A banking system loaded down with bad loans to state-owned factories may not survive vigorous competition from foreign banks.'' **********Professor Perkins is convinced that China's membership in the trade group makes sense for both sides. But he wants the deal to give Chinese banks and agriculture time to adjust. That means, he says, phasing in market reforms over five or more years, though there ought to be strict deadlines for every market-opening measure, so that China cannot dither. **********Greg Mastel of the Economic Strategy Institute, while agreeing that Beijing should be joining the trade group, worries that the China lacks the discipline of markets or legally enforced rules. He points to Chinese violations of the trade accord it struck with the Bush Administration. China, he says, did not live up to promises to open up government contracts to foreigners or abandon import licenses and other trade restrictions. **********''If China does not obey the rules once it is inside the tent,'' Mr. Mastel warns, ''the credibility of the tent is at risk.'' **********Mr. Mastel thinks that World Trade Organization panels might be largely ineffective in monitoring economic practices in China's closed society because they lack the power to compel the presentation of documents. He wants the deal to include a safeguard provision that would allow the United States to withdraw unilaterally if it deems China out of compliance. Mr. Lardy of Brookings calls for a more limited safeguard that would allow the United States to slap tariffs on its imports from China if they soar. **********The idea of safeguards is to take the risk out of the political calculations on Capitol Hill that stand in the way of Chinese entry into the trade group. And that would be a small price to pay, Mr. Mastel says, to help ''make the world's largest nonmarket economy into a market economy -- the most important economic task on the global agenda.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/18/business/international-business-down-and-out-in-rural-canada.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1999-12-18", "snippet": "Free market prices are deeply cutting farm subsidies in rural Canada, allowing inefficient farmers to fail and promoting productive techniques for survivors, changes that have radically altered landscape; Canada has cut annual farm subsidies to ab...", "word_count": 1516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Down And Out In Rural Canada", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Down And Out In Rural Canada", "body_text": " **********A century ago, European farmers spilled across Canada's western prairies, creating ''little Europes.'' As recently as the 1950's, this farming village outside Winnipeg could have been in Germany, supporting one restaurant, two churches, three stores and a high school. **********But free market policies -- deeply cutting farm subsidies, allowing inefficient farmers to fail, and promoting productive techniques for the survivors -- have radically transformed the human landscape here. **********''Twenty-five years ago, there were 25 families on this land -- now there is only one,'' said Ron Hiebert, a 49-year-old wheat farmer, driving over the 8,900 acres he farms with his family. Sperling's population has dropped in half since 1970, to 100 people, he said, and ''all we have now is the post office and the rink.'' **********At the turn of the century, this is precisely the rural depopulation feared by Old World agricultural Europe. It has seen the farming revolutions wrought in the ''overseas Europes'' -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada and the United States -- and wants nothing to do with them. Its resistance to any change in European farming, in fact, is a major reason why the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle collapsed early this month. **********To justify their $130 billion in annual farm subsidies, European Union officials divert discussion from the costs for consumers and taxpayers to talk of keeping people on the land and of preserving rural landscapes for tourists. **********It is a little late for Canada, which has cut annual farm subsidies to about $3 billion today. With farming now employing only 3 percent of Canada's work force, farmers worry that they have lost the population and political influence to fight for their interests. **********Following free trade recipes from earlier international trade meetings, Canada has cut wheat subsidies from 31 percent of gross receipts in 1991 to 9 percent today, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At the same time, the two other major wheat producers kept subsidies high -- 38 percent in the United States and 56 percent in the European Union. Australia's wheat subsidy is 4 percent. New Zealand has none. **********Today, skepticism prevails in Canada's breadbasket when people hear that Ottawa vows to make cuts in overseas farm subsidies its priority -- when and if the W.T.O. can convene new trade negotiations. **********''We took the Captain Canuck, Dudley-do-Right attitude that trade agreements would be followed,'' said John V. Morriss, editor of the Manitoba Co-operator, a farm weekly. Even if new trade talks happen, he said, ''Nobody outside of Ottawa thinks this is going to work.'' **********At the Canadian Wheat Board, a government agency based in Winnipeg, Gordon Miles, the executive vice president, said: ''Canada stepped up and eliminated their wheat subsidy. The Europeans didn't. The Americans didn't.'' **********[In an interview published Friday in The Globe and Mail, the European Union's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, reiterated the group's opposition to efforts by Canada to seek lower European farm subsidies.] **********Overseas, Canada is revered, even feared, as a lean and mean agricultural powerhouse. Planting 90 million acres a year, farmers harvest a cornucopia of crops, including an annual average of 25 million tons of wheat. The world's second-largest wheat exporter, after the United States, Canada controls about 20 percent of the world market. In durum wheat, essential for pasta, it controls almost two-thirds of the internationally traded supply. **********But inside the powerhouse, Canadian farmers feel besieged. **********Journalists in Canadian cities write dismissively of ''farm crisis fatigue,'' and openly suggest that some of western Canada's farmland should be returned to wilderness. **********Blaming American and European subsidies for extremely low wheat prices, the premiers of two prairie provinces, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, went to Ottawa in late October to seek aid, or what they called ''trade equalization payments.'' In response, Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief promised $115 million -- one-eighth of what they had sought. The minister, a member of the Liberal Party, a party with little western rural support, essentially told the premiers that Canada has too many farmers. He described his policy as ''tough love.'' **********''Why should farmers be rescued to any greater degree than miners or foresters, all of whom were affected by the slump in commodity markets?'' The Globe and Mail newspaper editorialized of the austere position of the minister, who himself failed last year as an Ontario fruit and vegetable farmer. ''Farmers have cried crisis frequently enough over the years to trigger a wolf whistle when they come to Ottawa.'' **********In response, John Cooper, an Alberta farmer, wrote in The National Post, Canada's other national newspaper: ''I feel I am under the heel of the enemy. That is how I view Ottawa, and maybe all urban people.'' **********Even before the minister told farmers to sink or swim, 5 percent of prairie farmers interviewed in August by Angus Reid, a polling group, said they planned to abandon farming; 41 percent said they were ''considering'' leaving farming. **********Last summer, as wheat prices fell to the lowest levels in a decade, prairie farmers blocked highways, drove in tractorcades to Ottawa, and talked of blocking food shipments to eastern cities. One farmer, speaking at a rally in front of Saskatchewan's legislative assembly, brandished a handful of iron spikes and said, ''If the family farm is not supported, the railways are coming out, too.'' **********But in Canada's plains, where agriculture has dominated the economy, farmers were shocked when some impatient drivers responded to  blockades with obscene hand signals. **********In Manitoba, the hardest hit state, farm income is forecast to plummet this year to $33 million -- only 14 percent of the annual average of the last five years. In contrast, the province's manufactured exports have tripled during the 1990's, surpassing agricultural exports last year for the first time. In 1998, this province of 1.1 million people exported $677 million worth of oil seeds and cereal grains, compared with $900 million worth of buses and aircraft parts. **********In a demographic shift that spells a loss of rural access to government tax money and political influence, the majority of western Canadians now live in cities. Of the nation's 217,000 farming families, only a minority make more than half of their income from farming. **********With dwindling influence, the farmers see little prospect that Ottawa will challenge the farm subsidies of the United States, which total $47 billion a year. The reluctance is partly because American demand for Canadian products is vital to Canada's economic well-being. **********In the first 10 months of this year, Canada's trade surplus with the United States hit $31.5 billion, two-thirds higher than in the corresponding period a year earlier. Canada runs a trade deficit with all its other major trading partners. **********Now, some farmers are turning Ottawa's free market guns on itself, demanding abolition of the Canadian Wheat Board, a government monopoly-purchasing system that started as a war measure in 1943. **********Dedicated to ''orderly marketing,'' this state company buys all the wheat and barley grown for export in western Canada, sells it overseas, and pays farmers the average, or ''pool'' price. Mr. Miles, the board official, said in Winnipeg, ''Because of the strength of the monopoly, we can extract better prices.'' **********But across the street, at the Western Canadian Wheat Growers' headquarters, officials point to independent surveys that indicate Canadian wheat farmers get as little as 80 percent of the price charged by their American farming neighbors. **********''Our farmer knows darn well that he is getting a lower price than the farmer across the border,'' said Paul D. Earl, a manager for the group of 6,000 big western Canada farmers. ''The position of our organization is that the Canadian Wheat Board should be a voluntary organization.'' **********In September, Elwin Hermanson, Saskatchewan's conservative candidate for premier, swept rural districts in part by criticizing the Wheat Board's monopoly. But even in Saskatchewan, the province with the highest proportion of rural residents, Roy Romanow was re-elected premier on the strength of city votes. **********Some farmers contend that the monopoly has retarded development of western flour and pasta mills, processing operations that add value in the region. **********Voting with their seeds, many farmers have switched to canola, a crop that is marketed privately, outside the board's control. Last year for the first time, canola, which is crushed for edible oil, overtook wheat to become Canada's most important source of farm income. **********But to preserve soils, farmers must regularly rotate their crops and plant wheat, generally about every three years. At his farmhouse here, Mr. Hiebert regularly checks his desktop commodities monitor, looking for the best moment to sell his oats, lentils or flax to any of a dozen private companies. **********But, although he is only a 45-minute drive from the North Dakota border, he knows the penalties for trying to drive a truckload of his own wheat out of Canada. Referring to Canadian customs officials, he said,  ''They would throw me in jail.'' **********During the last upward spike in wheat prices, in the mid-1990's, about half a dozen western Canadian farmers went to jail for trying to export their own wheat. **********The proof of the state monopoly's inefficiency, said Jim Pallister, a farmer opponent, is that American farmers rarely try to send their wheat north to get Canadian prices.

And that little fur ball with the attitude is back -- with cousins. **********There is no shortage of theme material for this year's crop of toys, which retailers will get their first look at on Monday when the 96th annual American International Toy Fair gets under way in New York. **********Toy makers hope the products, which will hit store shelves later this year, ultimately land in millions of toy chests. Many reflect the growing importance of technology in children's play. **********''As we move forward, you can expect to see many more examples of the use of technology in toys,'' said Peter Eio, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America, sponsor of the fair. **********For instance, Hasbro Inc. is introducing E-mail versions of games like Scrabble that enable players to compete by computer. The Microsoft Corporation is pushing into toyland with an expanded line of Actimates plush toys that children can interact with. And Mattel Inc. has several CD-ROM's that bring Barbie to life on computer as she plays ''extreme sports'' and dances to funky music. **********In fact, Barbie is apparently in the midst of a midlife crisis. She is sporting tattoos, glitter press-on nails and leopard-print swim wear and matching sunglasses. To commemorate her age, Mattel has created a more understated collectors' version, still no wrinkles, that incorporates the look of the 1959 original. **********Toys based on the first of the new Star Wars films are expected to be big sellers this year. ''Star Wars: the Phantom Menace,'' which is set in a future that predates that of the films of the Star Wars trilogy, is scheduled to be released in May. So companies without products tied to the movie are ''trying to launch toys earlier in the year to sort of stay out of the way of Star Wars,'' said Cliff Annicelli, associate editor of Playthings magazine, a trade publication. **********Bandai, the company behind the Power Rangers, for instance, is already selling this year's action-figure versions of those characters. **********Two companies that are expected to capitalize on Star Wars are Hasbro and Lego Group. Hasbro will introduce Star Wars action figures and vehicles at the fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, while Lego is coming out with a new version of its electronic Lego Mindstorms robots based on the movie's characters. The robots, assembled in much the same way as the classic Lego blocks, move, chirp and obey electronic commands. **********Wrestling is also a big theme this year, reflecting the growing number of World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling fans. Of course, the public relations lift the sport has enjoyed since Jesse (The Body) Ventura switched vocations has not hurt. That is Governor Ventura to the Minnesota electorate, which voted him into office in November. **********This year, Jakks Pacific Inc. and Toy Biz Inc. are battling it out with competing lines of popular wrestling action figures. Jakks has World Wrestling Federation figures, including Sweating Superstars -- yes, they simulate perspiration -- and Toy Biz is countering with World Championship Wrestling figures with mechanical features. **********Also this year, companies are updating recent best sellers in hopes of keeping youngsters interested another year. So if you have had it with Furby, too bad. It is back and has brought along some relatives. Furby now comes with new fur patterns, and Tiger Electronics, the division of Hasbro that makes the interactive stuffed animal, is retiring the originals, which is likely to create a greater frenzy for the remaining few. **********''We have only scratched the surface with Furby,'' said Lana Simon, a spokeswoman for Tiger. **********Now, there are Furby games, accessories and even a Furby Halloween costume. And Tiger is introducing Baby Furby, a smaller version of the original that babbles and gurgles and fits more easily into a backpack. One catch: At $30, Baby Furbys cost about the same as the original though they are nearly half the size. **********Other well-known characters have been given new features, too. Teletubbie pals, whose names most preschoolers know as well as their own, now have light-up tummies, while Barney, the purple dinosaur that seems to defy extinction, has learned to play the banjo since last year. **********Indeed, toy makers have decided  that creating a stuffed animal that simply sits there looking cute will no longer do. After all, Tickle Me Elmo and Sing and Snore Ernie proved that plush toys with personality sell well in what has typically been a slow-growth category. So companies have been coming up with new ways to make plush toys gyrate and wiggle ever since. **********This year Elmo and Ernie, which are from Mattel's Fisher-Price unit, play the guitar and sing rock songs. And Winnie the Pooh responds to a child's voice with songs and jokes. **********And once again manufacturers have created beanie everything, from Furby Buddies to Blue's Clues miniatures. With Ty Inc.'s wildly popular Beanie Babies continuing to capture the imaginations -- and allowances -- of children, toy companies that make virtually any kind of stuffed animals are making miniature bean bag versions to try to creating their own Beanie-mania. **********Some themes, though, have begun to wane. Virtual pets, the rage two years ago, have fizzled. That may come as a great relief to parents and teachers who were fed up with children's preoccupation with the plastic playmates, which required constant care lest they die in a backpack or lunch box. Sales of virtual pets, like Tamagotchi and Giga Pets, plunged nearly 80 percent, to $45 million last year, according to the toy manufacturers group. **********Youngsters' often fleeting fascination with the toy of the moment is exactly why the industry, despite all the new products, is expecting only a modest improvement over last year's stagnant results. For 1998, wholesale shipments were virtually flat at $15.2 billion, and companies like Mattel and the retailer Toys ''R'' Us had disappointing years. **********''In total, I think we can expect the combination of the toy and video-game industry will grow by between 3 and 5 percent in 1999,'' said Mr. Eio of the manufacturers group, ''with much of the traditional toy increase coming from Star Wars-related merchandise.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/09/business/strong-debut-for-e-stamp.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strong Debut for E-Stamp", "print_headline": "Strong Debut for E-Stamp", "body_text": " **********The shares of the E-Stamp Corporation, the company that sells postage on line, ended their first day of trading yesterday almost 32 percent above the initial offer price.

[Excerpts, page A10.] **********The commission listed the American training of the officer corps in counterinsurgency techniques as a key factor that ''had a significant bearing on human rights violations during the armed confrontation.'' **********Christian Tomuschat, the German jurist who headed the panel, said, ''The United States Government, through its constituent structures, including the Central Intelligence Agency, lent direct and indirect support to illegal state operations.'' **********That support helped Guatemalan military and paramilitary units engage in kidnapping, torture and executions, a staff member of the commission said. The aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the panel also found evidence that the United States had knowledge of genocide and still supported the Guatemalan military. **********The commission, set up as a part of a United Nations-supervised peace accord that ended the war in 1996, concluded that either the Government or allied paramilitary groups were to blame for more than 90 percent of the 42,000 humans rights violations, 29,000 of which resulted in deaths or disappearances. That attributes a somewhat higher percentage of deaths to the Government and its allies than did a report last year by the Roman Catholic Church. **********The commission, which conducted an 18-month investigation, specifically named military intelligence as the organizer of illegal detentions, torture, disappearances and executions, but it stopped short of identifying individuals responsible. **********As the conclusions were read at a solemn ceremony at the National Theater, rights workers, relatives of victims and others among the 2,000 people broke into standing ovations, sobs, shouts and chants of ''Justice! Justice!'' **********The outbursts repeatedly interrupted the presentation as President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and Cabinet members sat silently in the first row. **********While the scope of the bloodshed had been generally known, the report today is the first by an internationally supported panel to blame the Government and its military allies. In unexpectedly strong language, it describes the policy of the Government and military at the height of the war as genocide. **********The report's estimate of more than 200,000 deaths is slightly higher than previous figures, and the number of documented massacres substantially exceeds previous figures. **********The war, which began in 1960, pitted a rightist military-controlled Government against a classic Latin American left-wing insurgency. In waging a war largely in the hinterlands where Mayans lived, the military assumed that the Mayans sympathized with the insurgents and provided them with supplies, information and shelter. **********As a consequence, entire Mayan villages were attacked and burned and their inhabitants were slaughtered in an effort to deny the guerrillas protection. The report said the Mayans paid the highest price when the military identified them as natural allies of the guerrillas. **********The result, the report said today, was an ''aggressive, racist and extremely cruel nature of violations that resulted in the massive extermination of defenseless Mayan communities.'' **********Mr. Tomuschat, the chairman, said, ''The results of our investigation demonstrate that, in general, the excuse that midlevel commanders acted with a wide margin of autonomy -- an excuse used in an attempt to justify what happened as 'excesses' and 'error' not ordered by superiors -- is unsubstantiated and totally lacking any basis.'' **********The commission recommended a national reparations program and exhumations of ''hundreds'' of bodies from clandestine cemeteries, and called on President Arzu and the former guerrilla commanders to assume responsibility and ask all Guatemalans for forgiveness. **********The three-member commission and an international staff of 272 made extensive use of declassified documents from the United States, and the documents showed that  American agencies fortified the Guatemalan armed forces with training in their anti-Communist campaign, the panel said. **********Mr. Tomuschat said the investigation also found that until the mid-1980's, American companies and Government officials ''exercised pressure to maintain the country's archaic and unjust socio-economic structure,'' and that the C.I.A. supported illegal counterinsurgency operations. **********Besides Mr. Tomuschat, the commission members were Edgar Balsells, a lawyer, and Otilia Lux Coti, a leading Mayan educator, both of Guatemala. **********The commission did not give specific names of human rights violators, the result of military opposition during the peace talks to pointing fingers at individuals. But some victims' families said no true reconciliation could be achieved without judicial accountability. **********''There has to be an end to impunity,'' said Helen Mack, whose sister, Myrna, was killed in 1990, it is believed, for her research on the refugees driven from their homes by the army. The case resulted in the only conviction yet of an army official for rights violations, and Ms. Mack is pursuing the trial of three other officers for her sister's murder. **********Today, the weight of nine years of struggle with Guatemala's ineffective judicial system seemed to fall on her as she broke into tears as the commission's conclusions were read. **********''We the victims feel vindicated,' she said later. ''No one can now tell us we're following lies or ghosts anymore.'' **********Guatemalan officials said today that they would have a response after they study the report. The army leadership has remained defiant, accusing international and national ''actors'' for their roles in the violence and insisting that the military acted under a constitutional mandate to defend the state from Communism. **********Asked about the accusations against the C.I.A. by the commission, the spokesman for the intelligence agency, Bill Harlow, said: ''Since we have not seen the report, it would be inappropriate for us to comment.'' **********Donald Planty, the United States Ambassador, said, ''I believe that the report's focus is appropriate, that these were abuses committed by Guatemalans against other Guatemalans, the result of an internal conflict.'' The report did not ask the United States for reparations. **********Defense Minister Hector M. Barrios, who has promised his own report on the war dead and injured, said today, ''I see as positive any effort that is made on behalf of peaceful coexistence in Guatemala.'' **********President Arzu left without comment after shaking hands with members of the commission and those formally receiving the report: Alvaro de Soto, a senior United Nations official, and representatives of the Guatemalan Government and the former guerrilla group, Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity. **********Aides said protocol prevented the President from personally accepting the report, but that decision was seen by many here as intentionally distancing the Government from the commission's findings. At several points today, people in the theater shouted for the President to get up on stage and receive the report. **********At the ceremony, the nine volumes were provided only to the representative of the government, the rebels and and the United Nations. The commission issued only an 86-page summary to the public. **********Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein said the Government was already carrying out some recommendations, including compensation for victims, judicial reform and changes in the military. Political repression has been greatly reduced, by most accounts, and the guerrillas have regrouped as a political party. There has also been a rise of groups promoting the rights of indigenous people. **********The changing times were underscored today when scores of Guatemalans openly confronted Government officials in angry outbursts. **********But the country is still wrestling with its transition to a full democratic state. Stark poverty and economic inequalities remain. Despite a requirement under the peace accord that the army's size and role be reduced, monitors say the army still has a hold on internal affairs. **********Just how fragile the peace is was shown last year when a Catholic defender of human rights, Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi, was beaten to death with a concrete block just days after announcing the results of a three-year investigation of abuses during the war. That report identified specific military officers and guerrilla groups, and church and rights groups say they believe that the killing was meant to pressure them into remaining silent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/12/business/law-firms-approve-us-british-merger.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-07-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Law Firms Approve U.S.-British Merger", "print_headline": "Law Firms Approve U.S.-British Merger", "body_text": " **********Lawyers at Rogers & Wells in New York and Clifford Chance in London approved a merger of their firms, the first combination between major British and American law firms. **********The firms' partners also said they had agreed to push forward with plans to merge with Germany's third-largest law firm -- a move that would create the largest law firm in the world in terms of both lawyers and revenue, displacing two American giants. **********Business Day, page C13."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/31/business/c-corrections-205826.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-10-31", "snippet": "Correction of October 3 Private Sector column on annual antique cars competition at Rockefeller Center, which misidentified metal used in winner, 1938 Bugatti 57SC Atlantic; it is aluminum, not magnesium alloy (S)", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Corrections", "print_headline": "Corrections", "body_text": " **********A brief report in the Private Sector column on Oct. 3 about an annual competition at Rockefeller Center for antique cars misidentified the metal used in the winner, a 1938 Bugatti 57SC Atlantic.

He was 75 and lived in Village of Golf, Fla., and Highlands, N.C. **********The cause was a heart attack, Terry B. Adamson, his son-in-law, said. **********Mr. Holiday, who was known for his optimistic determination, helped lead the steel industry through the boom of the 1960's and the troubled times that followed in the 1970's and 80's. He frequently called on the Federal Government to insure that steel imports were legal, and, facing an economic downturn in the 1970's, pushed Armco to diversify. **********''Harry was a first-class manager,'' said Nicholas F. Brady, a former Treasury Secretary. ''He ran Armco at an extraordinary time when the company needed to diversify. Most of the people in the company believed that steel was their business. But Harry had the vision to know that some changes had to be made.'' **********The future for Mr. Holiday, who was born in Butler, Pa., seemed almost predestined. His father was the plant manager at Armco's Ford Steel Wheel Company in Butler. **********He graduated from the University of Michigan and served as an officer in the Army ordnance corps. **********Mr. Holiday joined Armco as an assistant metallurgist in the company's Middletown, Ohio, plant. In the next 36 years, he worked his way through the executive ranks, becoming president of Armco in 1974 and chief executive five years later. Mr. Holiday retired from the company in 1985. **********In addition to Mr. Holiday's business accomplishments, he was one of the world's best swimmers in the backstroke. During the 1940's, he set 7 world records, 18 American records and won 6 National Collegiate Athletic Association swimming championships. **********In the 1944 national amateur championships at the New York Athletic Club, Mr. Holiday, who was 6 foot 5, became the first swimmer to beat Adolf Kiefer, generally regarded as the best in the backstroke up to that time. Mr. Holiday was named to the 1944 Olympic team, but the games were canceled because of World War II. **********The war may have robbed Mr. Holiday of an Olympic gold medal and a place as an American legend. Johnny Weismuller, who won five Olympic gold medals in the 1920's, and Buster Crabbe, an Olympic champion in 1932, became household names after their victories. Mr. Holiday was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1991. **********He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Kay Watson Holiday; a brother, Matt, of Tucson, Ariz.; a daughter, Edith E., of Washington; two sons, Harry 3d, of King of Prussia, Pa., and Albert, of Middletown, Ohio,  and five grandchildren."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-10-14", "snippet": "Coffee prices jump 24 percent on concern that dry, hot weather in Brazil will damage world's biggest crop; in New York, coffee for December delivery rises 22.80 cents, to $1.1935 a pound; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********COFFEE SOARS FOR THIRD DAY.

He was 86 and had suffered a heart attack. **********News of Mr. Turowicz's death was brought to Pope John Paul II while he was about to celebrate Mass in St. Louis. He then prayed for the soul of the man who had been described as his closest friend at the time of his election to the papacy in 1978. **********In the years after Communism fell in their native Poland in 1989, they differed over issues like abortion, but their friendship went back to a time when Mr. Turowicz published the Pope's poems and essays while he was still Karol Wojtyla, a priest from Cracow. **********The death was front-page news all over Poland, and Thursday's issues of Gazeta Wyborcza, a Warsaw daily, devoted eight pages to Mr. Turowicz, including a poem about him by Czeslaw Milosz, the 1980 Nobel laureate in literature. In an editorial, the paper said Mr. Turowicz ''was the moral authority of several generations of Polish intellectuals; a wonderful essayist and a rational commentator on everything.'' **********Referring to his Cracow-based publication, whose name means The Universal Weekly, the editorial added, ''For more than a half century he established Tygodnik Powszechny as an achievement without precedent in the annals of Polish culture, an achievement that for many years provided the only light in the dark Polish tunnel.'' **********The magazine was founded in 1945, sponsored by Adam Sapieha, who was then Archbishop of Cracow. But after Mr. Turowicz took over as editor in 1951, he moved it away from direct church control, often enraging both Communist and church officials with its independence. Perhaps his boldest act occurred when, after the death of Stalin in 1953, party officials ordered him to publish a eulogy of the Soviet despot. He refused, and as a result the paper was taken away from him and turned over to a Catholic group called Pax that was collaborating with the Communists. **********Three years later -- after worker-led uprisings in Poznan, Poland; after a Hungarian rebellion was suppressed by Soviet troops, and as a new Polish Communist leadership sought credibility -- the weekly was returned to Mr. Turowicz. **********Standing up to the censors and at times to church leaders, he set about publishing articles on politics, culture and religion that were unavailable anywhere else in the Communist bloc. He battled censors word by word and instituted the practice of including dashes to show the readers where something had been removed. **********''We are not free to write everything we think,'' he said in 1986, ''but we have never been forced to write anything we do not think. In the East bloc that's a great deal.'' **********From a reader's perspective, this view was echoed in this same period by Slawomir Mrozek, Poland's best known playwright, who said Mr. Turowicz had ''shown us that just because you cannot tell the truth, you do not have to tell lies,'' adding, ''Because of Mr. Turowicz, Poles have a newspaper we can believe.'' **********Sometimes, in periods of less stringent censorship, his weekly could say things quite directly, as it did when it published an article by its featured essayist, Stefan Kisielewski, titled, ''Socialism Is Idiotism.'' At other times, when the censors were more aroused and energetic, he found many ways to say things that conspiratorially sensitized Poles had little trouble understanding. **********For instance, when the Polish Government mounted a full-scale anti-Semitic purge in 1968, Mr. Turowicz saw to it that his weekly published a number of articles by people who were being shunned elsewhere for their Jewish origins, and invited one such figure, the poet Antoni Slonimski, to be a contributing editor. Or later, in 1982, to mark the first anniversary of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's declaration of martial law, he devoted six of the publication's eight pages to a new translation of the Book of Job. **********Like all issues of the weekly during the Communist period, this one was limited to a press run of 50,000, but as always copies were widely circulated among networks of friends and neighbors, some of whom retyped and mimeographed articles for use in a burgeoning underground press. **********As for conflicts with the church, Mr. Turowicz was often upbraided for his commitment to church reform in the 1960's and 1970's by the strong and aristocratic Primate, Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski. In these conflicts he was often defended by Cardinal Wojtyla, the future Pope. Once Mr. Turowicz, having been summoned by Cardinal Wyszynski, fell asleep while being admonished. **********His relationship with the man who became Pope John Paul II began when he received an article about how materialistic temptations had corrupted the Catholic Church in France. It was written by Father Wojtyla, and Mr. Turowicz accepted it and ran it on the front page under a pseudonym, Andrzej Jawien, which the future Pope continued to use on his pieces in the publication. **********The two men met regularly, often discussing the ideas of Emmanuel Mounier, a French Catholic whose philosophy of ''personalism'' had argued for a third way, a way to spiritually invigorate people who had been depersonalized by either Marxist atheism or capitalistic materialism. The idea would later find expression in the Solidarity labor union movement in which Mr. Turowicz served as an adviser, and in several of the Pope's encyclicals. **********During the decade when Solidarity rose, was suppressed and then ultimately triumphed in 1989, the Pope and Mr. Turowicz maintained close contacts. But once a free and democratic Poland emerged, their differences widened. **********During a visit to Poland in 1991, the Pope turned down a request to see a group of liberal Catholic intellectuals that included his old friend. And in 1994 after the weekly published a debate that included various opinions on abortion, Mr. Turowicz, who described abortion as ''a lesser evil,'' was dismissed from the board of the John Paul II Foundation, which distributes research grants. But in 1994, Mr. Turowicz met with the Pope in the Vatican. **********Mr. Turowicz was born in Cracow on Dec. 10, 1912. He studied philosophy at the city's Jagiellonian University and married Anna Gasiorowska, the daughter of an aristocratic and influential family. He survived the war years on her family's estate, to which he invited Mr. Milosz after the poet's home in Warsaw was bombed. His wife and their three daughters and five grandchildren survive. **********In 1945 he joined the newly created church magazine as an assistant editor. Six years later he took over as editor and held that post until he died. **********''Probably I am not a bad editor,'' he once said. When asked what it was that enabled him to endure all the pressures, he replied, ''I think it is because I am calm.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/16/business/media-business-advertising-elizabeth-arden-campaign-strives-for-unconventional.html": {"writer_name": "Patricia Lauro", "pub_date": "1999-07-16", "snippet": "Elizabeth Arden Co will redefine its image in unconventional $50 million advertising campaign, telling women that beauty comes from within, not from a jar; themed 'Embrace yourself,' campaign created by J Walter Thompson offers single image for co...", "word_count": 909, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Elizabeth Arden campaign strives for the unconventional.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Elizabeth Arden campaign strives for the unconventional.", "body_text": " **********THE Elizabeth Arden Company received some alarming news earlier this year when it heard the results of a study of consumer attitudes about its company and the beauty industry. **********The study by Lubin Lawrence Inc. found that most women were turned off by the industry's dictates, that they considered the industry's view of beauty unreal and unattainable, and that all the advertising looked alike. Worse, said Peter England, Arden's president and chief executive, the study found that women saw the beauty industry as irrelevant to their life styles, and they had little or no relationship with brands. **********''The industry had a huge focus on glamour, but over time people's view of beauty has changed,'' Mr. England said. ''Crudely, the view has gone from 'I do it for him' to 'I do it for myself.' The self is much more important.'' **********For Arden, which has been struggling in a slow market dominated by the giant Estee Lauder Companies, the survey was an eye-opener. Now as part of huge $50 million corporate makeover, Arden will redefine its image in an unconventional campaign, telling women that beauty comes from within, not from a jar. **********Of course, Arden will use that message to offer a host of products to help women find that inner beauty -- colorful lipsticks, new fragrances and special skin care products. **********Themed ''Embrace yourself,'' the campaign offers a single image for the brand that will be used for all Arden products around the world. New products -- the lifeblood of the industry -- will be introduced inside the ''Embrace Yourself'' campaign. **********''It's a gutsy move,'' said Allan Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a beauty industry trade publication. ''Arden is trying to set up a dialogue with the consumer and create more of a subliminal trust thing. Quite honestly, I think it's needed in the industry -- a lot of customers are turned off by the hard sell and one new product after the next.'' **********The company, part of Unilever HPC North America, which had done all its advertising in-house for nearly 15 years, announced in April the appointment of J. Walter Thompson, New York, a unit of the WPP Group P.L.C., to create the advertising. **********The Thompson campaign begins in August with a blind teaser campaign on bus shelters and billboards in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. A single word in lower-case type, such as ''fearless,'' ''sweetheart'' and ''leader'' appears in black type against a white backdrop, but the ''ea'' of each word is in Arden's signature red. Two weeks later in mid-August, a second set of ads will finish the words in a sentence, like ''I am the fearless girl my mother warned me about'' or ''I am the leader of my own free world'' and identify Arden as the messenger. **********National print ads breaking in September beauty and shelter magazines use the same minimalist style but will also carry a black-and-white photograph by Carter Smith, a hot young fashion photographer. The models are of various ethnic groups and ages, and the photos are unretouched, journalistic-style pictures, not the industry's traditional highly stylized glamour shots. **********''Our casting call was for real women,'' said Ed Evangelista, the art creative director on the campaign with Chris D'Rozario, creative director-copy. **********One of the ads shows a woman laughing, the fine lines around her eyes clearly visible, and the headline reads: ''Free your mind and your beauty will follow.'' An ad to run in Cosmopolitan has the headline ''My best feature is my big beautiful sexy brain.'' **********''Women are no longer aspiring to society's ideal of the moment, they want to feel and look their best at any age,'' said Teresa Russell, Thompson management director. **********The industry has long played on women's insecurities about their looks and age. But the research showed that while in the past women wanted cosmetics to cover and mask imperfections, today they want makeup and skin care ''that bring out my natural best,'' she said. **********The campaign is aiming at women aged 25 to 55. The younger women are always needed to replenish the customer base, but Arden, which was founded in 1910, does not want to lose its older customers either, she said. **********At the bottom of each ad is the Elizabeth Arden name and its longtime red door logo shown as a minimalist red rectangle. TV spots as part of the multimillion-dollar campaign will be shown in the holiday period, beginning in mid-November. **********The $6.2 billion prestige beauty market -- which includes skin care, cosmetics and fragrances sold in better department stores -- grew just 3 percent last year, according to NPD Research, Port Washington, N.Y. **********Estee Lauder Companies, which also owns Clinique and other prestige brands, has 44.9 percent of the market, and has widened its share in recent years, said Amy Low Chasen, Goldman, Sachs cosmetics analyst. **********The Estee Lauder brand is the leader with an 18.1 percent share, followed by Clinique, with 17.6 percent, and Lancome, with 12.3 percent. Arden is the seventh-largest brand, with 3 percent, and Ms. Chasen said that share had been slowly declining in the 1990's. **********Arden has also been active on the new-products front, and will introduce several in the new campaign. The first, called Millennium Energist Revitalizing Emulsion, uses soy technology to treat aging skin. Another, Lip Lip Hooray, is a lipstick that promises to fight bad breath. **********Still, Arden will continue running its image campaign, along with the product ads, to tap into the heritage of the Arden brand name, said Mr. England, who helped revitalize the Ponds business with image and technical advancements."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/05/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-the-us-haven-albanians-and-serbs-seek-to-halt-deportation.html": {"writer_name": "Neil MacFarquhar", "pub_date": "1999-04-05", "snippet": "Even as NATO steps up war against Yugoslavia, Immigration and Naturalization Service is pressing ahead with deportation of Serbs who do not wish to be returned home to face conscription into military engaged in ethnic purge; many were caught tryin...", "word_count": 764, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Albanians And Serbs Seek to Halt Deportation", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE U.S. HAVEN; Albanians And Serbs Seek to Halt Deportation", "body_text": " **********Even as NATO forces press the war against Yugoslavia, there are Serbs across the United States fighting deportation on the ground that they do not want to be returned home to face conscription into a military engaged in an ethnic purge. **********In addition, as the Serbian province of Kosovo endures violent upheaval, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees fleeing, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service is pressing ahead with deportation cases for Kosovo Albanians. **********Lawyers or the Serbs say that they are not always getting a sympathetic ear from judges, with some implying that the men are shirkers for trying to avoid military service. **********''It is ridiculous to think that we might send someone back to Yugoslavia who is immediately going to be part of the military machine there,'' said Donald R. Sherinian, an immigration lawyer in Lake Forest, Calif., who has a Serbian client who faces a hearing on May 3. **********The immigration service will not say how many cases are pending, but in 1998, it granted asylum to 524 people from Yugoslavia, 49 percent of the requests. In addition, Richard L. Kenney, a spokesman for the immigration courts, said that in 1998, it handled 453 cases of people from Yugoslavia, some of which may have included more than one person. Of those, asylum was granted in 156 cases, denied in 127, and the other cases were closed in other ways. **********''We came here to survive,'' said Vlora Jakupi, a Kosovo ethnic Albanian native who is six months pregnant. Her husband, Valdet, has been in the Elizabeth Detention Facility in Elizabeth, N.J., for a month since they arrived with fake passports. Mrs. Jakupi was held overnight but released because she is pregnant and staying with her sister. **********Their lawyer, Claude L. Maratea, said Mr. Jakupi had a hearing with an immigration officer on Thursday to establish whether he had ''credible fear'' of the consequences of returning. Mrs. Jakupi got word Friday that most of her relatives had fled to Albania or Montenegro. **********The immigration agency will not comment on individual cases. Last June, the Justice Department issued a one-year order giving anyone from Kosovo the right to stay in this country for a year because of conditions at home, said Barbara Francis, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But it does not cover anyone who arrived after it was issued. **********''People have to have a credible story and we have to determine who they are,'' said Ms. Francis, acknowledging that refugees often arrive with no possessions or documents. ''Asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis, story by story.'' **********Serbs seeking asylum feel particularly vulnerable because the United States is now in a conflict involving  their country. If they go back, not only are they likely to be drafted, said Mark S. Kocol, a Chicago immigration lawyer who is defending five young Serbian men, but they will probably be singled out because they are coming from America. **********Under United Nations guidelines,  countries have the right to call up their citizens for the army, and facing such a draft is not sufficient grounds for asylum. **********The only exceptions are if an asylum seeker faces capital punishment if he is deported and convicted of  draft evasion or if he would have to  join a military known for human rights violations. **********The immigration courts, run by  the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, demand that each asylum seeker prove  that he will be drafted. While there have been widespread press reports of Yugoslavian conscription, most of the men fighting deportation do not have individual notices. **********Lawyers representing Serbs said most of their clients had been here for some time and were seeking permission to stay. But some of the Kosovo Albanians were caught trying to enter the country without proper documents and are in detention. **********Raymond P. D'Uva, an immigration lawyer, said a 19-year-old client from Kosovo was denied asylum on March 19. He said his client is distraught because he has no way of finding out the fate of the rest of his family. ''Reports from his town, Mitrovica, say all the Albanian inhabitants are gone,'' Mr. D'Uva said. **********Another lawyer, Victor V. Yee said a Kosovo refugee held in Elizabeth, Afrim Karaqica, 34, tried to enter the United States with a false passport in  December, hoping to get his wife and three daughters in later. **********''I don't know what happened to my family,'' Mr. Karaqica said in a statement.

It followed two days of meetings here in which finance ministers and central bankers from the United States and Europe again pressed their counterparts from Tokyo to do more to revive the Japanese economy and clean up the huge overhang of bad loans that has all but paralyzed the country's banking system. **********Mr. Greenspan said Japan was the ''archetype of virtually bank-only financial intermediation.'' When the banking system got into trouble, he said, the result was a deep and continuing credit squeeze that has crippled an economy that had been Asia's linchpin. **********''The Japanese Government has intervened in the economy and is injecting funds in order to recapitalize the banking system,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''While it has made some important efforts, it has yet to make significant progress in diversifying the financial system, which arguably could be a key element, although not the only one, in promoting long-term recovery.'' **********Mr. Greenspan also reiterated a message that the United States has long delivered with little effect: that Tokyo will save money in the long run if it stops dithering and acts more forcefully to close failed or failing banks, sell foreclosed real estate and other assets, and create a smaller but healthier banking system. **********''Speedy resolution is good, whereas delay can significantly increase the fiscal and economic costs of a crisis,'' Mr. Greenspan said. **********Mr. Greenspan did not address the current state of the American economy or provide any hints as to whether the Fed will raise interest rates when its policy-setting committee meets next week. Analysts say the central bank is increasingly likely to hold rates steady and wait for further evidence as to whether the economy is slowing sufficiently to avert any buildup in inflationary pressures. **********Mr. Greenspan also avoided any mention of the Japanese currency. The rise of the yen against the dollar over the last several months prompted the Japanese central bank to make statements this weekend that some took to be hints that it might reverse course and increase the money supply to weaken the currency, a step the United States favors. **********Mr. Greenspan, whose speech was titled ''Lessons From the Global Crises,'' said one reason the American economy held up so well last year was that as the bond market seized up in the aftermath of Russia's debt default, the commercial banking system stepped up its lending. **********''With the process of credit creation able to continue, the impact on the real economy of the capital market turmoil was blunted,'' Mr. Greenspan said. **********But Fed officials are now increasingly worried that bank lending standards in the United States have grown too lax. Laurence H. Meyer, a Federal Reserve governor, told the Institute of International Bankers in a speech today that while overall loan portfolios remain sound, there has been a modest but troubling increase in questionable lending. **********''Lenders are relying too much on the continuation of good times,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''They're assuming a very optimistic view of their borrowers' operating prospects and that their borrowers always will have ready access to the financial markets.

Mr. Wolff worked closely with Mr. Gore and his aides in the early 1990's, when he was at the National Science Foundation.

Murkowksi, Republican of Alaska, said at a hearing that the episode was ''a classic case of bureaucratic bungling.'' **********''Coke's 130-year-old secret is more secure than our nuclear weapons research,'' Senator Murkowksi said. A Democrat on the committee, Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas, said the failure to quickly search the computer ''still angers me.'' **********''Supposedly everybody was watching, and in reality no one was watching,'' she said. **********The department's general counsel, Mary Anne Sullivan, told the committee she agreed that the legal and bureaucratic obstacles to the search ''produced an unfortunate result.'' She noted that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced tighter security measures on Tuesday. **********Ms. Sullivan said the department had twice offered to search the computer but had backed off because of concerns that an espionage investigation might be jeopardized. **********Requests by the F.B.I. for permission to obtain a search warrant for the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, were rebuffed twice in 1997 by the Justice Department. It was not until March of this year, after obtaining Mr. Lee's consent, that investigators examined his computer. **********Officials say they discovered then that Mr. Lee had improperly transferred huge amounts of classified nuclear secrets into an unsecure system and then tried to delete them in February, two days after he failed a lie detector test. **********No information has surfaced to suggest that the delay in searching Mr. Lee's computer harmed national security. Mr. Lee has not been charged with any crime, and his lawyer says his client did nothing wrong. **********But the difficulties of gaining access to a computer at a Government-owned weapons laboratory prompted senators to complain today about how security concerns could be improperly subordinated to privacy protections or the demands of espionage investigations, most of which never result in prosecution. **********Ms. Sullivan and her aides said the Energy Department may search someone's computer if there is a reasonable basis to suspect work-related misconduct. But a search in a criminal case requires a higher standard, probable cause that a crime has been committed. **********Thus, the Energy Department may forgo its right to search -- as it did in the case of Mr. Lee -- if it fears that a defendant may legally challenge the evidence. **********This legal caution can create a dilemma in which no one is charged with a crime, yet national security may be harmed because no one does a search. **********A few hours later, in the same closed hearing room, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence heard from Attorney General Janet Reno on many of the same issues. Afterward, the committee's vice chairman, Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, said that most committee members believed that the Justice Department should have approved the F.B.I.'s request for warrants to search the computer. **********The committee's chairman, Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said the Attorney General ''defends what happened but doesn't know what happened.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/19/business/turmoil-in-brazil-the-lenders-approval-of-rate-policy-but-no-new-financial-aid.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1999-01-19", "snippet": "International Monetary Fund and US say that they are heartened by Brazil's pledge to keep interest rates high and slash its budget deficit; but they offer no new financial aid and make clear that Brazil's economic fate is largely in its own hands;...", "word_count": 893, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Approval of Rate Policy, But No New Financial Aid", "print_headline": "TURMOIL IN BRAZIL: THE LENDERS; Approval of Rate Policy, But No New Financial Aid", "body_text": " **********The International Monetary Fund and the United States said today that they were heartened by Brazil's pledge to keep interest rates high and slash its budget deficit. But they offered no new financial aid and made clear that Brazil's economic fate is largely in its own hands. **********As they shuttled around Washington seeking to explain and build support for their Government's decision to allow its currency to float in value, Brazilian officials said they had heard the message and were prepared to do what it took to re-establish the country's credibility in the ultimate court of economic policy, the financial markets. **********Even before Brazil's central bank announced tonight that it was increasing overnight interest rates, Pedro Malan, Brazil's Finance Minister, told a news conference here that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's administration was determined to take whatever steps necessary to avert a crippling new round of inflation. And he said the Government would intensify efforts to push through a package of tax increases and spending cuts intended to bring the budget deficit under control. **********''We know additional measures may be required'' to improve the country's fiscal condition, keep the economy on track and maintain the confidence of investors, Mr. Malan said. **********Mr. Malan met today with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. **********Afterward, a senior American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a ''shared judgment that the most important thing in Brazil was the pursuit of strong policies, which especially meant carrying through on deficit reduction measures, strong anti-inflation monetary policies and continued structural reforms.'' **********The American official said Mr. Malan ''made clear his own determination and President Cardoso's determination in a very complex political environment to carry through effectively; that was certainly something we welcomed.'' **********Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, also offered encouraging words. ''I am personally very satisfied with the conversations that I.M.F. staff and management have had over the last weekend with Minister Malan and the Brazilian team,'' Mr. Camdessus said. **********Mr. Malan said after arriving in Washington on Saturday that Brazil might ask the I.M.F. and individual countries, including the United States, to speed planned aid payments due to Brazil under a $41.5 billion assistance program negotiated last fall. The next set of loans, about $9 billion, is scheduled for release next month. **********Brazilian and American officials said today, however, that there were no discussions about granting the loans ahead of schedule. Economists said that since Brazil was no longer daily defending the value of the currency, the real, the country had less immediate need to bolster its foreign currency reserves. **********But Brazil, which took the first steps last week toward abandoning its old stable exchange rate policy without informing the I.M.F. and the Clinton Administration, will now have to accept closer scrutiny by the international lending organizations and the countries providing it with aid, including the United States. **********In a statement issued here today, Mr. Malan said Brazil would ''intensify its dialogue'' with the organizations and countries providing aid and would ''establish new and more intensive procedures of continuous consultation'' with the I.M.F., including the possible opening of an I.M.F. office in Brasilia. **********With financial markets around the world reacting favorably again today to Brazil's new currency strategy, and with the United States and the I.M.F. providing their stamp of approval, Brazil appears to have come through what could have been a disastrous collapse of its old strategy without any serious damage. **********But the true test will come only when the country hits its next economic bump, as it inevitably will, or when an outbreak of the financial turmoil that has plagued the world since mid-1997 next sweeps through the markets. **********Economists and policy makers see two possible outcomes for Brazil. Under the optimistic version, a temporary increase in interest rates and quick action to rein in the budget deficit restores confidence in the markets, allowing the currency to stabilize without dropping much further. Interest rates then come down, and the devalued currency allows Brazil to export more easily, helping economic growth without fueling inflation. **********Under the pessimistic version, continued downward pressure on the value of the currency forces the central bank to keep interest rates cripplingly high. The economy stalls, forcing politicians into an agonizing choice between weathering a painful recession or reducing rates, a move that could send the currency plummeting and inflation sharply higher. **********In 1992, Britain abandoned a policy of keeping the pound stable in value relative to the other main European currencies after a speculative attack of the sort that has become increasingly common in countries with underlying economic problems. Britain's finance minister at the time said the collapse of the stable exchange rate policy had him singing in the shower because it allowed him to reduce rates and give a boost to the domestic economy without worrying about the currency. **********Given its history of hyperinflation and doubts among investors about its willingness to deal with its fiscal deficit, Brazil does not have that luxury. Mr. Malan, to the relief of the I.M.F. and the United States, explicitly said as much in his statement today, a message reinforced by the central bank's quick move to raise interest rates to help prop up the currency. **********''In the new exchange rate regime, fiscal and monetary policies will have to play an even more crucial role in insuring price stability and conditions for sustained economic growth,'' Mr. Malan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/technology/can-it-pay-to-surf-the-web.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Guernsey", "pub_date": "1999-07-01", "snippet": "On-line marketing companies are resorting to number of strategies in trying to get people to pay attention to advertising; some are giving away gifts, while others are offering chances to earn electronic cash or points redeemable for products; All...", "word_count": 2006, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Can It Pay to Surf the Web?", "print_headline": "Can It Pay to Surf the Web?", "body_text": " **********IT sounded like a great idea at the time. **********Ryan Harmon, a 26-year-old technology salesman in San Francisco, received an E-mail message about a company that was offering to pay people up to $20 a month for something he did every day anyway: surf the Web. **********''There was no risk to sign up,'' Mr. Harmon said. ''It would really cost me nothing.'' **********The company, All Advantage.com, was ready to pay people who signed up 50 cents an hour for every hour that they spent on line, up to 40 hours a month. And, Mr. Harmon found out, he could make even more money by recruiting others to do the same. He could earn 10 cents for every hour that each of those referrals surfed, and 5 cents for every hour logged by people who signed up under the referrals. In fact, he could earn 5 cents for the referrals under those referrals -- and so on, down two more levels. **********Mr. Harmon signed up in April and then recruited 12 people, who referred hundreds more to the company. For that, All Advantage would put as much as $600 in his pocket every month. **********Since opening shop in Hayward, Calif., in late March, All Advantage has signed up more than 1.7 million members on the promise that they can get paid to surf the Web. In return, all the prospective surfers have to do is tolerate an on-screen device called the Viewbar that features paid advertising. Some members have gathered referrals so aggressively -- recruiting more than 10,000 members, in some cases -- that they claim they stand to earn thousands of dollars every month. **********But a week ago, the company quietly changed its plan. With the service not even fully operating yet, All Advantage changed the maximum surfing time to 10 hours a month from 40 hours a month. For people who are expecting to surf as much as possible under the company's terms, that means they will earn $5 a month instead of $20. The information about the switch was posted on the company's Web site (www.alladvantage.com). **********Mr. Harmon, who had read the fine print earlier on the company's Web site, was not terribly surprised. ''My expectations were set for something like this,'' he said. ''I didn't set them too high.'' **********Other All Advantage members, who saw a bigger drop in their projected earnings, were not so philosophical. ''My thoughts about the 75 percent reduction in view time are not pretty,'' one member wrote in a discussion group at www.egroups.com. **********Another member wrote, ''I thought it was devious and slick of them to make a last-minute announcement of it.'' The member said he felt that the company had ''milked'' him by first enticing him to find recruits and then changing the rules. **********Such is the world of on-line marketing programs, where the drive to build membership often moves much faster than the push to make a profit, or even cover costs. As marketing companies try to figure out how to get people to pay attention to advertising on line, they are turning to a number of strategies. **********Free-PC, a company in Pasadena, Calif., received a lot of attention earlier this year when it announced that it would give away Compaq computers worth about $700 to 10,000 people who were willing to watch advertisements and to provide the company with information about themselves. **********Other companies offer people the chance to earn electronic cash or points redeemable for products. Cybergold, based in Berkeley, Calif., offers cash simply for requesting free estimates from on-line car dealerships. My Points, a company in San Francisco, pays people redeemable points for reading E-mail messages from advertisers. **********All Advantage's business model is based on the belief that people will be willing to tolerate advertisements running across their computer screens if they are paid. The All Advantage Viewbar flashes advertisements at a rate of one or two per minute as members scroll through Web pages. The Viewbar is still being tested, but the company says that it will be available this month to All Advantage's first 200,000 members. **********James and Lisa Grove of Boston are among those who are so enthusiastic about All Advantage that they have set up Web sites dedicated to recruiting members. The Groves even paid a few hundred dollars for advertising to draw people to their site (www.grovelabs.com). They now have more than 1,700 people signed up under them. With a 40-hour limit, they could have earned as much as $3,600 a month. That amount has now been cut to $900. **********''I'm looking at it pragmatically,'' Mr. Grove said. ''I figured that something like this might happen.'' **********Even before this week's announcement, some marketing experts were skeptical of All Advantage's plan. And advocates for consumer privacy warn that companies involved in Web-based marketing may not be giving things away as much as they are trading products or cash for personal information and the right to record people's movements on line. **********Venky Shankar, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland at College Park, studies multilevel marketing programs like All Advantage's, which provide incentives for those who sign up to recruit others to get involved. **********Most of the programs start by promising an exciting boom in income, Professor Shankar said. ''But pretty soon,'' he said, ''people realize they actually have to put in more effort and it is much harder than it was made out to be originally.'' **********Professor Shankar said the rate change did not help the company's image. ''Smart multilevel marketing programs would not try and lessen the value for their members,'' he said. **********Jim Jorgensen, founder and chief executive of All Advantage, sees the reduction in hour limits differently. ''We didn't actually change anything,'' Mr. Jorgensen said. ''We're ramping up to it.'' **********The company's plan will still allow its members to earn thousands of dollars, he noted, but it will just take them longer. ''We just don't want to go broke before we get there,'' he said. The company has assured members that it will eventually pay for up to 40 hours of surfing per month. **********Mr. Jorgensen, who has a master's degree in business administration from Stanford University, has spent years creating and managing start-up companies. **********In 1990, he co-founded Discovery Zone, which built and managed indoor entertainment centers for children across the country. He left the company in 1992, after it had grown to include more than 200 centers. (Discovery Zone filed for bankruptcy in 1997.) **********In recent years, Mr. Jorgensen owned and sold a few companies that offered medical malpractice insurance and helped to start a soccer-camp company called Challenger Sports. **********He said he started thinking about All Advantage in February and founded the company a month later. Technologically, the company's strategy is possible because of the Viewbar, which gathers information on members by tracking what search terms they enter and what sites they visit on the Web. **********''If you go to fly-fishing sites a lot, we'll know that you fly-fish,'' Mr. Jorgensen said. ''So even if you aren't on a fly-fishing site, we could still provide you advertising related to fly-fishing.'' **********That information, Mr. Jorgensen said, also allows advertisers to avoid wasting their promotions on the wrong people. ''Part of that efficiency,'' he said, ''can be handed back to the users in the form of electronic payment.'' **********Exactly how much lucrative advertising can be aimed effectively at All Advantage's users, however, is still untested. **********Jim Sterne, the author of ''What Makes People Click: Advertising on the Web'' (Que Education and Training, 1997), said he expected that companies would be interested in the idea of tailoring their advertisements to members' interests, but he questioned whether All Advantage would be able to attract advertisers for high-end products. **********The people who typically join such marketing programs, Mr. Sterne said, are people at low- or middle-income levels who are interested in bargains, discounts or sweepstakes. ''They will only attract a certain type of advertiser,'' he said. **********Alex Gourevitch, a spokesman for All Advantage, said that such skeptics might be surprised. The members they have attracted so far, Mr. Gourevitch said, do not fit the profile of low-income consumers seeking sweepstakes. Most of them are young and, like Mr. Harmon, they live in Zip code areas that are known for relatively high incomes and frequent computer use. **********A bigger risk in All Advantage's plan, industry analysts say, is that it is based on multilevel marketing, which can lead to uncontrolled growth. E-mail makes referral recruiting easier and faster than ever, leading to membership bases that may be wildly larger than expected. Mr. Jorgensen said his business model was built on the expectation of 20,000 members; as of Wednesday, more than 1.72 million people had signed up. **********At the same time, however, the number of members, or what on-line marketers call ''eyeballs,'' is what helped the company attract advertisers. So far, 32 companies -- including Ebay and Efax -- have decided to run advertisements on the Viewbar. **********The reduction in paid surfing hours will have no effect on the deals struck with advertisers, Mr. Jorgenson said. The advertisers signed up so far have paid for a certain number of ''impressions,'' or on-line displays of their ads to specific users. The company is also striking deals with advertisers to earn its own commissions on products that people purchase after clicking on ads shown on the Viewbar. **********Michele Slack, an analyst with Jupiter Communications' on-line advertising group, is not so sure that advertisers will shrug off the company's revised start-up policy. Some people have simply signed up to receive $20 a month and are not interested in building referrals, Ms. Slack said. Now that they will only receive $5 a month, they may be less willing to take part. **********''That is a huge reduction to what they are promising these people,'' she said. ''If this ends up collapsing their user base, advertisers are going to be less interested.'' **********Privacy advocates say that consumers should be wary of signing up for free Internet offers for other reasons. **********Jason Catlett, the president of Junkbusters, a consumer advocacy group that tries to limit unsolicited mail, warned that companies like All Advantage are collecting information about members' social networks, as well as E-mail addresses and surfing habits. **********''People don't like strangers knowing who knows them,'' Mr. Catlett said. **********To join All Advantage, members must provide their names, mailing addresses, ages and E-mail addresses. The company has promised its members that it will not divulge the information to advertisers or other companies. That also applies to data about members' referrals, Mr. Jorgensen said. Free-PC promises the same, noting on its Web site that it will keep personally identifiable information ''completely private forever.'' **********Privacy policies for Cybergold and Mypoints state that the companies will not share personal information with third parties (like advertisers on its Web sites) unless members grant permission. **********Phil Agre, a professor of information studies at the University of California at Los Angeles, says that consumers can never be too wary. A company could be bought by a larger company, for example, and policies could change without much notice. ''Just because it is their policy today,'' Dr. Agre said, ''doesn't mean that it is their policy tomorrow.'' **********Consumers should also be aware, he said, of marketing clubs like All Advantage striking deals with third-party companies that want to send advertisements to the clubs' members. The clubs don't give the third parties the information; they simply take on the marketing themselves, sending messages to their members about the other company's products. **********Free-PC, for example, is planning to send its participants E-mail messages asking for permission to send targeted solicitations from its advertisers. **********When Mr. Jorgensen of All Advantage was asked about the possibility of sending members E-mail advertisements, he shook his head. ''We would consider that spam,'' he said. ''We'd consider that an invasion of privacy.'' **********In fact, he is more concerned about All Advantage being defrauded by its own members than he is worried about privacy issues. **********The Viewbar tracks how many minutes people are surfing by sensing movement on the mouse and keyboard. Mr. Jorgensen is preparing safeguards against surfing tricks like motorized mice that some people might use to add to their hours when they are actually away from the computer. **********''Don't cheat us,'' he said, and ''we'll be delivering.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/07/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-sap-consolidates-account-at-ogilvy.html": {"writer_name": "Constance Hays", "pub_date": "1999-10-07", "snippet": "SAP AG consolidates its global advertising account for general and Internet advertising, direct marketing and other communications at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide; Adweek estimates billings at $100 million; duties had been handled by various local ag...", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAP Consolidates Account at Ogilvy", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; SAP Consolidates Account at Ogilvy", "body_text": " **********SAP A.G. in Walldorf, Germany, has consolidated its global account for general and Internet advertising, direct marketing and other communications at Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, a unit of WPP Group P.L.C.

But the convoys alone are not thought to be enough. **********''In plain terms of need there are hundreds of thousands in Kosovo itself, and they are in desperate need,'' said Alex Rondos, the envoy for humanitarian affairs for the Greek Foreign Ministry. **********Mr. Rondos calculates that the Kosovo Albanians who have been displaced from their homes but who are still in Kosovo will need a minimum of 10,000 tons of foodstuff per month. At best, the convoys will be able to bring in 4,000 tons each month. **********''We're concerned that these isolated populations are in very bad shape,'' said a Pentagon official. ''We're looking at all the options now -- ground and airdrops.'' **********In the last three weeks, the Air Force has been making practice airdrops in the United States to be prepared if NATO decides to begin airdrops. **********''We know it's possible to make the airdrops,'' said one Pentagon official. ''But we can't promise that the food will reach the right people or that the flights will be risk-free.'' **********Until today, the Pentagon and the State Department had expressed doubt about airdrops because the bundles could be picked up by Serbian troops and police and because they would be risky for the pilots flying the cargo airplanes. **********''They've been exploring quite a number of options but there seemed no reliable suggestion short of ground troops to get the food where it was needed,'' said Bill Frelick of the United States Committee for Refugees, a private relief group, who has consulted with Ms. Taft. ''Airdrops indicate the level of desperation we're in.'' **********State Department officials warned that the details have yet to be completed and that the plan could be stymied if the Yugoslav Government  refuses permission. **********''It might involve the U.S. Government funding a private group, pursuing this option the way the Greeks have pursued their ground convoys,'' said James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman. **********In April, the Greek Government and a Greek relief organization began sending aid to Kosovo with permission from the Yugoslav Government and NATO. Now the Governments of Switzerland and Russia have banded together with Greece to send in the daily convoys. The operation informs NATO about the convoy schedules, and NATO then tries to insure that its bombers do not hit the relief trucks. **********''The Serbs have told us we can go where we want and we are going to test that proposition,'' Mr. Rondos said. ''That makes it a bit of a high-wire act.'' **********The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army rebels have opened up a supply corridor into Kosovo with the capture of a border post, NATO officials say. Aid group officials say the rebels have used the corridor to ship in arms and ammunition but might be willing to let in relief supplies for civilians. **********For the past year, the Serbs have used food as a weapon in ejecting  Albanians from Kosovo, systematically destroying their food stocks, burning down silos and haystacks, as well as killing livestock. By the end of last year, Kosovo was dependent on food assistance from international aid organizations. In March, when the bombing began, the aid groups fled to Macedonia. **********''Since then, the Serbs either took over the food stocks or destroyed them,'' Mr. Frelick said. **********With the war engulfing most of the province, it is unlikely that there will be much of a harvest this summer, according to classified American reports.

''I myself recognize merits in the Total Fina project, all the while regretting the way in which it was presented and the hostility surrounding it.'' **********Mr. Jaffre's comments amounted to a plea for new negotiations in the bitter fight that began when Total Fina mounted a $43 billion hostile bid for Elf Aquitaine on July 5. Two weeks later, Mr. Jaffre replied with a $50 billion counterbid for Total Fina. **********But Elf Aquitaine is struggling for support. An American advisory company, Institutional Shareholder Services, urged investors last Friday to reject Elf's plan, partly because it would have increased the company's indebtedness to $18.5 billion from $3.5 billion. **********''It would load the company with too much debt,'' said Melanie Bich Tran, a research analyst at the advisory company, which is based in Rockville, Md. ''It is too costly to existing shareholders.'' **********French Government officials have made clear that they would not allow Elf Aquitaine to strike a deal with a foreign company. Given the rapid pace of huge-scale mergers in the global energy industry, Mr. Jaffre has already acknowledged that a merger of some kind with Total Fina is inevitable. **********The main strategic difference between the rival takeover offers is that Total Fina would merge and retain the two companies' chemical divisions. Elf Aquitaine would merge the chemical operations but spin them off as a separate company. **********In practice, much of the fight is over which executives will ultimately control the combined enterprise. **********Notwithstanding his plea for peace, Mr. Jaffre accused the chairman of Total Fina, Thierry Desmarest, of trying to muscle his way to a takeover. ''For them, negotiations consisted of 'Get out with your hands in the air and we will spare no prisoners,' '' Mr. Jaffre said in an interview published today in the newspaper Le Monde. **********At the news conference to report the half-year results, he took another swipe at Mr. Desmarest. Asked who he thought was best qualified to run the merged company, Mr. Jaffre said his rival ''is an excellent oilman'' who ''needs to complete his training.'' **********Elf Aquitaine reported that net income more than doubled in the first half of this year, to 1.69 billion euros ($1.78 billion) from 699 million euros in the first half of 1998. Virtually all of that was attributable to a one-time capital gain of a billion euros from the merger of its Sanofi pharmaceutical division with that of Synthelabo. **********Operating profit actually declined in the first half, to 774 million euros from 969 million. That reflected the slump in crude oil prices and production before oil prices jumped this summer. The results were still stronger than expectations, and Elf Aquitaine shares rose 3.4 percent in Paris today, to 173.50 euros. **********Mr. Jaffre used the financial results to bolster his contention that Total Fina's bid understated Elf Aquitaine's true value. He now seems to be gearing up for extended bargaining. A Paris appeals court ruled on last Wednesday that Total Fina's offer should be extended to mid-October -- a decision that gave Elf more time to round up support from its shareholders. **********On Monday evening, the company announced it would postpone the shareholders' meeting that had been called to approve a capital increase.

But they still might, for example, produce a report that spells \"weather\" instead of \"whether.\" **********\"It creates very embarrassing moments,\" said Mr. Palm. \"They can survive in an English-speaking country,\" he said, but \"when they get into a business environment their English skills don't allow them to get their job done everyday.\" The Berlitz courses cover everything from making presentations to proper pronunciation and \"accent reduction.\" **********- **********OF COURSE, what is deemed essential in business can still vary greatly. The British Council, the British cultural relations organization overseas, offers business English courses in 90 percent of its 127 centers around the world, and reports that the economic troubles in East Asia in the past few years have produced a corresponding drop-off in demand there. **********\"The first thing that companies cut is their training budget, and English is often one of the things that gets hit first,\" said Peter Riddelsdell, network communications manager for enterprises for the British Council in London. **********But even with its ups and downs, the business English market is maturing, Mr. Riddelsdell said. Ten years ago, language schools would simply place general English teachers into specialized classes like business English, he said, whereas now, teacher-accrediting bodies such as the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) offer specialized courses and certificates. **********\"Mature\" is also a word used to describe the teachers themselves. \"A lot of our teachers who come into business English are older people,\" said Paul Harrison, the British Council's training consultant in Hong Kong, where he is anticipating an upturn with a new government scheme promoting English in the workplace, similar to one that accompanied a recent program in Singapore. **********Often, business English teachers have already worked in the business world themselves. \"If you haven't had that experience of actually writing reports, then it's difficult to teach,\" Mr. Harrison said. **********And perhaps even more important than work experience, they tend to have more life experience, language schools say, explaining that it takes a fair bit of confidence and savoir faire to lead a group of senior executives, who probably know exactly what they want from a particular situation and are used to people jumping to help them get it. **********\"After all, in the business world you do come across some rather demanding people, and you have to be able to deal with that,\" said Janis Abson, head of the English department at Professional Language Studies in London. **********\"They certainly don't want to be treated the same way as a gang of teenagers,\" said Phil Griffin, product development manager at the LCCI Examinations Board, which tests business English teachers on method and approach as well as the actual subject matter. **********Besides having high and specific expectations, business English students often have very limited time, and may not agree with their fellow students on, for example, what to study when. **********\"It's not a group I would give to a young, untried teacher,\" said Sandie Buglass, principal of Language Studies International's central London branch.

When the Justice Department filed the landmark antitrust suit last May, Government lawyers and the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court, said that because the issues were urgent, the trial would proceed quickly. **********''I am prepared to devote the month of September to this trial,'' the judge said then. He was talking about September 1998. **********But the trial did not get started until the end of October, and first stage, cross-examination of each side's witnesses, took more than four months -- far longer than anyone had expected. Microsoft generally spend four or five days cross-examining each of the Government's 12 witnesses. **********The protracted trial insures that the Government will fail to achieve its pre-eminent goal in filing the suit last May 19 -- to stop the bundling of a Web browser with Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 98, which had not yet been released. **********In fact, last spring, responding to Microsoft's request that the start of the trial be postponed until January 1999, Judge Jackson said: ''By the time you propose to be ready, 16 to 18 million horses will already be out of the barn, and that's too late.'' The ''horses'' to which he referred were copies of Windows 98, which went on sale last June. **********But by the end of this year, Windows 98 will be near the end of its lifespan; the next version, Windows 2000, is scheduled to be released early next year. Already, tens of millions of personal computers have Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, installed by default. **********Antitrust experts say now that if Microsoft loses, the Government will ask for remedies that would set broader rules for the future rather than attempting to mediate current behavior. **********''This industry moves too fast,'' a senior Government official involved in the case said today. ''Just look at what has happened already during the course of this trial. This argues for broader remedies.'' **********While the trial was under way, America Online agreed to buy Microsoft's major competitor in the browser market, the Netscape Communications Corporation, and begin cooperating with Sun Microsystems on new Web browsers and related technology. Executives from those three  companies testified against Microsoft at the trial, and Microsoft argued that the new alliances evinced strong competition in the industry, making the antitrust suit unnecessary -- a point of view the Government disputes. **********And last summer, a Federal appeals court ruled in Microsoft's favor in a related, earlier case, saying the company had the right to bundle its browser with Windows if the combination benefitted consumers. After that, the focus of the Government's case seemed to shift to emphasize issues like Microsoft's contracts with computer makers and Internet service providers. **********It remains possible that the two sides will settle the case in the next few weeks, eliminating any need for further trial proceedings. They held two hours of talks at the Justice Department Tuesday evening and plan to meet again -- though officials decline to say where or when. Tuesday evening's session was described as cordial but inconclusive. **********During the scheduling hearing in court today, neither Judge Jackson nor the litigants made any mention of the talks. Outside the courtroom afterward, representatives of Microsoft, the Justice Department and the 19 states that joined in the suit stood before reporters to say that none of them would discuss the settlement talks while they were under way. **********''If there are going to be productive settlement discussions, they must not take place publicly,'' said David Boies, the Government's lead trial lawyer, who took part in Tuesday's session. **********Government officials and Microsoft executives all seemed to be viewing the talks seriously today. Last week, Justice Department lawyers were dismissive of Microsoft's approach for settlement discussions, calling it nothing more than a public relations maneuver. **********The May 10 date for resumption of the trial is tentative because Judge Jackson is hearing another trial now and said he was not sure when it would end. When the Microsoft trial does resume, each side will present three rebuttal witnesses, and each witness is expected to spend about one week on the stand. **********After that, in roughly 30-day intervals, the litigants each file findings of fact. They both offer oral arguments. After an expected summer vacation, the judge will issue his own findings of fact. After that, the litigants file conclusions of law. Finally, late this year -- or possibly early next year -- the judge will issue his ruling. **********If Microsoft is found guilty, a separate proceeding will most likely be scheduled to consider what remedy will be applied."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/22/technology/what-s-next-where-rubber-meets-the-road-a-chip.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Guernsey", "pub_date": "1999-04-22", "snippet": "Advancements in tire technology discussed; include system offered by Smartire Systems to monitor air pressure and temperature and tire being developed by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co that contains tiny package of miniature sensors, other computerized...", "word_count": 1057, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Where Rubber Meets the Road, a Chip", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEXT; Where Rubber Meets the Road, a Chip", "body_text": " **********SOMEDAY your tires might be full of more than hot air. They may have minds of their own, keeping track of their air pressure and letting you know when they need to be replaced. **********That day, in fact, may have already arrived if you happen to be driving a fully loaded Lincoln Continental. And if you haul freight in an 18-wheeler or fly commercial planes, you may be communicating with your tires as soon as a year from now. **********Smartire Systems, based in Vancouver,  British Columbia, already has a relatively smart system on the market. It consists of a battery-powered device about the size of a cigarette lighter that is strapped to each wheel before tires are installed. It also includes a handheld module, with a display screen, that receives signals about the tires' air pressure and temperature from the devices inside the tires. **********''We take an otherwise dumb tire and make it smart,'' said Robert V. Rudman, president and chief executive of Smartire. **********A built-in Smartire system is now a Lincoln Continental option, and Smartire is now marketing the system as a stand-alone $299 product that can be installed in a car or trailer you already own. (To see how the technology works, look at the www.smartire .com/commerce/demo.html site.) **********The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company is developing what it considers an even more intelligent tire, which it is now testing for use in commercial trucks and aircraft.  Goodyear's ''intelligent tire technology'' is embedded within the rubber of the tires when they are manufactured. It is expected to be on the market in the next year. **********Goodyear's tire gets its smarts from a tiny package of computerized instruments, including miniature pressure and temperature sensors. These sensors are microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, the result of a marriage of computer circuitry and mechanical sensors on a very small scale. MEMS have been described by engineers as a way to detect and solve problems in a number of things, like airplanes and skyscrapers. **********In the Goodyear tire, the MEMS technology is within a transponder that acts like the tire's brain. The transponder is made up of silicon wafers, circuits and sensors that together are about the size of a quarter. The sensors pick up data about pressure and temperature and then store that information within the silicon chips. The transponder sends the data outside the tire through a wireless radio signal. It does not require a battery. **********Goodyear is now developing devices that might be used by commercial industries to read and re-transmit those signals. A handheld or dashboard computer, for example, might be used to send a pulse to the tire, inquiring about its status. Another possibility is that the tire would transmit information to a display screen or printer after being driven over some sort of pad that would stimulate the transponder. In the next few years, tractor-trailers may get tire-pressure readings while driving over scales at weigh stations off the highway. **********''Mostly we are looking at commercial truck and aircraft uses,'' said Tom Walker, general manager for Goodyear's aviation projects. ''We don't see it as something for car tires for the consumer -- at least in the short term.'' **********But beyond the short term -- say in 5 or 10 years -- it is likely that consumers will be treated to some, if not all, of the benefits of the technology, Mr. Walker said. **********For example, Goodyear is already marketing the Run-Flat tire, and Michelin is selling a similar product called the Zero Pressure tire. A car with such tires can continue driving for up to 50 miles at 55 miles an hour after getting a flat. Right now, the tires require a device like that developed by Smartire to monitor their pressure. The device triggers an alarm, warning drivers that although the tire is not actually flat, it has lost air and needs to be replaced soon. Maybe such capabilities will someday be built into the tires themselves, rather than relying on external devices, Mr. Walker said. **********In Goodyear's intelligent tires, the transponder also includes a hidden chip that stamps each tire with a unique identification number. A mechanic will be able to send a signal to the chip, asking the tire for its number. Using that number and a handheld computer, a mechanic or engineer could look up information about the tire that has been stored in an external, networked database. Unlike bar codes or other indentifiers that might be applied to the outside of the tires, the embedded identification chips can withstand more rugged conditions and will not wear off over time. **********''You can track the life of that tire,'' said Brian Logan, Goodyear's project manager for tire technology. ''You can track where it's been, if it's been repaired or how many times the tire has been retreaded.'' **********That information, however, comes from a person who enters the data into a database under the corresponding identification number. The tires are not yet smart enough, Mr. Logan said, to record and store their own repair history. **********Goodyear is now testing its intelligent tires in commercial trucks and buses and commercial aircraft. The company is also working with Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, to develop a system that will refine the maintenance of military planes and their landing wheels. **********Knowing when to add more air pressure to a tire could help companies save money. Driving with over- or under-inflated tires causes them to wear unevenly, which makes the tires more susceptible to flats. And a vehicle that is driven with underinflated tires burns more fuel. **********Teri Short, a manager of systems engineering for Continental Airlines, said another benefit of the technology was that it would allow workers to check the air pressure in airplane tires just after the plane had landed, instead of waiting three or four hours for the tires to cool, as is typically done now. When the tires are hot, the air pressure readings are distorted, but the technology will automatically convert pressure readings to cool-tire readings, regardless of the temperature of the tires. ''It would definitely save time,'' Ms. Short said. **********Douglas Love, a spokesman for the Automobile Club of New York, an affiliate of the American Automobile Association, said that most drivers did not check their tires' air pressure as often as they should because they hated to touch dirty tires. ''Anything that gives people an alternative to getting dirty,'' Mr. Love said, ''is a good step.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/12/world/chief-rabbi-of-poland-is-asking-a-favor-of-mr-pope.html": {"writer_name": "Alessandra Stanley", "pub_date": "1999-06-12", "snippet": "Poland's Chief Rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, meeting Pope John Paul II in live televised ceremony in Warsaw, makes surprise appeal to Pope to have large cross at walls of Auschwitz concentration camp removed; photo (M)", "word_count": 1180, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chief Rabbi of Poland Is Asking a Favor of 'Mr. Pope'", "print_headline": "Chief Rabbi of Poland Is Asking a Favor of 'Mr. Pope'", "body_text": " **********Seizing his moment in a receiving line, Poland's Chief Rabbi brushed past protocol today to ask Pope John Paul II to remove a large cross at the walls of Auschwitz. **********''I have a favor to ask Mr. Pope,'' the Chief Rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, said after introducing himself as a survivor of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz who ''can still hear the crying of the children.'' **********He told the Pope that this cross ''is like a stop, a 'halt' '' that disturbed his prayers.

The Pope was preparing to pray alongside leaders of Jewish groups at the Holocaust memorial in Warsaw. **********The incident was an unexpected reminder that even as the Pope was pleading for unity and understanding, the wounds of World War II remain open. **********John Paul, who on Sunday plans to beatify 108 Catholics killed by the Nazis, has long sought to honor Christian Poles who died in concentration camps as co-victims of the Jews who perished in the Holocaust. **********But as today's incident demonstrated, a dispute persists over who suffered more in a war that devastated Poland, and all but wiped out its Jewish population. **********Leaders of Jewish groups quickly disassociated themselves from the aged Chief Rabbi, who retires on Sunday, saying that the setting was inappropriate and that his way of addressing the Pope was ''scandalous'' and ''unjustifiable.'' One Roman Catholic Bishop dismissed the rabbi's comments as the views of an ''extremist.'' **********But while Catholic bishops have decided that the cross should remain, Jewish leaders said they were still hoping to remove or at least reduce its visibility. And that fundamental clash, which both sides had hoped to keep under wraps during the Pope's trip, veered up at the worst possible moment. **********Shortly before the Pope arrived in Poland, the Government ordered riot policemen to remove hundreds of smaller crosses erected at Auschwitz by Catholic militants. But the Catholic leadership decreed that one 26-foot- cross, planted on property that borders the walls of Auschwitz in 1989 and visible from inside, should stay. Many Catholics view the cross both as a commemoration of the Pope's visit to Auschwitz in 1979 and a memorial to Christian victims of the Holocaust. **********Asked whether the Pope would consider the Chief Rabbi's request to remove the cross, his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said this was a ''local issue'' that did not concern the Vatican. ''My impression is that the vast majority of Poles want it to remain,'' he added. **********Bishop Stanislaw Gadecki, who heads the Polish Episcopate's Commission for Relations with the Jews, said of the rabbi's comments: ''We are not bothered by extremist points of view.'' He spoke on a sidewalk while waiting for the Pope's arrival at the Holocaust monument on Umschlagplatz, the depot from which 300,000 Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto were taken by cattle car to Auschwitz in 1943 and 1944. **********''It is true that he was at Auschwitz, we share his pain and the pain of all the Jewish people,'' Bishop Gadecki said of the Chief Rabbi. ''But there is the pain of the Polish people, too.'' **********Nearby, leaders of Jewish groups were assessing the damage done by the rabbi to their own efforts to remove the cross that many Catholics as well as Jews in Poland consider inappropriate. **********''To address the Pope in that way was embarrassing to all of us, and it was seen by everyone,'' Stanislaw Krajewski, director of interfaith relations for the Union of Jewish Congregations in Poland, said while waiting for John Paul's arrival. ''We thought we had a good chance of finding a compromise solution,'' he said, referring to the fate of the cross. ''As of today that effort is much more difficult.'' **********Mr. Krajewski and other Jewish leaders complained that the Chief Rabbi, who before the war spoke Yiddish and after the liberation of Auschwitz moved to Israel and the United States, spoke clumsy Polish that might alienate Polish listeners, as would his failure to address the Pope as ''Your Holiness.'' **********Few, however, disputed the legitimacy of the rabbi's claim. **********''I completely agree that the cross should not be there,'' said Konstanty Gebert, a journalist and Jewish activist. ''But the image of an insolent Jew treating the most respected leader in the land that way confirms the worst stereotypes and that really hurts us.'' **********If the Pope was offended, he gave no sign of it. He listened patiently and attentively as the rabbi spoke, paying no heed to the Vatican official who squirmed impatiently next to him. His few words in reply, however, were inaudible to bystanders. **********At Umschlagplatz, surrounded by rabbis and other leaders of Jewish group, including Marek Edelman, the last surviving leader of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the Pope delivered a prayer for Jews, asking God to ''support them so that they may experience respect and love from those who still have not grasped the immensity of the suffering of the Jewish people.'' **********Reconciliation was also a theme of John Paul's address to Parliament, where the country's three branches of government, along with religious leaders of various faiths, vigorously applauded the Pope's call for a ''responsible use of freedom.'' **********Seated in an armchair on the floor of the lower house of Parliament, the Pope said, ''While the autonomy proper to the life of a political community must be respected, it should also be kept in mind that a political community cannot be seen as independent of ethical principles. Even pluralist states cannot abandon ethical norms in public life.'' **********In his speech, he looked back on Poland's tragic history, noting that Poles, ''in a situation of mortal threat to the very biological existence of the nation,'' resisted the Nazis by establishing a clandestine Polish state, ''something which did not exist elsewhere in occupied Europe.'' **********Many tens of thousands of Poles lined the streets of Warsaw today, eager for what some feared could be their last close look at a frail Pope, who remains a national hero as well as a spiritual guide. **********A woman who gave her name as  Hannah, 49, was among those waiting near the Holocaust memorial. She said that she had watched the Chief Rabbi on television, and that unlike her friends, had not found his words so offensive. **********''The context was unfortunate, given that the Pope was coming to this place,'' she said. ''But he probably just didn't know how to address him.'' **********She added, however, that she disagreed with the rabbi's appeal. **********''Oh no,'' she said, ''of course the cross at Auschwitz must stay.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/08/world/tullamore-journal-travelers-tale-irish-nomads-make-little-headway.html": {"writer_name": "James Clarity", "pub_date": "1999-02-08", "snippet": "Ireland's 40,000 nomads, formerly disparagingly called tinkers, are now politely called travelers; most have given up horsecarts and covered wagons of their ancestors for car-towed trailers; still have hard time finding regular jobs or adequate ca...", "word_count": 1135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tullamore Journal; Travelers' Tale: Irish Nomads Make Little Headway", "print_headline": "Tullamore Journal; Travelers' Tale: Irish Nomads Make Little Headway", "body_text": " **********On the scruffy edge of this drab midlands town, in a peat bog area of central Ireland, Bridget McInerney, 35, lives with her husband and seven children in a small trailer on a muddy campsite of Irish nomads, formerly called by the disparaging term tinkers, now politely called travelers. **********In the camp, set between a railroad track and a highway, she begins her day lighting candles so she can see to boil hot water on an old peat-burning iron stove. There is no electricity, no running hot water, only two portable outdoor toilet boxes for about 50 people, most of them children. **********One portable shower was installed the other day, the first in the six-year-old camp where Mrs. McInerney said she expects to spend the rest of her life. She is unable to take trips in the trailer to visit relatives because, she said, the town would prevent her from re-entering the illegal camp. **********Her children, looking well-scrubbed, played among piles of cinders and rubble, laughing and shouting, running after an outsider on a recent visit as if he were a Martian, or perhaps a prime minister. **********Two tired-looking horses and an old-fashioned two-wheel Gypsy-like cart were behind a wall. One of the old men in the camp takes occasional trips in the horse cart, they said. **********Mrs. McInerney is one of 40,000 travelers, in a population of 3.6 million -- Ireland's underclass, which despite a booming economy, has a very hard time finding regular employment or adequate campsite facilities along the road. **********''It's very hard,'' Mrs. McInerney said in the clipped accent that identifies her as a traveler. ''When you get up in the morning it's very dark. You have to light candles. It's very hard to keep the children clean with all the dirt outside.'' **********''They say they're going to fix things up,'' she said of the local council. ''But people are just prejudiced against travelers.'' **********As a traveler, she lives along the roads in conditions most Irishmen and women would find unacceptable. Many traveler camps have better conditions than this one, but about 2,000 travelers live in unauthorized camps that lack normal facilities. **********The Government in Dublin has ordered local councils to provide adequate facilities in the next five years. But travelers view the prospect with skepticism, suspecting that local officials will always yield to anti-traveler pressure among voters. **********For at least 800 years, Mrs. McInerney's ancestors have traveled the country's roads in horsecarts, covered wagons and now in car-towed trailers, making a living by doing odd jobs, selling ornate handmade tin cups and dishes and cheap rugs and furniture, collecting and selling scrap metal. **********Years ago, they were seen as colorful characters, the stuff of Irish folklore with a history of going from castle to mansion house, fixing the pots and pans of the settled gentry and with a reputation for seducing farmers' wives and daughters. They began to roam after the Viking invasions. Shakespeare described a drunken ''tinker,'' Christopher Sly, in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' 400 years ago. **********The travelers still speak -- when strangers intrude -- the language they invented, called shelte or gammon. They were a quaint part of national life. **********Now, they are described by their supporters -- including former President Mary Robinson, who is the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights -- as victims of racism. **********As in the past, the Government says it wants to help them, but that is still not a high priority, the Irish Travelers Movement asserts. Travelers' problems are rarely discussed in political campaigns or in Parliament in Dublin, which has never had a traveler member. **********In 1994, a traveler, Ellen Mongan, was elected to a local council in County Galway. There have been no others elected in Irish governments at any level, as travelers have no tradition of political involvement. **********''Ireland is for human rights in everybody else's country,'' said David Joyce, a traveler who used to help his parents sell cut-rate appliances door to-door, and is now an official of the Irish Travelers Movement. **********''The Irish picture themselves as standing up for the little guy, against apartheid in Africa. But Ireland never looked at discrimination in its own backyard. It does not have an anti-racist or anti-discrimination law like all other European countries. So it cannot ratify the U.N. Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination.'' **********Mr. Joyce noted that many of his parents' customers suspected that the goods were stolen. But he said the family got cheap goods by buying them in Northern Ireland, where taxes and prices were lower. **********Although the travelers are mostly churchgoing Roman Catholics, full-blooded Celts, as Irish as James Joyce or Sean O'Casey, many other Irishmen and women privately call them ''knackers,'' meaning lazy troublemakers. **********Travelers are also widely accused of being dirty, pugnacious and dishonest, responsible for most of the crime in areas where they make camp with their battered caravans, which have replaced the colorfully painted old covered wagons similar to those of Gypsies, or Romany, of Central Europe, to whom they are not related by blood. **********''They talk a lot,'' said Kathleen Calley, of Dublin's plans to help her. She has five children and expects to live at the Tullamore site for the rest of her life. ''They promise a lot,'' she said. ''They're supposed to fix things up. But it's mostly talk. **********''It's wrong. People is people. Travelers, settled people, blacks, Chinese. But they say travelers keep their children dirty. Whenever there's crime, travelers is blamed. But we can live without their help.'' **********Generally, the life expectancy of travelers is about 10 years shorter than the national average of 72 years for men and 77 for women. **********The current Government has allocated about $15 million for improving the hundreds of campsites, but about $7 million has not been spent, mostly because of local opposition. ''Not in my backyard'' -- is the motto in areas where travelers stop along the roads. **********''When you live in a house, after your housework is done, there's nothing else to do,'' Mrs. Calley said. ''Here, there's always something to keep you busy.'' **********Her husband, Willie, said the family survived on welfare payments. ''They wouldn't give you a job,'' he added. ''If you went to the pub, they wouldn't serve you.'' **********In her trailer, probably worth only a few hundred dollars, Ms. McInerney said she and her friends knew some of the language of the road, whose origin is uncertain. A man is ''feen,'' a girl ''lakeen,'' a baby ''goyha,'' a child ''sublai'' and travelers are ''minkiers.'' **********She said her children are now allowed in the same classrooms as children of settled families. But, she added, the settled children are still being taught racism at home. **********On a recent day, she said, a 3-year-old nontraveler child in the street near the school yelled at her and a friend, ''You're nothin' -- only dirty knackers!'' **********Why would someone teach a child to hate travelers? she was asked. **********''I haven't a clue,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/business/the-media-business-borders-names-a-new-chief-from-outside-book-industry.html": {"writer_name": "Doreen Carvajal", "pub_date": "1999-11-16", "snippet": "Borders Group names Greg Josefowicz, president of Jewel-Osco, chief executive; will succeed Robert DiRomualdo, chairman who has also been acting as interim president and chief executive (M)", "word_count": 352, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Borders Names a New Chief From Outside Book Industry", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Borders Names a New Chief From Outside Book Industry", "body_text": " **********The Borders Group, the nation's second-largest bookseller, reached outside the book industry yesterday for a new chief executive, appointing Greg Josefowicz, a food and drugstore executive, to preside over its chain of nearly 300 bookstores and its electronic outlet, Borders.com. **********Borders took pains to describe Mr. Josefowicz as an avid book reader.

But the measure still failed to satisfy President Clinton's concerns about adequately protecting consumers and minorities. **********The lawmakers were expected to work through the night in a House-Senate conference. While a compromise between the Republicans and the White House was not out of the question, the initial votes taken tonight included a rejection of several amendments supported by Mr. Clinton's aides that would have strength-ened privacy rights of customers. **********The amendments' defeat dimmed the prospects that Congress and the White House would be able to reach an accommodation on the measure. **********Administration officials had said Mr. Clinton would veto the bill both because it failed to protect the privacy of customers of financial conglomerates and it diluted the provisions of a 1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in lending. **********The legislation, different versions of which have already been adopted by the House and the Senate, would repeal more than 60 years of laws that have restricted the cross-ownership of banks, insurance businesses and securities firms. **********For months, Mr. Clinton has appeared to make the privacy and discrimination matters a central policy focus of the debate on the legislation. He has suggested that he viewed those as more important than the issues that underlie the legislation and are of greatest interest to the financial industries - the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and other barriers to competition. **********In part, the Administration's interest in these matters reflected a belief that Americans are more concerned with privacy and discrimination than the nuances of bank regulation, even though three powerful industries - banks, securities and insurance - have heavily lobbied for the legislation, pouring more money into lobbying and campaign contributions than at any other time in modern poitical history. **********Tonight, the lawmakers defeated a measure, largely on party lines, sponsored by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. It would have permitted customers to block their banks from sharing private information with either affiliated companies like insurers and brokerage houses or with third parties such as telemarkers. **********Dozens of finance lobbyists lined basement hallways of the Capitol this afternoon as the conference committee neared completion of its work. The industry had uniformly lobbied against strengthening privacy protection for customers, maintaining that preventing the affiliates of financial-service conglomerates from sharing customer information and marketing would defeat the purpose of such combinations. **********''This amendment would place unworkable and inappropriate limits on sharing of information between commonly owned affiliates,'' said a letter to the lawmakers by trade groups for the securities, insurance and banking industries. ''Our associations will find it necessary to oppose any legislation'' that adopted such amendments, adding that there were consumer benefits derived from affiliates that shared information and were able to market more services. **********Those contentions were sharply criticized by Democrats who supported the Markey proposal. ''I've seen all the fat-cat lobbyists in their $1,000 suits outside looking very, very happy,'' said Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan. ''They're about to get everything they want.'' In the end, the Markey measure failed on an 18-to-12 vote that largely followed party lines. **********The vote suggested that partisan politics might play a strong, and possibly fatal role in deciding the measure's outcome. Throughout the day, there was no sign of significant compromise by the White House or the Republican leadership, particularly in the Senate. The lawmakers were not expected to begin a series of important votes until late tonight on the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which prohibits discrimination in lending. Those votes may ultimately determine the bill's fate. **********While the Community Reinvestment Act is not a significant issue for many bankers, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, has made it an issue in the legislation. Mr. Gramm, who heads the Senate banking committeee, has criticized the bill as adding burdens for financial institutions. The measure before the conference committee was written by Mr. Gramm and two other Republicans, Representatives Jim Leach of Iowa and Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia. **********For more than 85 percent of the nation's banks and savings associations, it would decrease the number of times that their leading records are reviewed to see if they have complied with the Community Reinvestment Act - to once every five years from once a year. **********Vice President Al Gore, who has not generally spoken on the legislation, issued a statement expressing his commitment ''to insuring that C.R.A. remains strong and is not weakened.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/22/business/mortgage-rates-are-lower.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-01-22", "snippet": "Interest rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages fall for the week, to average of 6.78 percent (S)", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mortgage Rates Are Lower", "print_headline": "Mortgage Rates Are Lower", "body_text": " **********The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell again this week, staying under the 7 percent mark since June -- the longest stretch on record, Freddie Mac reported today.

Yeah, Right", "body_text": " **********The World Trade Organization was meant to usher in a glorious new era of global trade harmony, but in the five years since its creation, the trade body increasingly has become more of an international agreement to disagree. **********That has been amply illustrated in the current gridlock on the agenda for negotiations at the rapidly approaching summit meeting of the organization, which makes the rules of global commerce and negotiates disputes among trading partners. **********Despite more than two months of effort, countries have made little progress on figuring out a framework for negotiation. The ministers, due to meet in two weeks in Seattle, could be facing a big wish list from member countries that will be difficult, if not impossible, to tackle in the four-day meeting designed to help dismantle resilient barriers to international trade. **********The seeds of the divisiveness were sown earlier this year with the bitter contest to select the first non-European head of the trade group.  Emerging-market economies, which comprise most of the trade group's 135 members -- Estonia joined today -- flexed their numerical muscle and stuck to demands for a developing country choice. **********The fissures that appeared during the selection fight continue to trouble the trade organization. In the run-up to Seattle, countries are dodging compromise and instead setting out their positions and refusing to budge to a degree that has imperiled a new round of global trade talks. **********''There will be a meeting in Seattle, but I am seriously worried that there might not be a trade round,'' one trade envoy said. ''The chances are getting slimmer every day,'' agreed Japan's trade diplomat, Yo ichi Suzuki. **********Negotiators are meeting days and some nights to thrash out an agenda, which right now is a rambling 32-page document. Despite high-level efforts two weeks ago in Lausanne, Switzerland, to kick-start talks, not much has happened. **********''Actually, we really haven't agreed on anything,'' one European envoy said. ''Even on the motherhood paragraphs dealing with developing countries and technical cooperation, there are two or three points of divergence.'' **********Despite two public warnings by Mike Moore, the director general of the organization, that the impasse threatens to torpedo the coming talks, countries continue ''to lay out their positions and stick to them,'' according to one participant in the private negotiation meetings at the organization's Geneva headquarters. **********''We're trying to work out what the playing field will be,'' said Australia's trade envoy, Geoffrey Raby. ''But this is an extremely complex exercise that involves real national interests so, of course, countries want to try to tilt the playing field in their favor.'' **********Mr. Moore has been convening small groups in his Green Room, a conference room near his office, in attempts to negotiate compromises. This week, some movement was apparently achieved in the thorniest area -- agriculture. Although the topic is part of the built-in agenda, meaning it has to be negotiated, delegates are laboring to figure just what the negotiations will encompass. **********The European Union and Japan, which have strong farming sectors, are battling the United States, Australia and other agriculture exporting countries over the issue. The exporters want agricultural goods to be treated just like any other goods, with subsidies and other protections eliminated. **********Earlier this week, several large farming groups said in Geneva that they opposed giving in to exporting countries on the issue. Australia's Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, accused the European Union and its allies of thwarting preparations for Seattle by refusing to give any concessions on the issue. **********A few days ago, a new two-page text on agriculture emerged informally from Green Room discussions. It dropped the reference to multifunctionality -- allowing reasons such as farming's role in maintaining rural life -- to be used to justify agricultural support. **********Japan, however, does not agree. ''The issue is too politically sensitive to be decided here,'' Mr. Suzuki said. **********Efforts to open to the public the trade organization's mostly closed proceedings also seem to have fallen flat, with most countries sticking to the idea that they belong to a government-to-government organization. Underlining this stubbornness is a failed attempt by Canada to introduce a new preamble to the agenda that explains in everyday English the mission and goals of the trade body. Canada's delegation had hoped such an approach would deflect criticism from labor and environmental organizations, which have protested that the trade group has enormous power and little accountability. **********With a short time left before hundreds of officials gather, Mr. Moore has indicated he plans to come up with two more drafts in the hope of reducing the document to a manageable negotiating size. However, it is unclear that any new draft would look much different from the current version -- which is the second draft -- although basic editing would slim it down. **********The key, diplomats agreed, is the political will to get it done. No one country is to blame, most said, but the enormous differences between the United States and the European Union have impeded progress. **********The accepted wisdom is that despite foot-dragging on agriculture, the Europeans want a wide-ranging set of trade talks to open markets and bolster the Continent's economies. The Clinton administration, enjoying a booming economy, wants a more limited agenda, especially on the verge of an election year when there is no point in antagonizing voting constituencies. **********''There is no talk of boycotting Seattle, but there is talk of putting off the round for a couple of years,'' a European negotiator said. ''But that would be dangerous indeed because a lot of momentum would go out of the trade liberalization process.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/03/your-money/IHT-briefcase-elf-wont-stay-alone-for-long.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-07-03", "snippet": "When Elf Aquitaine SA was battling with Norsk Hydro ASA to take over Saga Petroleum ASA, Andrew Killean was rooting for Elf.

They do not fundamentally alter the current view of the war and its aftermath so much as provide overwhelming evidence of a Serbian campaign, organized by a powerful, authoritarian state and its security forces, to drive nearly one million Albanians from the province. **********Given the numbers of the interviews, the accretion of fact and the character of the European agency itself, these reports will have an important impact. The 55-nation organization comprises the United States, Canada and all of Europe, including Russia and all the states of the former Soviet bloc; Yugoslavia is the only country under suspension. **********But the organization is still seen in Belgrade as more neutral than the International Tribunal in the Hague, which has already indicted President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and four of his top associates for the actions of Serbian forces in Kosovo. And the reports, while supporting allegations of Serbian war crimes, are also highly critical of the actions of the former Kosovo Liberation Army and its supporters in committing similar crimes. **********The first report provides coherent detail and moving personal testimony about how the Serbs exercised their power, the pattern of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24. In general, it is an effort to find a pattern in the war and serves to rebut suggestions that Serbian paramilitaries, who did much killing and looting, were outside the control of regular Serbian army and police officers. **********The report also suggests a kind of military rationale for the expulsions, which were concentrated in areas controlled by the insurgents and along likely invasion routes. The idea appears to have been to cut back on Albanian wealth, power and numbers in Kosovo, while disrupting bordering countries. **********The second report describes continuing horrors carried out by Kosovo Albanians after the war. Those are often organized by the former Kosovo Liberation Army, the report says, and are generally aimed at non-Albanians with the intention of driving them out of the province. **********Those actions, the report makes clear, have taken place under the nose and often under the eyes of NATO-led peacekeeping troops, who took control of Kosovo on June 12. **********''The desire for revenge'' on the part of Kosovo's Albanians, the report says, ''has created a climate in which the vast majority of human rights violations have taken place'' and led to ''the assumption of collective guilt,'' so that ''the entire remaining Kosovo Serb population was seen as a target.'' **********The report also attributes the violence to ''the intolerance that has emerged within the Kosovo Albanian community.'' It notes that ''opposition to the new order, particularly the (former) K.L.A.'s dominance of the self-styled municipal administrations, or simply a perceived lack of commitment to the K.L.A. cause has led to intimidation and harassment.'' **********There is strong evidence of ''a more systematic pattern'' and organization by the former rebel army, the report says, with ''a careful targeting of victims and an underlying intention to expel.'' **********The O.S.C.E. calls for investigation of these allegations, given denials of involvement by leaders of the former rebel army. But the group's summary of its own reporting says it is ''littered with witness statements testifying to K.L.A. involvement.'' **********''It is clear that the K.L.A. stepped in to fill a law-and-order void, but this 'policing' role is unrestrained by law and without legitimacy,'' the summary says. **********Both reports are to be released on Monday in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. **********The first report covers the period from October 1998, when the European group and diplomats from the member countries were invited into Kosovo to monitor a cease-fire between the ruling Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army, through the withdrawal of the monitors on March 20, 1999, just four days before NATO began bombing Yugoslavia. **********The report also tries to describe what happened in each of the 29 districts of Kosovo during the 78 days of bombing. Its account -- well-organized and careful about what is hearsay -- is drawn from refugee statements and interviews. **********The first report was written by the the European group's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, based in Warsaw, using hundreds of individual case reports, daily and weekly reports from the staff of the Kosovo Verification Mission through March 20, and more than 2,760 interviews with refugees who had fled to Albania and Macedonia. **********While the report concentrates on Serb abuses of the Albanians, it also details the prewar atmosphere, when Serbian forces were facing off against the rebels, who were kidnapping Serbian civilians and ambushing police officers and soldiers. **********The report also raises questions about some allegations reported in the West. It says that allegations of a torture chamber in the basement of the main police station in Pristina and another in a police station in Pec, have so far not been corroborated. **********Typically in an expulsion, the report says, the army would hold the ground and roads, and militarized police and paramilitaries would go into a village or town, sometimes after shelling, announcing on loudspeakers that Albanians had to leave and gather in a main area, usually within a short time. **********Sometimes paramilitaries would mistreat or shoot laggards, and then the population would be pushed along set routes toward Macedonia or Albania, the report says. Often those expelled were mistreated, threatened with death, rape or beatings unless they handed over money. Sometimes they were beaten anyway, or women were raped. **********Some were killed, especially those who had ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army or who were rich, and houses were burned to try to ensure that the residents would not return. **********Abuses and killings were worse in the villages, especially in areas controlled by the insurgents, than in the cities, where the insurgents were fewer or less visible, the report says. **********The report says that in Pristina, the situation changed considerably once foreign monitors left. Serbian police officers were ambushed, ''provoking a strong reaction.'' The police patrolled vigorously and took up sniper positions, while Albanians remained at home out of fear and then the Yugoslav army shelled parts of the town. Serbian police officers and soldiers killed some civilians. ''Dead bodies remained for days on the street because no one dared to remove them, the report says. **********''The most visible change in the events was after NATO launched its first airstrikes'' on March 24, the report continues. ''On one hand, the situation seemed to have slipped out of the control of any authorities, as lawlessness reigned in the form of killings and the looting of houses. On the other, the massive expulsion of thousands of residents from the city, which mostly took place in the last week of March and in early April, followed a certain pattern and was conceivably organized well in advance. The most persistent human rights violations were the systematic expulsions, which were accompanied by numerous killings, looting and the extortion of money.'' **********The perpetrators ''included police, army and various groups of paramilitaries, as well as local Serbs and, to a lesser extent, Gypsies,'' who were described as looting and removing dead bodies from the streets. **********The second report, which runs from mid-June of this year through the end of October, was produced by the Human Rights Division of the European group's mission in Kosovo, which has some of the same staff members as the prewar monitors. It provides details of human rights abuses against all groups in Kosovo for each of the five regions designated by peacekeepers, and provides daily summaries of reported abuses. **********The report blames the lack of law enforcement for creating a ''cycle of impunity.'' **********United Nations officials in Kosovo say they need governments to follow through on pledges of manpower and money to bring the United Nations police force up from its current level of 1,700 to the 6,000 requested. **********But Dennis McNamara, the director of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees operation in Kosovo, said the report also pointed to the need for more Albanian cooperation with investigations. ''We need a functioning police and legal system,'' he said. ''But we also need support from the local community, for them to be willing to come forward and help.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/13/business/company-news-homestorecom-agrees-to-acquire-homebuyer-s-fair.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-10-13", "snippet": "Homestore.com acquires Homebuyer's Fair unit of Central Newspapers Inc for $85 million (S)", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOMESTORE.COM AGREES TO ACQUIRE HOMEBUYER'S FAIR", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; HOMESTORE.COM AGREES TO ACQUIRE HOMEBUYER'S FAIR", "body_text": " **********Homestore.com said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Homebuyer's Fair unit of Central Newspapers Inc. for $85 million.

Nor can you do anything about it, except maybe pay for everything with cash (in which case your bank can collect and sell data on your A.T.M. use patterns). **********Last week, President Clinton pressed for tougher laws to curb or at least improve disclosure of what he called banking industry abuses like these. Consumer advocates say, however, that with the Government unlikely to afford adequate protections, bank customers must be wary. **********The President wants to have banks improve disclosure of fees, charges and interest rates. Consumer groups say that bank customers shouldn't have to be corporate lawyers or accountants to comprehend what their banks are offering. **********''Many people in this country are essentially math-illiterate, and they need information disclosed in terms that they can understand but that Congress is not requiring,'' said Gary Klein of the Consumer Law Center in Boston. **********Mr. Clinton wants credit card issuers who lure customers with low teaser rates to state prominently how much they charge after the introductory periods -- in some cases, more than 2 percent a month. For now, customers should concentrate not on the initial rates, often promoted even on the envelopes containing these offers, but on the regular rates, sometimes disclosed in small print and sometimes not at all. **********Automated teller machines present special challenges. People who use A.T.M.'s operated by banks where they do not have accounts often have to go through several steps to learn whether and what they will be charged. Last week, the Senate approved a requirement that banks post charges on the machines. **********Several of the President's proposals are meant to protect customers' privacy. Mary Griffin, a lawyer for Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, wants Congress, at a minimum, to require full disclosure in plain English when banks sell information about their customers and their spending habits. Better yet, she said, customers should be able to block the sharing or sale of this information, as President Clinton has proposed. **********But in the Senate, which last week passed a bill to repeal the core laws that have governed the banking industry since the Depression, the focus was much less on protecting consumers than on letting banks, insurers and securities firms enter one another's businesses. **********The President says that as banks expand their domains, there is greater need for new restrictions and privacy protections. When one company can own a bank, an insurance company and a brokerage firm, he said last week, ''you should not have to worry that the results of your latest physical will be used to deny your application for a mortgage or a credit card.'' **********Consumer advocates also want Congress to prohibit banks from pitching insurance and investment products to people with pending loan applications, a practice they regard as coercive. Banks aren't allowed to turn down loan applicants for refusing to buy other products, but those seeking loans often have the opposite impression. Consumer advocates advise applicants to get their loans first, then choose insurance and investments separately and free from untoward pressure. **********THE consumer groups say the President should have tried to give customers who buy securities from banks at least as many rights as those who buy from brokers. Most important, they say, are protections against being steered into unsuitable investments, like an especially volatile mutual fund or Internet stocks for an elderly widower with only modest savings. **********Also missing from the President's proposals are limits on the rates banks can charge on loans or credit cards, consumer groups say. States used to set limits, but Congress, with the backing of the Supreme Court, has asserted its dominance. **********Banks say the loosening of restrictions benefits many customers, because interest rates can be set according to each borrower's credit risk. While some people pay higher rates because of poor credit histories, the banks say, others now borrow at lower rates. **********But with credit card lenders having to write off only 1 percent of the money owed them, Mr. Klein said, punitive rates are not justified. **********While the President is threatening  to veto the Senate bill for weakening regulations aimed at making sure banks lend in the inner cities, he has not listed the other consumer issues as veto bait. **********Banking trade groups say that issues as complex as privacy and disclosure should be dealt with separately, rather than having them jeopardize legislation needed now. ''These consumer protection issues,'' said Ed Yingling, chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, ''are not germaine to the bill.'' **********But Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, said that the longer the delays, the greater the need to police bank practices. ''Banks are pushing the envelope in every direction, testing consumers and regulators,'' he said. ''And why? Because their consumer business is far and away their most profitable business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/18/business/ibm-to-offer-linux-with-netfinity-computers.html": {"writer_name": "Amy Harmon", "pub_date": "1999-02-18", "snippet": "IBM will ship its Netfinity line of network server computers with Linux, the free operating system, pre-installed alongside Microsoft Corp's Windows NT (M)", "word_count": 783, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "I.B.M. to Offer Linux With Netfinity Computers", "print_headline": "I.B.M. to Offer Linux With Netfinity Computers", "body_text": " **********In perhaps the most significant endorsement yet of the little operating system that could, the International Business Machines Corporation will announce today that beginning next month it will ship its Netfinity line of network server computers with the free operating system Linux pre-installed alongside Microsoft's Windows NT. **********Linux is a highly regarded flavor of Unix, a kind of operating system widely used in powerful business machines that serve as the hub of local computer networks and Web sites. **********But despite its power and stability, Linux has not gained wide acceptance because corporations have had nowhere to turn for support; it was designed and built by a loose international coalition of programmers who freely share its source code and collaborate on its development. Thus, there is no company that can be held responsible for the product. **********I.B.M. will address that drawback by offering customers technical support for the software through an agreement with a Linux distributor, Red Hat Software. **********The move by I.B.M. comes on the heels of decisions by several other computer manufacturers -- most notably Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer -- to sell machines that run Linux, making it a viable competitor to other flavors of Unix and, most notably, to  Windows NT. **********Although some system administrators and programmers within companies have embraced Linux because of its flexibility and propensity not to crash, the operating system has rarely been officially sanctioned by management because of its orphan status. **********''This increases the credibility of Linux in organizations,'' said Stacey Quandt, an analyst with Giga Information Group in Cambridge, Mass. ''A lot of companies are running Linux on some server in a closet somewhere, but when I.B.M. comes out and says they're supporting it, it creates a lot more credibility.'' **********I.B.M. said customer demand had been growing for Linux, particularly among Internet service providers and companies that want to take advantage of its open source code to modify their systems for their own needs. **********''If you go back to early PC days, what you typically saw was technically literate folks using PC's at home and moving them into businesses where it wasn't a top-down decision,'' said Phil Hester, chief technology officer of I.B.M.'s personal systems group. ''This has a lot of that same feel to it. We think we need to understand this marketplace and grow with it.'' **********Mr. Hester's division, which is based in Raleigh, N.C., just five miles from Red Hat's headquarters, has set up a laboratory to test Linux on the Netfinity servers, as well as on work stations and its Thinkpad line of laptops. In addition to Linux and Windows NT, the Netfinity servers will continue to be shipped with I.B.M.'s OS/2 operating system. **********The deal positions Red Hat, which also supplies Linux to Hewlett-Packard, as the leading commercial distributor of the operating system, although I.B.M. left open the possibility that it would also contract with one of Red Hat's competitors, like Caldera Inc. or SuSe. **********Linux, which can be had free on the Internet, has spawned a cottage industry of distributors that combine its various pieces on a CD-ROM with  basic technical information. **********Red Hat, a five-year-old start-up that last year received an equity investment from the Intel Corporation, aims to make money by selling technical assistance to Linux's growing customer base. Under the agreement with I.B.M., customers will have the option of buying Red Hat support directly or through I.B.M. The company's existing support contracts range from $1,000 a year for a single user to $60,000 a year for enterprises, depending on the number of computers linked to the server. **********Microsoft uses a different approach, pricing its support for the Windows NT Server by ''incident,'' meaning that when a customer has a problem, he gets Microsoft's help for a specified amount of money. Typically, this is about $195, with a volume discount for companies that prepay for 10 incidents. Windows NT itself range in price from about $250 for a single computer to about $55 per computer when licensed for 25 or more computers. **********''Intel's endorsement of Red Hat meant Linux was O.K. to use,'' said Robert C. Young, Red Hat's chief executive. But anyone who bought it still took on the liability for buying hardware not supported for Linux.

Fries; Thornburg Value Fund", "body_text": " **********THE idea, as always, is to buy low and sell high -- but that doesn't mean that William V. Fries looks only at stocks with tiny price-to-earnings ratios. **********A low ratio can sway him, of course, but Mr. Fries, who runs the $297.4 million Thornburg Value fund,  has a more elastic definition of ''value'' than many of his peers. And investors tend to take notice: Thornburg Value had an annual average return of 29.7 percent in the three years through March 5, compared with 28.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, placing it in the top 2 percent of mid-cap value funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. The fund returned 14.2 percent in the 12 months through March 5, below the 22.6 percent of the S.& P. but still in the top 4 percent of its peer group. **********Thornburg Value has achieved such performance in part by thinking small -- in portfolio size. The fund holds just 42 stocks, compared with 111 in the average value fund, according to Morningstar. **********Mr. Fries, who is 60, favors three broad categories of stocks: the basic-value companies that are the bread and butter of his trade, but also what he calls ''consistent growers'' and ''emerging franchises.'' **********He chooses basic-value stocks -- which account for 56 percent of the fund's assets -- by using traditional yardsticks like low price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios and high dividend yields. For these stocks, which tend to be clustered in the financial services, energy and telecommunications industries, he aims to pay no more than two-thirds of the market multiple -- the average price-to-earnings ratio of all S.& P. 500 stocks -- or about 22, lately. **********The consistent growers, including  pharmaceutical and consumer products companies, are 20 percent of the fund. ''Typically these companies will be less cyclical or have more reliable top-line earnings growth,'' said Mr. Fries, who is willing to pay the market multiple for them. **********He is willing to pay a premium, however, for his emerging franchises -- generally fast-growing companies that are not yet well-established in new or changing industries. ''These stocks are a lot more risky and tend to grow much faster,'' he said in a phone interview from his office in Santa Fe, N.M. For these companies in the portfolio, he projects average earnings growth of at least 15 to 20 percent. (Emerging franchises account for 17 percent of the fund; most of the remainder is in cash.) **********Mr. Fries sets a target selling price for each stock in his portfolio and veers from it only if the outlook for the company shifts significantly. For example, he has raised his target price for Charles Schwab & Company -- he won't specify how much -- because it has become a big force in Internet stock trading. **********Most value-fund managers favor stocks with P/E ratios in the single or low double digits, but Mr. Fries can scour for bargains at much higher elevations. ''We have a couple of positions in companies that haven't produced much in the way of earnings, like semiconductor manufacturers, and that drives up the P/E,'' he said. **********Technology stocks account for more than 20 percent of the portfolio  -- unusually high for a value fund. But he said prices were so cheap for some of these stocks last summer that he couldn't resist buying shares of Intel, Brooks Automation and Lam Research. **********ONE of his favorite basic-value stocks is El Paso Energy, a natural-gas company. Because of the company's extensive holdings overseas, the stock weakened last fall, when Mr. Fries began buying shares at $25 each. It closed on Friday at $35.75, or 17 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $2.10 a share. He predicted a three-year earnings growth rate of 10 percent. **********Mr. Fries also sees big potential in American Home Products, a pharmaceutical company in which some other investors see mostly a dearth of blockbuster drugs. ''It's been very good at making acquisitions, taking the costs out and boosting the revenues of acquired products,'' he said. He began buying the stock at $49 last June and projects a three-year earnings growth rate of 12 to 15 percent. It now trades at $65.375, about 33 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $2. **********In the emerging-franchise category, Mr. Fries likes Advent Software, which produces software used by investment advisers to track, report and reconcile stock trades. In his view, Advent's software is the most popular and economical on the market. Given the aging of America and all those retirement nest eggs to be managed, he projects that Advent's earnings will climb 20 to 30 percent a year, on average, over three years. **********He began buying Advent shares in November 1997 at $24 and recently added to his holdings. The stock now is at $48.875, or 31.5 times his 1999 earnings estimate of $1.55."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/09/world/crackdown-on-sect-yields-111-arrests-beijing-announces.html": {"writer_name": "Elisabeth Rosenthal", "pub_date": "1999-11-09", "snippet": "Chinese Govt offers first official tally of crackdown on banned Falun Gong spiritual movement; says 111 people have been formally arrested on variety of criminal charges; figure does not include larger number of Falun Gong members who face other f...", "word_count": 770, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Crackdown on Sect Yields 111 Arrests, Beijing Announces", "print_headline": "Crackdown on Sect Yields 111 Arrests, Beijing Announces", "body_text": " **********Chinese officials today offered the first official tally of the government crackdown on the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, saying 111 people had been formally arrested on a variety of criminal charges, from disrupting state security to stealing state secrets. **********But that figure does not include the much larger number of Falun Gong members who face other forms of detention, ranging from re-education programs to labor camps.

They said that a handful had died while in custody, but that they had either committed suicide or died of natural causes. **********''There have been no beatings or inhumane treatment,'' Mr. Li said. **********Almost daily for the last two weeks, small groups of Falun Gong members from out of town have been detained after sitting and sometimes meditating in small acts of silent protest in Tiananmen Square. A few said they had planned to deliver petitions to the government legislators who were meeting nearby, but apparently they did not succeed. **********The popular movement, which blends traditional exercises with Buddhism and Taoism as well as a dash of mystical beliefs, was banned in July and has since been the subject of an extensive vilification campaign in the state-controlled media, at state-owned companies and on university campuses. **********The country's top leaders, who rarely speak out directly on policy issues, have branded Falun Gong ''an evil sect,'' using apocalyptic metaphors. **********''The Falun Gong problem is not a simple one,'' said President Jiang Zemin, quoted in a new book, ''Falun Gong and Cults.'' **********''We must not underestimate it,'' he said, ''and even more so, should not be gullible. If this problem is not swiftly solved, it will become a major social disaster.'' **********The Chinese press and human rights groups outside China have reported a succession of formal arrests in the last week, ever since the government approved new laws dealing with cult activity. **********While some of those arrested, like a former police official, Li Chang, were known to be leaders of the group, others were more obscure. Zhang Ji, a student in Heilongjiang Province in the northeast, was arrested for ''spreading information about Falun Gong through the Internet,'' said the Information Center of Human Rights and Democracy in China, a Hong Kong human rights group. **********Falun Gong members in China originally relied heavily on the Internet to organize events and to keep in touch with practitioners overseas, but the group's Web sites are now blocked in China. **********The group said it had millions of members in China before the ban. It is not clear how many remain, although some followers are clearly still deeply committed. Many adherents said the exercises had restored their health and given them spiritual peace at a time when many Chinese feel left behind by the country's economic transformation. **********But the government says 1,400 people have died as a result of the anti-scientific bent of Falun Gong, which it said had prevented members from seeking medical treatment. ''They have been sick and not gone for treatment,'' Mr. Li said. ''Their families have asked us to intercede.'' **********He said at least one of the people who died while under police supervision, Li Ruihua, 47, had a previous heart problem that had been left untreated. **********Mr. Li said another follower, Chen Ying, 18, had committed suicide by jumping from a train while being escorted back to her hometown in Heilongjiang by officials from that area. **********A third follower, Zhao Jinghua, also had a previous heart problem and died of a heart attack during her ''education'' period near her home in the eastern province of Shandong, Mr. Li said. **********The officials did not say how many followers were still being ''educated'' or how long the process lasted, saying that it was generally left in the hands of officials in the followers' hometowns."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/17/business/investing-wall-street-discounts-the-future.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1999-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 760, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wall Street Discounts The Future", "print_headline": "INVESTING; Wall Street Discounts The Future", "body_text": " **********THERE is a ''good news, bad news'' quality to the current corporate earnings season. **********The good news is that third-quarter profit growth is projected to be vigorous, aided by a strong economy and favorable comparisons with the 1998 summer quarter, a period marred by a strike at General Motors and turmoil in world financial markets. **********The bad news is that because of rising interest rates -- the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has risen 1.17 percentage points this year, to 6.26 percent on Friday -- investors do not seem to care about the good news. ''The numbers are going to be pretty robust, but when you buy stocks, you are buying the future profits of the company,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. ''With interest rates rising, the value of the future is discounted. Higher interest rates make it harder to earn those profits.'' **********Richard Pucci, chief operating officer at I.B.E.S. International, a research firm, said that based on estimates of 10,000 securities analysts, operating profits for the companies that comprise the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index will show a 20 percent gain for the third quarter and an additional 20 percent in the following three months. **********''The numbers are good and the comparisons are easy,'' he said. ''But I think stocks have a little ways to go down, because the rise in interest rates will cause price-earnings multiples to decline.'' **********Indeed, since the earnings reporting period began in earnest last week, the S.& P. 500 has fallen 6.6 percent. Still, sectors with stronger-than-average profit growth are more likely to weather the effects of higher rates than those that underperform. **********I.B.E.S. expects the third-quarter winners to be led by energy companies, benefiting from the sharp rise in oil prices, with operating profits up 41 percent. And because conditions were so poor in 1998, profits at financial services companies should look much better, too, up an estimated 34.9 percent. Consumer cyclical companies, beneficiaries of shoppers' torrid spending, should see earnings rise 33.3 percent. And technology companies should do well, despite fears about Year 2000 computer problems; analysts expect their earnings to rise 31 percent. **********In fact, no sector is projected to show negative earnings growth for the period, though transportation companies are expected to show a profit increase of just 1.3 percent. Utilities also fared relatively poorly, as did consumer staples companies like Coca-Cola, Gillette and Revlon. **********As in the second quarter, when corporate profits were also healthy, much of the information about the third quarter was assimilated in advance by investors. **********''People have been talking for a long time about how good third-quarter earnings were going to be,'' said Sam Stovall, a senior investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. ''Now that earnings are coming in as expected, investors are saying 'good.' It's a little like a kid who wakes up Christmas morning and gets everything he wants.'' **********The Grinch in the earnings story, Mr. Stovall said, is the Federal Reserve Board: ''If worries about the Fed raising interest rates were not there, then I believe stock prices would have upside potential.'' **********MOST analysts agree that profit growth should remain strong in the fourth quarter. But when talk turns to 2000, opinions start to diverge. **********Mr. Ratajczak and other economists expect profit growth to slow sharply next year, as a combination of higher interest rates, rising employee costs and a slowdown in consumption bites into the bottom line. **********''You can't have consumption continue like this forever,'' Mr. Ratajczak said. ''Profit growth will be slightly negative next year due to higher labor costs, higher finance charges and slower revenue growth.'' **********Next year, profits ''are going to get hit from all sides,'' said Joseph Carson, chief fixed-income economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. **********Thomas M. McManus, equity portfolio strategist at Banc of America Securities and a longtime profits bull, disagreed. **********Mr. McManus said profit growth next year would slow slightly from the 20 percent increase he expects for the third and fourth quarter, but not much. **********''We think operating earnings will rise by 15 percent or better next year,'' he said. **********Mr. McManus said the increase in interest rates, wage rates and commodity prices would prove temporary, and that bonds would rally. Moreover, he said that profits in 1998 and 1999 have been depressed by investments that corporations have made in preparation for 2000. Those investments will start to pay off next year, he said. **********''I am looking for a bond market rally to shift some stock market laggards into overdrive,'' he said, pointing to four stock sectors: financial services, health care, consumer nondurables and utilities, all of which are suffering because of higher rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/24/world/serb-rejects-dead-son-s-medal-and-the-whole-war.html": {"writer_name": "Carlotta Gall", "pub_date": "1999-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1151, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Serb Rejects Dead Son's Medal, and the Whole War", "print_headline": "Serb Rejects Dead Son's Medal, and the Whole War", "body_text": " **********Last week, eight months after his 20-year-old son was killed in Kosovo, Dusan Vukovic lashed out at the man he holds responsible: President Slobodan Milosevic. **********When he was presented with a posthumous medal for his son,  Aleksandar, at a televised ceremony in his home town, Mr. Vukovic refused to take it, and demanded that it be sent back to Mr. Milosevic. **********''I told them to take that medal and give it to Milosevic to give to his son, because as far as I know, war decorations are given to war heroes who are standing up,'' he said in an interview today in this small town in southwestern Serbia. ''My son is lying down and I cannot put it around his neck.'' **********Mr. Vukovic's angry rejection of the medal was virtually the only public protest since the end of the war by relatives of fallen soldiers. But it touched a raw nerve and exposed a groundswell of bitterness among ordinary families. **********Overnight, Mr. Vukovic became a local hero. Several newspapers even proposed that he be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He says he has received hundreds of telephone calls from people all over Serbia and abroad. ''They said, 'Thank you, you have done a good job to stop this, to stop us losing our kids, and to show what people are thinking,' '' he said. **********Even the president of Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic within Yugoslavia, sent a message commending him, he said. As secretary of the local veterans' organization, Mr. Vukovic has now become a rallying point for many Serbs who lost relatives in the war to suppress Kosovo Albanian separatists and who say they will make similar protests. **********It was the scrap of cheap paper that was brought round to his home last week that started Mr. Vukovic's protest. The paper, a standard military form used to call up conscripts to military service, was headed: ''The Fatherland Calls You.'' But this paper called him to a reception at noon the following day to receive a ''decoration for your dead son,  Aleksandar.'' **********To Mr. Vukovic, 49, a factory worker and organizer of the local soccer fan club where his son played, this was an insult. ''Is it appropriate to call the father of a son who died on toilet paper?'' he asked, holding up the flimsy brownish paper. **********It summed up everything that he was angry about: Mr. Milosevic's politics, the indifference of the system and the senseless war that took his son's life. Aleksandar died from bullet wounds in northern Kosovo on April 13, apparently shot by ethnic Albanian rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army, although his father is still awaiting the results of the forensic analysis. **********Aleksandar had been in Kosovo just three days, sent in with the rest of his tank unit from its base in Nis, in southern Serbia. ''He did not have time to see a gun, or to shoot anyone,'' Mr. Vukovic said. ''He did not want to shoot anyone. A kid of 20 does not want to be in a war.'' **********Aleksandar telephoned his parents the night before he left for Kosovo. ''He told us to take care of ourselves,'' his father recalled. ''He said this guy will destroy us,'' a reference to Mr. Milosevic. **********''He always told us: 'Do not vote for him because you will destroy the kids,' '' Mr. Vukovic said. **********About 7,000 people turned out for Aleksandar's funeral at the New Cemetery on the edge of Kraljevo two days after his death. The family still visits the grave everyday, whatever the weather, sitting for hours on a nearby bench. ''My wife cries all the time,'' Mr. Vukovic said. **********He brushed the snow from the grave, revealing the grass underneath that he had laid to resemble a soccer pitch. A tall black granite headstone bore a full-length picture of his son as a young soccer player, his foot poised on the ball. On each side was the grave of another young man, each also a victim of the war in Kosovo. **********''Since Milosevic came to power, Kraljevo has lost 75 sons in 10 years of wars,'' Mr. Vukovic said. More than half of them -- 41 men from the town and its surrounding districts -- died in Kosovo, 7 apparently from NATO bombing and the rest in the conflict with the Kosovo Liberation Army, he said. About 95 men were wounded. **********So when Mr. Vukovic received the invitation to the ceremony for his son, he made his plans. He prepared his speech and took along a local television crew and an Agence France-Presse journalist, Miroslav Filipovic. **********''Milosevic's family is together at breakfast, lunch and dinner, while my family has breakfast and dinner at my son's grave,'' he told the colonel from the Defense Ministry who presented the medal. **********Then he criticized the army, which he said had failed to protect his son and sent young, inadequately trained conscripts to war. ''They do not react in the right way to protect the youth of this country,'' he recalled saying. ''They churn out these decorations daily, but one decoration means nothing if you do not have your boy.'' **********''And I refused the medal because they did not call the other 40 families to participate in that farce of a decoration ceremony,'' he said. ''They will do it one by one, so that people do not see how many here are wearing black.'' **********Mr. Vukovic's speech in front of the military officer, who stood as if turned to stone, was broadcast on local television and, in a rare incidence of free viewing in Serbia, was picked up by the national network and shown around the country. **********It was particularly striking for its criticism of Mr. Milosevic, who is usually praised on the nightly news by loyal regional figures who repeatedly call for him to be awarded medals for his leadership of the nation during the 11-week NATO bombing campaign to force Serbian forces from Kosovo. **********It also reminded local residents of the tumultuous events in June, when Serbian troops returned home from Kosovo, angry, humiliated and disillusioned, and took up armed positions in the town, aiming the weapons on their armored vehicles at the local police headquarters.

Last week, Creative Artists was shaken by the defection of Robin Williams, who quit the agency to join Mr. Ovitz. **********So far a number of Creative Artists clients have decided to stay with the agency but also join Mr. Ovitz's management company, called Artists Management Group. These include the directors Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack, and the actresses Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Lauren Holly and Marisa Tomei. It was unclear tonight how many of them would stay with Creative Artists, one of the most powerful talent agencies in Hollywood. **********The Creative Artists decision was highly unusual on several counts. It is unheard of for a talent agency to openly say it will not handle clients if they join a specific management company. It is also highly unusual to engage in a public fight, especially with someone like Mr. Ovitz who has a reputation as an unforgiving and strong-willed figure. ''This is saying to the town, you can't put us in the same room together,'' said one veteran movie industry producer who spoke on condition of anonymity. He added: ''This rarely happens. This is a declaration of war.'' **********Mr. Ovitz declined to respond to phone calls. **********The move by Creative Artists came after Mr. Ovitz lured Mr. Williams, one of its top clients, who earns nearly $20 million a film, to his company, and tried to bring in other agency clients. The move outraged the leaders of Creative Artists, most of whom were hired and trained by Mr. Ovitz, who began the agency with several partners. Several of the top agents at Creative Artists, who are mostly in their 30's and 40's, had seen Mr. Ovitz as a mentor, almost a father figure, until recently. **********Although many actors retain agents, if they have managers, Mr. Williams opted to leave Creative Artists entirely. Apparently, he will be represented by two management companies -- Mr. Ovitz's as well as his longtime managers, Morra, Brezner, Steinberg & Tennenbaum. **********How other top agencies respond to the Creative Artists move is unclear. Jeff Berg, chairman of International Creative Management, one of the most powerful agencies in Hollywood and a rival of Creative Artists, had no comment about the open warfare between Creative Artists and Mr. Ovitz. So far, International Creative Management has the most clients shared with Mr. Ovitz because of a longstanding friendly relationship with Mr. Ovitz's partner, Rick Yorn, and his sister-in law, Julie Silverman-Yorn, who together represent such clients as Cameron Diaz and Ed Burns. **********One top rival agent to Creative Artists said he saw no effort yet by Mr. Ovitz to poach on other talent agencies. ''What he's saying to CAA is, 'I've given this to you, and I can take it away,' '' the agent said. **********Mr. Ovitz, as well as Ron Meyer, now the president and chief operating officer of Universal Studios, started Creative Artists with several partners in the 1970's, and turned it into the most powerful and feared agency in Hollywood in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Mr. Ovitz left the agency in 1993 to serve as president of the Walt Disney Company. He was dismissed 15 months later by Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman. **********Mr. Ovitz's decision to turn to the management business came last year, and was plainly an attempt to move into the production of films and television. Managers are unregulated, can produce films and television and historically charge 15 percent of clients' fees. Under California law, managers are only obliged to advise clients but cannot secure employment or arrange contracts for clients. This is left in the hands of talent agents or, in some cases, lawyers. In reality, the line has often been blurred between agents and managers. **********The Creative Artists move was made by its leadership: Richard Lovett, the agency's president, and five other agents, Brian Lourd, Lee Gabler, Rick Nicita, Kevin Huvane and David O'Connor. The leaders of the agency said that in recent weeks  they had held as many as 10 private meetings with Mr. Ovitz to work out a viable working arrangement, and were blindsided when he signed up Mr. Williams last week. **********''It was an aggressive and hostile move by a competing agent, although he calls himself a manager,'' said one top Creative Artists executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said that Mr. Ovitz was ''talking to every client of ours that picks up his phone calls,'' and added, ''He's talking to everyone in town.'' **********Creative Artists represents such stars and directors as Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Steven Spielberg."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/17/business/3com-plans-job-cutbacks.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-04-17", "snippet": "3Com Corp will cut 150 jobs, or 1 percent of its work force, and reassign 150 other people to faster-growing parts of company (S)", "word_count": 93, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3Com Plans Job Cutbacks", "print_headline": "3Com Plans Job Cutbacks", "body_text": " **********The 3Com Corporation said yesterday that it would cut 150 jobs, or 1 percent of its work force, and reassign 150 other people to faster-growing parts of the company, as it devotes more resources to its emerging high-speed, home-networking and wireless businesses this year.

This policy, he adds, must be one of ''fully acknowledged self-interest.'' **********Under Mr. Schroder's predecessor, Helmut Kohl, and other postwar chancellors, any reference to Germany as ''a great power'' or to national ''self-interest'' tended to be studiously avoided. **********Rather, Germany liked to portray its interests as being synonymous with those of European integration and the NATO alliance out of a generally unspoken fear that any other policy would be regarded as incipient nationalism or a sign that an ugly history was rearing its head once more. **********But the arrival in power of a postwar generation led by Mr. Schroder, and the Government move from Bonn to Berlin, have signaled a distinct shift whose full scope the Chancellor has now articulated. **********NATO used to be an organization ''that served to protect Germany, but also as protection against Germany,'' the Chancellor writes, adding that this concept ''has no value from now on.'' In its place, he suggests, a Germany without complexes has emerged. **********Of course, the term ''great power'' is generally associated with a country possessing nuclear weapons -- not the case in Germany. But Germany's prominent military role as part of a NATO force that bombed Kosovo signaled an end to the often repeated postwar principle that ''only peace'' would ''go out from German soil.'' **********The repercussions on European politics appear likely to be marked, not least on the French-German alliance, the relationship long at the heart of European integration and one based on a now exhausted marriage of interests. **********As a power under Western tutelage, Germany could look to France for political muscle, while France relied on Germany to provide the economic dynamism it lacked. But now Germany has declared its intention to wield political power commensurate with its economy, which is one-third larger than the French, while France has fewer complexes about its fast-changing economy than a decade ago. **********''France used to be proud of its historical essence and worried by its performance, while Germany was proud of its performance but ashamed of its history,'' said Dominique Moisi, a French foreign policy expert. ''An alliance on that basis made sense, but now everything has changed.'' **********The impact of Mr. Schroder's shift on Germany's relationship with the United States appears likely to be less strong so long as Germany's new commitment to ''national interests'' does not involve deviation from NATO. **********Mr. Schroder, whose push to wean Germany from Mr. Kohl's relentless and painful history lessons has been generally popular, makes no overt reference to Hitler or the Nazis in the article and outlines what he sees as the future of a large European power that has paid its historical dues. **********''Our partners have shown us that they accept us as equals, and that is the reason why they now expect us to accept and perceive our historic responsibility in an offensive way,'' he writes. As as example of this ''offensive'' responsibility, he cites Germany's role in stopping killing and ''ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo. **********Germany flew numerous sorties during the NATO bombardment of Kosovo and has deployed over 3,000 soldiers to the Prizren area as part of the peacekeeping force there. This role reflects Germany's new status, Mr. Schroder writes. **********Although the shift in Germany's policy and self-image is clear, the Chancellor repeatedly alludes to the importance of continuity, saying that Germany's ''anchoring'' in NATO and the European Union is irreversible and that its foreign policy will remain ''in Europe, for Europe and of Europe.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/25/business/economic-calendar.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-10-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 38, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Calendar", "print_headline": "Economic Calendar", "body_text": " **********Expected dates for the release of major economic indicators this week. **********MONDAY **********Existing-Home Sales   Sept. **********TUESDAY **********Consumer Confidence   Oct. **********WEDNESDAY **********Durable Goods Orders   Sept. **********THURSDAY **********G.D.P.

But this quarter, three managers beat the index, which rose 7.06 percent, and the other two did not miss by much. In comparison, the average diversified domestic equity fund tracked by Lipper Inc. rose 10.16 percent. **********The winner for the quarter was Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., with a return of 12.74 percent. His portfolio of all-Fidelity funds excelled because of big stakes in Fidelity Small Cap Stock, which rose 18.38 percent, and Fidelity Value, a new addition, up 25.60 percent. **********''Diversification does make sense, exactly for periods like last quarter, when we saw some of last year's biggest laggards come to life,'' he said. ''That's why we don't rely on short-term past performance to guide us.'' **********Mr. Kobren credits much of his winning performance to his shift last quarter out of Fidelity Spartan Government Income, a bond fund, and into Fidelity Value, a stock fund. ''I'm still a believer in active fund management,'' he said, ''but there's little doubt that asset and investment style allocation will determine most of your portfolio returns.'' **********He plans no changes to his portfolio. **********''Going forward, I wouldn't expect the deep cyclicals that moved so quickly so far to dominate uninterrupted,'' he said. ''But I do think they could continue to be market leaders through the rest of the year.'' **********The performance of the hypothetical portfolios is tracked each quarter by Lipper Inc. of Summit, N.J. It excludes sales charges, transaction costs and taxes, because most retirement money is held in tax-deferred accounts. The five managers can choose any funds open to new investors and can shift money quarterly. From the outset of the competition, in July 1993, the managers were asked to pick portfolios intended to grow for 20 years. **********SHELDON JACOBS, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers with a gain of 157.94 percent since the contest began. In that time, the five managers' portfolios have risen an average of 132.25 percent, compared with a 250.66 percent return for the Vanguard 500 Index fund, which mimics the performance of the S.& P. 500. **********Harold R. Evensky, a financial adviser in Coral Gables, Fla., took second place in the quarter, with a gain of 11.63 percent. ''As is so frequently the case, the gurus who have recently counseled that all is for naught except large-cap domestic growth stocks timed it wrong,'' he said. ''Diversification hasn't died -- at least not yet.'' **********Mr. Evensky is making only one change -- to replace Barr Rosenberg Market Neutral, which was 11 percent of his portfolio and has turned in disappointing results since he bought it in December 1997. ''Although I'm a patient investor, recent performance has been not only disappointing but inexplicable,'' he said. ''I obviously made a mistake.'' **********With the proceeds, he is putting 7 percent of the portfolio into Vanguard 500 Index and adding the remaining 4 percent to his position in Vanguard Value Index. **********A WELL-DIVERSIFIED portfolio also helped Susan Dziubinski, who edits the Morningstar Fund Investor. She took third place for the quarter, with a gain of 10.75 percent, helped by her strong overseas holdings. **********Her biggest winner was Liberty-Newport Tiger, which invests in Asia's smaller markets; it returned 28.64 percent. **********Ms. Dziubinski is eliminating the Yacktman fund, which has underperformed its mid-cap blend peers for three years, and adding the proceeds to T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth. **********She is staying with mid-cap stocks, she said, because they ''have less volatility than small-caps but tend to do well when small-caps do well.'' **********Mr. Jacobs, who took first place in the first quarter on the strength of his big domestic holdings, tumbled into fourth place for the second quarter, with a gain of 6.96 percent. But he plans no changes to the domestic holdings in his portfolio, half of which is invested in Vanguard 500 Index and the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index. **********''The two index funds include value stocks, and we do have some small-stock representation,'' he said, adding that Baron Growth (formerly Baron Growth and Income) was now focusing more on smaller stocks. **********But he is reshuffling his international holdings. He is reducing his 10 percent position in T. Rowe Price European Stock to 7.5 percent, is eliminating his 5 percent position in Montgomery International Growth and is buying Strong Asia Pacific. ''The international portion had been overweighted in Europe because the Pacific had not been doing well, but things have changed,'' he said. **********He likes Strong Asia Pacific because one-quarter of its stocks are in Japan and the balance are in other parts of Asia. Most other Asia-Pacific funds invest predominantly in Japan. **********Jack A. Brill, a San Diego investment adviser who advocates ''socially responsible'' investing, took last place for the quarter, with a gain of 6.16 percent in his portfolio of mostly mid-  to large-cap stocks. To increase his stake in smaller stocks, he is selling Bridgeway Social Responsibility, a large-cap fund that was 10 percent of his portfolio, and putting most of the proceeds into two funds that own smaller stocks: 5 percent to Ariel Appreciation and 3 percent to Citizens Emerging Growth. **********He is adding the remaining 2 percent to Pax World, a balanced fund, to build up the defensive part of his portfolio.

He was 85. **********The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Heidi Vernon. **********Mr. Vernon was a member of the Marshall Plan team that guided the economic revival of Europe after World War II, and worked on the development of the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. After serving in the Government in the Securities and Exchange Commission and the State Department for nearly two decades, he went to Harvard University in 1956 and never left. **********At Harvard, Mr. Vernon first led an ambitious three-year research project on the New York metropolitan region that was regarded as a pioneering work in urban studies -- the work was supported by the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. Afterward, at the Harvard Business School and later at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, Mr. Vernon focused for decades on the study of the international economy -- especially the increasing role played by multinational corporations and the limits to governmental power. **********''Ray Vernon was the father of globalization long before people used that term,'' said Daniel Yergin, an author and business consultant. ''His work has had a phenomenal effect on several generations of thinking about how the global economy works.'' **********Mr. Vernon's books on these subjects -- including ''Sovereignty at Bay'' in 1973, ''Storm Over the Multinationals'' in 1977, and ''Beyond Globalism'' in 1989 -- were influential and often far-sighted. **********In ''The Commanding Heights,'' a 1998 best seller by Mr. Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw, the authors, recognizing the scholarly foundation laid by Mr. Vernon in the study of relations between Government and the global marketplace, wrote, ''It is impossible to write about these issues without acknowledging the profound intellectual impact that Prof. Raymond Vernon has had on them over the half-century.'' **********Kim B. Clark, dean of the Harvard Business School, called Mr. Vernon ''one of the most influential scholars of his generation, a true pioneer in the study of multinational corporations and the international economy.'' **********Born on Sept. 1, 1913, in New York City, Mr. Vernon was one of four children in a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia. **********His father, Hyman, drove a truck delivering seltzer water to restaurants and bars in the Bronx, and Mr. Vernon and his two brothers helped their father heft the crates of seltzer on and off the truck. **********Their family name was Visotsky, but the children changed it to Vernon, beginning with Raymond's older brother, Sidney. Recalling her uncle's explanation, Heidi Vernon said he changed his name to improve his chances of being accepted into medical school. All four of the siblings -- Sidney, Leo, Raymond and Corrine -- earned doctoral degrees. **********Mr. Vernon received a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1933, and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University in 1941. **********At the S.E.C., where he worked from 1935 to 1946, Mr. Vernon handled various assignments from studying the behavior of floor traders and specialists on the New York Stock Exchange to planning securities enforcement programs. **********While at the State Department, he was one of the negotiators who brought Japan into the GATT trade system and helped secure nondiscriminatory treatment for Japanese exports. **********In the early 1950's, as acting director of the Office of Economic Defense and Trade Policy, he oversaw trade with the Soviet-bloc nations and encouraged their trade with non-Communist countries. **********Mr. Vernon's economic perspective, according to Mr. Yergin, who knew him for many years, was shaped by having grown up in the Depression and by his years at the S.E.C. ''He believed in markets, but he also saw the weaknesses -- where they can go wrong,'' Mr. Yergin said. **********In 1956, Mr. Vernon went to Harvard to head the three-year study of the New York metropolitan region. His urban studies project concluded with a measured though prescient projection -- continued growth and prosperity for the three-state region, but decline for broad swathes of the region's inner cities. **********Mr. Vernon began his research into multinational corporations in 1965. His early work anticipated that multinationals -- as efficiency-seeking enterprises -- would transfer labor-intensive work on standardized products to developing nations. In ''Storm Over the Multinationals'' he analyzed how the pragmatic decisions of increasingly global companies held a growing sway over economic forces once controlled by governments, like trade flows and levels of investment. **********Later, when European nations tried to combat the power of American multinationals by fostering the creation of state-owned ''national champion'' corporations, Mr. Vernon predicted early on that the tactic would prove to be poor policy. **********''His view was that state-owned enterprises could not compete with the investor-owned multinationals, which are more flexible,'' said Robert Stobaugh, a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School. ''His research became part of the foundation for the privatization push of the 1980's.'' **********Short and wiry, Mr. Vernon was an athlete until cancer slowed him down last year. An avid oarsman, he could be seen daily at dawn on the Charles River in his single scull. He competed for decades in the annual Head of the Charles crewing competition. Icy winters did not cool his competitive zeal. In his 80's, in fact, he set a world record for his age group in one class of ''indoor sprints,'' rowing machines with odometers attached. He was a member of the Cambridge Boat Club for 40 years. **********''One of the great sadnesses of his life,'' said his daughter, Heidi, ''was that he was not able to be on the river these last months.'' **********Mr. Vernon's wife of 60 years, Josephine, died in 1995. Mr. Vernon is survived by his two brothers, Sidney and Leo, and his sister, Corinne; and by his two daughters, Heidi Vernon of Newton, Mass., and Susan Vernon Gerstenfeld, also of Newton, Mass., four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. **********Mr. Vernon, the renowned student of multinationals, was once employed by a multinational-in-the-making. In 1954 he went to work for Forrest Mars Sr., who built the Mars candy empire. Mr. Vernon was placed in charge of planning, finance and new products. He oversaw the development effort that led to chocolate-covered peanut M & M's. **********The new peanut variety was a success, and, in the candy industry, Mr. Vernon was called ''the man who put the crunch in M & M's.'' **********Mr. Vernon's foray into the private sector was short-lived, since he went to Harvard after less than two years in the candy business. But he would always talk of his M & M exploits at family gatherings, impressing the younger members of the Vernon clan, recalled his daughter, Heidi. ''He told the grandchildren that he was the person who figured out how to get the letter M on each and every piece of candy,'' she said, ''and they'd all believe him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/10/business/microsoft-appears-unlikely-to-settle-its-antitrust-case.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1999-03-10", "snippet": "Microsoft Corp is not is expected to settle Justice Department's antitrust case, which broke for six-week recess on Feb 26; Government is seen in strong position at trial (M)", "word_count": 623, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Appears Unlikely To Settle Its Antitrust Case", "print_headline": "Microsoft Appears Unlikely To Settle Its Antitrust Case", "body_text": " **********When the Microsoft antitrust trial broke for a six-week recess on Feb. 26, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had some parting words for both sides. He called the lawyers for the Government and the Microsoft Corporation into his chambers and told them to ''use this six weeks wisely,'' according to a person close to the case. **********It was a garden-variety judicial admonition, legal experts say, to urge the two sides to see if they could again try to settle their dispute. Judges, they say, typically prod litigants to reconsider the option of settlement at key stages in a case. In the Microsoft trial, the 12 witnesses for each side have concluded their testimony. **********There are no settlement talks currently under way between Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the software maker, according to a person close to the case. **********The Seattle Times reported yesterday that the Government and Microsoft were ''exploring ways'' to settle the suit and quoted Robert J. Herbold, the chief operating officer of Microsoft, as saying, ''You never block out the notion of settlement.'' **********A day after the Intel Corporation announced a proposed settlement of its antitrust dispute with the Federal Trade Commission, the possibility that Microsoft might also settle its case drove its stock price sharply higher yesterday morning. In early trading, Microsoft's stock traded as high as $164.75 a share, up $5.75 from Monday's close, though it drifted down later in the day to close at $161.813 a share. **********Microsoft and the Justice Department did hold settlement talks in the days before the Government and states filed their sweeping antitrust case against the company last May -- but those talks quickly broke down when it became clear the two sides were far apart. **********The Microsoft and Intel cases, legal experts noted, are very different. A settlement in one, they added, suggests next to nothing about the chances of a settlement in the other, even though both are computer industry powers charged with violating antitrust laws. **********The F.T.C. filed a complaint against Intel contending that the big chip maker unfairly withheld technical information from three computer makers as a strong-arm tactic in patent disputes. The Government's case against Microsoft, by contrast, is a sweeping antitrust suit contending that the software maker repeatedly tried to stifle competition -- charges Microsoft fiercely denies. **********''A settlement would be far more difficult to reach in the Microsoft case because the stakes are so much greater and the distance between the two sides is so much wider than it was in the Intel case,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. **********Though not out of the question, settling a case after a trial has begun is far less common than before testimony begins, as Intel did. ''Once the two sides have descended into combat, it is far more difficult,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust litigator at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider in New York. **********What Microsoft might or might not agree to as part of a settlement is closely related to the debate over the remedies the Government might seek if it wins the case. These range from prohibiting Microsoft from entering into exclusionary contracts to splitting up the company. **********The Government, according to most courtroom observers, will likely win in Judge Jackson's court after a strong trial performance by its legal team. ''So it would take a real change in Microsoft's thinking for it to offer something that the Government could accept as real remedial settlement,'' said one person close to the case. **********Another hurdle in reaching a settlement is that any proposal would have to be acceptable not only to the Justice Department, but also to the 19 states involved in the case. A few dissenting states, or even one, could scuttle a settlement proposal, legal experts say."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/world/party-paper-in-china-makes-rare-mention-of-89-protests.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Eckholm", "pub_date": "1999-06-03", "snippet": "People's Daily, Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper, makes rare reference to 1989 democracy movement in Tiananmen Square; in editorial on 10th anniversary of protests says violent crushing of demonstrations was essential to protection of ...", "word_count": 488, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Party Paper in China Makes Rare Mention of '89 Protests", "print_headline": "Party Paper in China Makes Rare Mention of '89 Protests", "body_text": " **********The Communist Party's flagship newspaper made a rare reference today to the 1989 democracy movement in Tiananmen Square, calling the violent crushing of those demonstrations essential to the protection of national stability and economic progress. **********The editorial in People's Daily, ''Unswervingly Maintaining Social Stability,'' cited the NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last month as evidence that ''hostile forces in the West have never abandoned their scheme to ruin China.'' **********History has demonstrated, the editorial added, that the ''firm and resolute suppression of the political turmoil in Beijing'' in 1989 protected ''national independence, dignity, security and stability and insured the sustained, healthy development of economic reforms and opening to the outside world.'' **********''China must steadfastly avoid letting a disturbance created by outside forces spark internal chaos,'' said the editorial, the latest installment in a campaign mounted after the embassy bombing, to paint Western human rights concerns as a plot to undermine China's progress. **********Oddly, the English-language version of the editorial distributed by the official New China News Agency omitted the direct references to the demonstrations in 1989. **********On the surface, life goes on as normal here and elsewhere in China.

The detainees included seven people in the southern city of Hangzhou who had planned to commemorate the 1989 demonstrations and were held today, the information center said. **********In Beijing, in luxury hotels and some private compounds housing foreigners, CNN service on cable television has been temporarily cut off, apparently because the channel is transmitting numerous programs on the legacy of the demonstrations and their suppression. But almost no Chinese have access to CNN, anyway. **********In another action that largely affects foreign visitors, Hong Kong and foreign newspapers delivered to hotels here and in Shanghai have been arriving with articles about China cut out by Government censors.

Known on the web as Merlin, Mr. Rea puts his picks out to members, who then tend to pile into the stocks. **********Mr. Rea -- now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for his site's relationship with a brokerage firm he has recommended to customers -- definitely has pull. The shares he often touts make impressive trading spikes. But when the buying stampede slows, the stocks quickly drift down. **********Among the stocks Merlin touted the  first week of February were Bull & Bear Group, a mutual fund company; Imaginon, a money-losing software concern, and three brokerage firms: J. B. Oxford Holdings, Muriel Siebert & Company and M. H. Meyerson & Co. They went up when he waved his wand and dropped when he stopped. **********It is doubtful that all the Merlin followers who piled into these stocks were able to get out before they fell. But documents now trickling in show that another cast of characters made big money on the sudden popularity of these shares -- corporate insiders. **********On the very day that Merlin was advising investors to plunge into Bull & Bear Group, for example, five of its insiders were selling stock. Insiders sold a total of 127,500 shares on Feb. 4 at prices between $7.19 and $9.25, generating almost $1.1 million for the sellers. Not bad for a day's work -- especially considering that two trading days later, the stock had fallen back to around $4. It closed last week at $3.75. **********Insiders at M. H. Meyerson & Co. did even better. As investors piled in from Feb. 3 to Feb. 5, the company's five top executives were getting out. They sold 501,760 shares, generating $6.4 million. Martin H. Meyerson, the brokerage firm's chairman and founder, sold 200,000 shares -- almost 8 percent of his holdings -- at prices between $8.99 and $15.88. He reaped almost $2.5 million. M. H. Meyerson shares closed at $4 on Friday. **********And finally there were the insiders exiting Imaginon Inc., a favorite that Merlin has touted more than once. On Feb. 5, as Merlin was pushing the stock, an insider named Henry Fong sold $1.2 million in Imaginon shares at prices between $6 and $7.19 each. The stock has since fallen to $4.875. **********None of the executives who sold their shares in February returned phone calls Friday seeking comment. But Imaginon's president, David Schwartz, who has complained publicly about the manic price swings in his stock, said Mr. Fong told him that his sales were for personal reasons and that their timing was coincidental to the surge in the stock. **********There's nothing wrong, of course, with insiders taking profits in a rising stock. But such sales may suggest that the people who know a company best don't expect the shares to keep going up. Bob Gabele, who tracks insider transactions for First Call in Rockville, Md., put it simply: ''Investors who are rushing to buy have to worry about who's heading for the door.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/19/world/london-journal-plinth-seeks-occupant-nelson-will-be-neighbor.html": {"writer_name": "Warren Hoge", "pub_date": "1999-08-19", "snippet": "Statue of Jesus now occupies unused plinth in London's Trafalgar Square, first of several works of art by British sculptors that will be changed ever six months; they will take their place there as part of effort by Royal Society of Arts to spur p...", "word_count": 1030, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "London Journal; Plinth Seeks Occupant.

It turned out that at his death in 1837 he had left no money behind to build his memorial, so the plinth ended up vacant. **********It has remained that way until now, a precious piece of architectural real estate facing avenues lined with Britain's sovereigns, war heroes and parliamentary leaders. It stands in starkly empty contrast to the three matching granite bases elsewhere in the square bearing the triumphalist likenesses of King George and two military commanders from the days of empire: Sir Henry Havelock and Gen. Sir Charles James Napier. **********After 158 years, a figure has appeared atop the plinth this summer, the first in a series of six-month occupants, all produced by British sculptors. They will take their place there as part of an effort by the Royal Society of Arts to spur a public debate on what permanent use to make of the choice spot. **********Suggestions have ranged from the Queen to the Spice Girls to a giant pigeon, in honor of the square's most numerous inhabitants. But the first arrival, appropriately for the eve of the Third Millennium, is Jesus. **********Standing modestly in the shadow of the 172-foot tower with Lord Nelson on top and four lions at its base and the dark military statuary on the three other corners of the square, it is a human-scale Jesus in white marble resin. He is bare-chested, without the customary long hair and beard, his eyes are downcast and his hands are bound behind him. A twist of gold-plated barbed wire encircles his head. **********The work, called ''Ecce Homo -- Behold the Man,'' is by Mark Wallinger, 40, a London sculptor who said he was trying to portray a vulnerable Christ at the moment of His presentation to the crowds by a mocking Pontius Pilate. Though the sculpture has struck some observers as too diminutive and retiring to represent the son of God, Mr. Wallinger said in a written explanation accompanying its installation last month that that was his intention. **********''The purity of a white statue and the humility of its life-size would contrast with the outsized black bronze relics of empire,'' the artist said. **********In January it will be replaced by a work of Rachel Whiteread, 36, who has built a replica of the 24-foot-tall, 15-foot-long and 6-foot-wide plinth to be placed upside down on top of the real one. **********''After spending time in Trafalgar Square observing the people, traffic, pigeons, architecture, sky and fountains, I became acutely aware of the general chaos of central London life,'' she said in a statement about her entry. ''I decided that the most appropriate sculpture for the plinth would be to make a 'pause,' a quiet moment for the space.'' **********Next summer will see ''Listening to History,'' described by its sculptor, Bill Woodrow, 51, as ''a large statue head with a book covering the uppermost ear, the two held together on the plinth by the root mass of a tree.'' **********The three sculptors were the finalists from a group of 19 who submitted ideas to a panel of artists and curators set up by Prue Leith, a deputy chairman of the Royal Society of Arts who has campaigned for five years to draw attention to the neglect of the plinth. A Web site (www.fourthplinth.com) has been created to elicit comment and suggestions, and a final decision will be made by a committee headed by the writer Sir John Mortimer that will consider all the possibilities thrown up by the display of the three temporary works. **********Christopher J. Thorpe, the project's design director, said that of the estimated 5,000 people who had already visited the site, 40 percent liked the Wallinger, 20 percent disliked it and the remaining 40 percent favored using the plinth for a rotating exhibition of British contemporary art. **********''The juxtaposition of the Christ figure with the other figures in the square fosters levels of reflection of a profound nature,'' one wrote. Another asked: ''How often do we actually bother to look at official public sculpture? I know that I have never spent time looking at the sculptures on the other three plinths, they are just part of the urban wallpaper. By having an ever-changing site, one will be keen to see what's being shown currently and how is it different from what's gone before.'' **********One respondent saw an opportunity for another equestrian statue, ''either St. George killing a Welsh dragon or Henry V killing lots of Frenchmen.'' **********Last month, The Evening Standard threw the contest open to its readers and published two full pages of responses. The Queen and Queen Mother figured in many answers, though traditionally statues are not built of royals during their lifetime. Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House of Commons, suggested a representation of the women of World War II. **********Among the other names that emerged were Shakespeare, Thomas Paine, Gandhi, Nehru, Nelson Mandela, Diana, George Orwell, Dickens,  Churchill, Florence Nightingale, Margaret Thatcher and Alan Turing, the British mathematician who cracked the German naval Enigma code during World War II and developed early computing concepts. **********The last word may go to a letter writer named Jane Birch who said that the plinth was ''wonderful: a great, tomblike slab in Trafalgar Square's northwest corner.'' **********''Leave it be,'' she said. ''Our descendants will thank us for it.'' **********Or then again it might go to Larry Adler, the 84-year-old American harmonica player who has lived in England since being blacklisted in the United States in 1949 for his political views.

Bush, ''Fortunate Son: George W. Bush and the Making of an American President'' from bookstores across the country. The publishing house said that it no longer trusted the author, J. H.

Immigration at a rate of up to 150,000 a year has been largely responsible for the increase. A \"White Australia\" selection policy that largely excluded Asians and other non-Europeans was formally abolished in the early 1970s. **********But the government of Prime Minister John Howard has been keeping the number of legal settlers from the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and other parts of the world to an annual level of around 80,000 in the past few years. **********At the same time, the government has raised the proportion of skilled migrants in the program to around 50 percent in 1999 from 29 percent five years ago. **********Analysts said that in doing so, the government was mindful of the belief among a substantial number of Australian voters that too much immigration would cause job losses, falling wages and lower living standards. **********\"Some have argued we should take action to achieve a much smaller population,\" said Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock. **********\"Others have argued for a much larger population,\" he said. \"On the evidence I have seen to date, the environmental arguments for a much smaller population do not stack up against the social and economic costs involved in achieving it.\" **********Mr. Ruddock said he expected that Australia's population would stabilize at around 23 million by 2050 and that most Australians \"would not be alarmed by this prospect.\" **********Business groups that want to prime the economy with more foreign workers established an Australian Population Institute last month to develop the case for such a program. **********The institute has called for a population of 50 million by 2050. **********\"This would require an annual immigration intake of 450,000 and require the construction of seven new Sydneys, one every seven years,\" Mr. Hamilton said. **********He said serious debate was needed to decide on the optimum sustainable population. **********\"A zero-population-growth policy will still require 30,000 or so immigrants each year to offset emigration, and if fertility rates continue to fall, we will need more like 70,000 in the longer term,\" Mr. Hamilton added. **********As with other mature economies in North America, Europe and Japan, Australia's birth rate has dropped sharply in the past couple of decades, to below the level required to replace the existing number of Australians. At the same time, the population is aging rapidly. Instead of having six workers for every retiree, as it does now, Australia will have only three by 2028. **********\"Without an influx of young workers or an impossible increase in productivity, Australia is unlikely to be able to support this level of dependence and maintain its current standard of living,\" The Australian newspaper said recently. **********\"By contrast, our neighbors in Asia are growing strongly.

Mr. Primakov had traveled to Belgrade on March 30, a week after the NATO bombing began, but that attempt at mediation was rebuffed by NATO. **********While Mr. Gore's office did not disclose Mr. Primakov's response today, an aide to the Vice President said the two talked about ''how we might cooperate to urge Milosevic to take steps to end the conflict.'' The Vice President made ''the point there is a diplomatic track and we'd prefer diplomacy to bombing,'' the aide added. **********Using the Russians as a bridge to the Yugoslav President would help resolve the problem the Administration and NATO would have dealing directly with Mr. Milosevic after denouncing him so fiercely for the operation to drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo. Mr. Milosevic has told officials in Europe that he is not willing to deal directly with the United States. **********Senior Administration officials also said that actively involving the Russians would help soothe relations with Moscow, which has vehemently opposed the NATO bombing. **********Administration officials said the Russians would be asked to urge Mr. Milosevic to accept the four points that the NATO allies outlined last weekend as a condition for ending the NATO bombing. These are the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, the return of the refugees, the introduction of an international security force and self-government for Kosovo. **********''If the Russians obtained the agreement that would be good for the Russians,'' said a senior Administration official. ''And it would be good for us because we don't have to meet with Milosevic.'' **********In announcing these four points in the last few days, Administration officials have talked of an ''international security force,'' a more palatable phrase for the Russians, and for Mr. Milosevic, than the earlier references to a ''NATO-led'' peacekeeping force. But it would in fact be commanded by NATO, Administration officials said. **********Last week, Administration officials also said they were considering a plan to make Kosovo an ''international protectorate,'' instead of setting up an autonomous administration as envisioned in the Rambouillet agreements for which NATO failed to win Mr. Milosevic's agreement. **********For now, officials are rejecting the idea of partitioning Kosovo, with the Serbs keeping a northern portion of the province and the remaining area being given to the ethnic Albanians.  They argued that this would reward  Mr. Milosevic. **********After a speech today at the Brookings Institution here, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said the Administration was insisting that there be a ''permissive environment'' for the international force.  She reiterated that there were ''no plans or intentions for ground forces in a non-permissive environment.'' **********The first round of diplomatic meetings on Kosovo since the NATO strikes began will open in Brussels on Wednesday, with meetings of the six-nation Contact Group, made up of  Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Italy.. . **********The Russians dropped their demand that NATO halt the bombing before they would attend such a meeting, American officials said. **********Ms. Albright is expected to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the NATO allies in Brussels on Monday. If the Contact Group meeting in Brussels goes well, it is possible that a meeting of the group's foreign ministers will convene as well next week. But for that to happen, a Western diplomat said, the Russians would have to agree to the four principles laid down by NATO. **********How to deal with Mr. Milosevic has become a sore point for the Clinton Administration. **********Some members of Congress have said that Mr. Milosevic should be declared a war criminal and be dealt with only as such. **********At the middle levels of the Administration, especially among those who worked on Balkan issues during the war in Bosnia, there is also strong opposition to negotiating with Mr. Milosevic. **********Although officials have painted Mr. Milosevic as the perpetrator of the forced expulsions, they have not gone so far as to accuse his forces of committing acts of genocide. **********The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, has stopped just short of using the word ''genocide,'' saying instead that there were ''indicators of genocide'' by Mr. Milosevic's forces in Kosovo. Pressed last weekend on whether Mr. Milosevic was a war criminal, Ms. Albright said that was a definition that had to be determined after a trial at the war crimes tribunal. **********At the State Department, one official said that the Administration had not ruled out dealing with Mr. Milosevic in person.

People with tin ears fantasize that they can sing like Caruso or play like Horowitz. **********The RCA Corporation once thought it had figured out how to turn such human yearnings into a profitable business. In 1929, it tried to exploit the fantasies of closet musicians by selling a musical instrument that could supposedly turn the masses into maestros. **********''Anyone can make exquisitely beautiful music with nothing but his own two hands!'' crowed the advertising copy for the instrument, called a theremin, the only one that is played without touching any part of it. It is ''destined to be the universal musical instrument,'' the advertisements said, and people will play it as easily ''as they now write or walk.'' **********The reality was, and is, that the theremin, the granddaddy of all electronic musical instruments, is considered by many of its enthusiasts to be the world's most difficult instrument to play. RCA found out the hard way; it sold just 485 of them, which each cost $175 (more than $1,500 in 1999 dollars). **********But that wasn't the end for the theremin, which uses simple electronic principles to produce a somewhat eerie sound, a cross between an amplified child's slide whistle, a human voice and the squawks that emanated from early radio speakers. **********If you have listened to the Beach Boys' hit ''Good Vibrations,'' you've heard a theremin riff. The theremin was used to produce the otherworldly music in 40's and 50's films like ''Spellbound,'' ''The Lost Weekend'' and ''The Day the Earth Stood Still.'' Today, enthusiasts gather at conferences and on the Web (a starting point is www.nashville.net/theremin) to trade experiences and tips. **********''The creation of the theremin was a seminal moment, the primal scream of the beginning of electronic music,'' said Albert Glinsky, an associate professor of music at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa., who is the author of the forthcoming book, ''Out Of Thin Air'' (University of Illinois Press), a history of the instrument and its extraordinary inventor, Lev Sergeyevich Termen, a name later Anglicized to Leon Theremin. **********The classic theremin looks much like a portable lectern with two antennas sticking out. Early audiences often thought the whole thing a hoax. **********Theremin discovered the principles behind the instrument when working as a researcher in 1920 in Leningrad. He moved to the United States in 1927, then went back to the Soviet Union in 1938. **********Rumor has it that he was kidnapped by the K.G.B. (he was sent to a Siberian labor camp for three months). While saving the details for his book, Professor Glinsky said the circumstances were actually more complex than that. The inventor remained under house arrest until 1947, when he was secretly awarded the Stalin Prize for inventing the Soviet Union's first electronic eavesdropping device. **********The sound of the theremin is controlled by moving one's hands close to two antennas set into the box: The vertical antenna controls the pitch, while a horizontal loop antenna affects the volume. The theremin is so difficult to play because there are no visual or physical cues to indicate when you are hitting the right note. With the theremin, the player has no idea exactly what note will come out; while modern instruments can produce sounds across a range of five to six octaves, moving the hand as little as one-sixteenth of an inch can change the note by a half-step in some models. **********The technique most players use is to start to play a note at a very low volume and then to ''trim'' it quickly, either up or down, to reach the exact pitch. Only then is the volume raised. Staccato sounds, or separated notes, are created by moving the left hand toward the horizontal volume antenna to stop the sound, then moving the right hand to the proper distance from the vertical pitch antenna before raising the volume again. **********Interest in the instrument is growing. Robert Moog, inventor of the first electronic synthesizer and a theremin enthusiast, has sold more than 4,000 theremins since his company, Big Briar, opened its doors five years ago. Theremins are also available from Wavefront Technologies in Los Angeles. **********The definitive theremin recordings are by Clara Rockmore, a Russian immigrant and protege of Theremin's. ''To play like Clara Rockmore is impossible,'' said Alex Schub, a musician from Los Angeles who recently performed on the theremin with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. ''She played the theremin like a violinist, and nobody else can do that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/business/at-t-s-move-may-provide-sharper-view-of-leadership.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1999-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1034, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AT&T's Move May Provide Sharper View Of Leadership", "print_headline": "AT&T's Move May Provide Sharper View Of Leadership", "body_text": " **********The early jockeying to succeed AT&T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, begins in earnest today. **********At a meeting with hundreds of investors and financial analysts today in New York, AT&T intends to announce the most sweeping management changes since Mr. Armstrong took over two years ago, according to executives close to the company. **********Although Mr. Armstrong is only 61, his mandatory retirement at age 65 in four years may not seem so far away for any of the company's senior managers hoping to emerge as his successor. While it is not at all certain that the company will tap an insider to succeed Mr. Armstrong, the company's history suggests that Mr. Armstrong's lieutenants stand an excellent chance to rise to one of the most prominent executive jobs in the world. **********With today's management announcements, the roster of internal hopefuls will include John D. Zeglis, Daniel E. Somers and Richard R. Roscitt. And it may very likely include Charles H. Noski. **********Mr. Noski is president of General Motors' Hughes Electronics subsidiary, but is said to be Mr. Armstrong's favorite candidate to become AT&T's chief financial officer. Before joining AT&T, Mr. Armstrong was chairman of Hughes and knew Mr. Noksi there. Late yesterday, AT&T was still negotiating with Mr. Noski, however, and it was unclear whether Mr. Noski and the company would come to terms in time for an announcement today. **********Separately, in a move intended to mollify its regulatory critics, AT&T also plans to  announce an agreement today with Mindspring, the big Internet service provider. The agreement will outline how  Mindspring might eventually be able to offer Internet access over AT&T's cable television systems. Until now, AT&T has been criticized for an arrangement that gives the Excite@Home Corporation exclusive access to its cable systems through 2002. The Mindspring agreement lays the groundwork for outside companies to gain such access in the future. **********In a third announcement, AT&T also intends to say today that it will split off its wireless business as a separately traded tracking stock. That move may include  issuing billions of dollars in new shares of the wireless company. A tracking stock is an investment vehicle that can allow big companies to highlight the financial value of a business unit, without relinquishing ownership of that business. Investors in a tracking stock can buy and sell them like regular shares, but the stock does not represent an actual separate ownership stake in the business it tracks. **********Taken together, the three initiatives represent the latest part of Mr. Armstrong's continuing effort to change AT&T, the nation's No. 1 communications company, from the lumbering long-distance telephone behemoth he inherited to the nimble communications dynamo he envisions. **********An AT&T spokeswoman declined to comment on the plans. **********Of the executives involved in the shuffle, Mr. Zeglis, the former lawyer who is AT&T's president, will retain that title while also being named head of the newly separate wireless unit. Mr. Zeglis's main challenges at the wireless unit will be to continue its robust growth and to mount a new initiative to offer Internet access and local phone service to as many as 10 million United States homes using an innovative wireless technology known within AT&T as Project Angel. One person close to the company said on Friday that if Mr. Zeglis succeeds, he could become a shoo-in to succeed Mr. Armstrong. **********Mr. Somers, currently AT&T's chief financial officer, will be chosen to lead the company's far-flung cable television unit, succeeding Leo Hindery, the former Tele-Communications Inc. executive who recently resigned from AT&T. **********In moving from a staff job as AT&T's chief financial officer to run the most critical unit for the company's future, the cable business, Mr. Somers could also be seen as trying to burnish his operational credentials. If AT&T's multibillion-dollar cable strategy fails to live up to its promise of offering interactive television, high-speed Internet access and local phone service across the nation, nothing else will be able to bail out the company. **********Mr. Roscitt, chief executive of AT&T's fast-growing unit that runs networks for the company's largest corporate customers, will be named head of the unit that oversees all the needs of business customers. **********When Mr. Armstrong arrived at AT&T in the fall of 1997, he did not bring any other senior executives with him. If the company and Mr. Noski come to terms, he would be AT&T's most significant executive hire from outside the company since the arrival of Mr. Armstrong himself. **********While Mr. Zeglis will initially retain his title as president, his move to the wireless unit and Mr. Somers's move to AT&T's cable headquarters near Denver would seem to vacate duties that might prompt Mr. Armstrong to hire a chief operating officer, executives close to the company said. **********Those who might be disappointed by today's management announcements would appear to include Daniel Hesse, currently chief executive of AT&T's wireless unit, and Michael Keith, president of AT&T's business services unit. **********According to executives close to AT&T, Mr. Hesse will report to Mr. Zeglis and will run the wireless unit's consumer segment. Mr. Keith, who is essentially losing his job to Mr. Roscitt, is set to move to the wireless operation, where he will have responsibility for selling wireless services to business customers and for the new residential wireless initiative. **********Mr. Hesse won praise for basically remaking the wireless business with AT&T's Digital One Rate plan, which eliminates roaming charges and long-distance fees. But his reputation suffered as AT&T consistently underestimated demand for its wireless services in big markets including New York City, leading to service problems. **********Mr. Roscitt is a hard-charging executive who colleagues say was enraged last February when he was passed over in favor of Mr. Keith to run the company's business-services unit after the departure of Robert Annunziata in February. According to executives close to the company he has now won the job, at least in part because he put himself in the running for chief executive jobs at other companies, and AT&T did not want to lose him. **********On a level just below these top management changes, Kathleen B. Earley is set to be announced as AT&T's new ''Internet guru,'' according to an executive close to the company. Ms. Early, currently president of AT&T's Internet division, will assume overall control of the company's diverse data communications operations."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/05/business/downshifting-in-argentina-recession-and-rivalries-with-brazil-stall-the-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1999-08-05", "snippet": "Brazil's sharp Jan currency devaluation has worsened Argentina's recession, costing Argentina competitiveness in world trade and limiting its capacity to export its way out of slump; Argentina's commitment to pegging its peso to dollar has ended i...", "word_count": 1540, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Downshifting in Argentina; Recession and Rivalries With Brazil Stall the Economy", "print_headline": "Downshifting in Argentina; Recession and Rivalries With Brazil Stall the Economy", "body_text": " **********When Fiat S.p.A. inaugurated its giant Cordoba auto plant less than three years ago, Argentine Cabinet ministers clinked champagne glasses with senior Fiat executives from Turin. They gave union leaders hearty bearhugs and toasted the computerized, robotized assembly lines never seen here before. **********And all agreed that with the middle class growing and trade with giant Brazil beginning to boom, Fiat could certainly expect to derive handsome profits from its $600 million investment in the factory. **********Today, however, Fiat's Cordoba plant, like much of Argentina's auto industry, is operating at less than a quarter of its capacity. **********''We saw a future of great possibilities,'' recalled Vincenzo Barello, president of Fiat-Argentina S.A. ''Our humor has changed. We've gone from two shifts to one, and there is reason for concern.'' **********Part of Fiat's problem is the recession that has been shaking Argentina since September, an outgrowth of low world commodity prices and investors' continuing disenchantment with emerging markets, which first erupted two years ago in Asia. **********But of more lasting importance, auto executives fear, is the fallout from Brazil's decision in January to devalue its currency, the real, by nearly 40 percent. As a result, Argentina has lost competitiveness in world trade and has only a limited capacity to export its way out of its slump. **********Argentina is committed to a completely different currency policy than Brazil, one set in stone in 1991. It pegs the value of the peso one-to-one to the American dollar, which has been relatively strong in recent years. The practice has reduced the country's traditional hyperinflation to an inflation rate of virtually zero, helped lure more than $100 billion in foreign investment, and stemmed capital flight and bank failures during two recent recessions. But over the last eight months, the sudden disparity of the two currencies, by making it much more expensive for Brazilians to buy from Argentina, has sharply reduced the country's exports to Brazil,  by 30 percent. **********The drop in sales to Brazil -- which buys nearly one-third of Argentina's exports -- has deepened the recession here. Industrial production has fallen 13 percent, unemployment has climbed from 12.5 percent in December to 15 percent today and the economy is expected to decline by 3 percent by year-end. The auto sector, which is most dependent on foreign sales, has been the worst hit. **********Motor vehicle production in Argentina over the first six months of this year was down to 120,000 vehicles, a 48 percent decline from the 1998 period. Argentina exported 43,000 vehicles over the first five months of the year, down 56 percent from the January-May period last year. **********''We are in a crisis,'' said Alberto Garcia Carmona, the director of institutional relations at General Motors-Argentina. ''We lost our No. 1 client -- Brazil -- in January.'' **********For now, President Carlos Saul Menem appears to have his hands tied in adopting economic policies that would help regain market share in Brazil, diversify trade beyond Argentina's immediate neighbors, or  increase domestic purchasing power. The so-called convertibility law that pegs the peso to the dollar prohibits the central bank from printing pesos not backed by dollars held in the Argentine Treasury, in a system known as a currency board. As a result, Argentina has sacrificed a traditional economic management tool of printing money to stimulate demand. **********And with tax receipts dwindling and the fiscal deficit climbing to $5.1 billion -- double the targets set in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund in January -- Government economists say any more deficit spending is out of the question. **********Earlier in the year, Mr. Menem talked about abandoning the peso altogether and using the dollar itself as Argentina's official currency. Many Argentine economists, meanwhile, predicted that Brazil would eventually be forced to follow Argentina by pegging the value of its currency to the dollar and that a regional dollar-based currency would emerge. But Mr. Menem's dollarization plans have stalled, the Brazilian economy has stabilized, and Brasilia has shown no interest in establishing a regional currency to bolster trade. **********Some foreign economists are now suggesting that Argentina should follow Brazil's example and devalue. But Mr. Menem and the two leading presidential candidates who hope to succeed him in December promise they will not touch the peg. **********Unlike Brazil, noted Martin Redrado, a former aide to Mr. Menem who now heads an economic research organization, most Argentine businesses have the bulk of their debts in dollars. A devaluation, therefore, would make it exceedingly difficult for businesses here to pay their debts. At the same time, most large contracts are stated in dollars and Argentines have about half of their bank deposits in dollars -- causing consumers here to think in terms of dollars. **********''Therefore any positive impact of a devaluation,'' Mr. Redrado said, ''would be erased overnight by the rise in prices.'' **********Auto and other business executives are unified in support of the currency peg. They say they hope the dollar will continue its recent slide, thereby making the peso more competitive again. But they acknowledge that the slumping auto sector underscores a number of other interconnected problems that have no easy solutions. **********High tariffs to protect the anemic steel industry, for example, punish all heavy industries. Meddlesome Government regulations, high corporate taxes and inflexible work rules all increase costs over traditional competitors. That is one reason exports represented only about 9 percent of the Argentine economy even before the Brazilian devaluation, roughly the same as Brazil but far below the better than 30 percent that exports represent in the Mexican and Chilean economies. **********Argentina's cost problems are not new, of course. But they were supposed to be eased by the emergence of the Mercosur trading union in the early 1990's to unite the markets of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay and their 220 million consumers. Under Mercosur's current automotive agreement, Brazil and Argentina receive tariff benefits for auto companies with plants on both sides of the border. Motor vehicle production mushroomed in Argentina from 138,958 in 1991 to 455,000 in 1998. **********Unfortunately for Argentina, the 1995 auto agreement is due to expire at the end of this year, with fully free trade in vehicles scheduled to be phased in by 2004. Negotiations on a new auto pact were supposed to be completed by the end of last year, but Brazil's devaluation has only widened the differences between Argentina and Brazil. **********The last negotiating deadline passed July 31 without an agreement, as Brazil refused to consider Argentine demands for a continued guaranteed market share for Argentine autos and auto parts in Brazil as well as the rollback of local subsidies for auto makers who build plants in Brazil. **********''We need an agreement,'' said Rodolfo Ceretti, director of institutional relations in Argentina for the Ford Motor Company. ''All the improvements we made in increasing efficiencies and lowering costs were lost in Brazil's devaluation.'' **********Lately, Fiat and the other foreign auto companies here have been forced to sell some of their export models in Brazil at or below production costs just to keep their plants running. Argentine auto dealers, meanwhile, have been forced to cut retail prices sharply, by as much as 30 percent on some models. Ford recently decided to drastically downsize a planned modernization of its plant outside Buenos Aires to produce a medium-sized car named Focus from its original $320 million upgrade to a more modest $70 million program. **********''It's a long-term problem, with the industry facing the prospect of restructuring over the next three to five years,'' said Luis Fernando Katz, the head of economic studies at the Association of Automotive Manufacturers, the local auto trade group. ''There is the prospect for transferring assembly lines to Brazil and diminishing production in Argentina.'' **********Top auto executives say they were not likely to abandon any time soon the $5 billion investment they made in new plants, modernizations and worker training over the last seven years. Nevertheless, the introduction of new models has been delayed, and Fiat and Volkswagen A.G. have already transferred production of some models to Brazil, where costs are lower. And some analysts say the relatively small operations that DaimlerChrysler A.G. and the Toyota Motor Corporation have in Argentina could be in jeopardy if the recession here is prolonged. **********Production, sales and earnings for all seven foreign auto companies in Argentina have been disappointing this year. Revenue generated by Ford declined more than 40 percent in the January-June period -- to $530 million from nearly $1 billion during the first six months of 1998.

In almost every direction, crops of steep structures jut out of the concrete in a show of the magnitude of Sao Paulo, the third-largest metropolis in the world, after Tokyo and Mexico City. **********But Mr. Garnero, 61, a business tycoon with interests ranging from waste treatment to telecommunications, plans his newest and grandest venture for a spot eclipsed by this jagged skyline, in the decrepit, neglected downtown district where the city's first high-rises were built in the 1920's. There he hopes to build the world's tallest skyscraper, 1,622 feet high. Modeled on the Vedic temples of India, it would surpass the 1,483-foot Petronas Twin Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. **********''This building will be the symbol of Sao Paulo's new era, of a post-industrial Sao Paulo in a league with the world's great cities,'' Mr. Garnero said. **********To compete with tallest-building projects that are planned or under way on other continents, Mr. Garnero, a tall man himself, with a penchant for pinstriped suits, is teaming up with the investment arm of the followers of the Indian-born guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The Maharishi Global Development fund, whose assets are gathered mainly from contributions by practitioners of the guru's twice-a-day meditation methods, has agreed to be the main investor in the project, with a role in overseeing its design. The Maharishi fund and Mr. Garnero hired Minoru Yamasaki Associates, the architectural firm based in Rochester Hills, Mich., that conceived the World Trade Center in Manhattan. **********The resulting design for the 103-story Sao Paulo Tower, unveiled in May, has stirred up a tempest. Stylistically, it has nothing in common  with the postmodern skyscrapers erected here during the relative economic calm of the 1990's, nor does it resemble the drab high-rises of earlier decades, many of which seem better suited to Eastern Europe under Communism than to subtropical southeastern Brazil. **********Inside the Sao Paulo Tower, which will look something like a layered pyramid with ornate touches, will be hotels, offices, residential apartments, a convention center, a university and, during the workday, about 50,000 people, Mr. Garnero said. At the top will be a restaurant within a golden crown. **********Aside from the surprise expressed by some architects over the unusual design, most critical views center on the project's contribution to a troubling trend -- the confining of more and more aspects of public life within buildings. In crime-plagued Sao Paulo, better-off residents increasingly retreat into gated communities and guarded shopping malls. **********''This is a fortress, a mega-intervention in a city dying for public space,'' said Raquel Rolnik, an architecture professor at the Catholic University of Campinas. **********Another well-known expert, the urban planner Jorge Wilheim, said, ''We need this building like we need a hole in our head.'' **********Other Brazilian architects defend the project, saying it could bring new creative energy and international attention to Sao Paulo. ''This building would catalyze popular hope,'' said Edison Musa, the president of a national association of architects and chairman for Latin America of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Mr. Musa likened the Sao Paulo Tower to American skyscrapers, including the Empire State Building, that were finished during the Depression. ''It is an affirmation of our national capacity,'' he said. **********BRAZIL has long had faith in the idea that the design of its buildings and cities can bring positive change. This thinking was behind the construction 40 years ago of a new capital, Brasilia, deep in the savannas of the country's interior. And just as the inventors of Brasilia have defended their creation from criticism that it is artificial and sterile, so the architects of the Sao Paulo project stand by their design. **********''We didn't want a cookie-cutter repeat of other tall buildings,'' said Henry Guthard, senior vice president of Minoru Yamasaki. ''When seen silhouetted against the sky, this building will be striking.'' **********As the controversy unfolds over the building's design and its eventual impact on the city's crazy-quilt sprawl, a more urgent issue presses: financing. The Maharishi fund, which manages assets of roughly $600 million, is committed to raising money through donations, borrowing and returns on its investments to provide  half the estimated $1.6 billion needed to complete the building. If construction is to begin as planned in January, the fund's managers and Mr. Garnero will have to drum up the other half quickly. **********''Money is currently so expensive that one has to wonder where they will get it,'' said Daniel Citron, the chief financial officer of Brazil Realty S.A., a large developer of commercial real estate here. Indeed, many people in Sao Paulo's real estate industry have expressed doubt whether the project can get off the ground at a time when domestic interest  rates for real estate lending are above 25 percent. **********There are also questions about the supply of tenants, given the market's doldrums as the country just begins to emerge from recession. **********If the project is built, there are chances it will not retain the title of tallest building for very long. Investors in Shanghai; Taipei, Taiwan, and Melbourne, Australia, are also competing to erect the world's tallest building. A real estate firm in Chicago, where the Sears Tower reigned as the world's tallest until 1996, unveiled plans last month for another contender, although, at 1,537 feet, it would be shorter than Mr. Garnero's. **********That hasn't kept Mr. Garnero from knocking with gusto on the doors of potential partners. He hopes to interest Brazilian investment firms and pension funds that have invested in other developments in Sao Paulo. **********So far, the attention attracted by the project has helped renovate the public image of Mr. Garnero and his business empire, gathered under the merchant bank Brasilinvest. Brazil's highest court recently cleared Mr. Garnero of accusations of fraudulent financial transactions in the 1980's. **********The managers of the Maharishi fund are confident about the plans. ''There are always people who think small,'' said Benjamin Feldman, a member of the fund's board who is responsible for its activities in Latin America. ''Any great endeavor is criticized by people who have no understanding of it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/13/business/microsoft-says-worker-wrote-smear-of-rival.html": {"writer_name": "John Markoff", "pub_date": "1999-08-13", "snippet": "Microsoft Corp acknowledges that one of its programmers apparently masqueraded as independent computer consultant earlier this week in effort to discredit America Online's tactics in companies' quarrel over instant messaging; Microsoft is unable t...", "word_count": 965, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Microsoft Says Worker Wrote Smear of Rival", "print_headline": "Microsoft Says Worker Wrote Smear of Rival", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation acknowledged yesterday that one of its programmers apparently masqueraded as an independent computer consultant earlier this week in an effort to discredit America Online's tactics in the companies' quarrel over instant messaging. **********Microsoft had reason to be red-faced about the incident yesterday -- first, because the company was unable to identify the employee who forged an E-mail message on Tuesday accusing America Online of irresponsible behavior, and second, because whoever did it sent the message to the one computer security expert who was most likely to trace it back to Microsoft. **********The ruse has added a bit of Spy vs. Spy melodrama to a bitter dispute over instant on-line messaging that America Online and Microsoft -- the world's two largest Internet service providers -- have been waging for several weeks. The dispute began last month when Microsoft introduced a clone of the AOL Instant Messenger program, which permits computer users to chat over the Internet with other computer users. **********Since Microsoft released its clone, the two companies have waged a public war of words while simultaneously carrying on a hacking cyberwar as America Online has tried to electronically lock Microsoft Messenger users out of its network and Microsoft has at least 13 times managed to find new backdoors. **********America Online executives say Microsoft is making illegal use of proprietary directory information that is essential to connect instant messenger users via the Internet. **********The Microsoft disinformation incident came to light on Wednesday when Richard Smith, the president of Phar Lap Software and a leading computer security expert, received an E-mail message from someone identifying himself as Phil Bucking of Bucking Consulting. **********The author suggested that he was developing his own instant messaging program and was studying America Online's tactics in blocking Microsoft users. In his message, he asserted that America Online is using a programming error that has created a security flaw -- one not found in Microsoft's clone program -- to detect the Microsoft Messenger program. The author said he was writing Mr. Smith because Mr. Smith had ''significant credibility with the press.'' **********''I think you would agree that this is a heinous and risky action,'' stated the electronic message, which was sent using a free Yahoo E-mail account. ''I am perfectly fine with AOL and MS fighting it out with standard software practices, but putting user security at risk is unacceptable. It is inconceivable that a company would even consider doing this.'' **********When Mr. Smith, who has criticized Microsoft's software development and privacy practices in the past, examined the message, he discovered that it had originated within Microsoft. **********''Microsoft is trying to use me as a pawn in their fight with AOL,'' he said. **********In a telephone interview today, Rob Bennett, the director of marketing for Microsoft's Internet service, MSN, confirmed that the author of the message was almost certainly a Microsoft employee, but he said the company had not yet discovered his or her identity. **********''I think it's somebody who got a little overpassionate but went about it the wrong way,'' Mr. Bennett said. **********Computer industry analysts said that the incident echoed a 1992 controversy in which Microsoft employees masqueraded as independent computer users and posted messages to public computer bulletin boards with opinions critical of I.B.M.'s OS/2 operating system, a product that competed with Microsoft's Windows. **********''This is par for the course for Microsoft marketing,'' said John C. Dvorak, a columnist for PC Magazine. ''In the past we called them Microsoft munchkins. It was a scandal.'' **********Microsoft executives said there had been no Microsoft plan to play dirty tricks in its dispute with America Online. Mr. Bennett also said that members of Microsoft's software development team had told him they knew nothing about the incident. **********Mr. Bennett, however, insisted that the accusations made in the message were accurate and that America Online's programmers had been exploiting a security flaw in the AOL Instant Messenger software to identify Microsoft Messenger customers. He said that since the dispute began, , Microsoft had made 13 changes to its program to get around America Online's efforts to block users of Microsoft's clone. **********''It's unfortunate they're putting user security at risk,'' he said. **********An America Online executive disputed that there was any security issue involved and said the company would not acknowledge that its software contained a vulnerability known as a buffer-overflow error. **********''It's a fake issue by a fake consultant, '' said Barry Schuller, director of interactive services at America Online. ''Our whole approach is all about privacy and security for our members, and I think this is really embarrassing for Microsoft.'' **********A buffer overflow error is a type of programming defect that could permit an intruder to execute rogue programming instructions on a remote machine via a computer network. In some cases buffer overflow bugs can be exploited to crash remote programs while simultaneously executing illicit code. **********Microsoft said that in the case of AOL Instant Messenger, the buffer overflow error did not result in a program crash. But by running a program on its servers, America Online could exploit the bug by weeding out users whose software did not have the error and therefore had to be using the Microsoft clone. **********Mr. Smith acknowledged that the code Microsoft was questioning in America Online's program might not, in fact, be a bug. But if it was, he said, America Online's exploiting it to detect the Microsoft clone was risky from the standpoints of privacy and computer security. **********''Putting network backdoors in software products should be against the law,'' he said. ''I don't like the idea at all of 'spyware.' '' **********Microsoft posted a change to its program last night to work around the new America Online strategy, Mr. Bennett said.

''Whether it's Y2K, or inflation, you just don't see as many happy people out there trading now.'' **********It may just be the laws of gravity. But the outlook of individual investors has been taking a dive. And that is bad news for on-line brokerage firms, which have seen trading volumes ebb recently. If the trend holds, investors are on course to trade fewer shares on line this quarter than they did in the previous three months, making it the first such sustained decline in Internet trading volume for the nascent on-line brokerage industry. **********Summer is rarely a record-breaking time for stock trading. But trading volume -- on which on-line brokers depend mightily for revenues -- slumped more than just about anyone expected in July and August. September, at least so far, has not offered much relief. **********A few of the indicators: Charles Schwab, the largest on-line brokerage firm, reported yesterday that average daily revenue from trades by its customers dropped 14 percent from July to August, a figure some analysts viewed as a leading indicator for the industry. Credit Suisse First Boston noted that trading in a sample basket of high-flying Internet stocks was off 2 percent for the second quarter. And two brokerage analysts downgraded earnings estimates yesterday for the Knight/Trimark Group, the biggest market maker for shares traded on Nasdaq, including many big Internet stocks. **********Scott Appleby, an on-line brokerage industry analyst for BancBoston Robertson Stephens, reduced his estimates for Knight's earnings per share for the July-September quarter to 31 cents from 36 cents, or 14 percent. That is the second time in a month he has lowered his profit targets for Knight, whose revenues have skyrocketed in tandem with heavy trading in Internet stocks and individual investors' migration to on-line brokerage houses. In early August, he revised estimates for Knight downward from 40 cents. Shares of Knight fell $1 yesterday, or 3 percent, to $30.625. **********''It's an industrywide issue,'' Mr. Appleby said. ''We expected a seasonal trough in the summer. But the volume has been unexpectedly poor.'' **********Few believe that America's love affair with on-line trading has faded. On the contrary, most analysts say that Internet brokerages have just begun to tap a huge pool of savings still stored in banks and in accounts with full-service brokers. Americans have 70 million brokerage accounts, but only 10 percent of them permit on-line trading. And as more people move their assets on line, taking a more active role in their investment decisions, trading volume tends to rise substantially. **********Moreover, the decline in trading in the third quarter comes after a nine-month growth frenzy in which Internet broker transactions doubled in size. By the end of June, they accounted for one in six stock trades made in America. That pace was not viewed as sustainable. **********Still, even a temporary trading slump could be hazardous to the on-line brokerage industry's health. Schwab, for example, derives almost half its total earnings from trading commissions, and most of its trades are now conducted on line. For smaller brokers -- there are three score of them competing for Internet investors now -- the dependence on trading commissions is far greater. **********All have seen sharp drops in their share prices. Schwab shares have fallen by half since April and closed yesterday at $36.4375, up 6.25 cents. E*Trade has tumbled 63 percent in the same period, closing yesterday at $23.5625, down 46.875 cents. **********What's more, many of the leading Internet brokers are geared for growth, not for a grinding battle for market share. E*Trade and Ameritrade, two of the best-known on-line brokers, are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to promote themselves, sacrificing earnings today for rapid growth tomorrow. Ameritrade said yesterday that it planned to spend $200 million over the next year on advertising, about as much as Mazda spent advertising cars and trucks last year. **********''E*Trade and Ameritrade depend on commission much more than Schwab,'' said L. Russell Keene, a brokerage analyst at Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola & Thornton. He has a relatively bearish ''hold'' recommendation on both stocks. **********Most of the Internet brokerage firms will report third-quarter earnings in early October. **********Mr. Keene said he saw the first and second quarters of this year as exceptional. Internet investors, Internet stocks and Internet brokerage firms found themselves then in a virtuous circle. Investors opened new brokerage accounts and seized on high-flying Internet stocks, including the brokerage firms themselves, sending share prices skyward. **********''That really fueled an anomaly in trade volumes,'' Mr. Keene said. ''If you ignore the first and second quarter and look at the trend, what we see this year is less worrying.'' He said stock trading volumes were still up over year-earlier periods, even though the increase was less robust than it was in the recent past: Third quarter commissions grew 40 percent in 1997 over 1996, 30 percent in 1998 over 1997 and seem likely to grow 20 percent in 1999 over 1998, he said. **********Other measures of on-line investment activity are also slowing, but not as much as trading commissions. Customers at Schwab, which reports certain operating statistics more regularly than most of its rivals, added $8 billion to the company's assets under supervision in August, allowing the firm to keep pace with expectations. Schwab also reported that it had 6.3 million customer accounts in August, up from 6.2 million in July and not far off analysts' predictions.. **********E*Trade and Ameritrade seemed to have slowed more, Mr. Keene said. He expects that Ameritrade will add about 50,000 new accounts for the quarter, down 50 percent from account growth in the second quarter. E*Trade, Mr. Keene estimates, will add about 200,000 accounts, well off its stellar performance in the second quarter, when 332,000 customers opened new accounts at that firm. **********''There are other indicators of a slowdown in the quarter,'' he said. ''But it is by no means a terminal slowdown. The long-term trend is still healthy.'' But the summer swoon may give a clue as to how fickle retail investors are. They have fired the rise of Internet brokerage firms and then given them the shivers. **********''Just like we were seeing people act like cheerleaders for companies before, now you often see people just fan the fires of negativity,'' said Joe Andras, an electrical engineer in Laguna Beach, Calif., who manages his own stock portfolio and trades on line.

Cable systems already deliver television channels and sometimes Internet service, but AT&T wants to retool cable networks to also offer local phone service, breaking open the Baby Bells' de facto monopoly in residential markets. **********Faced with that threat, the Bells are scrambling to put together communications packages of their own. SBC, which does business as Southwestern Bell, Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell, has already said it wants to offer high-speed Internet service using normal phone lines to 8.1 million of its 18 million residential customers by the end of the year. Some analysts also expect SBC to win regulatory approval to sell long-distance phone service to its customers in Texas in the next six months. **********SBC and DirecTV declined to comment. **********Since 1994, DirecTV, which is part of the Hughes Electronics unit of the General Motors Corporation, has grown to become the nation's largest direct-broadcast satellite provider -- and by far the biggest competitor to cable services -- with more than seven million customers. **********Over the last few months, SBC has conducted negotiations with both DirecTV and its main rival, the Echostar Communications Corporation, which has about 2.5 million subscribers. But under its deal with DirecTV, SBC would not be allowed to pursue a second satellite partner for at least a few years. SBC will begin marketing DirecTV service to its customers in Arkansas, California, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma and Texas this fall, executives close to the deal said. **********SBC owns the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation, the dominant local phone company in Connecticut, and has a pending deal to acquire the Ameritech Corporation, the leading local phone company in the Midwest. But SBC has no firm plans to expand its DirecTV partnership into those regions because both Ameritech and Southern New England Telecommunications own cable television operations that compete against DirecTV, executives close to the deal said. **********In its core markets, however, SBC plans to offer the DirecTV service, traditional phone service, high-speed Internet access and perhaps wireless phone service on a single bill, the executives added. **********For communications companies, the power of such integrated packages comes in the opportunities to create promotions that span different products. SBC, for instance, could potentially offer free voice mail, call waiting and Caller ID to local phone customers who sign up for DirecTV. The satellite television service would carry the brand of both companies. **********Hughes also offers a satellite Internet service known as DirecPC, but that service did not appear to be part of the SBC deal. **********America Online Inc., the No. 1 Internet provider, has recently struck marketing deals of its own with both Hughes, for satellite delivery of the on-line service, and with SBC for high-speed delivery over digital subscriber lines. **********Bell Atlantic, SBC's main local phone rival, also has a marketing deal with DirecTV, but that agreement does not appear quite as wide-ranging as SBC's. Since striking its deal last year, Bell Atlantic has followed a relatively conservative timetable for introducing Bell Atlantic-DirecTV service; it is not yet available in New York City, for instance. Bell Atlantic phone customers who sign up for the satellite television service receive separate bills for the two services, and Bell Atlantic and DirecTV do not yet offer significant cross-promotions. (A Bell Atlantic spokesman said yesterday that such promotions were on their way.) **********The recent deal is actually SBC's second go-round with DirecTV. In the fall of 1995, SBC conducted tests with DirecTV, but that initiative fell apart after AT&T acquired 2.5 percent of DirecTV the following January for $137.5 million. **********The chairman of Hughes Electronics, DirecTV's parent, at that time was C. Michael Armstrong. Shortly after Mr. Armstrong became chairman of AT&T in November 1997, AT&T sold its interest in DirecTV, opening the door to DirecTV's latest partnerships with the Bells. **********When AT&T sold its interest in DirecTV, AT&T said that consumers appeared to prefer to buy the satellite dish and converter needed for the DirecTV's service from consumer electronics retailers. **********Executives close to the SBC deal said SBC was considering a fairly radical promotion to deal with that concern: giving away DirecTV dishes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/business/market-watch-big-board-ready-to-open-the-e-gates.html": {"writer_name": "Gretchen Morgenson", "pub_date": "1999-11-28", "snippet": "Gretchen Morgenson Market Watch column on push by New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso to persuade members to vote against regulation forbidding member firms from trading stocks listed on exchange before 1979 anywhere but on floor of tr...", "word_count": 592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Big Board Ready to Open the E-Gates", "print_headline": "MARKET WATCH; Big Board Ready to Open the E-Gates", "body_text": " **********RICHARD A.

Inroads  by regional exchanges or so-called third-market firms were tiny. **********That will likely change with Rule 390 out the window. So what brought the N.Y.S.E. around? **********Mr. Grasso said he was able to persuade  his membership that the rule, meant to keep trades in the arena where they would be exposed to the greatest number of investors, had come to reflect badly on the institution. ''It was intended to protect the customer,'' Mr. Grasso said. ''Now, people believe the rule is there to protect the exchange.'' **********Moreover, the rule now applies to only 30 percent of the companies listed on the exchange, which account for 48 percent of total volume. For this reason, ''I frankly don't think there will be much of a difference when it's repealed,'' Mr. Grasso said. **********Others aren't so sure. Mr. Smith, for example, believes that some of the N.Y.S.E.'s market share in big, heavily traded companies will migrate to electronic communications networks now trading Nasdaq stocks. **********But even if its share of trading in its own listings declines, the Big Board may pick up volume from elsewhere. Earlier this month, Mr. Grasso announced plans to create an E.C.N. at the exchange that would handle trades of Nasdaq and other stocks. The network, expected to be up and running by July, will display investors' orders for all to see, something that Mr. Levitt also favors. **********Interesting times.

Its stock has lost 70 percent of its value in the last 20 months. But instead of going on the offensive, Jill E. Barad, the chief executive, has gone into hiding. **********Although she generally loves the spotlight and thrives when she is putting on a show, Ms. Barad abruptly canceled plans to attend an influential toy industry conference last Wednesday in New York. Most companies view the meeting, sponsored by Gerard Klauer Mattison, an investment firm, as a golden opportunity to strut their stuff before analysts and shareholders, and Mattel has almost never missed a chance to make a presentation there. But the company was nowhere to be seen this year, even though Ms. Barad was said to be in New York a day later for a board meeting. **********Ms. Barad declined to be interviewed for this article. But conversations with many people who have worked with her at Mattel, with current and former customers, with institutional shareholders and with toy industry insiders draw an image of a company severely damaged by Ms. Barad's management style. Most of these people asked for anonymity when they spoke, fearing reprisals from Mattel, the dominant company in a close-knit industry. **********The picture they paint is troubling. For years, Mattel benefited mightily from Ms. Barad's marketing skill -- she takes credit for building Barbie from $250 million in annual sales in the mid-1980's to $1.7 billion last year. **********But now that Barbie's growth has slowed to a crawl -- sales were up 3 percent in the third quarter after a 14 percent drop last year -- Mattel is suffering from Ms. Barad's weaknesses. People who know her well say that she lacks financial acumen, is not disciplined herself, cannot instill discipline in her employees and has severe problems delegating authority to subordinates. Those on Wall Street add another fault: she chronically overpromises and underdelivers. **********Ms. Barad has also shown a tendency to do whatever she must to get what she wants. On one occasion, while she was chief operating officer, the company resorted to questionable tactics to make its financial results look good, according to court documents. Ms. Barad's compensation, like that of many a chief executive, is closely tied to the company's financial performance. **********Assessing her performance, a former senior Mattel executive who worked at the company for more than 10 years said: ''When I've seen her at ad and marketing strategy meetings, everything she says improves the quality or the strategy. But as a long-term strategist and as a developer of people? No. An ability to accept an alternative point of view? No. Her demons presently are outweighing her assets, and I think the company is a lot the less for it.'' **********No chief executive can excel at everything, of course. But Ms. Barad's flaws are exacerbated, according to several former colleagues and customers who know her well, by the way she jealously guards her power. As a result, they say, she has driven away many effective managers who might now make up for her shortcomings and help Mattel out of its mess. **********Further, these people said, Ms. Barad is driven by the need to succeed but cannot acknowledge failure. Over the 18 years she has worked at Mattel, they said, Ms. Barad has shown herself to be a brilliant presenter, but she refuses to listen to either her customers or her employees. **********Glenn Bozarth, Mattel's spokesman, said, ''We find the criticisms to be unfair and unfounded.'' As for management turnover, Mr. Bozarth said all those who had left did so for individual reasons. **********Four years ago, when Ms. Barad was chief operating officer, insiders were already expressing concern about her management style. In a June 1995 speech before senior managers, James A. Eskridge, then the newly installed president of the company and Ms. Barad's subordinate, ran through a short list of challenges facing Mattel. He said that in meetings with numerous executives he had been told of a ''learned powerlessness'' at Mattel. One element contributing to that powerlessness was the company's tendency to operate according to what he called the ostrich school of reality. Another element, Mr. Eskridge added, was the ''Jill Factor,'' a cryptic reference to her volatile management style. **********MR. ESKRIDGE left Mattel in 1997, shortly after Ms. Barad was named chief executive. He became chairman of the Stride Rite Corporation last year, but quit in July. He could not be reached for comment. **********But what he said looks prescient. Shellshocked Mattel shareholders, searching for clues to why $13.5 billion in market value has vaporized since March 1998, need look no further than the pattern of denial that has characterized Mattel's board and its management since Ms. Barad was named chief operating officer in 1992. Then, and until 1997, Mattel's chairman was John W. Amerman. **********Ms. Barad continues to have full support of the company's board, a Mattel spokesman said, despite the string of disappointments that has defined much of her tenure as chief executive. Several Mattel directors, when called, declined to comment on Mattel or Ms. Barad. **********One of a handful of women occupying the chief executive's chair at a major United States corporation, Ms. Barad ascended to the job in January 1997, when Mattel's stock was at $27.75. It rose to a high of $45.625 on March 13, 1998, but had fallen to $13.375 at Friday's close. **********The most recent bombshell hit Mattel shares in late September. With no warning,  the company said third-quarter earnings would fall well below analysts' expectations, largely because of problems at the Learning Company, a software maker Mattel acquired in May. Instead of adding $50 million to $100 million to Mattel's third-quarter earnings, as Ms. Barad forecast when the $3.8 billion deal was completed, the Learning Company produced $105 million in losses for the quarter, she said. More than a dozen shareholder lawsuits have been filed since the company made the announcement. **********Shareholders fled on the news, leaving those still in the stock exasperated. ''Somebody has to be held accountable for the loss of shareholder value,'' said Erik Gustafson, senior portfolio manager at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago, which owns 3.8 million Mattel shares, slightly less than 1 percent of the stock. ''Somebody must present a cogent and well-thought-out plan to realize the value of Mattel's core franchise. Who that is, I don't know anymore.'' **********The Learning Company debacle was only the latest shocker. Last December, Ms. Barad told shareholders that a sudden change in buying patterns by major retailers after Thanksgiving would result in a 12 percent decline in sales and a 30 percent drop in earnings during the all-important fourth quarter. Few believed the explanation. Toy industry insiders at both retailers and manufacturers said it was highly unlikely that a chief executive would be surprised by a shift in buying after Thanksgiving, because buying decisions are typically made well before that. The stock fell 27 percent on the announcement. **********For all of Ms. Barad's current problems, however, her stint as chief executive began well. In 1997, her first year on the job, Mattel's sales rose 6.6 percent and earnings advanced 24.5 percent. The market applauded. **********In 1998, while earnings rose 14.6 percent,  sales fell 1 percent, the first sales decline at the company since 1988. This year, sales have risen 4.3 percent through the third quarter, but earnings are 22 percent below those of the corresponding period of 1998. **********To put this volatile performance into context, for the five years before Ms. Barad's appointment as chief executive, Mattel showed 21 percent average annual sales growth and 35.7 percent average annual earnings growth. **********JILL ELIKANN was born in Brooklyn in 1951, a daughter of a television show producer and homemaker. After attending Queens College, according to past interviews, she wanted to become an actress. A brief appearance in ''Crazy Joe,'' a B-movie made in 1974 by Dino De Laurentiis, changed her mind. **********She then turned to another form of show business, cosmetics, and started training department store cosmeticians for Coty. On a visit to Los Angeles, she was having drinks with a friend at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel when she spotted an attractive young man. As Ms. Barad later told The Los Angeles Times: ''I look over and here's this really nice-looking guy with his mom and dad. I said to my friend, 'See that guy over there? I'm going to marry him and move to L.A.' '' His name was Thomas Barad. **********The two married and lived in Los Angeles starting in 1978. After having the first of two sons, she landed a job at Mattel in 1981 as product manager. In 1982, she was named marketing director for Barbie. **********By all accounts, she was brilliant at expanding the Barbie brand from a doll to a lifestyle, with cars, houses, horses and costumes for any number of careers. Barbie became the canvas upon which any little girl could paint her fantasy world. Sales skyrocketed. **********One executive who contributed mightily to the brand's success, and Ms. Barad's,  according to former Mattel managers, was Robert Sansone, hired as president of Mattel USA in 1987. He died in 1991. **********According to several people, Mr. Sansone provided the muscle for Barbie's ascent. He raised the price on some merchandise -- Happy Holidays Barbie, for one -- and got Toys ''R'' Us and Wal-Mart Stores, a company new to toys, to increase their Barbie orders significantly. **********Mr. Sansone was integral to the company, several former Mattel executives said, because he established and enforced management controls. If a retailer balked at buying a certain Mattel item, for instance, the sales force had a longstanding practice of promising to provide token advertising if they agreed to take the product. Not under Mr. Sansone. ''If they wouldn't take it, so be it,'' a former executive recalled. ''The product was dropped.'' **********Now, the former executive said, Mr. Sansone's controls have disappeared. ''Jill is a shoot-from-the-hip person,'' this person said. No executive there contradicts Ms. Barad. **********As Ms. Barad moved up Mattel's ladder, even after she was named chief operating officer in 1992, she kept a tight rein on the Barbie business. There was not an advertising storyboard or a doll design she didn't see. ''Control Barbie and you control the company,'' another former executive said. ''That was her best and her constant move.'' **********Trouble started in the mid-1990's when Barbie sales growth began to slow.  People who have worked with Ms. Barad say her ego was too entwined with the brand to want to accept that fact. ''She marketed herself as the Barbie guru,'' a former executive said. ''If you went in and said, 'Barbie is going to be less than a year ago,' she would have gone bananas.'' **********BY 1994, top management realized that Mattel had problems. According to a former employee who has filed a wrongful termination suit against Mattel, top management took extraordinary measures to make earnings predictions that year. **********The case, which was dismissed on summary judgment in December 1997, is on appeal in California state court. It was filed by Michelle Greenwald, who was hired as a senior vice president in 1992. She contends that Mattel fired her in 1995 because she alerted her superior, Mr. Eskridge, then Mattel's president, of her concern that the company may not have accounted properly for a royalty payment it had persuaded the Walt Disney Company to defer from 1994 into 1995. Ms. Greenwald had primary responsibility for Disney-licensed products at Mattel. **********Since 1995, when the lawsuit was filed, Mattel has called Ms. Greenwald's case ''baseless.'' A 1996 review by the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and the accounting firm Ernst & Young into Ms. Greenwald's allegations concluded that there was no evidence that the company's accounting was ''inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles.'' In dismissing the case, the trial judge said Ms. Greenwald had not objected strenuously enough. **********Ms. Greenwald declined to comment, and her lawyer, Michael Harris of Harris & Panels in Syracuse, declined to make her available for an interview. But thousands of pages of documents filed with the California Court of Appeals tell the tale. **********According to documents filed by Ms. Greenwald in support of her suit and obtained from the court, Jim DeRose, then president of Mattel, wrote to Ms. Barad, the chief operating officer, on Oct. 6, 1994, that the company was short $40 million necessary to meet its financial projections, and that they should ''determine collectively how to address the profit fallout.'' Mattel management then asked Disney to reduce the terms of its royalty arrangement, and Disney said no, according to the documents. **********Later that year, Mr. DeRose told some Mattel employees that he ''intended to inform the board of directors of the impossibility of achieving'' the financial goals for 1994. On Dec. 9, Mr. DeRose was fired, according to court documents. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment. **********Among the payments that Mattel owed Disney in 1994 on its licensing deals was $11.8 million for infant and preschool toys. The payment was not made by the end of the year and, on Jan. 10, according to the documents, Ms. Barad wrote a letter essentially asking Disney to forgive the royalty payment. In its response, Disney agreed only to defer the payment until 1995. **********Ms. Greenwald feared that Mattel did not consider the $11.8 million owed to Disney as a deferred expense in 1994, as accounting rules would require. Court papers say that on April 25, 1995, she alerted Mattel's new president, Mr. Eskridge, to her fears about this and other amounts owed to Disney totaling $16.6 million. She said she was fired  two months later, while on vacation. **********On the deferral of the Disney royalties, the Ernst & Young review said Mattel's accounting was ''reasonable'' given the ''facts and circumstances as they existed at the time the accounting decisions were made.'' **********Court documents also include Mr. Eskridge's slides from the June 1995 presentation to top management that outlined Mattel problems. In addition to his reference to an ostrich school of reality and the Jill Factor, there is a slide titled ''Mattel . . . The Current Business Situation.'' It said ''Strong track record of sales and earnings . . . but 'manufactured' earnings in last two quarters. 4th quarter 1994: Disney 'deal' and $ currency hedges.'' **********The Mattel spokesman said the comments from the slides were taken out of context. **********In its 1998 annual report, Mattel stated that during 1996, the company received comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding ''its accounting for certain royalties and participation fees in prior periods.'' The company said it conducted a thorough investigation and found that its accounting was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Nevertheless, Mattel ''recognized a catch-up adjustment in the amount of $21.8 million before taxes in the fourth quarter of 1998.'' **********Was the S.E.C. letter confirmation of Ms. Greenwald's allegations? The spokesman said only that the company had consistently argued that the suit was without merit. **********The $16.6 million cited by Ms. Greenwald  may sound like small change at a company as big as Mattel -- its revenues in 1994 were $3.2 billion -- but if it did not record the amounts owed to Disney as expenses, the company's earnings looked better than they actually were. **********Beyond trying to please Wall Street analysts by meeting the earnings estimates, Mattel management had an incentive to increase profit because executive compensation is based on how the company does financially. **********From 1993 to 1995, Mattel's management incentive plan focused on profitability, asset management and revenue growth. According to testimony of Barbara Luna, one of two independent accounting experts hired by Ms. Greenwald to examine company records for practices that would support her allegation, if Mattel reported expenses of $16.6 million during 1994, the company would have earned $1.46 a share, not the $1.50 necessary for top management to receive greater bonuses. **********Ms. Luna testified that if a Mattel share earned $1.46 for the year, the $26 million bonus pool payable to top management in 1994 would have fallen 21 percent, to $20.4 million. On the strength of what Mr. Eskridge's slides had called the ''manufactured'' earnings, Mr. Amerman, the chief executive at the time, earned a bonus of $833,150, Mr. Eskridge received $425,000 and Ms. Barad got $635,800. **********MS. GREENWALD also contends in her suit that Mattel consistently delivered free goods and other incentives to major retailers in exchange for their buying additional merchandise that would help Mattel ''make their quarters.'' How the company accounted for inducements was another concern. **********A senior executive at a major toy retailer confirmed that over many years, Mattel regularly asked him to place an order before the quarter's end to help Mattel. ''They've been making their quarters for 15 years by going to retailers and saying, 'We need a $10 million order,' and give an inducement,'' the executive said. Although this executive said that providing an occasional favor like this was common in the industry, the regularity with which Mattel did it was unique. ''Every company has done it at a time, but not every company does it every quarter,'' he said. **********The incentive might be a discount on merchandise or a promise of free goods in the future. But the retailing executive was not sure how Mattel accounted for the discount. ''It has to go in future liabilities or current liabilities,'' he said. For example, it cannot be deferred to a future quarter when  higher revenues would make the expense look inconsequential. **********Mattel said it accounts for these incentives properly. **********Although Mattel's troubles began as early as 1994, the company was telling the outside world that things were great. **********But toys made by other companies started to take market share from Barbie. Beanie Babies became a sensation among both young girls and collectors, and merchandise designed around the Spice Girls, the rock group, stormed the market. Then came Furby. **********''For years, Barbie didn't have any competition,'' said Jim Silver, publisher of the Toy Book, an industry newsletter. ''These items all represented competition even though they weren't just dolls.'' Barbie could no longer grow at 15 percent a year or more. In 1994, according to an internal Mattel memo, Barbie sales rose 8 percent. **********People who know Ms. Barad said she was ill-equipped to deal with Barbie in decline. ''Jill is one of the most brilliant, hard-driving marketing product people I have ever met,'' said a top executive at a major toy retailer. ''Her problem is, the world is not just Barbie. Not everything in the toy business can be done the same as Barbie.'' **********Ms. Barad's focus on Barbie seems to have resulted in a lack of innovation in other areas at Mattel, former insiders say. So, even as Barbie sales were slowing, Mattel flooded toy stores with merchandise. The company also began producing far more of the collector's line of Barbies -- a high-margin segment of the business begun in the early 1990's -- than it said it would. The market became awash in these dolls that fetched between $50 and $100, enraging Barbie collectors who had believed the company when it said the dolls were limited editions. **********CUSTOMERS who complained to Mattel said they were ignored. ''A lot of it was an obsession with the bottom line, and they were riding on their high horse and not listening to their customers,'' one retailer said. ''Not listening to the dealers and the customers is now a major part of their problem.'' **********Without ideas for internal growth, Ms. Barad was forced to look to acquisitions. Her record in this area is mixed. **********Her first was Tyco Toys Inc., whose Matchbox toy car brand and radio control toys complemented Barbie. Tyco's sales were declining when the deal was done in March 1997, but Mattel paid $881 million for it, a little more than Tyco's 1996 sales. Mattel immediately recorded a $275 million pretax charge against operations as a result of the acquisition. **********Last year, Mattel bought the Pleasant Company, a mail-order doll concern that was generating $300 million in annual sales. Again, the price was high: $700 million. Toy industry experts say that paying the equivalent of sales for a toy company is considered rich. **********Then came the Learning Company, for which Mattel paid $3.8 billion -- 4.5 times sales -- in May. **********''Management felt in both cases that these were fair valuations,'' Mr. Bozarth said. **********But even casual observers of the Learning Company knew that it was no longer a hot property. Its software characters, Reader Rabbit and Carmen Sandiego, were aging and it had lost money in all but one year since 1992. **********On Oct. 4, when Mattel warned shareholders that the Learning Company would show a significant revenue shortfall and a loss, it cited three reasons. A planned licensing arrangement was scrapped because its terms were not what Mattel had understood them to be, the company chose to write off bad debts and it had terminated relationships with some distributors. **********To people familiar with the due diligence typical before an acquisition, these explanations only clouded the issue. ''This is not brain surgery,'' one former Mattel executive said. ''When someone says to me they were shocked because licenses didn't do what they were supposed to do, that says to me someone didn't forecast properly.'' **********AND where is the Mattel board? According to Patrick McGurn, director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services, a corporate governance group, Mattel's board includes too many people who have been there for 10 or 20 years. Most were there to watch Ms. Barad mastermind Barbie's glory days, and are charmed by her. Among outside directors, the average age is 60, the 1999 proxy states. **********''The board is in some pretty desperate need of new blood,'' he said. ''When they serve a long time, they may not see the need for change.'' **********Mr. McGurn is even more troubled by the fact that Ned Mansour, Mattel's president and general counsel, sits on the board's nominations and corporate governance committee, which is charged with ensuring that the company is run effectively and smoothly. **********''It's not good governance, period,'' Mr. McGurn said. ''There should be no insiders on those panels.'' **********Mattel responds that it believes Mr. Mansour's seat on the committee to be appropriate. **********For now, angry shareholders have only one reason to hope for change: at the annual meeting, Mattel allows for so-called cumulative voting for directors. That makes it easier for a big shareholder to make a run at a board seat. **********''If a shareholder had about 9 percent of the stock,'' Mr. McGurn said, putting all his shares toward a single candidate ''could vote a person onto the board.'' **********''A dissident could swoop in,'' Mr. McGurn said. **********One way or another, many people want resolution of Mattel's problems.''I just hope they bring it around quickly, and we can continue to grow together,'' said Fred Meyers, the owner of Meyers Toy World in Battle Creek, Mich."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/25/business/business-digest-606472.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-11-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 583, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Revised Growth Estimate Shows Economy in Top Gear **********With employment, incomes, confidence and major stock market gauges at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its estimate of economic growth from July to September to an annual pace of 5.5 percent from 4.8 percent, surpassing nearly all predictions. **********The figures indicate that the current expansion is poised to set a record for longevity with the arrival of the year 2000.

And everyone is struggling to find enough programmers, designers, marketers and fulfillment specialists to get the job done quickly. **********''A lot of this comes down to simply believing that building a site is an easy thing to do,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research. Part of the $10 million cost of building a first-rate site is hiring people like developers, he said. ''But guess what -- everybody else is, too,'' he went on. ''Some companies have been looking for vice presidents of e-commerce all year. Then you have to build the site, handle fulfillment, customer service call centers, and on it goes.'' **********Elaine Rubin, an e-commerce consultant and chairwoman of Shop.org, an industry trade group, said companies that handle fulfillment and other tasks for Internet retailers ''are to this day getting calls from people looking to get up before Christmas.'' Most of those calls are coming from those with no previous e-commerce experience, she said. ''The ones with experience know some of the steps,'' she added, ''and they typically started planning their launch in the early spring.'' **********Which makes it all the more puzzling that many deep-pocketed, experienced retailers that witnessed the e-commerce surge last year will not make it online this year. **********According to Jon Ricker, chief information officer of the Limited, the company started planning the online rollout of its brands -- including the Limited, Limited Express and Victoria's Secret -- in mid-1997. So far, only Victoria's Secret is up and running; neither the Limited nor Limited Express will have an e-commerce site running this year. ''We refuse to do damage to our brand,'' Mr. Ricker said. ''The lure of additional Christmas revenue just isn't worth the risk.'' **********Though it is easy to say that traditional retailers are lagging behind because they are not yet able to operate at Internet speed, Mr. Ricker said bigger retailers had more at stake than Internet start-ups and were justifiably more cautious about risking their reputations with a site that may not be ready for prime time. ''And for a large retailer like ourselves with a global presence and global sourcing,'' he said, ''there's a lot more to consider as you put the model together.'' **********In addition, larger retail corporations with a single e-commerce division can do justice to one brand's debut on the Web at a time, said Shelley Nandkeolyar, vice president for e-commerce at Williams-Sonoma. The company will introduce its site for Williams-Sonoma (www.williams-sonoma.com) today, as scheduled, Mr. Nandkeolyar said, but other company chains like Pottery Barn and, appropriately enough, Hold Everything, will have to wait. **********''We had some hard negotiations between the brands about who would launch when, but it made most sense to do it this way,'' Mr. Nandkeolyar said. The company started the Williams-Sonoma Wedding and Gift Registry (www.wswedding.com) earlier this year ''to help us learn about how to launch e-commerce,'' he said. **********''Now the Williams-Sonoma site is going up, and in short order next year we'll bring the rest online,'' he said. **********If executives like Mr. Ricker and Mr. Nandkeolyar sound less than mortified at the prospect of leaving some of their brands on the e-commerce shelf this year, they may have good reason, analysts said. Despite the Web retail hyperbole, holiday sales this year will  amount to only $4 billion, according to Forrester Research. ''So I don't think the opportunity cost is huge,'' Mr. McQuivey of Forrester said. **********''But can you live without the confidence it inspires in Wall Street, or in the boardroom, or the cachet it generates with consumers who see you on the Web?'' Mr. McQuivey asked. ''I think the opportunity costs are more intangible.'' **********Of course, retailers that miss the rush will also have to work harder in the future to win customers away from stores that make the holiday deadline and perform well. Mindful of this, executives like Dick Sabot, chairman of Eziba.com (www.eziba.com), are determined not to let November pass without getting started. **********The company, which will sell handmade goods from around the world, is expected to go live within the next week -- thanks in part to an unexpected source of pressure. ''We had to decide in August on advertising placement,'' Mr. Sabot said, noting that recent ads in magazines essentially committed the site to rolling out soon. ''If it wasn't for the discipline that imposed on us, it's hard to imagine how we would've forced ourselves to get it done. Looking back, it was a fairly audacious thing to do.'' **********Another crucial factor in making the opening happen on time was persuading e-commerce service providers to work with them. It was no easy task, since fulfillment and Web site development companies and advertising agencies were buried with work offers even in March, when Eziba started building its site. ''We had to go in there early and win the competition,'' Mr. Sabot said. ''And then we had to convince them to internalize our deadline.'' **********Mr. Nandkeolyar of Williams-Sonoma said he had to guard against ''scope creep'' in the seven months it took to build the Williams-Sonoma site. Six weeks ago, for instance, one member of the site development team suggested building more content into a section devoted to seasonal event planning. **********''We thought we could do more, but it would require pages and pages of programming, and that would jeopardize the launch date,'' he said. ''We couldn't get enough production, since we're in the Bay Area and everyone's trying to launch by Nov. 1. So we'll just have to build it out over time.'' **********Even those that have managed to start operating on time are often doing so quietly, in hopes of ironing out any wrinkles in the system before the holiday deluge hits. Jim Finkelstein, president of Luxuryfinder.com (www.luxuryfinder.com), a purveyor of the pricey that went live late last month after eight months in development, said he simply did not publicize the rollout. **********''We're prepared for the rush, but we just want to make sure we've got everything right,'' Mr. Finkelstein said. ''That's why you try to get up a couple of months before the holidays. And that's why it's smart for companies who couldn't launch by the fall to wait until next year. If you want to create something that will last, you have to go about it the right way.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/18/business/company-briefs-959472.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-12-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********RAYTHEON SYSTEMS LTD., **********London, the British subsidiary of Raytheon Co., Lexington, Mass., said it received a $1.3 billion contract from Britain's Ministry of Defense to build a radar surveillance system. **********LYCOS INC., Waltham, Mass., an Internet search service, will buy as much as 15 percent of Fast Search and Transfer, Oslo, a maker of search products used in the Lycos service, for about $99 million. **********UNOCAL CORP., El Segundo, Calif., an oil and natural gas exploration company, will buy stakes in producing fields and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from closely held Tana Oil and Gas Corp., for an undisclosed price."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/31/world/negotiations-with-hijackers-delicately-poised-india-says.html": {"writer_name": "Celia Dugger", "pub_date": "1999-12-31", "snippet": "Negotiations between Indian officials and hijackers holding more than 150 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines jet in Afghanistan resume after nearly breaking down; talks are now 'delicately poised,' according to Indian government; a young male pass...", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Negotiations With Hijackers Delicately Poised, India Says", "print_headline": "Negotiations With Hijackers Delicately Poised, India Says", "body_text": " **********Negotiations between Indian officials and hijackers holding more than 150 hostages aboard an Indian Airlines jet in Afghanistan resumed today after nearly breaking down early this morning, and are now ''delicately poised,'' the foreign minister of India, Jaswant Singh, said tonight. **********The talks are focused on the hijackers' remaining demand that India free a jailed Pakistani Muslim cleric and 35 militants opposed to Indian rule of Kashmir. On Wednesday, the hijackers abandoned their insistence that India pay a $200 million ransom and turn over the exhumed body of a slain militant. **********Both the Indians and the hijackers are under intense pressure from the ruling Taliban militia in Afghanistan to make a deal and end the week-old crisis. The Indian Airlines Airbus that was seized by the hijackers on a flight from Nepal last Friday has been sitting on the tarmac of an airport in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar since Saturday. **********Negotiations broke off at 2 a.m. and Indian officials left discouraged. ''The negotiations came to a situation of impasse,'' Mr. Singh said. ''There was apprehension about no further resumption of negotiations.'' **********Later in the morning, the Taliban, which has made its impatience with the pace of the talks plain, sent in dozens of heavily armed soldiers and trucks loaded with a rocket launcher and an anti-aircraft Stinger missile. **********Taliban officials have repeatedly said they would storm the plane if the hijackers began killing passengers on Afghan soil, and the movement of soldiers to the airport raised speculation that such an attack might be imminent -- or that the Taliban was trying to remind the hijackers of what could happen if they resorted to more violence. The hijackers fatally stabbed one man, a newlywed returning from his honeymoon in Nepal, before the plane reached Afghanistan. **********But the Taliban's foreign minister, Abdul Wakil Muttawakil, said the deployment was just a routine security measure. ''It does not mean we are going to storm the plane,'' he told reporters in Kandahar. **********Mr. Singh said neither the Taliban nor the hijackers had set a deadline for an end to the hijacking. **********[On Friday morning, Mr. Singh said he would fly to Kandahar immediately to join in the negotiations, Reuters reported.] **********On a day when little information of substance was made public, unconfirmed reports spread quickly that the Indians were close to a deal to release some of the militants in exchange for the freeing of the hostages. But Indian officials emphatically denied it. ''There is no such agreement,'' said Raminder Singh Jassal, a spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs. **********The hijackers -- their identities still a mystery -- are talking with Indian negotiators by radio. The strongest clue to who they are lies in their demand for the release of Maulana Masood Azhar, a Pakistani cleric who was a leader of Harakat ul-Ansar. The group helped recruit, train and send militants to the Himalayan territory of Kashmir, and is on the United States State Department's list of terrorist organizations. **********The status of Kashmir, whose population is predominantly Muslim, has been a festering source of conflict between predominantly Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan ever since they were created from the British empire in 1947. In the last decade, indigenous Kashmiri rebels as well as militants sponsored by Pakistan have fought for a separate Kashmiri nation, or for Kashmir's right to join Pakistan. **********Still, the precise motives of the hijackers are murky. **********Today, in a small sign of flexibility, they allowed a young, unidentified male passenger with a serious stomach ailment to leave the plane for treatment at a hospital, but only with the understanding that he would return to the plane. **********This afternoon, the Indian man, looking pale and exhausted, was whisked from the airport in a white van. Tonight, there were conflicting reports about whether he had been returned to captivity. **********A diabetic hostage, Anil Khurana, who was released on Sunday, returned to Delhi tonight. He had been flown to Islamabad on Monday and taken to a hospital there."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/09/world/6-libyans-tried-in-absentia-in-89-downing-of-french-jet.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1999-03-09", "snippet": "French antiterrorism court in Paris puts six high-ranking Libyan officials on trial in absentia on charges of ordering bombing of French DC-10 airliner that killed 171 people in 1989 (M)", "word_count": 238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "6 Libyans Tried in Absentia In '89 Downing of French Jet", "print_headline": "6 Libyans Tried in Absentia In '89 Downing of French Jet", "body_text": " **********A French antiterrorism court in Paris put six high-ranking Libyan officials on trial in absentia today on charges of ordering the bombing of a French DC-10 airliner that killed 171 people in 1989. **********Under pressure from economic sanctions imposed because of Libyan support for terrorism, Col.

Accustomed to bloody battle and gruesome terrorism, the country was lastingly unsettled by the quiet tragedy of an unsolved mystery. **********One January night in 1968, the Dakar, a British submarine newly refurbished for the Israeli Navy, disappeared in the midst of its maiden voyage, from England to Haifa. A 69-man crew vanished with it, lost without a trace in a maritime enigma that became a legendary part of Israeli history. **********On Friday, the wreck of the Dakar was found 9,500 feet beneath the Mediterranean Sea, between Crete and Cyprus. On Saturday night, the Israeli Navy confirmed the findings of a joint Israeli-American search team. Underwater photographs taken by an aquatic robot proved that the hull belonged to the Dakar. **********''It was more exciting to find than the Titanic, because to me the Titanic is just a shipwreck,'' Thomas K. Dettweiler, who led the search teams for both vessels, told Agence France-Presse aboard his boat. ''With the Titanic most people have died who had any connection with it, but with the Dakar it's still living.'' **********Today, 31 years after the ship was lost at sea, Israel officially went into mourning. Newspapers printed pictures of each downed naval crewman and officer, pictures frozen in time. The Israeli radio played somber music, and, repeatedly, a recording of the final transmission from the ship -- a musical tribute to the ship sung by its new crew. **********''I pray that they will pull the submarine from the sea and bring the boys to burial in Israel so we will have somewhere to go and cry,'' Shmuel Shenfer, whose son Reuven was aboard, told Itim, the Israeli news agency. **********In a disturbing coda to the Dakar saga, a former navy commander, Adm. Michael Barkai, killed himself hours after hearing that the submarine had been located. His brother, Maj. Avraham Barkai, had been the ship's deputy commander. **********The admiral, whose decorated navy career ended abruptly 20 years ago after he stood trial and was acquitted on sexual assault charges, had been sick with cancer. **********In January 1968, an Israeli crew set out from Portsmouth, England, in their new submarine, a World War II-era vessel purchased from the British and refurbished. **********Just off Crete, the ship sent what would be its final message to shore, including the group warbling of a giddy tribute to the new craft, written by Maj. Barkai: ''The Dakar is in the depths in full strength.'' **********Then the ship disappeared. For two weeks, the Israeli Navy searched, with help from other navies. In mid-February, Moshe Dayan, then the Defense Minister, and senior military officials pronounced the hunt futile. **********About a year after the initial search was called off, the submarine's emergency buoy washed up on the coast off the Gaza Strip. The navy assumed that the boat had veered from its course and went down in relatively shallow waters off Egypt. That assumption governed a new round of searches for the Dakar, which were made easier after Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt. **********Two years ago, under pressure from the relatives of the crew, the navy asked for help from the United States, which assisted with further explorations. A few months ago, Israel hired the American Nauticus Corporation, which discovered the  Titanic, to use its advanced technology to sweep the ocean floor. With sonar gear and robot-guided deep-sea cameras, the Dakar was found 300 miles west of Israel -- precisely on its original course. **********The submarine had vanished, though, during an era when delicately balanced superpower rivalries were being fought beneath the seas, when Israel and Egypt were still enemies and Soviet and Egyptian fleets dotted the Mediterranean. **********Its disappearance inevitably spawned any number of theories, and the mystery may never be solved. An initial examination of the submarine suggested that it did not sink because of an attack, but more likely because of a technical malfunction, human error or a collision. **********Brig. Gen. Gideon Raz, a former Israeli navy deputy commander, visited the site of the wreck today and observed the submarine through an underwater camera. He said that the front section was whole, the middle section damaged, with parts spread about the ocean floor, and the rear section separated from the main body. **********''I think we can say that it was not caused by a large explosion, or explosives, or ammunition,'' he said. ''One thing is clear, given that the pieces did not spread over a large radius: It fell almost whole until the end of its fall.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/14/business/company-news-iron-mountain-buys-4-records-management-companies.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-14", "snippet": "Iron Mountain Inc, world's largest records-management company, purchases four companies for total of about $162 million; largest company purchased is Data Base Inc; purchase price is about $115 million; other companies are First American Records M...", "word_count": 115, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IRON MOUNTAIN BUYS 4 RECORDS-MANAGEMENT COMPANIES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; IRON MOUNTAIN BUYS 4 RECORDS-MANAGEMENT COMPANIES", "body_text": " **********Iron Mountain Inc., the world's largest records-management company, has purchased four companies for a total of about $162 million, adding new markets from Maine to Oregon.

Through July, according to the Treasury, corporations paid $140.7 billion, 6.4 percent less than in the corresponding period last year. **********Obviously, companies are reporting lower earnings to the Government than they are to their shareholders. Nothing new there. After all, tax accounting methods differ from those used to compile shareholder reports. **********But the downturn in tax receipts is new. Corporate tax receipts have not dropped since 1983, and that was when the United States was shaking off a crippling recession. And the decline comes at a time when individual tax receipts are running 6.7 percent ahead of 1998. **********Forget, for a moment, what the drop might say about how inflated the earnings reported to shareholders have come to be. What's behind the decline? **********Corporate tax shelters are an explanation offered by Christopher E. Bergin, editor of the magazine Tax Notes, which published an article about falling tax receipts in late July. ''Increasingly, U.S. corporations are looking at their tax departments as profit centers,'' he said. Once, tax staffers were ridiculed as numbers nerds; now they are revered. **********Martin A. Sullivan, the economist who wrote the Tax Notes article, said that if the decline in taxes continues through the rest  of fiscal 1999, which ends in September, overall taxes paid by American companies as a percentage of their profits would be about 19.9 percent, the lowest rate since 1984. Five years ago, corporations paid 24.6 percent of profits in taxes. **********The trend may indicate ''that corporate tax receipts are being adversely affected by corporate tax shelters,'' Mr. Sullivan said. **********What sorts of shelters? Only the financial engineers know for sure. But Robert Willens, managing director at Lehman Brothers, said corporations could legitimately reduce their tax bills by structuring asset sales as tax-free exchanges and using government-bestowed tax credits, like the one benefiting companies with heavy research and development costs. And, the more income a company generates overseas and leaves there, the lower its tax bill. **********But one of the biggest contributors to the falloff in tax receipts may be stock options. **********Here's why: Under shareholder accounting, stock options are not considered an employee compensation expense, even though they clearly are. So companies that use them -- and rare is the publicly traded company that doesn't -- effectively overstate their earnings. **********But for tax accounting purposes, when an employee exercises an option, the difference between that option's strike price and the prevailing market value of the underlying stock is an expense to the company that issued the option. **********So the widespread use of options not only hypes corporate earnings, it cuts companies' tax bills and Treasury receipts.

The Burlington Free Press ominously editorialized about the ''New Jerseyification'' of the scenic vacation town of 6,000 residents. The National Trust for Historic Preservation declared the entire state of Vermont and its little white-steepled towns ''endangered'' by suburban sprawl. **********It took seven years of expensive battling before the store finally opened. During the same period, an effort to open a store in nearby St. Albans was blocked by the Vermont Environmental Board. **********Today, however, Wal-Mart is no longer treated as an invader. The company, the nation's largest retailer, opened its fourth outlet in Vermont last month -- a new 70,000-square-foot store on the outskirts of Berlin, about 30 miles southeast of Williston. Despite complaints from preservationists and environmental groups, the entire process -- from filing a permit to greeting the first customers -- took little more than a year. **********Wal-Mart's quiet little victory in Vermont has been echoed throughout the Northeast, where the retailer has lately been mounting an aggressive expansion drive with little of the uproar that accompanied its rocky start earlier in the decade. **********What is particularly significant about the latest Northeast push is that most of the new stores are supercenters. Sprawling to as much as 200,000 square feet, these vast emporiums offer not only the apparel, housewares, and electronics available at most Wal-Mart stores but also groceries, pharmaceuticals and extras like eye care and auto service. **********As a result, they compete with a much more diversified range of retailers than regular Wal-Marts. The average Wal-Mart supercenter rings up about $55 million to $65 million in annual sales -- almost double the volume of a regular Wal-Mart and seven times that of a rival discounter like Ames Department Stores. **********According to some analysts, Wal-Mart stands to triple its supercenter presence in the region in just the next two years -- an expansion that could draw $3 billion more in annual sales from an already crowded marketplace. To put this figure in perspective, it exceeds the 1998 sales for any of the regional chains -- Ames, Bradlees and Grand Union. **********At first, Wal-Mart's expansion will undoubtedly mean more opportunities for thrifty consumers and heightened rivalry among the stores who want their business. ''Wal-Mart's expansion into the Northeast is going to create a killer competitive environment and an intense price war,'' predicted Burt Flickinger 3d, who has been studying regional retail patterns for three decades and is now managing director of Reach Marketing, a retail and marketing consulting agency in Westport, Conn. **********Killer is the operative word. Mr. Flickinger says that not all the chains can survive -- and he is not shy about calling the race. He argues that Grand Union and the supermarket chains run by the Penn Traffic Company, a company now in bankruptcy that has a significant presence in eastern Pennsylvania, along with the retailers Ames and Bradlees, are among those with ''questionable futures.'' **********''The Northeast is only so big, and since Wal-Mart is the winner in worldwide retailing, it will be the winner here,'' he said. **********As its competitors point out in defense of their own viability, Wal- Mart is not exactly invisible in the Northeast even now. With 244 of its regular discount stores -- like those in Williston and Berlin, Vt. -- as well as 28 supercenters, the retailer is already familiar to many consumers in New England, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. **********But the chain is entering what Wal-Mart watchers call the saturation phase in the Northeast. Dr. Kenneth Stone, an economist with the University of Iowa and a student of the Wal-Mart phenomenon, says that by its own standards, the retailer has barely begun to establish a foothold in the region. Sam Walton, the chain's founder, ''used to joke that he likes his stores so close together that the managers compete against each other,'' Dr. Stone said. **********Wal-Mart typically provides few details of its expansion plans for the year beyond an overall number of stores planned. This year it announced it intends to build 150 supercenters and 40 regular-size discount stores nationwide. When asked about analysts' projections, a Wal-Mart spokesman, Jay Allen, said that as of now the company had plans to build only 15 supercenters in the Northeast this year. **********The company, however, has always followed the same game plan when it expands: namely, it builds an enormous distribution center and then constructs stores in concentric circles around it. So it is easy to make plausible deductions about Wal-Mart's ambitions in the Northeast. **********In five of the last six years, the company has opened a major warehouse in the Northeast. Its newest, in New Bedford, Pa., is the first of its sites in the region that has the capacity to supply 75 supercenters. Mr. Flickinger estimates that 180 superstores will be built within the area in the next five years and that as many as 33 may be built this year. Mr. Allen does acknowledges that the giant New Bedford warehouse is currently operating far below capacity. **********And Wal-Mart is not likely to stop with another several dozen supercenters in the Northeast. The retailer is building another supercenter supply depot in Johnstown, N.Y., scheduled to open in June 2000. **********What might Wal-Mart ultimately take to be an appropriate number of supercenters for the Northeast? To get some idea of its preferred supercenter-to-consumer ratio, consider that Arkansas, its home state, with a population of 2.3 million, has 27 of the mega-outlets. **********The new stores are expected to be in neither urban nor suburban areas, but in territories just beyond that. The retailer generally prefers to put its stores in semi-rural areas so it can have large spaces at low cost. Still, because such stores are typically built at highway interchanges they will be easily accessible to large swaths of the densely populated Northeast. **********Wal-Mart's play comes at a time when competition among clothing discounters, its traditional competitors, has been heating up again in the Northeast. Several retailers are seeking to grow by picking up some of the pieces of Caldor, once a leading regional chain, which announced last month that it was liquidating and putting its 145 valuable properties on the market. **********Kohl's, a retail powerhouse from the Midwest, is competing for 32 of the Caldor stores on Long Island, which would transform the company overnight into a major force in metropolitan New York. The discounter Target, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, another Midwest retailer that is rapidly building a nationwide presence, is also said to be looking to buy several stores. Wal-Mart has put in a bid for 13 of the Caldor stores (which are generally too small for its standard store). **********Also suddenly looking for a bigger piece of the population-rich Northeastern pie are the newly energized regional chains of Bradlees, which just emerged from bankruptcy with a new expansion-minded management team, and Ames, which acquired 150 Hills stores late last year. **********Discounters in the region say they are ready to meet the challenge. Bradlees, which has only 8 of its 102 stores in the same markets as Wal-Mart, might justifiably fear an escalation in its conflict with the retailing leviathan. But the chief executive of Bradlees, Peter Thorner, appears sanguine. In markets where they go head to head, he said, ''Wal-Mart takes only 6 to 8 percent of sales from our stores and, even then, only in the first year of competition.'' The minor downside, he said, is that ''we lose some lower-margin products.'' **********To meet the challenge, Bradlees has been focusing on more stylish apparel and decorative items for the house, chic design having never been a strong suit for no-nonsense Wal-Mart. **********Joe Ettore, chief executive of Ames stores, argues that for him the battle with Wal-Mart is already over. ''Out of our 301 Ames stores, 245 are within 10 to 12 miles of a Wal-Mart, and 165 are within 3 miles,'' he said ''At this stage it is not about our future survival. We already co-exist.'' **********Mr. Ettore's strategy, which has been widely hailed by analysts, is to sell to consumers with family incomes below $25,000, just beneath the middle-income customers who are Wal-Mart's prime target. **********With Wal-Mart opening more supercenters, grocery stores will also face increased competition. ''It is going to put tremendous pressure on grocery stores out there,'' said Dr. Stone, the University of Iowa economist. **********Supermarket executives acknowledge that Wal-Mart is a threat. ''They are not benign,'' said Bob Tobin, president and chief executive of Ahold U.S.A., the subsidiary of Royal Ahold N.V., the Dutch grocery giant that owns the New England-based Stop and Shop chain. ''No one who is a student of this industry welcomes Wal-Mart into their area.'' **********In a recent study of Wal-Mart's experience in Texas, Dr. Stone found that three years after a supercenter opened, local grocery stores had lost an average of 17 percent of sales. **********Mr. Flickinger, the retailing consultant, argues that the Wal-Mart effect can already be seen in Pennsylvania, where Wal-Mart has 19 supercenters, by far its greatest concentration in the region. Penn Traffic, the long-troubled owner of several chains of grocery stores, has shuttered 15 of its area Bi-Lo stores. ''There is no doubt they became a competitive element in many many of our districts,'' said Marc Jampole, a company spokesman. Still, he declined to blame Wal-Mart. ''I don't think their opening was the overriding factor.'' **********Other supermarket executives say that they can go toe-to-toe with Wal-Mart. Mr. Tobin of Ahold notes that in contrast to the Midwest, the Northeast market for groceries has long been both highly saturated and highly competitive. ''New England,'' he said, ''is not like a cornfield in Arkansas.'' **********That is a sentiment echoed by Bernard Rogan, a spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets Inc, a subsidiary of J. Sainsbury P.L.C. He says the supercenters are an old idea -- Wal-Mart opened the first of them 15 years ago -- and will not meet the needs of the region's aging populace, who prefer more intimate shopping. **********Shaw's has been shrinking the average size of its stores (down to 58,000 square feet from 65,000) and expanding upscale offerings like fresh seafood and meat, deli foods and ready-to-eat meals, areas where it feels Wal-Mart does not compete well. **********Still, the $3 billion in sales that Wal-Mart is expected to reap from its Northeast expansion has got to come from somewhere. No matter how much retailers contend they can compete, Wal-Mart is clearly on the prowl. Supercenters will clearly change the calculus. For example, Ames stands to lose older customers to supercenters because they have pharmacies. **********Moreover, Wal-Mart supercenters sell more apparel than their regular stores because people drawn in by the promise of cheap fruit and vegetables find themselves lured by Wal-Mart's store designs to the clothing racks and toy areas. **********As a result, Mr. Tobin of Ahold said, ''Many stores in the area that thought they had weathered the original hit from Wal-Mart are going to get hit again.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/23/news/10-ways-to-lead-the-internet-pack.html": {"writer_name": "Victoria Shannon", "pub_date": "1999-09-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1083, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "10 Ways to Lead The Internet Pack", "print_headline": "10 Ways to Lead The Internet Pack", "body_text": " **********PARIS\u2014                     When Scott McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems, addresses a crowd, you can expect a few sweeping generalizations, a few laughs \u2014 and a few digs at Microsoft Corp. **********In Paris last week, he gave via satellite a conference of European technology executives his \"top 10 assumptions to live by in the Internet age.\" Underneath the glib remarks are the principles that guide Sun's business model and investments, he said. **********1) Have lunch, or be lunch. \"What you don't want to do is get Amazoned,\" Mr. McNealy warned. Get your business on the Internet, don't be short-sighted about the future, and make the investment now.\"It's very, very important to get there first,\" he said. **********2) Assume that everyone is connected to a high-speed, broadband network at all times. \"This is a pretty silly assumption, if you think about it. We have a world today where half the world dies without ever making or receiving a phone call,\" he said. **********But it will pay off as huge amounts of fiber-optic cable are laid and as wireless communications, cable modems and other high-speed access spreads around the world. **********3) The Web is in charge. \"No single company anymore is in charge,\" even though Microsoft is \"still trying to be.\" In a plea for companies to use open standards, and thus Sun's own Java technology, Mr. McNealy argued that the Web has already chosen the standards of TCP/IP, HTML and Java. **********Mere mortals should not operate nuclear power plants, telephone switches, the Hoover Dam, or computers. In the debate over whether desktop PCs will continue to be the centerpiece of home computing power, Mr. McNealy instead has long supported the notion of a simplified network computer that gets most of its ammunition from a network or the Internet. **********While he still believes that the network computer, now often called the \"thin client,\" is the future, he takes it a small step forward and renames it the \"thin appliance.\" **********\"The new access devices for the Internet are things like the NTT DoCoMo I-mode phone with wideband CMA and full Java capabilities. The Palm VII is now a Java virtual wireless connected machine in a handheld device.\" **********5) Web tone will usurp dial tone. In other words, future business and profits will not come from voice lines as much as from all-the-time, broadband Internet access. **********\"In fact, what you'll see a lot of the carriers doing is giving the old dial-tone world away for free,\" Mr. McNealy said. \"The narrow-band stuff \u2014 the mail, the voice, the chat \u2014 will be for free, and then the broadband services \u2014 like video, applications, commerce, advertising and all the rest of it \u2014 will be how they make their money.\" **********6) Over time, all software will be free.

A growing number have concluded that the best way to accomplish that goal is to create an entirely new piece of paper. **********Tracking stocks, which first appeared in the early 1980's, have become hot. Last week, the Walt Disney Company said it would combine its own Internet holdings with the Infoseek Corporation and create a new company that it will control, Go.com. Later this year, the DuPont Corporation will create a tracking stock for its life sciences business. And shares of the Microsoft Corporation jumped 5 percent on Friday after reports that it has been considering a tracking stock for its Internet businesses. All told, there are dozens of tracking stocks trading. **********Last week, Robert Willens, a managing director and analyst at Lehman Brothers who has served as an adviser to companies with tracking stocks, discussed the pros, cons and potential pitfalls for investors in tracking stocks. Here are excerpts: **********Q. Tracking stocks have been in the news a lot recently, but they have been around for some time. Could you give us a history? **********A. Technically, tracking stocks have been around for about 15 years. They were first used with General Motors' acquisition of EDS, and then again when they bought Hughes Aircraft. Both those were pretty much the only times they were used in the 1980's. **********What I call the modern era began with USX, when they issued a stock to track the performance of their oil business, Marathon Oil. **********In that instance, the tracking stock was a compromise. Carl Icahn, who at the time was a big USX shareholder, was exerting a lot of pressure to separate Marathon from the parent. In order to protect its debt rating, among other things, USX wanted to keep the two companies together. So we came up with the tracking stock. **********Q. How do you explain the surge in interest in tracking stocks? It looks like a number of companies, including Disney, are merely trying to highlight their Internet holdings. **********A. The Internet probably has a lot to do with it. But a lot of attention was focused on tracking stocks last February, when the Clinton Administration proposed in its version of the Federal budget to end the use of tracking stocks, and said any company issuing a tracking stock would be treated as if it had sold the tracked assets. That would subject the company to capital gains taxes. Faced with such an onerous tax, it is unlikely anyone would issue tracking stock should that proposal become law. **********But the negative proposal had the odd effect of getting people's attention. All of a sudden, tracking stock became one of the tools that corporations focused on. And when they did look at it, they found it was such a powerful tool that it made sense for almost any big company. **********Q. Was this year's sudden rush of tracking stocks an effort to beat the legislation and get grandfather status? **********A. The way the Administration's proposal was written, a company would have been grandfathered for the first issuance of tracking stock, but not for subsequent uses.  That would have defeated the purpose, because companies will want to use the tracking stock to make acquisitions, to pay dividends and the like. **********Q. Is the impetus to issue a tracking stock decreased if the stock of the parent company is doing well? **********A. Yes, it is. Unlocking value is the impetus here, by forcing the market to pay attention to a business within a much larger enterprise. By separating the business and giving it a separate currency, or stock, you allow them the opportunity to make acquisitions in that area and to compensate management. **********Q. Based on experience, does the issuance of a tracking stock help to increase the stock price of the parent company? **********A. Usually there is very little effect on the parent company stock after the tracking stock is created. **********Q. What are some potential pitfalls and common misperceptions about tracking stocks that investors should bear in mind? **********A. One theoretical risk is that since these businesses are not separated in any legal sense, creditors would have claim on those assets if the parent ever got in trouble. **********And that leads to a common misperception. In some quarters, there is still some confusion about who owns the company. A tracking stock is not a company that has been spun off. A shareholder has no direct claim on the tracked assets. And you have no voting rights, except at the parent company level. **********Q. Have tracking stocks performed well? **********A. For the most part, they have been good investments. In general, they tend to trade pretty much in line with their independent peers, which is exactly what people hope will happen."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/your-money/IHT-as-interest-rates-on-bonds-wane-preferred-stocks-offer-an.html": {"writer_name": "Mitchell Martin", "pub_date": "1999-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 6388, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Your Money", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Interest Rates on Bonds Wane, Preferred Stocks Offer an Alternative", "print_headline": "As Interest Rates on Bonds Wane, Preferred Stocks Offer an Alternative", "body_text": " **********PREFERRED STOCKS as an investment for retirees intrigued Mike and Naomi Fredman of Kfar Saba, Israel. They initiated the following exchange of correspondence with Mitchell Martin, editor of The Money Report. **********- **********What are your views on preferred stocks? If interest rates fall, then retirees are looking for means of keeping their income up. But preferred stocks are often vulnerable and volatile. **********- **********The question of preferred stocks is a broad one. If you look at it from the point of view of a retiree seeking income, then volatility should not be a concern because the idea would be to hold the shares indefinitely and just use the dividends. Inflation, which would tend to depress the value of preferreds, could reduce the purchasing power of dividends, but that is the same concern that a bondholder has. **********The nature of the preferred stock has a significant bearing on the yield. Almost all preferreds yield more than the common stocks of the same companies, but depending on convertibility and other features, they might yield more or less than bonds. If your goal is to maximize income, then a nonconvertible preferred might be the appropriate choice. Preferred shares are often easier for a small investor to buy than are bonds. **********As to the question of vulnerability, a study by Moody's Investors Service last year found there was virtually no chance of a preferred stock rated in the top two categories \u2014 aaa and aa \u2014 skipping a dividend in the coming 12-month period. **********- **********Two questions arise from this response: **********Firstly, we cannot find a list of preferred stocks available. If we have the name of one, we can get a rating from Moody's or S & P. But a list \u2014 no way. Secondly, you say it is easier for a small investor to buy a preferred stock than a bond. Our experience is the opposite. Neither banker nor broker can take these matters further for us. **********Obtaining an exhaustive list of preferreds would be difficult, but you can see a lot of them in the Trib's daily stock tables. They follow the common shares in the listings. **********Standard & Poor's Corp. has a monthly publication called the Stock Guide, which has information about preferred shares. Any convertible preferred is listed right after the issuer's common shares, and there are about 550 additional (nonconvertible) preferreds in a separate section in the back. The price for a one-year subscription is $158, although a recent issue might be found in a library or a brokerage house. **********A complete list of the preferred shares in the Standard & Poor's database could be generated for about $600. Most of these are U.S. shares, but there are some international preferreds with U.S. listings. **********As to purchases, any broker that can buy common stocks should be able to purchase preferreds listed on the same exchange. Charles Schwab & Co., for example, said any account-holder, including non-Americans, can buy preferred shares. **********- **********We have been receiving S&P's Stock Guide for a long time, but missed their section on preferreds. Looking through it, we found one with a triple-A rating: Gabelli Convertible Securities Fund 8.00 percent. We've been in touch with Gabelli for a prospectus and financial statements. One aspect that is unclear is the taxability of the dividends. **********I tend to prefer a straightforward investment in the preferred stock instead of a mutual fund, but the triple-A rating is a strong reason to go with them. **********- **********That is an unusual security, a preferred stock issued by a closed-end fund that specializes in convertible securities. The fund itself is unusual in that it switched from open-end status to closed-end, a format that is well-suited to the relatively low liquidity of convertibles. **********If you are looking for yield, the preferred is now offering about 7.6 percent, and Gabelli has two other closed-end preferreds, for its Equity Trust and Global Multimedia funds, which are currently yielding 7.1 percent and 7.6 percent. **********A Gabelli spokesman said the idea behind the preferreds was to give the funds some leverage, allowing them to put larger sums to work than if they just relied on their common-equity capital. Of course, if they make bad choices, the common shareholders would suffer disproportionately to the portfolio losses because the preferred shareholders would still get their dividends. **********For this structure to make sense, the fund must generate gains in excess of the 8 percent a year it pays to the preferred shareholders. So far, the convertibles fund has been able to do this; its total return since its July 1989 inception has been in the range of 10 percent, and its objective is to surpass long-term Treasury bond yields by six to eight percentage points, giving a current target of 11 to 13 percent. **********Since the basic portfolio includes preferred stocks, along with convertible bonds and some common shares, the common shares in the fund might be of interest to yield-conscious investors, but if you like the triple-a aspect of the preferreds, the payout is more than 2.5 percentage points above that on 30-year Treasury bonds. **********There may be a small tax break on the dividends. U.S. rules require that closed-end-fund preferred dividends contain the same ratio of long- and short-term capital gains as common payouts, Gabelli said. For an American taxpayer, the long-term portion would be taxable at a 20 percent rate, while the short-term and income portion would be taxable as income, possibly at a higher rate. The convertibles fund dividends usually contain fewer long-term capital distributions than the two other funds, Gabelli said, but the amounts vary from year to year. **********Your tax rate will depend on your citizenship, residence and whether you hold the securities in a tax-advantaged account. **********For further information: **********GABELLI FUNDS.

The plan also would reduce the number of Serbian troops in the province to 4,000 or 5,000 from 25,000. **********Armed with the proposal, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and other national security advisers met with key House leaders today to ask for ''acquiescence at the least'' that American ground troops take part in any peacekeeping force in Kosovo, Administration and Congressional officials said. **********One Administration argument is that the talks this weekend would have a far better chance of success if the Kosovo Albanians were assured that the United States, backed by Congress, would take part in a peacekeeping force. **********In the last few weeks of negotiations, according to Administration officials, the Kosovo Albanians made it clear that they would not trust a peacekeeping force that did not include Americans. ''That's one of the pots of gold they are looking for,'' one official said. **********Another Administration point is that there will be more violence in the spring if peace talks fail, and that an American refusal to send troops could block any agreement. **********''What if the United States abdicates its responsibility,'' one official asked, ''and then there are additional massacres?'' **********Senators began lobbying today on the question of deploying American troops and the outline of an eventual peace accord. **********''We have an investment and interest in stability in the Balkans,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, in support of sending American troops. **********''This is the 50th anniversary of NATO. Its primary purpose was to create stability in Europe, and what's happening in Kosovo is as great a threat as Bosnia because of interests in surrounding countries, stretching out ultimately to Greece and Turkey.'' **********Senator Lieberman joined two Republican Senators, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, at a news conference to make a plea for support to send troops. **********But other Senators questioned some of the assumptions in the draft plan. **********As described in the document, first reported today by The Financial Times in London, the current Kosovo Verification Mission would be empowered to oversee establishment of a new civilian government, with the backing of an armed international force to insure compliance. **********The thrust of the draft is to give Kosovo the highest degree of autonomy possible for the three-year duration of the plan. **********Within nine months a new assembly would be elected, which would then elect a president, who would in turn choose a prime minister. The assembly would pass new laws, new courts would be formed and municipal governments would have greater control over their areas. **********The 40-page document offers details on the rights of refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes, on a free press and on open access of international humanitarian groups to all areas, among other guarantees. **********But the draft is vague on the key issue of separating the warring parties -- Serbian troops and Albanian separatist guerrillas -- and imposing a cease-fire. The province has been racked by violence despite the cease-fire signed in October. **********Of its 25,000 troops in the province, Serbia would have to withdraw all but 2,500 members of its security forces and 1,500 of its army troops. There are about 2 million residents of Kosovo, of whom about 90 percent are ethnic Albanians. **********The plan is noticeably silent on how the Serbian forces would be removed. After the October agreement, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia did not adhere to the provision to reduce the troops in Kosovo, and even sent in more. Serbia is the overwhelmingly dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and sorting out Yugoslav and Serbian forces is often impossible. **********Under the plan, the paramilitary and rebel forces of the ethnic Albanians would be expected to disarm within three months, but the proposal does not specify how this would be accomplished. **********''This is the nub of the plan,'' said a former State Department official who read the draft. ''If you can get the Belgrade forces out of Kosovo to the minimal levels of a few hundred, then the rest of the tasks are relatively easy.'' **********Both Britain and France have said they will deploy troops in a NATO peacekeeping force in the event a settlement is reached. And Administration officials said they are optimistic that Congress will give initial approval for deploying American troops. **********But Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Gordon Smith of Oregon, both Republicans, sent a letter to President Clinton today saying they would oppose sending American troops if any Serbian police, army or paramilitary forces were allowed to stay in Kosovo."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/30/business/company-briefs-131962.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-12-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********SIPEX CORP., -- Billerica, Mass., a maker of integrated circuits, said it would cut jobs, close its Fremont, Calif., operations and reorganize its work force as a result of its $45 million purchase of the Calogic Corporation.

United team, may not be as well known as Mr. Neeson. But both men are stars in blockbuster high-technology features that have each earned well over $200 million. **********In Mr. Pope's case, though, the feature is not a big summer film like ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' but a best-selling video game: FIFA Soccer, currently the most popular title from Electronic Arts Inc., the world's largest maker of video games. Mr. Pope spent the day here in the company's new $3.2 million motion-capture studio in early August, going through his moves for the next version of the game. **********Thanks in part to technologies like motion capture, video games are expanding beyond their male teen-age stronghold into an increasingly mainstream form of entertainment. In fact, the $6.3 billion North American computer and video game industry is closing in on Hollywood box-office revenues, which reached $6.95 billion last year. **********''Entertainment is the 6,000-pound gorilla in the American home,'' said Nicholas Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a San Francisco market research firm. ''Motion capture is important because it adds more interesting experiences that will broaden the reach of the game industry.'' **********To improve the reality in virtual reality, producers of popular video games -- whether sports titles like FIFA Soccer and Activision's Jack Nicklaus game or fantasy shooter games like Eidos Interactive's Tomb Raider series -- have turned to human actors like Mr. Pope. Last year, for example, Westwood Studios used motion capture sequences from more than 100 actors for its video-game version of the movie ''Blade Runner,'' including many of the film's original cast members. **********And among the game makers, access to increasing computing power for both video games and PC's is touching off a new race toward realism. In this latest version of FIFA Soccer, for instance, the producers were able to increase the video speed to 26 frames a second for the Sony Playstation from 21 previously. In comparison, conventional television runs at 30 frames a second, while most movies are shown at 24 frames a second. **********''We're at the point where the visual resolution of our products will soon surpass television,'' said Don Mattrick, a software game pioneer who is now head of the Electronic Arts production studios. ''That will take our products into mainstream culture.'' **********Electronic Arts, which uses motion capture for more than a dozen sports titles and many of its other games, is seen as the leader in this field -- in aesthetics as well as in technology. **********''You have to put motion capture in a larger context,'' said Steve Eshkenazi, a veteran video game analyst who is now a partner at Walden Media and Information, a technology and media investment fund in San Francisco. ''Electronic Arts understands that it won't replace great game play, but they have developed the ability to create digital actors to enhance the game brands they have created.'' **********Although Electronic Arts is a Silicon Valley company, with headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., its production studio is in this suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, which is also home to a thriving film industry. It was here, in the early 1980's, that Mr. Mattrick founded Distinctive Software, one of the first PC game companies, which was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1985. **********Because much of the company's production talent was already based here, Electronic Arts built its new studio in Burnaby last year rather than ask its programmers and artists to move to San Mateo. Already, the company says, the Burnaby studio is the most productive and profitable of the dozen development studios the company has scattered among five countries. **********Capturing the raw material of FIFA Soccer resembles shooting a scene for an action film. Garbed in a black body suit dotted with silver reflective spheres the size of table tennis balls, Mr. Pope looks like an alien. On a 40-square-foot patch of real grass that has been laid in the studio for the day's shoot, he goes through his moves, performing headers and deeks  (soccer jargon for feints or fakes). Strobe lights pulse 240 times a second as 10 specially designed high-resolution cameras break Mr. Pope's fluid moves into digital snapshots. **********While he kicks soccer balls into a net, two programmers watch through the large window separating the studio from their control room as Mr. Pope's motion data stream into a row of Silicon Graphics work stations and other machines. **********On one monitor a small cluster of lights moves like a balletic constellation of stars, tracking the player's movements as an assistant tosses him a ball. Mr. Pope performs a slashing header, then falls and rolls on a cushioned mat. Next, imagining a winning goal scored, he springs up and bounds away in a celebratory run, arms spread like an airplane, as if ready to hug an unseen teammate. **********Almost immediately, the work station has translated this sequence into movements depicted by a three-dimensional stick figure that repeats the header, roll and victory dance -- the kinetic architectural framework on which computer graphics artists will build a video animation mimicking Mr. Pope's athleticism. **********All this comes from no more than 20 points of light on the screen, which have extracted the essence of his motion and given the stick figure dance a remarkably lifelike fluidity. The digital motion-capture files will now become the raw material for game designers whose job it is to extend the illusion by enhancing the skeletal renderings with flesh, clothing and facial expressions. **********''Your eye is remarkably sensitive to motion,'' said David Pierce, a special effects engineer who manages the studio. ''It creates a powerful illusion.'' **********Although motion capture technology was invented in the 1970's, it was not until the early 90's that the processing power of video game consoles began making it worth the cost and effort of recording human movements for games. Current consoles from Sony, Nintendo and Sega use 32-bit processors, and all three companies have faster 64-bit consoles in the wings. **********The Electronic Arts FIFA team is eagerly awaiting this next generation of machines, like the Sony Playstation II, which will be introduced in Japan later this year. On that machine, the number of polygons -- elements in the basic wire mesh used to create three-dimensional human figures available to programmers -- will exceed 10,000 for an individual figure, compared with 250 polygons a player on current consoles. With that level of resolution, programmers would be able to depict movement in a soccer player's hair as he or she runs. **********But even with the current generation of game consoles, Electronic Arts programmers are finding new ways to enhance the illusory effects. FIFA 2000, to be released in November, relies heavily on Mr. Pope's on-field movements, for example, but it also  exploits the more subliminal component of sound in an effort to make game players feel  that they are actually in a stadium watching a game in progress. **********By the time it is ready for release this fall, the new version will use the recorded words of 27 different announcers in nine languages speaking 85,000 scripted words. Different disks will be sold in different countries. **********The three programmers responsible for sound and music are seeking a leap in realism by using only complete prerecorded phrases; in the past, the game's announcers have sounded robotic as certain phrases are  patched together from a library of words. **********Moreover, the game will add predictive speech by the announcers -- phrases like ''waiting in the middle cross'' that anticipate the action -- as well as sentences indicating an awareness of earlier developments in the game. The number of goals a player has already scored, for example, might prompt the programmed announcer to say, ''Ah! He's made his hat trick!'' when the player scores a third one. **********The sound designers have also programmed in more crowd chants and various spectator sounds that will be more responsive to the game in progress.

Long regarded by leaders of the member countries and by the commissioners they appoint to five-year terms as a tame assembly of toothless, has-been politicos, the Parliament has been given increased legislative power in recent years and has repeatedly asserted its willingness to use that power. **********In January, a European Parliament investigation of reports of corruption and malfeasance by commission members led to a vote of censure, but it did not win a majority. **********Elected legislators had for years demanded greater accountability from the faceless ''bureaucrats in Brussels'' criticized over time by European leaders like Margaret Thatcher, who denounced their power when she was Prime Minister of Britain from 1979 to 1990. **********Under European Union rules, only the commission can propose European-wide legislation, and last year it proposed measures that the member states will debate later this month to change decision-making procedures and rein in expenditures in the European Union's $100 billion annual budget, almost half of which goes to agricultural price supports. **********Commissioners are also regularly denounced for issuing directives and decrees that range from regulating the permitted size of bananas to deciding whether unpasteurized milk can be used to make Camembert cheese. The commission also sits in on trade deliberations and consults with the European Central Bank that administers the new common European currency, the euro. **********Elected European leaders from Mrs. Thatcher to more Europe-friendly Government chiefs like the former Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl, have periodically railed against the perception of untrammeled power by the commission. **********So its members' unexpected demise at the hands of an independent five-member investigating committee set up after the unsuccessful parliamentary vote of censure last January will make the European Parliament election campaign this spring a crucial one. **********Mr. Santer, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was appointed by the leaders of member states in 1994 to a term that was to expire at the end of this year. Those leaders are scheduled to meet in Berlin in two weeks and could appoint a new commission then. The commission has 20 members: 2 each from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, and 1 from each other member country. **********The 140-page report by the five independent experts was shown to the commissioners on Monday evening before being released to the public. Earlier accounts said that it detailed cronyism and financial irregularities at the top of the European Union's executive branch. **********Though the charges seemed small stuff by Washington standards, they amounted to major scandal in Brussels. **********The report cited several commissioners for lax control over aid and other programs for which they were responsible, accusing them of putting friends and relatives on their payroll and pleading ignorance when asked why they did not act sooner to stop waste and fraud. **********The report said fraud and corruption passed ''unnoticed'' at the top of the institution that runs the European Union's day-to-day affairs, and dismissed the defense by some commissioners that they had been unaware of how bad things were. **********Edith Cresson, a former French Prime Minister who was the commissioner for Research, Education, Youth and Training, had been accused by members of the European Parliament of favoritism in hiring outside consultants, giving contracts to a dentist from her hometown and his son. **********''Should we only work with people we have never met?'' Mrs. Cresson responded when questioned about the propriety of those contracts. **********The subsequent independent report concluded: ''It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility.'' **********Pauline Green, of England, leader of the Socialist group in the European Parliament, which sits in Strasbourg, France, and Brussels, spoke after the report was released of a ''collective responsibility for mismanagement.'' **********Wilfried Martens, a Belgian who is leader of the Christian Democrats in the Parliament, said European Union commissioners had lost control of management. **********The fraud report was harshest for Mrs. Cresson, who it said ''failed to act in response to known, serious and continuing irregularities over several years'' in educational and other programs for which she was responsible. It said when informed of fraud and waste in an outside contractor who squandered $160 million meant for a youth training program, she failed to stop it. **********She was also criticized for getting a short-term European Union research job in 1995 for a friend who was later judged to be unqualified. He was paid for 10 months but was allegedly sick for 9. **********The report condemned others for cronyism, too, The Associated Press reported from Brussels tonight. **********Regional Development Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies of Germany, and the commissioner for relations with developing nations. Joao de Deus Pinheiro of Portugal, put friends and relatives on the European payroll, the report said. **********It cited Development Commissioner Manuel Marin of Spain, for lax control over the running of an aid program for Mediterranean nations, for irregularities in hiring, and for doing too little too late to stop fraud in the European relief aid budget in the early 1990's. **********The report said there was no evidence that any commissioner ''was directly and personally involved'' in fraud. The commissioners, who are paid about $200,000 a year, had denied any wrongdoing. **********The report found no irregularities in the office of Mr. Santer, the commission's president. But it did express dismay he did not act sooner on allegations of fraud in security contracts for European Union buildings in Brussels dating back to 1993. **********The fraud report stemmed from testimony last December in the European Parliament by Paul van Buitenen, a Dutch auditor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/31/news/a-push-to-redefine-eurocorps-role.html": {"writer_name": "John Vinocur", "pub_date": "1999-05-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1264, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Push to Redefine Eurocorps Role", "print_headline": "A Push to Redefine Eurocorps Role", "body_text": " **********TOULOUSE, France\u2014                     Responding to what they said is Europe's incapacity to take independent military action on matters like Kosovo, France and Germany have announced their plan to remodel their Eurocorps unit into a rapid-reaction force within a new European Union defense role. **********Although there was no specific statement, it seemed clear from the announcement of the unit's creation that the French and Germans want it to be emblematic of a desire to achieve European capacity to operate autonomously from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its American command. **********Both countries called at the same time Saturday for a greater overall independent defense mission for the European Union, \"backed with the capacity of decision and action in crises,\" and said that a meeting of EU government leaders in Cologne next weekend would produce decisive steps toward that goal. It was expected that the meeting would result in a timetable for folding the Western European Union defense forum into the EU as its security body by the end of next year. **********President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who held two days of bilateral talks here, described the initiatives in epochal terms. For Mr. Chirac, they were historic; for Mr. Schroeder, the defense developments were as important as the creation of the EU's now-battered common currency. **********A joint declaration, issued by the French-German defense council, made reference to the support of NATO summit participants in April for an expanded European defense undertaking, and Mr. Chirac said that it was a continuation of the French-British defense initiative announced in December in St. Malo, France. The president also referred to the need for the creation in Brussels of an EU body that, much as NATO did, would work on security-policy matters. **********But the thrust of the leaders' decisions raised the question, magnified by the Kosovo events and the timing of the announcement, of how much distance from NATO each of the countries wanted to achieve. There were obvious contradictions. **********As recently as last week, an aide to Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France described Germany as indecisive on developing a real European defense capability. And enthusiastic as he appeared here, Mr. Schroeder did not address the issue of creating a rapid-response force for Europe, meant to operate outside traditional German notions of self-defense, at a time when Germany has ruled out participation in a possible ground offensive in Kosovo for political, historical and constitutional reasons. **********Using the language that France frequently employs when it wants to underscore its charges of American domination of events and the unilateral nature of American policy making, Mr. Chirac said at a news conference that Europe's growing defense identity will make \"an essential contribution to a multipolar world to which France is profoundly attached.\" **********There was no mention in the joint declaration of how the redesigned Eurocorps would complement or relate to NATO's rapid-reaction force. Rather it stressed that \"these forces in waiting\" would be a contribution to the United Nations and the Security Council as \"it assumes the prime responsibility for peace and international security.\" **********The two leaders emphasized that the Kosovo situation had shown how existing European defense provisions were not adapted to current threats, with Mr. Chirac pointing out that they were essentially defensive. Mr., Schroeder said, \"We want and we must have a crisis reaction corps.\" **********\"We are convinced,\" the defense council statement said, \"that the new strategic environment must lead us with our three other partners in the Eurocorps to adapt this multinational unit, with priority for its command staff, to constitute a European rapid reaction force in the future.\" **********The other three are Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain. **********As it now stands, the Eurocorps, operative since 1993, has 60,000 troops earmarked to call on, with the essential component located in French and German armored units. The command, led by a Belgian general with a Spanish second-in-command, is headquartered in Strasbourg. A Eurocorps unit was active in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but changing the corps' mission, which would involve the redesignation of units and the acquisition of equipment, would probably be complicated and expensive. **********The Kosovo conflict, with the United States providing perhaps three-quarters of the aircraft and flying the vast majority of the missions, has emphasized the West European countries' limited margins for maneuver in military terms. **********The goal of integrating the WEU's capacities into the European Union was adopted by the EU in 1997. According to a German official, details for the process are to be approved in Cologne and completed in the latter half of 2000, when France holds the EU's rotating presidency. **********Whatever the apparent unity of tone at the meeting here, France has generally regarded Germany over the years as unwilling to undertake any European defense initiative that could be regarded by the United States as working at cross-purposes with NATO."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/19/business/international-business-lawsuits-are-prompting-calls-for-changes-clause-nafta.html": {"writer_name": "Timothy Pritchard", "pub_date": "1999-06-19", "snippet": "Suit by Methanex Corp, Canadian fuel additive maker, against United States focuses attention on possible need to rewrite North American Free Trade Agreement clause that lets companies sue US, Canada or Mexico if export opportunities are lost for r...", "word_count": 456, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lawsuits Are Prompting Calls for Changes to Clause in Nafta", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Lawsuits Are Prompting Calls for Changes to Clause in Nafta", "body_text": " **********A $970 million lawsuit against the United States Government by a Canadian fuel additive manufacturer has focused attention on a clause in the North American Free Trade Agreement that trade experts say may have to be rewritten. **********Chapter 11, as the clause of Nafta is known, allows companies to sue the Governments of the United States, Canada or Mexico if export opportunities are lost for reasons that have nothing to do with normal commerce. **********The Methanex Corporation of Vancouver, British Columbia, said Wednesday that it was seeking damages because California had banned imports of a gasoline additive called methyl tertiary butyl ether or M.T.B.E., which has been leaking into the West Coast water supply. **********This is only the second action to be filed against Washington in the five years Nafta has been in force.

A week ago, the yield on the 30-year bond jumped to an 18-month high of 6.16 percent as investors thought that two -- or even three -- rate increases were possible. By Friday, the yield had tumbled back below 6 percent, to 5.97 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished the week up 3.8 percent. **********While investors may be relieved, what the Fed will do after policy makers meet on June 30 -- when they are almost certain to raise their short-term interest rate target a quarter of a percentage point -- is still up in the air. **********And the spreads between yields on Treasury securities and corporate bonds, junk bonds and emerging-markets debt are still wide enough to indicate that some investors see the risk of near-term turmoil. **********Mr. Greenspan signaled a rate increase when he told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that ''when we can be pre-emptive we should be, because modest pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions at a later date that could destabilize the economy.'' **********Investors took their cues from ''modest'' and ''more drastic action'' and concluded that one rate increase might be enough. **********But Mr. Greenspan sent other signals that can be interpreted to mean rate increases will go as far as needed to assure that economic growth slows to around a 3 percent rate. **********Specifically, he said the 4 percent average annual growth of the last four years was based on a two percentage-point increase in worker productivity and a one percentage-point increase in the working-age population. The remaining point, he said, came from the shrinking of the pool of job seekers without work. **********That last development ''represents an unsustainable trend,'' Mr. Greenspan said.  Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, said Mr. Greenspan has set a speed limit because he does not want a further decline in the unemployment rate. If that happens, Mr. Greenspan faces the inflationary wage increases that the Fed is determined to avoid. **********''A bull would say, 'I think the economy will slow down pretty much on its own, so we are fine,' '' Mr. Barbera said. ''A bear would say, 'Greenspan told us rates are going up until the economy slows down.' '' **********STILL, the worst may be over for the average investor, who should look beyond that uncertainty. If the Fed does what is expected -- and there is no good reason to think that it won't -- then the outlook for both bonds and stocks is positive over the longer term. And market timing is not a game that smaller investors -- with long-term goals -- should play in any case. **********The immediate market reaction to rate increases often ignores the long-term perspective. ''The knee-jerk reaction -- one never knows. It can be bad,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman Sachs & Company. ''What matters is what happens after that.'' After the necessary rate increase -- she is not predicting how many will be needed to slow growth -- she expects the market outlook to improve, helped by what she believes will be good second-quarter earnings reports. The second quarter, Ms. Cohen added, might even be strong enough to make her increase her corporate earnings forecast, which is now 7 to 8 percent growth this year and next. **********That means investors can consider picking up some bonds on the assumption that they will rally as rates fall -- in the second half of the year ---- in the wake of a Fed success. And sticking with stocks looks O.K.,  too, as good earnings reports should be even a better bet in the third and fourth quarters as the comparisons to 1998 get easier. **********The Fed, Ms. Cohen said, ''can do this in a way that does not harm the economy.'' As she did with the one-quarter-point rate increase in March 1997, Ms. Cohen is calling this a ''flu shot.'' Yes, it hurts. But it staves off something worse."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/business/the-markets-late-season-spurt-helps-shares-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-07-01", "snippet": "Statistically, spring quarter was another banner period for stocks, as main gauges all climbed between 5 and 12 percent, shattering records along the way; charts on stock leaders and laggards in second quarter on major American stock exchanges (M)", "word_count": 725, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Late-Season Spurt Helps Shares in Quarter", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Late-Season Spurt Helps Shares in Quarter", "body_text": " **********Statistically, the spring quarter was another banner period for stocks, as the main gauges all climbed between 5 and 12 percent, shattering records along the way. **********But the gains, capped by yesterday's surge after the Federal Reserve chose the mildest of expected options on monetary policy, raising rates a quarter of a percentage point, masked unusual market turmoil. **********The Nasdaq market, where high-technology issues dominate, tumbled below its March 31 level each of the three months in the second quarter before ending at a new peak. **********Its gyrations included gut-wrenching declines in many of the most prominent Internet stocks and coincided with a steady rise in interest rates that pushed yields up one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point across the board. **********But while many of these onetime highfliers remained far below their peaks -- Amazon.com, for example, skidded to $125.125 from $172.1875 --  the Nasdaq market as a whole finished the quarter ahead 9.1 percent, with more than half of this gain in the final three days. **********''The main theme was the rebound in technology,'' said Robert J. Froehlich, vice chairman of Kemper Funds, noting that stocks trading at high multiples of annual earnings are particularly vulnerable to rising interest rates. ''That should be bad news for tech, but these things rallied right in the face of it.'' **********Earlier in the quarter, however, rising rates took a heavy toll on both established growth stocks and more speculative ones, as many investors shifted money into stocks of companies tied to the economic cycle. Their reasoning was that the economy was growing so fast that these laggards might finally get some leverage to raise product prices. **********''There was this turbocharged rotation out of the high price-earnings growth stocks and into the lagging cyclicals,'' said Charles J. Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S. G. Cowen Securities. **********Pfizer, for example, skidded from a high of $150.125 in mid-April, to $95.125 in mid-June, while Alcoa rallied from a low of $40.75 in early April, to as high as $67.9375 in mid-June. The differential between the drug company's percentage loss and the aluminum company's percentage gain was more than 100 percent, a stunning gap that Mr. Pradilla said was no doubt far greater than any plausible change in economic conditions. By the end of the quarter Pfizer was up to $109 and Alcoa down to $61.875. **********Indeed, as the quarter ended many  cyclicals were fading, perhaps having benefited more from a lack of other places to put money that had come out of growth stocks than from a conviction that pricing-power inflation might be on its way. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is skewed toward big growth companies, finished the quarter with a 6.7 percent gain, surpassing its 4.6 percent first-quarter gain. This means that if the second half of the year is as good as the first half, this index, so widely used as a benchmark, will  once again confound forecasters and advance more than 20 percent for a fifth straight year. **********The Dow Jones industrial average posted the best performance of the three major gauges, rising 12.1 percent but failing by the narrowest of margins, one-tenth of 1 percent, to regain enough ground to end the quarter above its record, 11,107.19 set on May 13. **********Significant amounts of the money that was switched into cyclicals in the quarter went into smaller-company shares, with some value-oriented portfolio managers declaring that this long-neglected sector might finally be getting its due. Indeed, the Russell 2000, the most widely cited index for this group, gained a hefty 15.1 percent in the quarter. **********But there was a growing view as the quarter ended that the Federal Reserve would one way or another make sure that the economy's 4 percent growth rate was throttled back. A slowing economy is a poor climate for small companies. **********Besides the Internet casualties in the quarter -- America Online, for example, ended 35 percent lower than its April 6 peak of $175.50 -- the drug group took a heavy hit. **********McKesson-HBOC slumped 52.3 percent; Pfizer, 24.4 percent; Amgen, 20 percent; Eli Lilly, 19.9 percent, and Merck, 10.8 percent as talks heated on proposals that could involve Federal price controls on prescriptions. **********The top winners in the S.& P. 500 had the following gains in the quarter: National Semiconductor, 168.5 percent; Nalco Chemical, 94.8 percent; Case, 92.1 percent; Millipore, 62.7 percent; Raychem, 60.7 percent, and Cummins Engine, 60.5 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/08/business/worldbusiness/IHT-lazard-to-consolidate-its-3-global-operations.html": {"writer_name": "Tom Buerkle", "pub_date": "1999-06-08", "snippet": "Lazard Partners announced Monday that it would bow to the forces of globalization and unify its London, Paris and New York investment banks into a single partnership to compete better with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley D...", "word_count": 4268, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lazard to Consolidate Its 3 Global Operations", "print_headline": "Lazard to Consolidate Its 3 Global Operations", "body_text": " **********Lazard Partners announced Monday that it would bow to the forces of globalization and unify its London, Paris and New York investment banks into a single partnership to compete better with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. **********The move will bring an end to one of the oldest and most unusual structures in international finance, which has linked the Lazard Freres partnerships in the United States and France with the British limited company, Lazard Brothers & Co., since 1929. **********The spread of the business gave the houses of Lazard an international focus long before most of its American rivals, but the continued presence of three separate structures and profit centers has become a handicap for further growth. **********Now, after an unprecedented surge in international merger activity in recent years, the bank is effectively following the advice it has been dishing out to corporate clients by integrating itself to provide a single image and seamless service around the globe. **********The unification of the three arms was \"the only conceivable way forward,\" said Michel David-Weill, who succeeded his father as head of Lazard Freres & Cie. in Paris in 1975 and led the effort to integrate the three affiliates. \"Fragmentation is simply not a possibility.\" **********But integration is not a prelude to flotation. Goldman Sachs' recent move to end its partnership and go public has merely \"reinforced our belief in maintaining our partnership,\" Mr. David-Weill said. **********The firm will keep its activities focused tightly on corporate finance and asset management, he said, adding that it did not need to expand its capital base, which at around $500 million is a small fraction of the billions deployed by the publicly traded investment banks. **********Lazard has remained remarkably successful for its size, a testament to the skill of its bankers and the richness of its corporate contacts. As a group, the affiliates rank as the No. 6 adviser on international mergers and acquisitions so far this year, working on 47 deals with a total value of $133 billion, according to Securities Data Corp. But that volume lags well behind those of the five leaders, which are led by Goldman Sachs with deals worth $499 billion **********\"You're seeing an increasing proportion of M&A going to the top few firms, and they want to put themselves in that arena,\" said one New York banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********Lazard has worked hard to improve collaboration between its three arms, an effort that paid off this year when it advised on TRW Inc.'s $6.6 billion acquisition of the British auto-parts maker LucasVarity PLC. But the continued existence of three separate operations still could lead bankers to concentrate more on their own profit center than on the cross-border needs of clients, Mr. David-Weill said. **********\"What we need is to get the right people in the right place at the right time, without impediments,\" he said. **********The integration, which should take four to five months to complete, will unify the three arms under a seven-person executive committee headed by Mr. David-Weill. **********Steven Rattner, deputy chief executive of Lazard Freres in New York, will move to the post of deputy chairman while William Loomis takes over as deputy chief executive. **********Compensation across the firm will come from a single profit pool, but there will be no single headquarters. **********\"We're going to run this place like a partnership,\" Mr. David-Weill said. \"We're not going to run this like General Motors.\" **********The restructuring does not require that Pearson PLC divest of its stake in Lazard Partners, he said, although speculation about a sale has persisted recently because of efforts by the British publishing company's chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, to sell off peripheral businesses. **********Lazard increased the sharing of profits among its three banks in 1996 in an attempt to strengthen integration, and it 1997 it merged its New York, London and Tokyo asset management businesses. **********But the changes have been followed by some high-level defections, including the exit of John Nelson, vice chairman of Lazard in London, who moved to Credit Suisse First Boston in October."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/04/technology/news-watch-sony-says-new-playstation-might-even-show-movies.html": {"writer_name": "Matt Richtel", "pub_date": "1999-03-04", "snippet": "Sony Corp announces plans for the next generation of Playstation, which will be released in early 2000. says graphics will come to life and that 3-D images will pop off the screen of the new console; new unit will have 300-megahertz, 128-bit proce...", "word_count": 185, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sony Says New Playstation Might Even Show Movies", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Sony Says New Playstation Might Even Show Movies", "body_text": " **********With much fanfare, Sony this week announced its plans for the next generation of Playstation, which will be released in early 2000.

It also includes dozens of new tax credits and other subsidies. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, mockingly declares ''the era of Big Government is back'' three years after Mr. Clinton declared it over. **********But charges of extravagance are unconvincing. Even if Congress passed Mr. Clinton's entire plan, the relative size of the Federal Government would continue to shrink, budget analysts point out. Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization, estimates Government spending, while continuing to grow modestly in absolute dollars, will fall by 2004 to about 18.5 percent of total economic output.  That level, down from 19.7 percent today, would be the lowest in 34 years. **********Nonmilitary discretionary spending -- the part of the budget that excludes Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security but includes nearly everything else outside the Pentagon, from the F.B.I. to basic research -- would fall by 2004 to 3.1 percent of economic output, the lowest level in at least four decades. Besides, the fundamental feature of this budget is its fiscal prudence; it uses trillions of dollars of surplus revenue to drive down Federal debt rather than spend it immediately or give it away in across-the-board tax cuts. **********Still, simply because overall spending levels would hardly budge does not mean that Mr. Clinton can so easily escape the serious charge that his shotgun approach to spending and tax incentives is missing the target. The proposed budget sprinkles new spending across a huge array of programs, hardly missing a constituency or Congressional district. Rather than concentrating the scarce funds and doing a few things well, the Administration has chosen instead to do dozens of things on a small scale, says C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, in a way that amounts to ''budget patches.'' **********Mr. Clinton proposes to spend about $17 billion more next year on discretionary programs than current budget rules anticipate. The litter of initiatives is breathtaking: $600 million on community learning centers and after-school programs here, about $600 million to integrate technology into classrooms there, $2 billion for states to protect water quality, $50 million to demolish blighted buildings, and on and on with a host of undoubtedly worthy projects. **********Indeed, some of the initiatives, such as reinstating food-stamp and Medicaid benefits to recent immigrants, are widely praised, especially by Democrats. The National Science Foundation gets a sizable boost, as does an effective tax credit for building housing for low-income families. But Rudolph Penner of the Urban Institute takes a look at the panoply of new spending programs and asks, ''Where's the theme?'' **********Gary Bass of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal advocacy group, would have preferred that Mr. Clinton focus the $17 billion of extra spending on a few programs aimed at the needy. Research shows that the most effective way to prepare workers for the future is to educate them when they are young. Mr. Clinton's Administration understands this, and his budget would put $600 million more into Head Start, the effective preschool program, and other education and training initiatives. But the investments fall far short of enrolling every eligible child. **********Imagine a budget that used the $17 billion to tackle two or three pressing needs. For example, there are millions of families qualifying for subsidized rental housing, but there are no vouchers for them. The White House proposes to create another 100,000 vouchers, a large increase by historical standards but not nearly enough to meet the need. Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, supports the fiscal prudence of the overall budget, but would prefer piling up more of the available money for training elementary and secondary teachers. **********Critics also accuse the Administration of cluttering the tax code with dozens of new credits and subsidies, declaring an end, if not to Big Government, at least to an era of tax simplification that culminated in the estimable Tax Reform Act of 1986. The White House proposes, among pages upon pages, a $1,000 long-term-care tax credit, a $1,000 credit to offset expenses of disabled workers, a credit for small businesses that join coalitions to purchase health insurance and a credit for parents who stay home to care for a newborn. **********Most of these tax credits are too small to do much good. Take the credit for caring for the chronically ill. It almost entirely excludes the poor, who do not pay taxes and cannot take advantage of a tax credit. It provides, compared with the annual costs of $60,000 or more, small relief to middle-class families. Is this the most effective use of the limited money Mr. Clinton carves out for new initiatives? **********Besides making the tax code bewilderingly complex, the layering of credits creates other problems. Each credit, to avoid unduly running up costs and benefiting the rich, must be phased out as family incomes rise. So each credit that is phased out amounts to a tax on work. **********There are reasons the Administration backed into nit-picking tactics. Congress has imposed tight caps on discretionary spending, virtually forcing Mr. Clinton to tackle problems with tax subsidies. Lacking the will to go after waste that riddles discretionary spending and the political muscle to eliminate the caps and start fresh, Mr. Clinton resorted to doling out spoonfuls of money where shovels were needed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/world/over-the-summit-2-clouds-chechnya-and-earthquake.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1999-11-18", "snippet": "Raging war in breakaway Russian province of Chechnya and recent series of earthquakes in Turkey hang over summit of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Istanbul, Turkey (M)", "word_count": 759, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Over the Summit, 2 Clouds: Chechnya and Earthquake", "print_headline": "Over the Summit, 2 Clouds: Chechnya and Earthquake", "body_text": " **********Two specters hang over the summit meeting that is bringing more than 50 world leaders to Istanbul this week. **********One is the war raging in Chechnya, where Russia's campaign to crush a separatist rebellion has prompted sharp Western criticism of the devastating impact on civilians. **********The conflict hangs like a dark cloud over the summit meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which starts Thursday.

''The O.S.C.E. prefers to hold a celebration,'' he said, ''but it should come to act.'' **********While political instability in Chechnya is an issue the summit leaders cannot avoid, geological instability beneath Turkey's soil is on the minds of more than a few delegates. This part of the world has been shaken by a series of earthquakes over the last three months, including one in August that killed more than 17,000 people and another last Friday that killed more than 500. And seismologists agree that a major quake is likely to hit Istanbul -- tomorrow, or several decades from now. **********Seeking to calm fears that the big quake may be imminent, the country's most prominent seismologist, Ahmet Mete Isikara, urged Turks and delegates to the meeting: ''Don't believe ill-intentioned rumors.

''He's the reason everyone else is coming,'' said one European diplomat. **********Whatever is accomplished here will likely be achieved on the margin of the summit talks. **********Mr. Clinton has already won one victory by exerting behind-the-scenes pressure that led leaders of the Turks and Greeks on the divided island of Cyprus to agree to indirect talks in New York next month. **********Among the many other sessions that will be held around Istanbul will be one between Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece and his Turkish counterpart, Bulent Ecevit. Both have said they are eager to end the hostility that his divided their countries for generations. **********While in Istanbul, Mr. Clinton is scheduled to hold separate meetings with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. He hopes to prod them toward settling their bitter dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which the world recognizes as part of Azerbaijan but which is occupied by ethnic Armenian fighters. **********He is also expected to urge European leaders to support Turkey's effort to become an official candidate for membership in the European Union.

Eventually, Ford relented, trimming its request to about six people. **********For banks, insurers and companies like Ford, the mounting wave of Holocaust-related lawsuits has created both a litigation and public-relations nightmare. But the lawsuits have also created a mini-boom for one unlikely group, historians and research specialists. **********''You have to think in terms of corporate memories,'' Mr. Bradsher said. ''There is probably no one around who knows anything about this stuff, and for many of them these lawsuits are hitting them out of the blue.'' **********As a result, a growing number of corporations, from Ford to General Motors to Bertelsmann, have hired well-known academics to write their wartime histories or scour ancient file rooms worldwide for damaging or exculpatory information. At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements, potential public embarrassment, and even business complications. And often the race is simply for companies to find disquieting information before their adversaries do. **********And the disclosures can be unsettling. Deutsche Bank said recently that independent historians it had hired had found records confirming that the bank had helped finance the building of the Auschwitz death camp. **********Other companies have contracted out research to small companies that use graduate students and others to pore over dusty records at repositories like the National Archives. Plaintiffs' lawyers have also assembled competing teams of historical experts, including some with far darker views of corporate behavior than researchers hired by companies. **********The rush by companies to hire historians has also touched off an ethical debate in academic circles, including an exchange of fire between opposing groups in journals like The Times Literary Supplement. **********In a recent article, Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, a professor at Brunel University in England, asserted that companies that hired academics to investigate their Nazi-era ties either tried to hamstring historians or retained researchers who viewed corporate wartime transgressions as unavoidable. **********''Among certain corporate historians, there is an ideology that corporations are unfairly maligned and that they are less powerful than they are made out to be,'' Mr. Pinto-Duschinsky said in a recent telephone interview. **********But academics hired by companies to investigate their wartime roles insist they are given the freedom and resources to seek out the truth. Saul Friedlander, a history professor at the University of Tel Aviv, said he was approached recently by officials of Bertelsmann, the German publishing company, after an article in a Swiss magazine that accused the company of, among other things, publishing pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic books in the Nazi years. **********Mr. Friedlander said he insisted before taking the job that Bertelsmann give him and fellow researchers unfettered access to its archives and that it forgo control over the fruits of that research. Within 30 minutes, Mr. Friedlander said he received a fax from Thomas Middelhoff, the company's chairman, agreeing to those terms. **********''He gave me the strong feeling that he wanted this whole thing cleaned up in every detail,'' said Mr. Friedlander, who also teaches at the University of California at Los Angeles. **********The recent demand for World War II research began several years ago, when Swiss banks were accused of keeping assets deposited before the Holocaust by Jews and others who were later killed by the Nazis. The World Jewish Congress hired young researchers like Miriam Kleiman to review Nazi-era documents at the National Archives. **********''I was between jobs, and I had free time,'' Ms. Kleiman said. **********But as the pace of Holocaust litigation intensified, the stakes quickly rose. Ms. Kleiman was soon lured away by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll, a class-action law firm in Washington that has filed many Holocaust-related lawsuits. And while some researchers at the National Archives still wear blue jeans, it is not uncommon these days to spot corporate researchers wearing suits and gold cuff links. **********''Some of those people have limousines picking them up,'' Ms. Kleiman said. **********With Holocaust legal battles being fought in the forum of public opinion, the type of corporate firepower brought to bear on this peculiar paper chase can be awesome. Soon after being sued in March, Ford assembled two research teams with a total of 40 to 50 people, said Jon Spelich, a Ford spokesman. They quickly hit document rooms at the company as well as at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., where pre-1950 documents were kept. **********Next, the company turned to the National Archives, which keeps its Holocaust-era records in College Park, Md. For that task, it also contracted with companies like History Associates, a small concern in Rockville, Md., that hires historians and graduate students to prowl through Government record rooms. Over the last nine months, Ford research teams have also hunted through World War II archives in Britain, Germany and other countries, Mr. Spelich said. **********He said the goal was to see if any documents existed that undercut Ford's position that it lost complete control over its Germany subsidiary, Ford Werke, before the United States entered the war. Thus far, Mr. Spelich said the only new discovery is a $60,000 dividend payment by Ford Werke to Ford. **********''We said that we were going to dive into archives to see if there is anything that had been missed over the years,'' Mr. Spelich said. **********Not only has Ford retained professors like Simon Reich of the University of Pittsburgh, but Mr. Spelich said it would soon announce the hiring of yet another academic to examine whether the company's research methodologies are up to snuff. **********But Ford is by no means alone in its quest for academic all-stars. General Motors recently hired Henry A. Turner, a professor of history at Yale University, to investigate the activities of its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, during the Nazi era. And Degussa A.G., a German-based company accused of profiting from gold looted from Holocaust victims, has retained Peter Hayes, a professor at Northwestern University, to research its past. **********Lawyers suing companies over World War II-era claims are also assembling their own crews of historical experts, including some who have investigated the darker part of corporate behavior in the Nazi years. **********Ms. Kleiman's law firm, for example, worked with a Dutch professor, Cees Wiebes, the co-author of a book about how relatives of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews from death camps, hid ties between the family's banking business and the Nazis. And not surprisingly, the debate over industry's wartime role has brought some old adversaries into collision. **********Consider the case of Bradford Snell, who as a young Government lawyer in 1974 helped begin a Senate subcommittee investigation of possible collaboration between both Ford and G.M. and the Nazis. **********Ever since, Mr. Snell, who has been working the last two decades on a history of G.M., has been a corporate gadfly. His research was used in a television documentary shown recently that depicted how G.M. worked to undermine municipal trolley car and rail systems to pump up motor vehicle sales. And with the Holocaust lawsuits, he is the object of renewed attention. **********Several months ago, he said, he received a call from a class-action firm in New York involved in Holocaust lawsuits asking if he would work with them. And Mr. Turner, the Yale University professor hired by G.M., has also written to him. **********Mr. Snell said he was holding off working for plaintiffs' lawyers until his book was finished but there is little doubt about where his sympathies lie. ''I'm trying to write a history of General Motors,'' he said, ''and they don't want this one written.'' **********Whether the new gleanings of corporate files and archives reveals new revelations about the Holocaust remains to be seen. Some critics like Mr. Pinto-Duschinsky say the undertaking is little more than an exercise in public relations. **********Not long ago, for example, one small Swiss company that thought it might attract attention because it, by coincidence, had the same name as a leading Swiss Nazi sent a researcher to the National Archives to see if company officials had done anything wrong during World War II, said Mr. Bradsher, the archivist. **********It came up with a clean bill of health, but many other companies might not be so lucky. **********''If I was the general counsel for one of these companies,'' Mr. Bradsher said, ''I would be looking to find everything I could.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/25/business/business-digest-496952.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-02-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 535, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********U.S. Leads Defeat of Pact On Genetically Altered Food **********Attempts to forge the world's first global treaty to regulate trade in genetically modified products failed when the United States and five other big agricultural exporters rejected a proposal that had the support of the rest of the roughly 130 nations at the talks. **********The treaty's supporters said it would reduce the risk of harmful effects from introducing genes of different species into plants, animals or microorganisms.

The company is expected to report its 13th consecutive year of record profit, according to Tetsuya Furumoto, a small-capitalization analyst at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd. **********The story behind Yonkyu is simple. Declining wild fish populations are cutting into domestic production and imports are limited by increased attention to managing international fisheries. That leaves farming, and Yonkyu is one of the few dealers of cultivated fish that are incorporated and have modern management skills in an industry dominated by regional cooperatives. **********\"We do not see any noticeable competitor,\" for Yonkyu, Mr. Furumoto said, adding that he thought the 5 percent market share for cultivated fish in Japan would expand. **********Yonkyu deals in cultured fish such as yellowtail, sea bream and kanpachi, a fish unique to Asia, which are often made into sushi and sashimi, Japanese favorites. **********Yonkyu is engaged in fish incubation and sales of feed, segments that are earning it fat margins, while avoiding cultivation of fish itself, a difficult business with risks from disease and fluctuating market prices. **********Mr. Furumoto said he expected Yonkyu to record profit of 1.6 billion yen in the current financial year, up 28 percent from last year.

Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, who has used much of his wealth to build a cable media empire, is set to take his cable company public. **********Eager to take advantage of Wall Street's enthusiasm for cable, the company, Charter Communications Inc., filed a prospectus yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise about $3.4 billion in a public offering. It said it would use the funds to finance part of the purchase of a handful of pending cable acquisitions. **********According to the prospectus, Mr. Allen plans to keep voting control of the parent company. **********Not only is Mr. Allen looking to the public for financing; he will personally invest $750 million in a Charter subsidiary, Charter Holdings Inc., paying the same price for his shares in the unit that investors pay for their shares in the parent company. **********Mr. Allen has aggressively built the nation's fourth-largest cable company. After the pending purchases, it will have 6.2 million subscribers, primarily in St. Louis, Los Angeles and Greenville-Spartenburg, S.C. Charter also has systems that are heavily concentrated in Wisconsin and Michigan. **********Had all the purchases been completed at the end of 1998, the offering memorandum shows, the new company would have had 1998 revenues of $2.67 billion and a net loss of $342.5 million. **********The cable industry generally measures financial health by cash flow, and Charter's 1999 pro forma cash flow would have been $1.2 billion, giving it a cash flow margin of 45.1 percent, roughly the industry norm. **********After the public offering, however, the company would have long-term debt of $10.4 billion. **********One Wall Street analyst, whose firm is not involved in the transaction, noted that even if 1999 cash flow grew a healthy 10 percent, to $1.3 billion this year, debt would be almost eight times cash flow. ''That appears to be at the high end of the range of what exists in the industry,'' the analyst said. ''Over the last several years, the ratio has been between three and seven, so it would be more highly leveraged, which introduces a higher level of risk.'' **********That could have ramifications for the company's debt ratings, the analyst added. **********On the other hand, the internal growth rate for new subscribers was 4.8 percent last year, more than twice the national industry average of 1.7 percent, the prospectus stated. The analyst said that such healthy growth rates to some degree offset the high debt because the company is showing the ability to keep increasing cash flow. **********Charter said it was using the proceeds of the offering to pay for three pending cable acquisitions: Falcon Communications L.P. of Los Angeles, Avalon Cable Television and the cable systems of Fanch Communications Inc.. **********The combined value of the three purchases is about $6.8 billion. Charter had agreed to pay roughly $3.6 billion for Falcon and $885 million for Avalon and $2.4 billion for Fanch. **********The prospectus stated that funds not spent on pending acquisitions would be used either to reduce debt or to make additional purchases. It also said the company was assuming that it would be able to raise an additional $1.1 billion toward the purchase price of yet another pending acquisition, the Bresnan Communications Company. **********Mr. Allen and his team are betting that digital cable television, interactive video programming, high-speed Internet access and local phone service will increase cash flow from Charter's subscribers. **********Underwriters for the pending initial public offering are Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Bear, Stearns, and Goldman, Sachs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/business/many-steps-to-go-before-china-can-become-a-full-member.html": {"writer_name": "Elizabeth Olson", "pub_date": "1999-11-16", "snippet": "World Trade Organization director general Mike Moore cautions that several steps remain before China can become full member of organization; bilateral agreements must be concluded with other WTO member nations, most significantly European Union; C...", "word_count": 423, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Many Steps to Go Before China Can Become a Full Member", "print_headline": "Many Steps to Go Before China Can Become a Full Member", "body_text": " **********While welcoming the accord clearing the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Mike Moore, the director general, cautioned today that several steps remained before the country could become a full member. **********''China must still reach agreement with other member governments and we need to complete important technical talks before China can take her rightful place at the table of great trading nations,'' Mr. Moore said. **********He said that because of the substantial work involved, a meeting of the working party on China's accession would not be convened until after the Seattle summit meeting.

The Government put in place by the West is frozen and inactive. In Montenegro, a President who has won backing from Washington and other foreign capitals is devoting all his energies to averting a coup backed by the army of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. **********Macedonia, already coping with hundreds of thousands of Kosovo refugees, is worried about tens of thousands more arriving, and Croatia's tourist-dependent economy faces a bleak summer of empty hotels and beaches. **********For involved foreigners and locals, the real fear is that prolonged NATO bombing of the Serbs will reopen all the wounds still festering from the Balkan wars of this past decade. **********''The security situation is stable, but the longer the bombing goes on the more difficult it will be to control the situation,'' said Lieut. Gen. Mike Wilcocks, a British officer who is the deputy commander of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia, the NATO-led peacekeepers known here by the acronym SFOR. ''We are watching the situation like a hawk.'' **********In Bosnia and Montenegro, the best face that diplomats or military officials have put on the Serbian fury stoked by three weeks of bombing is that they should be able to contain it until Mr. Milosevic is defeated. At that point, they suggest, prospects for democratic development in the region will soar. **********''If getting rid of Milosevic fails, then everything else fails,'' said Carlos Westendorp, the top international official charged with keeping peace in Bosnia. ''That is the condition we need for full development of the region, respect of borders and democracy.'' **********He and other Western officials concur, however, that the longer the bombing campaign continues, the more difficult it will be for peacekeeping forces in Bosnia to hold back Serbian radicals and for the elected government in Montenegro to escape a coup that could spark a civil war. **********The bombing has halted efforts to rebuild infrastructure or return Bosnians who fled the war to their old homes. Hundreds of Westerners have evacuated what is called Republika Srpska, as the Bosnian Serbs' 49 percent of Bosnia is known. Mr. Westendorp has ordered the elected Serb assembly not to hold any sessions until the Kosovo war is over. **********''What I am doing is freezing the situation,'' Mr. Westendorp, the high representative enforcing the 1995 Dayton peace accords, said here today. ''The hard-liners are constantly harassing the moderates. It would do a lot of harm to have the assembly meet.'' **********Next door, fears of a coup in Montenegro, a Yugoslav republic where the American Government is making significant diplomatic and financial investments, have paralyzed the economy while backing elected leaders into a corner. They are struggling to stop the Yugoslav Army from taking over the news media, conscripting senior officials in the republic and fomenting street violence. **********The bombing also scuttled a bid to improve relations between Montenegro and its neighbor, Croatia. **********According to a Western diplomat, Montenegro had been planning before the bombing to apologize to Croatia for Montenegrin forces that in 1991 and 1992 shelled the historic coastal city of Dubrovnik, the jewel of Croatia's Adriatic coastline and once a major tourist draw. **********While Croatia has supported the bombing of its old foe Serbia, the assaults appear to have shattered prospects for the country's tourist industry this year. Most summer hotel bookings up and down the Adriatic coast have been canceled, hotel owners said. **********In the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, too, there is widespread concern that the flood of refugees from Kosovo could destabilize a government that has been receptive to Western influence. **********The West has the most control where it has the most military muscle. That is in Bosnia, where peacekeepers from 37 countries, including 6,200 American troops, are heavily armed and have more than three years' experience dealing with the terrain and managing the anger of local Serbs. **********After the bombing began on March 24, General Wilcocks said he ordered a ban on the training and movement of local armies across Bosnia. SFOR troops have been ordered to wear body armor in the field at all times and not to travel in groups of less than three. **********In the week after the bombings began, there was a sharp increase in Serbian attacks on SFOR troops, including several incidents when hand grenades were thrown at soldiers from moving cars. General Wilcocks said no troops have been injured in the attacks. **********The general said in an interview that forces in Bosnia ''have nothing to do with NATO.'' But the credibility of that distinction, if it ever held much weight among Bosnian Serbs, took a severe blow on April 3, when SFOR troops, acting on orders from Washington, blew up a stretch of railroad that connects Belgrade with Montenegro. **********The tracks were destroyed in a stretch of the railroad that cuts across a tip of Bosnia. Western diplomats here said SFOR troops were ordered to take immediate action because of information that a trainload of armed Serbian paramilitary forces was headed to Montenegro to make trouble for the pro-Western government there. **********The destruction of the tracks, during which SFOR troops killed a local watchman who fired at them, gave Serbian nationalists in Bosnia a reason to argue that their country was being occupied by the same forces that are bombing Serbia. **********The NATO bombing, moreover, exacerbated an already severe political crisis in Republika Srpska. **********Earlier in March, Mr. Westendorp in effect fired the elected President of the Serbian republic, Nikola Poplasen, a radical Serbian nationalist who had refused for months to work with the government's moderate prime minister. **********On that same day, an arbitrator in Vienna denied the Serbs exclusive control of a city, Brcko, that connects two parts of their territory. Many Serbs regard the city as an essential link for the survival of their government inside Bosnia, a loosely federated country they share with the Muslim-Croat Federation that covers 51 percent of Bosnian territory. **********The bombing, then, was perceived as part of a triple whammy by the West against Serbs and has sharply raised the risks of violence, said Bryan Hopkinson, director of the Sarajevo-based Bosnia project of the International Crisis Group, a think tank financed by European governments and Western foundations. **********''At worst, the capacity might soon exist to mount an armed secessionist movement, at least for that part of Republika Srpska east of Brcko, perhaps using paramilitaries so that the political instigators would not be directly implicated,'' Mr. Hopkinson, a former British Ambassador to Bosnia, wrote in a report last week. ''The public, in its present baffled and enraged state, would probably not be hostile.'' **********Mr. Hopkinson said in an interview that any move by the Bosnian Serbs to secede would be easily handled by peacekeepers. **********''They might lose a few men, but if SFOR is determined to resist an insurrection, they could,'' Mr. Hopkinson said. **********In neighboring Montenegro, however, Western diplomats are not at all certain that the elected government could resist an army coup. The army has tanks and artillery, while the republic's police, although well trained and believed to be highly motivated, do not. **********The President of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, has told American diplomats that he was confident that he could avoid bloodshed in Montenegro while challenging Mr. Milosevic's authority, but only if the West refrained from bombing. **********Since the bombs started to fall, Mr. Djukanovic has said in interviews that his police would prevail in a fight against the army, but he and other officials have conceded that such a fight could ignite a civil war among his heavily armed population."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/06/business/the-markets-stocks-bonds-dow-makes-a-u-turn-to-finish-solidly-ahead-by-69.30.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-05-06", "snippet": "Dow Jones industrial average gains 69.30 points, to close at 10,955.41; Nasdaq composite index surges 1.98 percent, or 49.32 points, to 2,534.44; Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rises 15.31 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,347.31; graph; chart (M)", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Makes a U-Turn to Finish Solidly Ahead by 69.30", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; Dow Makes a U-Turn to Finish Solidly Ahead by 69.30", "body_text": " **********Stocks rebounded from early losses yesterday to finish solidly ahead, as investors showed renewed affection for the blue-chip growth stocks they had shunned lately. **********While none of the major indexes reached new peaks, all reversed course about 1 P.M. and climbed steadily to finish at their best levels.

''I bought a Palm V on the Web recently and got a great price,'' he said, referring to the popular personal digital organizer. ''But you can bet they won't discount all the other things that go with it,'' he said. ''If you look at it from the standpoint of building a business, it makes sense.'' **********It may make sense during the current customer acquisition frenzy. But it is not sustainable over the long run, said Gary Echhorn, chief executive of Open Market, an E-commerce software company. ''At some point, the world will have to figure out the need to actually make a profit to stay in business, so the price wars will be mitigated by that,'' he said. ''You can only suspend the laws of business for so long.'' **********The good news for Internet retailers is that despite consumers' professed interest in finding bargains on line, research suggests that they are a bit lazy about seeking them out, preferring to use reliable merchants with well-known names. A recent McKinsey & Company survey found that more than 80 percent of on-line shoppers do not compare prices before buying. **********''It's very counterintuitive, but so far the trend among customers has been not to compare prices,'' said John Hagel, who leads the E-commerce practice for McKinsey, a management consulting firm. ''Customers, once they come on line, tend to settle quickly on one site in a given category,'' he said. **********Part of the reason, Mr. Hagel said, is that the most popular items now selling on the Web are low-ticket goods like books and CD's, which provide little financial reward for price comparison. **********Another reason, he said, is that the technology that allows consumers to compare prices for a particular product from different merchants is still somewhat unsophisticated. These ''shopping bots,'' as they are known, are offered by portals like Excite, as well as niche sites like Cnet's Shopper.com service. While they sometimes turn up a good deal, the results can be inconsistent. **********A search on Excite's shopping service for ''Nike Air Jordans,'' for example, turned up nothing on one day, despite repeated attempts, but did yield results the next day. Meanwhile, an all-categories search on Amazon.com's Shop the Web service yielded no results for the term ''Levi's jeans,'' even though Levi Strauss pays to be listed in  the service. (An Amazon spokesman could not account for the problem.) **********If price comparison services improve -- and include ratings for merchants on factors like customer service, product availability and shipping charges -- retailers could face more price pressure as shoppers show more proclivity to stray. But for now, Mr. Hagel said, consumers seem to be showing some loyalty. ''Once people learn how to get around a site and have a positive experience, they tend to go back.'' **********And even if a some consumers change their behavior and begin to comparison shop more aggressively, some industry executives expect that retailers that do not play the discount game will still find customers on line, if they seem to provide superior service. ''There's always going to be  customers who look for price, and there's always going to be customers who look for service, just like some people shop at Saks and some shop at Wal-Mart,'' said Eli Katz, president of E-commerce for Fragrance Counter.com and Cosmetics Counter.com, which do not discount. ''That will hold true on the Web as well.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/28/business/the-markets-stocks-dow-and-s-p-both-gain-but-nasdaq-falls-slightly.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-10-28", "snippet": "Dow Jones industrial average gains 92.76 points, to 10,394.89; Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbs 14.80 points, to 1,296.71; Nasdaq composite index falls 8.95 points, to 2,802.52; graph; chart (M)", "word_count": 584, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow and S.& P.

The setting was Christie's, London, where the most expensive Isaac Soreau ever at auction (\u00a3573,500, or $924,300), for an extremely beautiful still life of the 1620s was followed by a mind-boggling \u00a31 million for an imaginary harbor view by Joseph Vernet in Rome. The entire sale of Old Master pictures added up to \u00a314.8 million. It was a triumph duly echoed in the ringing press release put out by Christie's PR people. **********With so much to celebrate, they somehow had little time for an interior scene by the elusive Jacobus Vrel that had also been sold. Is it because so little is known about this Dutch painter, whose earliest dated picture done in 1654 is in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna and whose verifiable activity stops a mere eight years later? Or was it just the austerity of the subject \u2014 a young woman who is sleeping in a four-poster, attended by nuns, with her newborn babe in a cot nearby? Whatever the case, no mention was made of the \u00a349,900 picture. **********Nor did the dealer who bought it, Johnny Van Haeften of London, a leading specialist in Dutch and Flemish painting, convene a press conference to announce that light cleaning had revealed an immaculate paint surface under the grime. The signature, which could only be faintly made out but escaped the attention of the auction house experts, is now distinctly legible, adding one more unquestionable work to an oeuvre that counts fewer than 20 paintings. **********A coup, undoubtedly. But not the only one involving Vrel, nor one of a kind reserved for dealers only. On July 10, 1998, a painting of an interior scene that is arguably Vrel's masterpiece was bought at Christie's by one of this century's great collectors, Baron Heinz Heinrich Thyssen von Bornemisza. He got the gem virtually unopposed, for \u00a378,500. Only within the vast field of Old Masters could such a gem be acquired for what is, relatively speaking, a modest outlay. **********A mere fraction of that sum may occasionally bring in a perfectly good landscape by some of the lesser 17th-century Dutch painters. Further down in the sale, a poetic view with a Renaissance chateau on the banks of an estuary came up. Clouds roll in the sky allowing a pale sunlight to brighten up the mauvish brick facade that shows signs of decay. One is reminded of Van Goyen's Romantic perception of the Dutch countryside. But the panel dated 1646 is signed with initials by Wouter Knijff (1607-1693). Nowadays, the artist's name means little to most, but at \u00a35,175, the buyer hardly took a big chance. **********Another landscape by a contemporary of Van Goyen that followed could be bought for a fifth of what a Van Goyen of comparable quality might be worth. Signed A[nthonie] V[an der] Croos, the dated panel is a view of Haarlem as it stood in 1653, seen from the southwest, with the River Spaarne running in the foreground along the low fortified walls with its turrets and half bastions. **********A masterpiece? Hardly, but a very pleasing urban landscape worth every penny of the \u00a328,900 it cost. **********When it comes to underpriced quality pictures, though, nothing gets anywhere near Flemish Primitives that do not lend themselves to a clear-cut attribution according to the lights of the art pontiffs of the day. **********Lot 122 at Christie's was a panel painted with an Annunciation on one side and a Saint Christopher trudging across some dried-up brook on the other. The Annunciation had the precise daintiness and even the fresh colors of a miniature enlarged to the size of a full-fledged picture 90.2 centimeters (36.08 inches) high. Mary is kneeling in an anteroom and holding a prayer book open on a pulpit nearby with one hand while turning her head to look at Gabriel. Behind the Virgin, an arched doorway leads into a bedroom with a four-poster. The composition is highly structured and close attention is paid to architectural details such as the moldings of the cornice at the top of the wall. **********On the back, Saint Christopher is curiously lodged in a trompe l'oeil niche that is very carefully rendered. Such a manner is reminiscent of Pieter Coecke van Aelst, who is described by a 16th-century painter and critic as \"an architect and painter.\" Entered as work from the \"Circle of Pieter Coecke van Aelst,\" which in plain English means \"contemporary with and only vaguely resembling the artist's work,\" the panel, probably the wing of some altarpiece, could be had for \u00a323,000. **********Next came a more fascinating quiz, an \"Adoration of the Magi,\" which Christie's catalogued as \"attributed to Pieter Coecke van Aelst.\" In auction house jargon, this translates as \"could conceivably be by the artist, but probably is not.\" The panel, with a shaped top and 104.8 centimeters high, indeed presents some similarities in mirror reverse with the master's \"Adoration of the Magi\" in a church at Oldenzaal. **********Yet it is clearly more than just an indifferent variant. **********Mary's face is strikingly beautiful. The elderly man holding up a bronze casket who served as a model for one of the Magi is in itself a masterly portrait. Not least, the architectural setting with its very Renaissance pseudo-Ancient Roman monument background is very well done \u2014 a roundel with low relief figures is quite remarkable. If there is one obvious weakness, it is the gilt bronze scepter laid across a ledge. The painter here struggled with the perspective. **********Coecke van Aelst's work or not? Mary's face may well be, and also the Magian king. A very detailed study would be required to determine how much of the rest is likely to be studio work, as was common practice in late Renaissance workshops. If the panel was spurned despite a moderate \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000 estimate, and was bought in at \u00a313,000 without any bids from the room, this is first due to the widespread dislike of religious subjects in our positivist society, secondly the result of the current obsession with famous names, and, last but not least, a consequence of the difficulty that so many of the new contenders experience in recognizing beauty. **********This could be verified the day after, at Sotheby's, where the Old Masters sale was also extremely successful, though lighter in substance. It included a rare masterpiece by Jan Tilens, large (75 by 125 centimeters), in good condition, and fully signed \"J. Tilens.ve.\" **********The imaginary landscape, with improbable Renaissance ruins meant to stand for an Ancient Roman city, was bathed in an unreal glowing light, with bluish clouds gathering over the scenery in the background. Exhibited several times in major shows dealing with Netherlandish landscape in the 17th century, the panel had graced a famous Dutch collection. It made only \u00a334,500. **********Of the several reasons that can be put forward for the low pricing, three stand out. Few buyers nowadays relate to late Renaissance aesthetics. A newcomer to art who is gifted but has an untrained eye may look at Impressionist or early 20th-century landscapes and immediately respond. Not so with a Tilens. **********A second reason is that those who want to give themselves a crash course in Impressionism or in Picasso's art only need to travel to Paris (the Musee d'Orsay; the Musee Picasso), or New York (the Met; the Guggenheim) and grab in addition half a dozen art books to cover a good deal of basic ground. For Tilens and the likes of him, years of travel and museum visits through Belgium and the Netherlands would be required, supplemented by numerous visits to auction houses and dealers. **********A third reason accounting for the modest pricing of Tilens's masterpiece is the obsession of our time with names. Who has heard of Tilens outside specialist circles? And, if the name cannot be drummed up, no one takes any notice, even if the aesthetics of the work have an immediate appeal. **********In Sotheby's sale, two landscapes signed by Simon Denis were respectively dated 1791 and 1792. With their dramatic use of sunset light, these rank among the earliest forerunners of the 19th-century Romantic approach to nature. Extremely well-painted, unpublished, the pair cost its inspired buyer a mere \u00a347,700. But to measure their innovative quality implies great familiarity with Romantic landscape painting in the first half of the 19th century. **********In short, to go after any but the most famous masters presupposes connoisseurship, a commodity in short supply these days. And that is why Old Masters remain, and will continue to be, so much cheaper than Impressionist and Modern Masters. **********SOUREN MELIKIAN is art editor of the International Herald Tribune."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/31/world/world-court-chief-faults-us-over-its-un-dues.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1999-10-31", "snippet": "Justice Stephen M Schwebel, US judge who serves as president of World Court, says that there is 'no question' that US is legally obliged to pay past assessments it owes United Nations (M)", "word_count": 482, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Court Chief Faults U.S. Over Its U.N.

Marks & Spencer also blamed what it called fashion miscalculations with the company's winter clothing line and even Britain's unusually warm weather this fall. **********''They've got a major product cost problem,'' said Tony Shiret, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. ''At the end of the day, they need to drive sales growth and lower costs.'' **********The company earned $:192.8 million, or about $322 million, in the first six months of its fiscal year ended Sept. 25, down from $:337.4 million the year earlier. Sales fell to $:3.7 billion, or about $6.18 billion, from $:3.8 billion a year earlier. **********Peter L. Salsbury, chief executive of Marks & Spencer, said the company's restructuring would slash costs partly by using overseas suppliers, with the goal of saving $:450 million, or $750 million, by 2002. Last month the company cut 700 jobs and dropped one of its longtime suppliers, William Baird P.L.C., ending a 30-year relationship and unnerving other Marks & Spencer suppliers. The company also said it would sell $:400 million, or about $668 million, of its nonstore property to raise cash. **********''These actions are designed to improve radically the ability of our business to compete with the world's best retailers without losing the qualities unique to Marks & Spencer,'' Mr. Salsbury said. ''The relevance of these changes is strongest in the U.K., but they are just as essential to the success of our overseas business.'' **********In the United States, the performance of Brooks Brothers continued to be a disappointment, losing $8.4 million in the last six months. ''I must say, I think Brooks Brothers is a distraction,'' Mr. Shiret said. ''Basically, Brooks is on trial over the Christmas season.'' **********Marks & Spencer said it planned to bring Brooks Brothers to Europe in the next two years, but analysts now question how extensively the stores will be introduced. **********Perhaps the most overshadowed detail of the restructuring may be its most important, at least to customers. The company said it would begin accepting credit cards. Previously, customers had to pay in cash or use a Marks & Spencer charge card.

He travels from stable to stable with blacksmithing tools and manufactured horseshoes, which he molds to the horses' feet after trimming and cleaning the hoofs. **********When you visit his own 20-acre horse farm in this bucolic hamlet in the heart of New Jersey's horse country, the only shoeless animal you're likely to encounter is Spike -- a half-corgi mutt with a penchant for darting under moving cars in the driveway. But Spike is still canine gentry -- a great-grandson of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's purebred corgi. **********Throughout the 1980's, Mr. Gervasio shod thoroughbreds at Mrs. Onassis's farm in Bernardsville, N.J., where weekend fox hunts were de rigueur. ''A couple of sniffs of brandy and, tallyho, off they'd go,'' he recalled. **********Now he jets off to tend to the mounts of the Olympic equestrian medal winner Robert Dover during international competitions and, closer to home, cares for the residents of Bruce Springsteen's stable in Red Bank, N.J., and for some of the horses owned by members of the Essex Fox Hounds Club. **********But he has not always ridden so high. His parents were Italian immigrant factory workers who wanted him to work at General Motors or attend college. ''I did neither,'' he said, ''though my sister has a master's in mathematics from Princeton.'' **********When Mr. Gervasio was 7, his family moved to a horse farm in Ewing, N.J., operated by a retired Virginia cavalryman. It was equestrian destiny. **********Soon Mr. Gervasio was spending all his spare time there, and he knew that he would devote his life to working with horses. ''Back then,'' he said, recalling the days of his apprenticeship, ''the old-timers did everything -- doctoring, shoeing, training, breeding.'' **********In 1960, after high school, he started training and showing quarter horses. ''It was tough to make a living, and people were always asking me to shoe their horses,'' he said. **********One shoe led to another -- for all sorts of horses -- and by 1968 Mr. Gervasio had backed into the business of shoeing full time. In 1972 he also became an official farrier to the All American Quarter Horse Congress, which runs competitions. He held that post for the next 20 years. **********Mr. Gervasio says his 300-horse business provides a healthy six-figure income. ''I started off 30 years ago getting a buck a shoe, and now it's around $200 a horse,'' he said. **********Most of his quadruped customers need to be shod every month. ''A horse's foot is constantly growing, just like your fingernail,'' he said. ''Maintaining the feet is crucial for the horse to have good balance.'' **********He spends half of every winter month tending equine clients in West Palm Beach, Fla., home of the Winter Equine Festival. Most are hunters, jumpers and dressage competitors. He prefers tending to these horses, which perform complex and beautiful movements, to working with their race track counterparts. **********Mr. Gervasio had a brief fling with entrepreneurship in the 70's, when he invented the first sliding plate shoe, used on horses that perform especially intricate steps. But he became discouraged because the design was too easy to copy. ''All the big companies had to do was change some little thing and they could make it themselves,'' he said. ''They made a fortune on that shoe.'' **********CAROLYN LeDONNE, a longtime client, describes Mr. Gervasio's business style as level-headed, not leveraged. ''The ironic thing about Arnie is that some of his clients are living these lavish rich-and-famous life styles on borrowed money,'' Mrs. LeDonne said. ''Meanwhile, he clumps around in jeans and a flannel shirt but with his farm, horses, custom truck and house all totally paid for.'' **********Mr. Gervasio says he has never had so much as a mortgage. ''My parents knew about hard work, not borrowing or investing,'' he explained. When cash starts accumulating, he invests in what he knows.  ''I bought a yearling for $3,000 and sold her for $35,000 two years later,'' he said. ''Another one I paid $10,000 for and sold for $70,000. But of course they don't all work out like that. One horse caught pneumonia and died.'' **********And how does an investor determine which Pegasus will be the next equine Ebay? ''You have to know exactly what characteristics make a really good dressage horse, hunter and jumper or quarter horse and look for those traits,'' he said. **********Though Mr. Gervasio came up through the old-fashioned route of  apprenticeship, he suggested that future farriers attend one of the nation's 59 training programs. Courses are as short as 12 weeks or as long as two years and can cost $2,000 to $20,000. **********When Mr. Gervasio isn't shoeing his regular clientele or jetting to Florida, he's busy getting his passport stamped. Last year he shod horses competing in the World Cup Dressage competition in Europe.  And there's a good chance you'll find him, hammer in hand, at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. **********At that level, tending to the horses is like coaching a human runner, he explained. ''Somebody has to monitor everything,'' he said. ''If the weather is looking dry I have to make sure the feet have moisture and don't get bruised.'' **********Mr. Gervasio's customers discuss his abilities with awe, even suggesting that he is a real-life ''horse whisperer.'' **********''I watched him say something to a horse that no one else could get near, and afterwards that animal ate out of his hand,'' Mrs. LeDonne recalled. **********But Mr. Gervasio scoffs at notions of mystical powers. ''The difference between me and someone just nailing shoes on a horse's feet is that I stay ahead of the problems -- take care of them before they happen,'' he said. ''For the rest, any good horseman learns to read the signs -- a shy horse, one that's going to bite you. It's like knowing your dog.'' **********(So what did he whisper into the ear of that recalcitrant mount? ''I said, 'Hey, how would you like a chain saw for a bit?' '' he recalled.) **********Now if only Mr. Gervasio could whisper something to keep that little dog out of the driveway."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/06/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-thompson-revamps-office-in-new-york.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-01-06", "snippet": "J Walter Thompson Co announces series of personnel changes as part of reorganization of agency's New York office by Bob Jeffrey, who recently became president; Doug McMahon, executive vice president-director, is named to additional title of genera...", "word_count": 166, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Thompson Revamps Office in New York", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Thompson Revamps Office in New York", "body_text": " **********The J.

Moreover, most forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, had been expecting a visible slowdown from the previous quarter's frenetic 6 percent rate. **********''This economy continues to defy the aging process,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston. ''The only discernible weakness is the trade deficit. And this has merely slowed the economy from warp speed.'' **********A burst of domestic spending fueled last quarter's gains. Consumers, who account for more than two-thirds of the nation's buying, spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Home purchases shot up at an annual rate above 15 percent. And business investment in new plant and equipment, which had faltered last summer, continued to rebound, advancing at a 7.6 percent rate. **********Investors were stunned by the economy's momentum. Fears that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates in the next few months to cool things off sent bond prices down sharply, and stocks tumbled, too. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 89.34 points, to 10,789.04. **********To William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, the latest report on the gross domestic product ''in some ways was even stronger than the fourth quarter's.'' **********Despite the virtual absence of inflation now, Mr. Dudley said, growth this fast always increases the risk that wages and prices will start to creep steadily upward. **********But even though the so-called G.D.P. deflator -- which measures changes in the prices of domestically produced goods -- jumped to a 1.4 percent annual rate compared with eight-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter, the increase appeared mostly to reflect a one-time pay increase for civil servants. **********Steven Landefeld, director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, pointed out that prices on everything that businesses and consumers buy, including cut-price imports, rose no faster last quarter than in the fall, at a 1.1 percent rate. **********How long can the good times last? An economist who has spent the last 15 years studying American business cycles says the short answer is: pretty much as long as the Federal Reserve, committed to preventing an outbreak of inflation, remains convinced that the danger is minimal. **********The economist, Christina D. Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, explains in a forthcoming article in The Journal of Economic Perspectives that long periods of uninterrupted growth are a post-World War II phenomenon. Between the early 19th century and the 1960's, the longest interval between recessions was half a dozen years or fewer. But the 1960's boom lasted nearly nine years, the 1980's growth cycle stretched for almost eight years, and the expansion of the 1990's has now passed its eighth birthday. **********What changed? Professor Romer said: ''We learned something from Keynes about how to prevent recessions, i.e. how to use monetary policy to counter economic shocks. But the new-found competence eventually turned into hubris.'' **********During the Vietnam War and the years after the 1973 oil shock, she says, ''we expanded too much and created a lot of inflation.'' **********To undo its own mistakes, the Fed had to create some truly nasty recessions, including the severe recession of 1980-82 engineered by Paul A. Volcker, then the Fed's chairman. Ever since, central bankers have managed to avoid overexpansion, and the only recession, the one largely precipitated by a consumer pullback in response to the outbreak of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war, was relatively short-lived and shallow. **********With the Fed's having shown restraint in the past, Professor Romer said, ''We don't have to create a recession to get inflation down.'' **********Professor Romer says that Alan Greenspan, who has been in charge at the Fed since 1987, has been lucky as well as smart. Trouble in the rest of the world, paradoxically, turned out to be a boon for the American economy. Tough times abroad helped hold inflation down as the prices of raw materials and imports collapsed and foreigners poured their money into Wall Street. **********As for American consumers, they are behaving as if bad times are far, far away. With unemployment at a 30-year low, inflation-adjusted take-home pay rising handily, and spirits about as high as they have ever been, consumers are spending all of their income -- and then some. In addition, the well heeled are cashing in some of their stock market gains while the less well-to-do are taking advantage of easy credit to borrow more. **********After-tax personal income soared at a 4.6 percent annual rate this winter, but spending rose at an even headier 6.7 percent annual rate and the personal saving rate, already around zero, fell into negative territory to the lowest level, minus five-tenths of a percent, ever recorded. (The measure, while seriously flawed, nonetheless clearly shows that Americans are saving less than they were just a year or two ago.) **********Business, which has been having trouble passing higher costs along, is spending freely once again as well to improve its efficiency. Although the growth of computer purchases slowed this winter, businesses invested heavily in low-technology  gear, new office space and the like. **********What could go wrong? A meltdown in the stock market could spook consumers into becoming born-again savers. Corporate America, facing heavy debts and mediocre profits, could suddenly slash its investment budget. Another deterioration in growth abroad -- at the moment things look a bit firmer -- could reverse the budding spring revival in manufacturing that seems to be under way. And inflation may start to simmer again. For now, however, these are just risks, not realities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/business/international-business-us-says-japan-brazil-dumped-steel.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1999-02-13", "snippet": "Clinton Administration rules that Japan and Brazil have illegally dunped steel in US at prices as much as 70 percent below normal; will impose enormous penalty tariffs to protect American jobs; Commerce Department and Office of US Trade Representa...", "word_count": 949, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Says Japan, Brazil Dumped Steel", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; U.S. Says Japan, Brazil Dumped Steel", "body_text": " **********The Clinton Administration ruled today that Japan and Brazil had illegally dumped steel in the United States at prices as much as 70 percent below normal, and said that it would impose enormous penalty tariffs on their products to protect the jobs of American steelworkers. **********The ruling from the Commerce Department came after a considerable battle within the Administration over how to handle the complaints of steel companies and the politically powerful steelworkers' union. While the Commerce Department and the Office of the United States Trade Representative advocated strong action, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and others in the Administration have argued that the United States should not appear to be closing its doors to foreign goods, especially as Asia and Latin America are trying to use exports to ease their financial crisis. **********Actions against ''dumped'' products are always a mix of economic and political calculation, and today's announcement was no exception. Russian steel, which American steelmakers complain has also been sold here at illegally low prices, was temporarily exempted from today's ruling. In a gesture to Moscow, the Commerce Department said that it would continue its investigation into Russia's practices through the middle of next week, while it  negotiates an agreement that could allow Russia to export steel to the United States in limited amounts, at set prices. **********''It's extremely important that we not cut off one of the few sources of raising hard currency that the Russians have right now,'' one of President Clinton's top economic advisers said today. ''There's a very delicate balance between protecting our industry and not worsening a crisis in Russia that is clearly getting worse.'' **********Today's action covers only hot-rolled steel. Technically, it would not go into effect until a final ruling is issued in 75 days. But final rulings rarely vary much from preliminary rulings -- which is what were released today -- and Commerce Secretary William M. Daley has already invoked a special provision of the trade laws that permits him to invoke the duties retroactively, to November. **********Part of the Administration's calculation in acting today was to head off a movement in Congress to impose quotas on imported steel. Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, a West Virginia Democrat, is one of several lawmakers from steel-producing states who have advocated such limits. Today, shortly after voting to acquit President Clinton on both impeachment charges, Mr. Rockefeller said that the ruling ''represents only a small step toward stopping the flood of cheap imports.'' **********The steel dispute may provide something of an early test of Mr. Clinton's persuasive abilities in a post-impeachment Congress. He is now deeply indebted to Democratic lawmakers, who have tended to take a far more protectionist view of how to deal with imports than Mr. Clinton has. ''He owes these guys a lot,'' one White House aide noted recently, ''and they are going to come looking for his help.'' **********Today, Mr. Daley said that the Administration opposed quotas, and he insisted that its quick ruling on dumping showed that it was prepared to act. **********''We think now we're on top of this,'' he said. ''The dumping margins we've found are substantial, and if they hold up in the final ruling, which we expect they will, it will substantially reduce imports.'' **********In fact, recent statistics show that steel imports from Japan and Brazil are already on the decline, a sign that both countries are reacting to considerable political pressure from the United States. Some of that has been encouraged by Vice President Al Gore, who, Administration officials say, has taken an intense interest in an issue that clearly will be an election issue in steel-producing states. **********The announcement this afternoon came too late for reaction from the Japanese Government, which has long argued that exchange rates and depressed commodity prices worldwide, not unfair pricing, account for the flood of low-cost Japanese hot-rolled steel. But the Japan Steel Information Center, financed by the Japanese steel industry, said that the dumping charges were ''unjustified, ill considered and counterproductive.'' **********Here in Washington, David H. Phelps, the executive director of the American Institute for International Steel, which is financed by importers and exporters of foreign-produced steel, contended that the ''domestic steel industry has abused this process to protect its market.'' **********''Nobody is going to pay these kinds of duties,'' he said, arguing that the reduction in steel imports ''has already taken place.'' **********As a result of today's rulings, importers of Japanese and Brazilian steel will have to pay deposits or post bonds on their steel imports to the United States Customs Service. Full payment of duties would not begin until a final ruling is made on April 28. The anti-dumping margins calculated by the Commerce Department -- in essence, the difference between the cost of producing and shipping the steel and the price at which it was sold -- ranged from 25.14 percent to 67.59 percent for Japanese producers, and 50.66 percent to 71.02 percent for Brazilian producers. **********Politically, the higher duties on Japanese goods are an easy sell in the Clinton Administration. But the Treasury Department is clearly worried about Brazil, which is still negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on amendments to the country's financial bailout plan, which collapsed in January. **********Russia is an even more sensitive issue in Washington. With the Russian economy headed steadily down, the Administration clearly did not want to be blamed for worsening unemployment in Russia's steel centers. It is able to negotiate an agreement with Russia on all its steel products because Russia is not yet a member of the World Trade Organization, which has strict rules on bilateral side deals to set limits and prices on trade of any kind.

I've found a good way to track them is with a simple spreadsheet listing all the relevant information, especially the date the rebate check is due you and the name, address and telephone number (usually on the rebate coupon) of the rebate issuer. **********This was invaluable with several rebate coupons obtained at Comp USA and mailed in last April. All promised the check within ''six to eight weeks.'' All took almost 14 weeks and had I not made a number of insistent telephone calls, I suspect I'd still be waiting. **********A few of the telephone representatives assured me that the rebate was not at all late, that their clock does not start when I mail the request but  when they enter it into their system, which apparently takes two to three weeks. When I suggested that the ''8 to 10 week'' commitment must take that into account, I got the telephone equivalent of a blank stare. **********Another caution with rebates is that they are sometimes on out-of-date versions of software and, big surprise, neither the manufacturer nor the retailer seems particularly interested in advising the customer of this. **********The manufacturer often puts the newest version in an identical or nearly identical package, and the retailer sometimes gets into the act by mixing new and old on its shelves. **********At my local CompUSA (but I'm sure this happens elsewhere), the cashiers are instructed to refuse to give out individual receipts, forcing the customer to go someplace for copies of the cash register receipt,  since one is required for each rebate. A bit of customer firmness at the register can usually solve this problem. **********Then there is the matter of sales tax. In most states, the customer is responsible for sales tax on a purchase's full amount if the rebate is issued by the manufacturer. But if the rebate is issued by the retailer (as some of CompUSA's are), the retailer is not entitled to sales tax on that portion of the price represented by the rebate amount, even though the rebate amount is collected at the time of sale. **********Again, big surprise, cashiers are usually unaware of this, and their employers do not seem interested in enlightening them. **********Finally, here is a new trick from Broderbund.

There have been persistent rumors that Mr. Tudjman, who has stomach cancer, is being kept breathing artificially and is attached to life-support equipment while his divided party, the Croatian Democratic Union, figures out who will succeed him. Seeking to address those rumors, party officials said today that he was alive. **********Mr. Tudjman is apparently unable to sign the documents for parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for Dec. 22, so the country is in a state of morbid expectation, reminding some people of the lingering, four-month death watch for Josip Broz Tito, the founder of Yugoslavia, who died in 1980. **********Mr. Tudjman, 77, who has patterned his habits and his taste for uniforms on Tito's, is a historian and former Yugoslav Army general who pulled Croatia out of Yugoslavia in 1991, thereby helping to collapse the old Communist federation. **********Mr. Tudjman has run Croatia as an autocrat since 1991 while winning repeated elections as its president, the last in 1997. But a pattern of economic corruption and cronyism, a disregard for human rights and a tight rein on the news media, especially television and radio, have brought Mr. Tudjman considerable criticism from Washington and the European Union. **********In particular, the West would like the Croatian government to be more fully cooperative with the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague and to stop refusing to hand over people indicted as war criminals; to welcome, rather than discourage, the return to Croatia of Serbs driven from the country after Mr. Tudjman's forces recaptured the Serb-held territory in August 1995; and to hold free and fair elections with free and fair access granted to the news media. **********Part of the political confusion here stems from the increasing unpopularity of Mr. Tudjman's umbrella party, since the economy is stagnant, corruption is visible and unemployment is very high. Reputable polls taken earlier this month indicated that an opposition grouping of center-left parties would probably win a majority in Parliament, although Mr. Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union -- universally known here by its Croatian initials HDZ -- would remain the largest party. **********Originally, parliamentary elections were scheduled for Dec. 22 -- a pre-Christmas date that seemed designed, in this largely Roman Catholic country, to help his party, since many of its critics, including Croats who also have homes abroad, would be on vacation or out of the country. But Parliament's mandate expires on Saturday, and no solution is yet in sight for calling fresh elections. **********Mr. Tudjman's death would leave his party divided into roughly three factions. The first is led by Ivic Pasalic, Mr. Tudjman's adviser. Mr. Pasalic has no state function but is considered instrumental in internal and security policy. He is the leader of the ''Herzegovina lobby'' that supports the Bosnian Croats, fervent devotees of Mr. Tudjman's party who are also allowed to vote in Croatian elections despite their Bosnian citizenship. **********The second faction is led by the deputy speaker of Parliament, Vladimir Seks, a hard-line Croatian nationalist who announced today on television that Mr. Tudjman ''is alive.'' **********The third faction, more liberal and pro-European, is led by Foreign Minister Mate Granic, a favorite of Washington. While Mr. Granic is popular in the country, he is less so within the party. **********The party, then, is thought to be trying to buy time while the leadership decides who will run for the presidency and when to call parliamentary elections. If Mr. Tudjman dies, the parliamentary speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, a relatively colorless figure, will run the country before new presidential elections within 60 days. Parliament's term is scheduled to expire on Jan. 27, and new elections should be called by Dec. 26 at the latest, to allow 30 days of campaigning. **********But to have them during the Christmas break would require Mr. Tudjman -- or, if he is declared incapable, Mr. Pavletic -- to sign an order this week. **********Today's Parliament vote was an indication of the confusion. The Constitution describes procedures in the case of a president's death, resignation or ''permanent incapacity.'' But Mr. Seks said that the party ''will under no circumstances agree to apply the institute of permanent incapacitation.'' To do so, he said, would be ''immoral and disgraceful.'' **********So in extraordinary session, Parliament passed, by a vote of 85 to 28 with 24 abstentions, a constitutional amendment that created a category of ''temporary incapacity,'' which must be decided upon by the Constitutional Court when asked to do so by the Cabinet. But the law allows 30 days for the whole procedure, causing opposition politicians to protest that the political instability would simply continue. **********The Parliament also voted to extend the mandate of the speaker, Mr. Pavletic, so he could serve after the legislature is dissolved on Saturday but before new elections are held. That would enable him to assume some of Mr. Tudjman's duties if he is declared temporarily incapacitated or dies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/28/world/an-anti-milosevic-leader-tries-for-a-comeback.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Erlanger", "pub_date": "1999-08-28", "snippet": "Zoran Djindjic, Yugoslav opposition figure, vows to push to oust Pres Slobodan Milosevic; photo (S)", "word_count": 1545, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "An Anti-Milosevic Leader Tries for a Comeback", "print_headline": "An Anti-Milosevic Leader Tries for a Comeback", "body_text": " **********Zoran Djindjic has been refining his plans, and there have been a lot of them, but he now seems ready to roll the dice to try to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. **********At 47, Mr. Djindjic, the urbane and telegenic leader of the Democratic Party, appears to think it is his last chance to rid the country of Mr. Milosevic and his Government. **********Huge street protests in the winter of 1996-97 petered out after 88 days with Mr. Milosevic in power, but Mr. Djindjic vows that this time he is prepared ''to go to the end,'' though he can be vague about what that means exactly. In an interview, he said he would lead demonstrations, beginning with a Belgrade rally on Sept. 21, until Mr. Milosevic resigned. **********Asked if that meant that his only options were victory, arrest or exile, Mr. Djindjic shrugged. Later, he said that ''if Serbia enters the new century with Mr. Milosevic at its head,'' he will retire from politics. **********Mr. Milosevic must be gone ''by the end of October or early November,'' Mr. Djindjic said. But he recognizes that Mr. Milosevic may not be gone, and that his strategy may have to be revised. **********''If ordinary people are not ready to take the risk, we will lose,'' he said. ''But if they are not ready to be on the streets, I'll be ready and try to lead them there.'' **********Known for his pragmatism and modern sensibility, Mr. Djindjic, with less to lose, now seems more radical than his rival within the opposition, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement. That has made him more attractive to Washington, which had long mistrusted the German-educated Mr. Djindjic as being ''too European.'' **********''We have different interests,'' he said of Mr. Draskovic in his much-improved English. ''Draskovic doesn't want to change the system. He wants to maintain the privileges of the Government but to change its membership. I want to change the character of the Government itself.'' **********While Mr. Draskovic has been plumping lately for early elections under freer conditions, possibly on Nov. 7, and Mr. Milosevic's aides have themselves been suggesting an early vote, Mr. Djindjic says free elections will not be possible while Mr. Milosevic is President. **********Still, in the interview Mr. Djindjic said clearly for the first time that his party and the larger opposition coalition, the Alliance for Change, would have to take part in early elections, even with Mr. Milosevic in power -- that they could not credibly boycott the vote, as they did in 1997. **********But he said they would try to organize the election as ''a referendum on Milosevic,'' running slates of candidates that did not include party leaders but would be headed by respected non-politicians like Drago slav Avramovic, the former Central Bank head who brought down Yugoslavia's hyperinflation in 1994, and Momcilo Perisic, who was fired by Mr. Milosevic in November as army chief of staff. **********After meeting with American officials, Mr. Djindjic said he had assurances that these men would agree to lead such a slate. **********''We'd say O.K. to elections, but have two million in the streets to wait for the results as a kind of electoral control,'' he said. He would hope that street pressure and the imploding of the Government would cause Mr. Milosevic to step down, so that ''truly free elections'' could then take place with all party leaders running. **********Mr. Djindjic said he hoped to step up street pressure slowly but surely, giving the Government no pretext for a crackdown. Under enough pressure, ''I believe Milosevic and his wife will leave if they see they have lost,'' Mr. Djindjic said. ''I don't believe they are brave enough to fight to the end.'' **********Others, pointing to Mr. Milosevic's indictment on war crimes charges, say that the couple has little alternative but to try to preserve their positions, and that they would not trust promises of safety from cronies, let alone opposition figures. **********Mr. Djindjic, trained as a philosopher, said the fate of the Milosevics was not his concern. **********''Milosevic is not a criminal, but a logical consequence of a part of our history,'' he said. ''Milosevic is a cause of our problems, but he is also, in an important sense, a consequence of them. But if Milosevic remains in power, and the effort to democratize fails, there will be a further period of state disintegration.'' **********But few see many signs of serious cracks in the Government, and some analysts regard Mr. Djindjic's new radicalism in part as an effort to compensate for having fled Serbia during the war over Kosovo. **********''Djindjic is simply trying to find his way back to political life,'' said Milan Milosevic, a respected political analyst who is not related to the President. **********''I think the opposition has totally overestimated the possibility of revolution in Serbia because of the loss of Kosovo,'' Mr. Milosevic said. ''Djindjic has no chance as a revolutionary, but all this has helped him to survive politically. And by choosing this more radical path, he has rallied his troops around him.'' **********Mr. Djindjic portrays himself as contemporary, thoughtful and sophisticated. He sees Serbia's other major political figures -- President Milosevic, Mr. Draskovic and Voji slav Seselj, the Radical Party leader and coalition partner of Mr. Milosevic -- as ''antimodern,'' with their concentration on primitive Communism, traditionalism and nationalism. **********Insights like that have made him an attractive candidate to the urban educated voters in Serbia who want closer ties to Europe and the rest of the world, especially after the fiasco of the war with NATO. **********Though his rally speeches are improved and popular, he is not a natural rabble-rouser like Mr. Draskovic. In a way he is trying to ride popular discontent as much as to lead it. **********At the moment, Serbs may be angry, but they are not especially enamored of the opposition leaders. Asked in an opinion poll published on Thursday in Nin magazine which opposition leader ''will lead us out of the crisis,'' 68 percent of Serbian respondents said ''none,'' while another 20 percent were undecided. **********Some 4 percent chose Mr. Draskovic, 2.5 percent chose Mr. Avramovic and 2 percent Mr. Perisic. Only 1.5 percent chose Mr. Djindjic. **********Even if the unknown margin of error in the poll was large, the conclusions are fairly vivid. **********Part of the problem is that ''all opposition leaders are fascinated with the masses,'' said Mr. Milosevic the political analyst. Although they only pulled 10 percent of any city's population into summertime rallies, ''they see 10,000 people in front of them and they imagine it's a million.'' **********And they never do the kind of serious local political organizing that President Milosevic's party has always done, and in fact refined since it transformed itself from the Communist Party. **********Ivan Radovanovic, an independent journalist, called Mr. Djindjic ''a strange mixture of pragmatism and hysteria, and you never know which will prevail.'' Mr. Djindjic, he said, ''seems wholly pragmatic, and then something tips him over and he's capable of overthrowing his plans. And Vuk Draskovic drives him crazy.'' **********It was Mr. Djindjic who was most responsible for the breakup of the opposition coalition, called Zajedno, when he went back on his promise to back Mr. Draskovic in his 1997 presidential campaign and instead boycotted the elections, Mr. Radovanovic said. He noted that in 1993 Mr. Djindjic negotiated his own coalition deal with President Milosevic, pulling out only at the end, although four from his party joined the Cabinet. **********After the 1996-97 protests, ''Djindjic was spoken of as a Serbian Vaclav Havel and he thought he could run the opposition,'' Mr. Milosevic said. ''But he had big problems with Draskovic, who saw himself as the king of the streets'' and who, once betrayed, engineered Mr. Djindjic's ouster as Mayor of Belgrade. **********Because of that and the 1997 election boycott, Mr. Djindjic ''for two years has been out of the game and in crisis, and his party has been in crisis, too,'' Mr. Milosevic said. **********He made matters worse by fleeing the country during NATO's bombing campaign, his life under threat. Government propaganda took full advantage and called him a coward, a traitor and a tool of NATO, charges that Mr. Draskovic's party echoes, though less crudely. **********But as Mr. Djindjic, the Alliance for Change and Mr. Draskovic have explored one strategy after another, the summer has been wasted in disputes and a now-dead plan for a transitional government of experts that President Milosevic would never have accepted. **********And the period after the capitulation in Kosovo -- when the Milosevic Government was rocked on its heels and seemed extremely shaky, with the army and police unsure -- was not exploited, even though the opposition probably could have united those angry with President Milosevic for prosecuting the war and those angry with him for losing it. **********Now, with the Serbs nearly expelled from Kosovo under NATO eyes, it is easier for Mr. Milosevic to argue that the war was worth fighting, given the consequences. **********''The opposition never seems to anticipate anything,'' Mr. Radovanovic said. ''They only react to Milosevic and to events, and to the insults of each other.'' **********Now President Milosevic's suggestion of early elections has further divided the opposition. But despite all the confusion and the skepticism, Mr. Djindjic is steeling himself. **********''I believe that this is the last opportunity to get rid of Milosevic,'' he said. ''It's not just the last chance for me, but for us as a country.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/23/world/chinese-restate-goals-to-reorganize-state-companies.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Eckholm", "pub_date": "1999-09-23", "snippet": "Four-day meeting of Communist Party's top leaders ends with reaffirmation of China's commitment to reorganizing state-owned enterprises and making them competitive in global marketplace; plenary meeting of 189-member Central Committee also gives V...", "word_count": 528, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chinese Restate Goals to Reorganize State Companies", "print_headline": "Chinese Restate Goals to Reorganize State Companies", "body_text": " **********A four-day meeting of the Communist Party's top leaders ended today with a reaffirmation of China's commitment to reorganizing state-owned enterprises and making them competitive in the global marketplace. **********The plenary meeting of the party's 189-member Central Committee also gave Vice President Hu Jintao a symbolically important  new position as a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. That adds to the evidence that Mr. Hu, at 56 the youngest senior leader, is President Jiang Zemin's choice as a successor in several years. **********In a statement this evening, the Central Committee called the overhaul of state enterprises ''an important and urgent task.'' But it mainly restated problems and goals set out repeatedly in the last two years and said that reforms  had ''reached a crucial stage, and some deeply rooted problems need to be dealt with'' -- suggesting that progress has been ragged. **********In sometimes vague and contradictory language, the statement called for modern management of state enterprises and, in a break with tradition, to offer direct performance-related financial incentives to top managers of larger state companies. But it also called for improved ''ideological and political work'' in such companies. **********Combined with much language about markets and preparing industries to meet ''fierce global competition,'' the statement at several points stressed the need for Government to retain control over  pivotal industries, including emerging high-technology industries. **********China is struggling with a huge number of money-losing, inefficient and redundant state enterprises, some dating from the Mao Zedong era and others built up even as the country started introducing market forces in the 1980's and early 90's. By wide agreement, they are a serious drain on the economy, and their huge debts imperil the banking system. **********In 1997, Mr. Jiang Zemin, also the Communist Party chief, called for a major reorganization of larger industries, including bankruptcies, mergers and new stockholding schemes. Smaller companies were to be left to sink or swim. Last year, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji vowed to turn around the sinking state sector within three years. **********The shake-up of coddled state enterprises is closely linked to China's drive to join the World Trade Organization, because membership would require reduced tariffs on imports and additional opportunities for foreign businesses to compete in China. **********But the ailing state-run companies also provide jobs and welfare to millions of people and power to industrial ministries and local politicians. The backlash of threatened interests, corruption in the dismantling of companies and Chinese leaders' concerns about the political and social effects of layoffs have all hampered change. **********From the statement today, it was unclear whether conservative forces had blunted a drive for more sweeping and rapid change or triumphant reformers had assuaged the opposition with bromides about preserving state control. **********In a typically convoluted sentence, filled with the code phrases suggesting opaque bureaucratic battles, the statement said: ''The strategic adjustment of the layout of the state sector of the economy needs to be combined with optimization of and improvements in the industrial and ownership structure, sticking to advancement in some areas and retrenchment in others and refraining from some things in order to do others, so as to increase the ability of the state sector to control the economy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/14/business/company-news-excite-home-to-acquire-imall-for-425-million-in-stock.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-07-14", "snippet": "ExciteatHome agrees to acquire iMall Inc for stock valued at $425 million (S)", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCITE@HOME TO ACQUIRE IMALL FOR $425 MILLION IN STOCK", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; EXCITE@HOME TO ACQUIRE IMALL FOR $425 MILLION IN STOCK", "body_text": " **********Excite@Home said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire iMall Inc. for stock valued at $425 million to expand its electronic commerce capabilities on the Excite Internet portal.

The company's market valuation alone is nearly half a trillion dollars, and its presence is a huge reason that 2,500 other high-technology companies are congregated here. **********Most of those start-ups are near Microsoft on the east side of Lake Washington, and many were started by Microsoft alumni. Their combined market value is roughly another half-trillion dollars, according to a study by the Eastside Economic Council, a business and civic group. **********Microsoft, in short, has transformed Seattle, almost single-handedly saving the region from a recession a few years ago during a downturn at the city's largest employer, Boeing. **********More recently, Microsoft has fueled a boom here that is the subject of heated local debate. Some Seattleites celebrate the growth, while others complain it is turning a once unassuming, comfortable town into a glitzy, traffic-clogged mess. **********But now, after a withering denunciation of the region's Golden Goose by a federal judge, people here are debating a different question: What will this mean for the region? **********Not much, many insist. They note that the company's stock price was $43 on the day the government filed its case in May 1998 and has more than doubled since then. **********Only good things, say others. They invoke the advice of John D. Rockefeller when he heard his oil monopoly was being broken up by the Supreme Court in 1911: buy Standard Oil. The magnate rightly predicted the stock would be worth far more divided into a bunch of new companies. **********And then there are the doomsday, turn-out-the-lights scenarios. An article in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Saturday, the day after the judge's finding was issued, even carried speculation that the software giant might desert its woodsy campus in the suburb of Redmond and high-tail it for the Cayman Islands, beyond the reach of United States antitrust laws. (''Unlikely but not impossible,'' the newspaper said.) **********No one knows, of course, what will happen in the end. And for now, even with many local leaders decrying the judge's finding as an unfair attack on the hometown team, there is no discernible sense of panic. **********''The main reaction I've noticed is that it's kind of exciting as a news event, but people don't seem to see dire outcomes down the road,'' said Fred Moody, managing editor of The Seattle Weekly and author of ''I Sing the Body Electronic: A Year with Microsoft on the Multimedia Frontier (Viking, 1995).'' ''The attitude clearly is, there's a long way to go.'' **********The judge's findings that Microsoft unfairly uses its monopoly power to bully and thwart competition has also touched an ambivalent chord here about the company's chairman, William H. Gates. **********''Gates himself personifies the company, and there are a lot of mixed feelings,'' Mr. Moody said. ''He is obviously a local kid who made good. It's a lot of fun to see a Seattle person taking on the world, being defiant and refusing to lose.'' **********On the other hand, he added, people in Seattle have the same aversions that anyone else does to someone who is too rich and too powerful. Besides, he said, ''A lot of people equate Microsoft with the personal computer, and just because computers can be so frustrating, they think it's all Microsoft's fault.'' **********Mark Dabek, a co-owner of Re-PC, a Seattle store and Web site that sells recycled computers and peripherals, said he generally admired Microsoft and believed that the company wasn't getting enough credit from the judge or the government for sparking innovation in the high-technology  industry and for providing good standards for software. **********But, having said that, he added that many of his customers were reacting with glee to the government's gains in the antitrust case. **********''They feel as though Microsoft has literally led them down a path they don't necessarily want to go down,'' Mr. Dabek said. ''They don't like the Windows operating system, but they feel they have to go along with it because everybody uses it.'' **********Microsoft and the high-technology industry have created tens of thousands of jobs here. Microsoft alone employs about 17,500 people in the region and says it is looking for about 2,000 more. And while the ''packaged software'' industry, which excludes  Internet ventures, employs only about one-fourth the numbers employed by Boeing and the rest of the aerospace industry here, it generates more wages: roughly $6.8 billion compared with $5.5 billion, according to a 1998 study by the state's Employment Security Department. **********Those gains have created tensions, as the image of a blue-collar Seattle where anyone could make a good living and no one's wealth was on display has been replaced by dot-com millionaires with hugely expensive homes and cars. **********In the main, state and local leaders here jumped to Microsoft's defense within hours of the release of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings, which could lead to significant changes for the software maker. **********Both United States senators and Gov. Gary Locke issued statements that supported the company. **********Representative Jennifer Dunn, a Republican who represents the Eastside communities where so many technology companies are based, said she was ''fearful of government  attempts to regulate this dynamic and competitive industry.'' And the state's chief economist, Chang Mook Sohn, told reporters that ''anything that hurts Microsoft hurts the state's economy -- no question about that.'' **********But others question whether the antitrust action really will hurt Microsoft in the end, even if the outcome is a draconian remedy. **********''If the company breaks up some day, that's not automatically bad,'' said Dick Conway, co-publisher of The Puget Sound Economic Forecaster, a newsletter. ''That was certainly the case with AT&T, that the parts were greater than the whole, and that certainly is conceivable here.'' **********Mr. Conway made clear that he was not predicting a break-up. **********But the Standard Oil and AT&T cases differ from the Microsoft matter in a way that is significant to Seattle. In the former cases, there were clear geographical divisions that could be carved out of the corporate empire. In Microsoft's case, such divisions would seem meaningless, given the ubiquity of software. **********So one important local question if a break-up were ever ordered would be how many of the divided parts would remain based here. **********On the other hand, a great deal of the economic activity Microsoft has generated here is taking place outside the company campus anyway. Microsoft AlumNet, a 3,000-member group that supports the business and philanthropic activities of company alumni, says that more than a third of those members have started their own technology companies or consulting practices here, or hold top positions in other start-ups. **********Companies like RealNetworks and Onyx Software are full of Microsoft alumni. What's more, many analysts say the real growth here is in Internet companies like Amazon.com, InfoSpace.com, Go2Net and others. **********News of Judge Jackson's findings  capped a long, tense week in Seattle. A crash of a Boeing plane, like the EgyptAir Boeing 767 last Sunday, is always a big story here. Political leaders wrung their hands over passage of a statewide anti-tax measure that threatened stark budget problems. And an office shooting left two people dead and a killer at large. **********''It's kind of an unusual week for Seattle,'' said Mr. Conway, the economist.

''The Berlin wall fell, the Soviet Union collapsed and majority rule came to South Africa. Even here in Asia there have been great changes.  Watching these things, we feel a tinge of envy, and wonder why our situation hasn't changed.'' **********In this remote Indian town, thousands of Tibetans have been awaiting deliverance for nearly 40 years.  Their political and spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, 64, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, is a devoted pacifist. He has refused to support armed actions or other forms of violence in his campaign to win concessions from China, which occupied Tibet in 1950 and considers it a Chinese province. **********How long he can keep exiled Tibetans united around his nonviolent principles is the question that envelops Dharmsala. **********Sitting in a shaded courtyard near the Dalai Lama's residence on a recent morning, two young Tibetans argued about how they could best end their long exile. **********''I believe the Dalai Lama,'' said Tzering Doyee, a 25-year-old language student. ''If European countries and the United States support us, we will go back. Young people in China are talking about democracy.  Maybe in two or three years I will be living in Tibet.'' **********At that, Mr. Doyee's friend Lobsang Treten, 32, also a student,  smiled and shook his head. ''If we wait for nonviolence to work, maybe I will spend my whole life here,'' he said. ''We need a stronger way.'' **********Mr. Doyee and Mr. Treten have never seen Tibet. Both were born in India, and the closest contact they have with their homeland is Dharmsala, where Tibetans live alongside streams of Western pilgrims who come to soak up their spiritual vibrations. **********The area around Dharmsala is home to nearly 15,000 Tibetan exiles, who for the most part live peacefully with the region's 250,000 Indians.  Many of the Tibetans work for the Dalai Lama's exile government or run shops or hostelries with names like Lotus Flower, Shangri-La and Tibet Memory. **********Drawn by the Tibetans, a people viewed as gentle innocents crushed by a cynical world, and by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Buddhism he represents, spiritual pilgrims have made Dharmsala one of India's most unusual tourist destinations. **********''The hippies are everywhere,'' said Subahsh Nehria, 29, an Indian who was born here and now guides trekkers through the surrounding mountains. ''You wouldn't believe there are so many of them left. They have a very romantic view of Tibetans and the Dalai Lama, and I suppose they come here hoping some of the aura will rub off on them.'' **********Many of the Tibetans who live here aren't quite sure what to make of these visitors. While most appreciate the money they spend at handicraft shops and the pro-Tibet convictions they presumably develop and bring home, some see an air of silliness in their idealization of Tibetan Buddhism. **********''My heritage is Buddhism, but I wouldn't dare tell you that I know much about it,'' said Dawa Tsering,  who was born in India and has been elected by Tibetans here as their community leader. ''When I listen to these people, I have to laugh. Buddhism is a fad to them, like blue jeans. They study for a week or a month and become champions of Buddhism, at least until another fad comes along.'' **********The walls of Dharmsala are plastered with signs demanding Chinese withdrawal from Tibet and urging a boycott of Chinese goods. They compete for space with leaflets that advertise courses in natural healing, integral massage, soul realization, ''ancient yoga of the inner light'' and ''the direct awakening of the unconditional state beyond the psychological self.'' **********The Dalai Lama's office sponsors courses in Tibetan Buddhism, and they draw many young visitors. One of them, a barefoot Australian named Nerissa Parker, said she had come to Dharmsala after having a dream in which the Dalai Lama invited her. She attended one of the public audiences that he gives every month or so, and said that making eye contact with him was ''a big experience because of the very special atmosphere around him.'' **********A Swedish visitor, Charlotte Pruth,  said she had come not out of curiosity about Buddhism or the Dalai Lama, but to show solidarity with the Tibetan cause. ''The Chinese overran Tibet and are trying to destroy the whole country and tradition and religion,'' she said. **********There are about 130,000 Tibetans living in exile. About 80,000 of them live in India, many as farmers in the steamy south, living very differently from the way they did as nomads in their frozen homeland. **********Tibetan refugees have held together with remarkable success over the decades. Their exile government runs 87 schools in India, Nepal and Bhutan where Tibetan history, culture and religion are taught in addition to a standard curriculum. Monks in hundreds of monasteries keep alive the ancient flame of Tibetan Buddhism. **********One of the most respected leaders of the exile government, Rinchen K. Choeygyal, who holds the title of education minister, said many visitors who come to Dharmsala see Tibetans as ''creatures from another planet.'' **********''But whether they are infatuated or fascinated, if they meet the right kind of Tibetans it may be good for them and good for our cause,'' Ms. Choeygyal said. ''When we first came here, even many people in India had no idea who we were or where we came from or why. Now the whole world knows, and that is certainly progress.'' **********''In our work and in our cause, we are trying to be very responsible, but the world should also be responsible toward a group of people that is trying to be an example for the world. **********''Deep inside, every one of us is carrying a very heavy load in spite of our smiling faces and dignified appearance. As human beings, it is natural that we feel anger and frustration and even hatred.

Renyi, that ''not once during this investigation, with all the media it has had, has the bank seen fit to publicly or privately defend me and let it be known that there is not one negative thing to say about me.'' **********A spokesman for the bank declined to comment except to say that the bank had a copy of the letter and that ''we acknowledge the resignation and wish her well.'' **********Law enforcement authorities here and abroad have been examining the suspicious movement of $7.5 billion from Russia through a handful of accounts at the bank since 1996. Although much of that money was apparently related to schemes to avoid taxes and duties, investigators have said they believe that a significant part of the funds may have derived from illicit activities in Russia. **********Ms. Kagalovsky, who is living in London with her husband and also has a home in New York, has not been charged with wrongdoing by any law enforcement agency. Last week, a Federal grand jury indictment was unsealed in Manhattan that charged three others, a former Bank of New York executive, Lucy Edwards; her husband, Peter Berlin, and a business associate, Aleksey Volkov, with running an illegal wire-transfer business in New York  through three companies, including the Benex International Company and Becs International L.L.C. **********Ms. Edwards, who worked for Ms. Kagalovsky at the bank, was suspended by the bank on Aug. 18, after press inquiries about the Federal investigation. The bank dismissed Ms. Edwards shortly after her suspension for what the bank called ''gross misconduct.'' **********Investigators have focused on Ms. Kagalovsky not only because she supervised Ms. Edwards, but also because she played a leading role in securing business for the bank in Russia. Many bank customers in Russia were large banks that collapsed in the wake of the financial crisis there last year. The Russian banks have been criticized for freewheeling ways. One, Bank Menatep, was overseen by Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin Kagalovsky, the bank's former vice chairman. **********But Ms. Kagalovsky's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said beyond innuendo surrounding the Kagalovskys' relationship, investigators have no grounds to be suspicious of his client. **********Mr. Arkin said Ms. Kagalovsky is not a target of the Federal investigation and is not formally cooperating with it, but said she is prepared to answer any questions posed to her.  ''We have nothing to hide,'' he said. **********Moreover, Mr. Arkin added, the Benex and Becs accounts under scrutiny were not opened in Ms. Kagalovsky's division and were not under her supervision. The accounts, according to the indictment, were controlled by Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin. But the bank declined to say who supervised the accounts. **********People with knowledge of the investigation said the Bank of New York was not preparing to discharge Ms. Kagalovsky. Mr. Arkin said there were no legal reasons behind her decision to resign. He said the decision was based on the desire to move on professionally and leave a bank that refused to support her. **********In her letter, Ms. Kagalovsky said she has been ''living in professional limbo'' and ''subjected to painful baseless rumor arising out of the federal investigation.'' She said the bank's abandonment of her had left her to ''swing in the wind.'' **********The United States Attorney's Office in Manhattan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment on Ms. Kagalovsky's resignation.

Far from being unsettled by the uncertainty or technical glitches, the stock markets in Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Madrid all jumped 5 percent or more. **********Britain, which has thus far refused to adopt the euro, had a less euphoric day. The FTSE stock index ended up roughly even while the pound slipped against the euro. **********On European streets, there was little sign that anything had changed. Even in downtown Frankfurt, which is home to the European Central Bank, few stores were posting prices in euros. **********At Kaufhof, an upscale department store in the city's financial center, signs boasted, ''We will make you ready for the euro,'' but none of the prices were listed in euros. **********And plenty of people were befuddled. Because euros will be usable only for electronic payments until Jan. 1, 2002, some German bank customers did not understand why their banks would not give them euros in cash. Others were annoyed that banks were suddenly ordering them to identify the currency they were using when writing checks. **********Even bank employees were perplexed about how, exactly, to open a bank account denominated in euros. **********''This will be a sort of experiment,'' said Monique Pouzet, a teller at Credit Commercial de France in Paris, as she opened a binder marked ''Memento euro.'' After a moment's study and a few key strokes, Ms. Pouzet reported with a smile that the experiment was a success. ''You can pick up your euro checkbook in about one week, apparently,'' she told a customer. **********Traders, bankers and Government officials warned that it would take several more days to know for sure whether the huge technical conversion was successful. But the evidence today pointed toward a remarkably smooth start for the euro and toward its acceptance as a serious competitor to the dollar as an international currency. **********''Technically, there is absolutely no problem at all,'' said Michael Bartmann, a securities dealer on the floor of the Frankfurt stock exchange. ''The only problem is that people have to get used to the new numbers. Trading volumes are very low right now, probably because people need time to get adjusted.'' **********None of the elaborate ''dress rehearsals'' for the euro involved the full range of financial institutions at one time. So, although individual institutions seemed to function well today, the real test will come when all of them -- banks, brokerage firms and settlement systems -- have had a chance to thoroughly interact with one another in settling accounts, or processing their transactions, after the markets close. Bank executives said that would take several days of trading. **********''Before we declare this a complete triumph, let's just wait until the settlement is done of the first few trades,'' said Graham Bishop, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney. ''Once we have pushed through to the end-of-the-week settlements, then people will feel a lot happier.'' **********Peter Wolf-Koppen, head of euro projects at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said: ''There are still two important milestones in front of us. One of them comes today when we have to post all the day's transactions to all the accounts. The other will be in settling transactions with other institutions.'' **********One trader in Frankfurt commented: ''There is definitely potential for problems. What could happen is that you get orders in euros and in marks, and in that case you would see complete chaos. We will have to wait and see whether the banks have fully implemented the conversion.'' **********All in all, both industry executives and European central bankers said the conversion seemed a success. Most central banks, including the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy, said they had received no distress reports during the weekend conversion or today. And both big and small financial institutions said the conversion had been easier and faster than they had expected. **********Deutsche Bank, which had more than 3,000 workers on duty over the weekend, said today that it had reprogrammed all its computers by 10 A.M. on Sunday. In London, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had wrapped up their work by Sunday evening. **********''It went absolutely perfectly, much faster than in our dress rehearsals,'' said Detlev Rahmsdorf, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank. **********Mitchell Shivers, head of Merrill Lynch's euro conversion project, was equally optimistic. ''It went tremendously and far exceeded our expectations,'' he said this afternoon in London. ''It's been unprecedented -- very unusual to see an industry pull together and accomplish something like this.'' **********Though many industry experts worry that smaller banks may turn out to be weak links in the chain of processing payments, executives at several smaller institutions said their conversion to the euro seemed to go smoothly, too. **********Vincenzo de Bustis, chief executive of Banca del Salento in southern Italy, said all the bank's operations seemed to be function properly when business started this morning. **********''We worked on the conversion all weekend,'' Mr. De Bustis said. As of early this morning, ''exchange operations and transfers both within Italy and abroad went without any problems,'' he added. **********Currency traders in Australia and Asia had already bid up the price of euros, and there was considerable evidence that Asian fund managers were buying euros as a hedge against global economic turmoil. The buoyancy continued after the European markets opened, though traders noted that the volume of activity in both stock and currency markets was very low. **********Economists said it would be a mistake to read much significance into the rising price of the euro, but they said the activity today was consistent with the general strength that  individual European currencies have enjoyed for much of the last year. **********''We predicted that the euro will be a stable currency, and that is what we are seeing today,'' said Petra Koehler, a senior economist at Dresdner Bank. ''I think there was also some relief that the conversion went well.'' **********All the effort for conversion was of little interest to ordinary bank customers and shoppers, who have heard so much for so long about the euro but cannot feel the soft comfort of a thick wad of bills or drop a shiny new euro coin into a vending machine. **********That most German stores continued to post prices only in marks today reflected, in part, a residual hostility toward the new currency among many Germans, who still treasure the mark as an anchor of stability. **********But it also reflects the fact that most people do not really need to do anything in euros for the time being. Executives for both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank said that far fewer than 1 percent of their customers had asked for euro-denominated bank accounts. **********''The euro is a great thing for Europe, but it makes no difference to me in my daily life,'' said Egon Weber, a customer at the Frankfurter Volksbank. ''If I had a lot of customers in other countries, a euro account might be useful. But for the moment, there isn't any point.'' **********Many German bank customers may soon be furious about the euro. Some banks say they will not process bank transfers if customers forget to specify on the form whether the payment is in euros or marks. **********''If a customer forgets to indicate the currency, we will have to clarify each case individually,'' said Herbert W. Staub, a board member at Frankfurter Sparkasse, a savings bank. **********In France, where the dream of a single European currency first took hold, stores and banks were far more hospitable to the euro. **********At the Virgin Megastore on the Champs-Elysees and at Galeries Lafayette, the flashy department store in downtown Paris, clerks said they had been taking euro-denominated checks since Saturday. **********Michel-Edouard Leclerc, head of the Leclerc chain of stores, went so far last weekend as to take a group of journalists along on a shopping trip in which he paid for his purchases with euro-checks. **********And Le Printemps, another big department store, is offering until Jan. 15 to deliver anything ordered from its Internet site anywhere in Europe for three euros, or roughly $3.50."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/05/business/international-business-postcommunist-media-deal-is-torn-by-personal.html": {"writer_name": "Ladka Bauerova", "pub_date": "1999-08-05", "snippet": "Uncertainty over whether Central European Media Enterprises Ltd or station's dismissed general director, Vladimir Zelezny, controls license of TV Nova, greatly popular Czech Republic television station, has driven down Central European's share pri...", "word_count": 1016, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Post-Communist Media Deal Is Torn by Personal Dispute", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Post-Communist Media Deal Is Torn by Personal Dispute", "body_text": " **********When Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. signed a merger agreement with SBS Broadcasting S.A. in March, the partners hoped to become one of the most powerful media networks in Central and Eastern Europe. **********But the company has since become entangled in a dispute that could result in the loss of its only money-making asset, a greatly popular television station in the Czech Republic called TV Nova. And now, the merger is in doubt. **********Established in the early 1990's by the cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder, Central European Media is a Bahamas-based broadcasting company that has been operating in the post-Communist lands of Eastern Europe. **********But after the company lost $125 million last year, the third money-losing year, Mr. Lauder struck a deal to merge the business with SBS Broadcasting, a Luxembourg-based media company, for $615 million in stock, payable to current Central European Media shareholders. Mr. Lauder would retain a 6 percent stake in the combined company. **********The marriage of SBS and Central European Media would create a broadcaster with 18 TV and 12 radio stations estimated to reach 150 million people in 13 countries, mainly in Scandinavia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Eastern Europe. **********But within weeks of the announcement, things started to go awry. On April 19, Fred Klinkhammer, Central European Media's president, dismissed the general director of TV Nova, Vladimir Zelezny, for what Mr. Klinkhammer called an accumulation of evidence that Mr. Zelezny had been cheating and stealing from the company. Mr. Zelezny denied the accusation and mounted a stunning counterattack -- seizure of TV Nova's broadcasting license. **********Mr. Zelezny contends that he controls the license through his 60 percent share in the license holding company CET 21. That company, in turn, was formed jointly by Mr. Zelezny and Central European Media's Czech subsidiary, Ceska Nezavisla Televizni Spolecnost in 1994. The dispute is now in the courts. **********The loss of a license for one TV broadcaster might ordinarily not be considered a deal breaker. But TV Nova is no ordinary broadcaster. Under Mr. Zelezny's guidance, it has become one of the most commercially successful media enterprises in the former Soviet bloc, scrapping its original intellectual programming in favor of a formula that ranges from schlock comedies to sensationalist news and dubbed reruns of ''Baywatch.'' **********TV Nova's most popular program is the 10 P.M. variation on TV weather reporting, ''Pocasicko'' (A Little Weather), a reverse striptease in which a naked male or female model dresses according to the next day's forecast. **********Uncertainty over who controls TV Nova's license has driven down Central European Media's share price to $6.35 from a high around $30 last year, and has become the main source of doubts about the company's merger with SBS Broadcasting. **********Both prospective partners have rejected speculation that the deal will collapse. ''Nothing has changed in this deal yet,'' Mr. Klinkhammer said, adding that the two companies are working closely, sharing staff and technical expertise. ''So although we are not married yet, we are dating a lot,'' he said. **********Others outside the companies are pessimistic. ''Nova is the only operation they have that's making any money,'' said Jake Waters, a London-based independent media analyst. ''If C.E.M. people don't win their legal battle, I'm sure SBS will want to renegotiate the deal. I can't see that they would go with the original conditions.'' **********Last year, TV Nova earned $55 million, securing 75 percent of Czech advertising revenue. **********After Central European Media's falling out with Mr. Zelezny, Moody's Investors Service lowered the company's debt rating to a speculative grade, Caa-1, and warned investors that the rating might be reviewed again with the ''direction uncertain.'' **********Mr. Zelezny said he was confident he would prevail and was determined to make TV Nova thrive. ''I can do without them,'' he said, referring to Central European Media and SBS, during a recent interview in his makeshift office attached to several half-finished broadcasting studios on the outskirts of Prague. **********Central European Media officials said Mr. Zelezny had been dismissed after they discovered that he had been using the company's Czech subsidiary to guarantee debts and had provided free or inexpensive advertising time to favored clients, including a mineral-water company he is said to have owned. ''He just stole from this company in a number of very deceitful and clever ways,'' Mr. Klinkhammer asserted. **********In April, Central European Media filed a lawsuit with the International Chamber of Commerce's Court of Arbitration in Paris in an effort to prove it was the rightful license holder for TV Nova. It also sued in the Czech courts to get the license back. **********The company won a preliminary victory on July 14 when the regional commercial court in Prague froze Mr. Zelezny's property until the dispute was resolved. But Mr. Zelezny is still holding the TV Nova license unless the courts determine that he does not own it. **********Calling the freezing of his property an ''irrelevant decision,'' Mr. Zelezny has continued to behave as though TV Nova belongs to him. Every Saturday at lunchtime, he broadcasts his own live program from his studio. The program, titled ''Call the Director,'' is 30 minutes of Mr. Zelezny's unrestrained editorial comment on topics ranging from the country's politics to his own dispute with Central European Media. **********Representatives of Central European Media appear to have no strong card up their sleeve. ''What's best for our shareholders is to put aside whatever personal differences we may have over his dismissal and deal with this on behalf of our shareholders,'' Mr. Klinkhammer said. ''So it is my continuous hope and belief that there will be a resolution to this. I just don't know what it will be.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/23/technology/l-incoming-working-off-the-clock-033782.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-12-23", "snippet": "Letter by Andy Sloan responds to Dec 16 article on employees using computers at work for personal reasons; says employers need to be realistic about human nature and keep their focus about whether employees are getting job done, not how they go ab...", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Working Off the Clock", "print_headline": "INCOMING; Working Off the Clock", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I hope that those companies that remind their workers not to use the company computer for personal business also post signs at their exits reminding employees not to think about work once they leave the office (''The Web: New Ticket to a Pink Slip,'' Dec. 16). **********I'll be the first to admit that I write personal e-mails, shop and look for information on hobbies while I'm at work.

One of his closest allies, Aryeh Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, was recently convicted on corruption charges. **********In Mr. Barak, Israelis consciously, or unconsciously, chose a former protege of the late Yitzhak Rabin, a man who faces, as Mr. Rabin once did, his first term in office after decades of experience as a commander but little experience in the consensus politics of governing. **********Mr. Barak deliberately evoked the link with Mr. Rabin throughout his campaign. Following his lead, his supporters spontaneously gathered on Monday night at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, where he ended up delivering a second victory speech. Many talked about his victory serving as a means for them to resolve the undigested trauma of Mr. Rabin's death. **********Mr. Barak, in the way he ran his very professional campaign, skillfully led them to those conclusions and associations. Gerald Steinberg, a political scientist here, called the campaign ''a triumph of avoidance.'' It was totally intentional. **********After three years of a Prime Minister who was the relentless subject of national attention, Mr. Barak bet that a low profile would be a strong selling point. And he did not bet blindly. Using an army of consultants, he conducted continuous field polls, and cross-tabulated the results with every sector of the population. **********Running for the top office in Israel is hardly an exercise in humility, and Mr. Barak has plenty of self-confidence. Yet as much as could be possible within the constraints of his character and the campaign, Mr. Barak did not blow his own horn. **********Time and again in the last few months, the trait he demonstrated most clearly was restraint. And in the volatile Mideast, that can be an  appealing characteristic. **********''Netanyahu is too provocative and too controversial to heal this nation,'' said Tamar Harel, a saleswoman in Jerusalem. ''For three years, everything has been about Bibi. It's time for Israel to be the important subject.'' **********Moshe Ben David, a hotel worker, agreed. ''Barak is my flavor of the day, because he's vanilla,'' he said. ''I'm dying to be bored. That would be so normal. To have a boring leader who just does his work.'' **********Brainy, competitive and capable of being a show-off, Mr. Barak resisted all temptation to display that part of himself on the public stage. Last week, he was on the verge of giving a classical piano concert to Russian immigrants in Rishon Letzion. But he must have sensed that while his direct audience would have loved it, the larger Israeli public might have been tempted to poke fun. He didn't play. **********Mr. Barak made a strategic choice to present himself as a calm, almost bland voice of reason and integrity: the dovish hawk, the Maimonides-quoting secular Jew. On Monday night, he quoted scripture and appealed to his ''brothers.'' **********It is true that many chose Mr. Barak because they did not like Mr. Netanyahu. For all those who admired the Prime Minister because he was ruthless, there were others who were depressed by the way he antagonized both associates and leaders of other countries. **********This election was clearly a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu, whose personality loomed large on the Israeli stage for the last three years. He galvanized the Israeli public in a way that is probably without precedent. Those who chanted ''Go, Bibi!'' at his rallies idolized him with a loyal passion; those who criticized him did so with what seemed to be outraged enmity. **********''Rabin was hated by the right-wing for his policies,'' Nachum Barnea, a columnist for the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper wrote. ''Netanyahu was hated both by left and right because of his character, because of his winks, because of his shocking appearances. The hatred went overboard -- what Menachem Begin could be forgiven for, Netanyahu could not.'' **********But Mr. Barak successfully co-opted a principal part of Mr. Netanyahu's appeal. Mr. Netanyahu has hammered the phrase ''peace with security'' into the Israeli psyche. Only he could deliver a peace agreement with teeth, he said, one that guaranteed Israel's security. **********With his military credentials, however, Mr. Barak seemed tough enough to many Israelis, and few believed that he would jeopardize Israel's security after a career spent fighting terrorism."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/18/business/study-finds-the-richest-got-richer-in-1998.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-05-18", "snippet": "Annual study of global wealth by Merrill Lynch & Co shows world's richest people got 12 percent richer last year; Merrill says combined wealth of world's almost six million 'high net worth individuals'--with net worth of at least $1 million--rose ...", "word_count": 127, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Study Finds the Richest Got Richer in 1998", "print_headline": "Study Finds the Richest Got Richer in 1998", "body_text": " **********The world's richest people got 12 percent richer last year despite the turbulence caused by the world economic crisis, according to an annual study of global wealth released today by Merrill Lynch & Company. **********Merrill Lynch said the combined wealth of the world's almost six million ''high net worth individuals'' -- with a net worth of at least $1 million -- rose to $21.6 trillion during 1998. **********By 2003, Merrill Lynch said in its third annual World Wealth Report, the rich will have become richer by a further 50 percent, putting their worth at $32.7 trillion. **********Merrill Lynch, which conducted the study in conjunction with Gemini Consulting, a management consultancy, attributed the increase largely to rising stock markets, reinvested dividends and an increase in global prosperity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/12/business/developer-raises-stake-in-mall-of-america.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-11-12", "snippet": "Simon Property Group raises its stake in biggest US shopping mall, the Mall of America, outside Minneapolis; Simon Property now owns half-interest in mall; buys stake from Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equity Fund; ...", "word_count": 173, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Developer Raises Stake in Mall of America", "print_headline": "Developer Raises Stake in Mall of America", "body_text": " **********The Simon Property Group said this week it had raised its stake in the biggest United States shopping mall, the Mall of America, outside Minneapolis. **********Simon Property, the largest developer of shopping malls in the United States, said it now owns a half-interest in the mall.

Wesley K. Clark, the rebels would have to withdraw from fortified positions held during the conflict with President Slobodan Milosevic's forces, turn over their heavy weapons and disband in two phases over 30 days. **********A NATO official said tonight that the commander of the security operation, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of Britain, expected to announce an agreement soon, but that details needed to be worked out. **********The rebel force's leaders have pledged to cooperate with NATO forces. But they have not shown much inclination to break up their insurgency -- just as it has become the dominant political and military force among the Kosovo Albanians. **********In town after town, including the capital, Pristina, the guerrillas' presence has grown each day, with their red-and-black flags adorning ''official'' buildings and their armed soldiers openly patrolling villages. **********The company of insurgents had just paraded through the village of Zegra, on their way to Gnjilane, when troops from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit confronted them early this morning a few miles to the north. The commander of Company K, Capt. David W. Eiland, said he first asked them to turn over their weapons voluntarily, beginning two hours of tense negotiations. **********When they continued to refuse, he ordered them surrounded and, with Apache and Cobra helicopter gunships hovering overhead, arrested six officers. **********It was not until eight hours after the confrontation began that the insurgents complied. ''We pretty much insisted they turn them over,'' Captain Eiland said of the weapons. **********Lieut. Col. Bruce A. Gandy, commander of the Marine ground force based at a chicken hatchery and slaughterhouse on a hill outside this village, said this evening that NATO would release the detained officers but would destroy the confiscated weapons. **********Until today, NATO's interaction with the Kosovo Liberation Army had been largely cordial and tolerant. The rebels view NATO as an ally in their struggle to win freedom for the predominantly Albanian population of Kosovo, and they have generally cooperated with the security forces. **********NATO commanders here have pledged to be evenhanded in securing peace in Kosovo after more than a year of civil war and 78 days of NATO air strikes. That also means protecting the Serbs in the province. **********With the insurgents' manning checkpoints in cities like Kacanik, Suva Reka and Prizren, and opening an office in the capital, thousands of Serbs have crammed their belongings in cars and fled, saying they feared reprisals from the rebels, whom they view as terrorists. **********The anxiety among Serbs has grown sharply as the last of Serbian-dominated Army and special police units withdrew from a large swath of Kosovo after NATO demands for a phased withdrawal by Sunday. **********The first phase of that withdrawal was supposed to have been complete  on Tuesday night. But NATO granted a 24-hour extension, saying the Yugoslav Army was making a concerted effort to leave but faced enormous logistical challenges in withdrawing 40,000 soldiers and police officers. **********A convoy of about 12 military vehicles left Pristina at noon today, escorting nearly as many civilian vehicles. When asked where she was going, a woman in one car said, ''We don't know.'' **********At the Army headquarters in the center of Pristina, a Serb, Verica Trajkovic, scolded one of the few soldiers who remained. ''You are leaving us alone,'' she said. ''What are we going to do without anyone to protect us?'' **********General Jackson has repeatedly tried to assuage such fears, though with little success. Today he met a large group of Serbs in Kosovo Polje, west of the capital, and told them that the terms for ending the NATO campaign against the Serbs required that the Kosovo Liberation Army be disbanded as an organized force. **********''This will require a strict program of certain actions which must be taken,'' he said, Reuters reported. **********In Pristina, Russian forces that arrived on Saturday remained at the airport. In Helsinki, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and his Russian counterpart, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, met and reported progress toward a solution. **********While the thirsty Russian troops awaited news, the British delivered bottled water to them and a Russian resupply convoy arrived. **********The Kosovo Liberation Army is not only a problem for NATO. One of its spokesmen, Jakup Krasniqi, told Agence France-Presse today that any Russian peacekeepers ''will be unwelcome here and we will treat them as an enemy force,'' a remark that set off a blistering objection from Russia's Foreign Ministry. **********The agreement under negotiation would more or less mirror the accord signed in March by leaders of Kosovo Albanians in Paris. It would require the rebels, now thought to number up to 17,000, to disband in a month and start training to become a police force for the province. **********The first phase of the pact would require the rebels to respect a cease-fire with the retreating Serbs and remain a little more than a mile from them. The insurgents would also have to keep that distance from main roads and security forces, a NATO official in Brussels said. **********In four days, the rebels would withdraw from the fortified positions that they held during the conflict. In a second phase, which beginning after seven days, the rebels would begin turning over heavy weapons, 12.7-millimeter or larger caliber. **********By the end of 30 days, the force would have to disband, ceasing organized maneuvers and other operations and shedding uniforms. **********A problem in negotiating with the Kosovo Liberation Army is its opaque command structure and internal divisions. ''The idea is to get something like the military technical agreement we have with the Serb forces,'' the NATO official in Brussels said. ''But a major question is whom do you talk to.'' **********The company confronted today, which had 116 soldiers, appeared to be highly organized, disciplined and armed. ''It was an organized unit,'' Colonel Gandy said. ''And they were loaded for bear.'' **********Their weapons, when stacked in a pile at the marines' camp near the village of Partes, reached waist high. In all, the marines confiscated 105 rifles, 10,000 rounds of ammunition and 45 grenades. There were two Dragonoff sniper rifles, one with a silencer, as well as land mines and TNT, presumably for ambushing Serbian forces."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/24/business/tracking-stocks-show-signs-of-respectability-at-age-15.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1999-11-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 327, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tracking Stocks Show Signs Of Respectability at Age 15", "print_headline": "Tracking Stocks Show Signs Of Respectability at Age 15", "body_text": " **********Once dismissed as gimmickry, tracking stocks have become an almost thoroughly mainstream way for big companies to highlight the performance of their far-flung units. **********Say a company generates most of its earnings making plastic.

He abruptly canceled a scheduled trip to Moscow in April, when Benjamin Netanyahu was still Israel's Prime Minister and prospects for a broader regional peace still looked grim. **********But the regional picture has changed sharply since the election in May of Ehud Barak as Israel's Prime Minister-elect. In recent days, there have been exchanges of signals from all sides of genuine interest in rekindling the quest for a broader peace. **********Now, on just three days' notice, Mr. Assad is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on Monday, in what appears to be a clear effort to enlist Syria's old patron once again on his behalf. **********In a scheduled meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Assad will certainly seek support for its longtime demand for the full return of the Golan Heights, the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 war. And Western diplomats say Mr. Assad will also seek Mr. Yeltsin's agreement to sell his country as much as $2 billion in arms, as he seeks to enter any peace talks from a position of strength. **********Syria, which has longtime budget problems, owes Moscow $12 billion to repay aid,  and that has been an obstacle to further arms sales in the past. But in recent months, the diplomats said today, there have been indications that Russia may be willing, at least for now, to set aside the unresolved debt, in the hope that renewing close ties with Syria may help Moscow to restore at least influence in the Middle East. **********''The timing is perfect for Assad,'' a Western diplomat who is based in Damascus said today. ''If Russia agrees to supply Syria with weapons, it will enhance Syria's position in negotiations with Israel.'' **********The trip by Mr. Assad, who will turn 70 this year and rarely travels outside his country, is expected to start off a travel blitz by key regional leaders. Mr. Barak is expected to travel to Washington in the next few weeks to meet with President Clinton, and he is also expected to meet soon with Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. **********And Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, whose country made its peace with Israel two decades ago, has pledged to resume an intermediary's role by meeting soon with Mr. Barak, Mr. Assad and Mr. Arafat. On Saturday, during a stop in France after a trip to the United States in which he met with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Mubarak said he was ''very optimistic for the future.'' **********''I am sure that the two main issues, that of the Palestinians and of Syria and Lebanon, will be treated with equal priority,'' he said after a lunch with President Jacques Chirac of France at Elysee Palace. **********One indication that all sides may be trying smooth the way to serious talks has been their tame response to Israel's air attack 10 days ago on sites in Lebanon, which killed nine people and wounded more than two dozen others. Mr. Barak distanced himself from the strike, which was launched by Mr. Netanyahu's outgoing Government in reply to cross-border missile attacks by guerrillas of Hezbollah, or Party of God. And Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon and a key Hezbollah sponsor, has shown a willingness to set the matter aside. **********''I think everyone is looking seriously now to the prospect of real negotiations,'' a Western diplomat said today. **********One reason for the Arab anxiousness, Syrian and Lebanese officials have said in recent interviews, is a real concern that Vice President Al Gore's election campaign may by year's end leave the Clinton Administration shy about weighing in seriously on matters of Middle East peace, given domestic America sensitivities. **********By contrast, the Kremlin, in an announcement on Friday, has said Mr. Assad was traveling to Russia at Mr. Yeltsin's official invitation -- a possible sign, Western diplomats say, that the unresolved dispute over Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo has left Mr. Yeltsin eager to find other ways to assert his country as a power broker. **********Any major arms purchase by Syria now, at a potentially crucial time in the peace effort, would certainly attract criticism from Israel. But Syria's military strength has withered badly in recent years, and Damascus could make the case that it would remain far from parity with Israel. **********According to Western diplomats, the centerpiece of the $2 billion arms deal under discussion by Syrian and Russian officials is an upgraded version of Russia's MIG-29 fighter aircraft, which has been in production only since December. **********The discussions have focused on anti-tank systems, a high priority to Syria but a subject that has prompted warnings from Washington that aid to Russia may be canceled if the sale of those weapons goes ahead. **********Syria is regarded by Washington as a key element in the Middle East process, but it also remains on a State Department list of nations that sponsor or support terrorism.

Still, they said, the planes have great advantages over conventional warplanes without such ''low-observability technology.'' **********''No one ever said the F-117 was an invisible plane that could not be shot down,'' said John E. Pike, a military affairs analyst with the Federation of American Scientists. ''It would be obviously incorrect to say this represents a failure of the technology. **********''Stealth technology is not like a 'cloaking device' from 'Star Trek.' In the real world, it makes an airplane difficult to detect, but not impossible.'' **********No warplane can be made totally undetectable. But the ability to make the Nighthawk and future models less obvious to radar and other sensors is improving in an effort to stay ahead of technology to detect them. **********''This is like a cat-and-mouse game between technologies,'' said Dr. Andrew F. Krepinevich, executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington-based study group. ''The U.S. has been ahead in its stealth technology for a while, but this kind of technical monopoly is unusual and can't last.'' **********Stealth features extend to the plane's two jet engines. The air intakes for the engines are covered with a mesh to keep radar signals from hitting spinning turbine blades, intensifying the signals, and engine exhaust exits the plane through slits that mix it with cold air, reducing the craft's infrared heat signature. **********The F-117 can show up on radar screens in a number of ways, experts said, including making sudden maneuvers at low altitude that can reflect signals to receivers in the area. Such turns and maneuvers are more likely over the mountainous terrain of Yugoslavia than the desert terrain of Iraq. **********Further, experts said, when the plane opens its bomb-bay doors to drop its 2,000-pound ''smart'' bombs, the doors produce a large radar ''reflection'' that can disclose the aircraft's location. **********''The plane is most vulnerable to detection when it drops its bombs,'' Mr. Pike said. **********The bombs themselves show up on radar screens, allowing an enemy to track them back to their source. **********The Air Force recently started coating the Nighthawk's bombs with a radar-absorbing coating, Mr. Pike said. **********Dr. Krepinevich said the type of enemy radar and its position also could help in detecting a stealth plane. **********The F-117 operates more effectively when American forces know the position of enemy radars so the plane can find its way through holes in a defense screen, he said, and tightly placed or unexpected radars operating at certain frequencies can detect the plane. **********Newer stealth aircraft like the B-2 bomber and the F-22 fighter have designs dramatically different from that of the F-117. The new planes have a more curved and streamlined appearance that developers say makes them even less detectable. **********Designers are incorporating stealth features into many new, more conventional warplanes, experts said, to lessen the possibility of detection but not necessarily to avoid it entirely. **********''You want the advantage of seeing the enemy before he sees you,'' said Daniel Goure, deputy director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ''even if it's only for a couple of minutes or a few seconds. If stealthiness allows you to get off the first shot, it's worth the effort.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/09/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-350982.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-11-09", "snippet": "Roundup of recent advertising account changes (S)", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; Accounts", "body_text": " *********** Marketshopper.com, New York, an on-line gift shopping Web site, to CMGCommunications, New York, as the first agency of record to handle its account.

The strategic reserve was conceived as a billion-barrel shield against gasoline lines like the ones during the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 and again during the Iranian revolution of 1979. **********But the reserve reached only a little more than half its expected level, and it has shrunk precipitously in the last few years as millions of barrels have been sold -- at a loss of $10 a barrel or so -- to help balance the Federal budget. And imports have grown by 60 percent since the Arab oil embargo as the country has switched to sport utility vehicles and domestic wells have run dry. **********The oil remaining in the reserve, 561 million barrels, represents about 60 days of imports. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and import levels were lower, the reserve had nearly 90 days' supply. **********Many oil experts, though doubtful that another war in the Mideast would produce shortages, given the free-flowing world oil market, say that crude oil would soar in price. **********Energy Secretary Bill Richardson plans on Thursday to announce that the Government will replace the 28 million barrels sold over the last few years at a rate of about 150,000 barrels a day, drawing on the Government's 200,000-barrel-a-day royalties from offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico. The Energy Department and the Interior Department, which collects the royalties, already have authority to transfer the oil and no Congressional action is needed, officials said. ''The time to take this step is now, when prices are low and when we can save for a rainy day,'' Mr. Richardson said in a telephone interview. Oil for March delivery settled in New York today at $11.75 a barrel; by contrast, the average purchase price of oil in the reserve is around $27 a barrel. **********At the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, John H. Lichtblau said that increasing the reserve was sensible.

She sits down at one of the trailer's 12 computers and begins to scroll through Web sites, her gray hair pulled back in a white kerchief. Her hazel eyes search the screen for names she has written on a crumpled paper she clutches in her hands. **********''Every day she comes in here and says to me, 'How can I find my children?' '' said Kujtim Latifi, a 17-year-old Albanian refugee and computer assistant who speaks enough English to translate for the United States Information Agency staff members in the trailer. **********Ms. Bajrami, a refugee, has four sons who are fighting for the Kosovo Liberation Army and a son and a daughter who she thinks are still in Kosovo. She recently heard from her brother that another son and his family are in Macedonia, but she has not been able to  get in touch with them. **********For now, the Internet is her only hope -- and in that sense, Ms. Bajrami is lucky. She has access to Web sites, to Internet radio broadcasts, to E-mail. Refugees in most other camps around Europe do not yet have Internet trailers like the one here; many are still relying on dribbles of information that come in letters or week-old newspapers. **********To change that, the information agency is coordinating the Kosovar Refugee Internet Assistance Initiative. The Internet trailer at Fort Dix is the project's first on-line center. A similar center in Germany just opened this week, said David Zweigel, the agency's  overseas technologist. Another center in Germany, two in France and two in Poland are also about to go on line, Mr. Zweigel said. Getting Internet access to the camps in Albania and Macedonia is trickier, because fewer Internet hubs were already in place, but officials hope to connect a pool of laptops in Macedonia via a satellite link this week and in Albania by mid-July. **********If the experience here is any indication, those centers will be packed as soon as they open. Since the Fort Dix trailer opened on May 20, Mr. Zweigel said, hundreds of refugees have visited it each day. **********On Tuesday, nearly 50 people had crowded into the 40-foot-long trailer. The sounds of multiple radio and video broadcasts -- all in  Albanian -- were bouncing off the trailer's walls. In one corner, six gray-haired men bent to the computer, listening. Next to them, Mr. Latifi helped Ms. Bajrami find a Web site that might enable her to send an E-mail message that could be delivered to the Macedonian refugee camp. **********At the other end of the trailer, a handful of teen-age boys sat stone-faced, scrolling through photographs of victims of a massacre that according to international monitors took place in Racak in January. The photos, displayed on an anti-Serb Web site called the Kosova Crisis Center, show slain men sprawled on the ground and a dead baby covered with cuts. **********When asked why the boys wanted to look at such horrific pictures, Mr. Latifi paused then spoke. ''Because they would like to see what the Serbs have done,'' he said. On Monday, he said, a man who was looking at the pictures ''saw his uncle, killed.'' Then, he said, the man looked away and cried. **********Providing open access to information is the U.S.I.A.'s primary mission, said Jonathan Spalter, associate director and chief information officer for the agency. **********''Access to objective and reliable information will be key to restoring structures of civil society for these terribly dispersed communities of Kosovars,'' he said. **********Reconnecting family members is also a major part of the project. On this Tuesday, a 20-year-old refugee named Liridon Durigi, whose parents are still in Kosovo, found that a cousin is now in a refugee camp in Albania. He found his cousin listed on a Web site called the Family News Network (www .familylinks.icrc.org/), which was opened in mid-May by the International Committee for the Red Cross. Pointing to the name, he asked a nearby computer assistant to help him send an E-mail message. **********If the Kosovo peace settlement is actually carried out, reliable connections between people could become even more important, Mr. Zweigel added. ''People will be able to correspond and say: 'I'm going home. You can come home, too,' '' he said. **********Until then, many visitors to the Internet trailer are happy to be able to read Albanian Web sites and hear Albanian news broadcasts. ''When these people came in and heard the news in their own language, it was amazing,'' Mr. Zweigel said. They had just arrived in the United States, with foreign customs and a foreign language spoken all around them. ''It was like they felt that this made them real people again,'' he said. **********More than a dozen companies and foundations are participating in the United States Information Agency project. Nongovernmental organizations and foundations are managing the donations and helping to distribute equipment. **********Other groups are directing projects that could tie into the agency's effort, like as a project led by professors and students at the Chicago-Kent College of Law. They have been helping organizations in Macedonia and Albania create a Web-based database of refugees' registration information and information about what they saw in Kosovo. **********But hurdles abound. The telephone system in northern Albania, for example, is so limited that stringing high-speed Internet lines is very difficult. And often the people that refugees have the least information about -- families hiding in Kosovo, for example -- are the least likely to provide  information on the Internet. **********Villarrubia Olga, an official for the Central Tracing Agency at the International Committee for the Red Cross, said that people inside Yugoslavia or in Macedonia are unlikely to give information because they fear being discovered by Serb forces.  ''They are more comfortable'' elsewhere in Europe, she said. **********Ms. Bajrami, meanwhile, sat in front of a computer here, her eyes welling up as she wondered aloud why she had not heard from her daughter and son still in Kosovo. **********But then her voice strengthened. ''Every day,'' she said, slapping her hands against her lap and looking around her, ''I will come until I find them.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/04/technology/game-theory-making-a-fortune-one-monster-at-a-time.html": {"writer_name": "J.

First you've got to capture them, and they bite you and stomp on you. Then you have to tame them, which means you need a place to keep them and train them, lots of resources and manpower and some kind of inventory system. You introduce digital technology, computer networks, commodity trading, database integration and electronic commerce. Pretty soon you're in the brokerage business, and your days as a hunter-gatherer are a distant memory. **********So it is with Pokemon (short for ''pocket monsters''), the wild virtual beasties roaming across Nintendo Game Boy screens worldwide. Starting with one monster, you raise and train it to fight whatever wild Pokemon cross your path. Once creatures are sufficiently weakened, they can be captured and tamed, then trained for battle. As their skills develop, they evolve into stronger and fiercer war dogs (or war slugs, or war rodents, or killer attack pigeons, as the case may be). **********The goal is to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer by battling and training 150 different monsters that roam wild in the game environment. You must also defeat eight other Pokemon trainers in combat. At that point, your own menagerie of bats and bugs and ferocious mackerel becomes even stronger and more ferocious, with awesome tail-whip and water-squirting capabilities. **********Combat is a very dramatic term for what goes on here. It's more like dueling data arrays. Even though you can collect scores of these animals, you can carry only six at a time. A big part of the strategy is deciding which monsters to use in each battle and how those monsters  should be deployed. **********This is an extremely complex set of decisions. First of all, these 150 monsters fall into 15 categories (flying, electric, plantlike, poisonous, icy, psychic and so on), and they all stack up differently against one another.  For instance, fire-type monsters are weak against water-type monsters, which don't do much damage to plant-type monsters. It's like playing  rock-paper-scissors with 15 variables instead of 3. **********Certain Pokemon have three different stages of evolution, and they typically evolve into more powerful versions of themselves as they gain experience. But sometimes they evolve into completely new monsters, and you have to decide whether you are going to throw ice water on that process to preserve a given monster for tactical reasons. **********Each monster has both offensive and defensive ratings that are built up during game play. So you also have to decide which monsters to cultivate and which to shelve. In addition, each monster can use only four different fighting moves, although many more are available. If your Pokemon learns a special new technique, you have to decide which of its previous abilities to discard. Some Pokemon can soften up a rival's defenses; others are better at full-bore attacks. So shuffling the batting order makes a difference. **********That is when you realize that Pokemon is a marvel of interface design. Witness the Pokedex, a self-described ''handheld personalized electronic encyclopedia containing all available knowledge about the known species of Pokemon.'' The Pokedex adds: ''Autosensor device triggers instantaneous database retrieval of any Pokemon within range. An invaluable tool for the serious Pokemon trainer.'' **********A virtual personal digital assistant, the Pokedex may be the first handheld consumer electronics device within a handheld consumer electronic device. But at any rate, it's very well designed. It displays the height, weight and text description of your Pokemon, along with images and sound samples of their squeaky war cries, plus detailed statistics about your current attack squad. It lists the items you're carrying, how much money you have and any special information you've collected on your travels. And all of this is clear and user-friendly on a 166-by-144-pixel L.C.D. screen, which is a miracle. If the Pokedex existed outside a video game, it could give the Palm Pilot a run for its money. **********In the world of Pokemon, such devices are a matter of course. This planet is wired to the gills. In every town, there is a Poke Center where all your monsters can be restored to full health, and in the corner of each Poke Center is a tiny personal computer hooked into the Poke Net. Log into the PC and you can upload and download Pokemon from the central Poke Server. **********Another corner of the Poke Center is reserved for the Link Cable Club, which is for two players who have connected their Game Boys with a cable (sold separately). They go to the nearest Poke center, walk into the Cable Club and find a virtual meeting room. They view each other's Pokemon statistics and decide whether to fight or barter. Someone makes an offer. A request to confirm the deal shows up a second later on the other player's screen. If that person approves, the fight begins, or the trade goes through. It's a baby step toward on-line banking. **********Ultimately, the real action in this game is trading and transactions.  There are two different versions of the cartridge, blue and red, each containing different monsters, and if you want a complete collection, you have to trade with a friend who has the ones you're missing. Some Pokemon will evolve when you trade them. And all Pokemon that are traded grow faster than Pokemon that haven't been traded. **********At some point, hunting wild Pokemon stops making economic sense. You can get so much farther as a day trader, churning high-growth Pokemon on the open market. At lunch. Recess. On the bus. It doesn't take a rocket scientist (or even a fourth grader) to figure this out. **********To date, more than a million of these cartridges have been sold, and the Poke brokers and market makers are out in force. ''Kids are selling Pokemon in the schoolyard, individual monsters for five bucks apiece,'' said Eileen Tanner, a Nintendo spokeswoman. No doubt, a Pokemon futures market is imminent. And these are 10-year-olds. In 20 years, these people are going to be running the stock market. **********Heaven help the Dow. **********(Published by Nintendo for the Game Boy; $29.95; for all ages.)"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/30/world/poland-s-glossy-capitalism-displays-a-darker-underside.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1999-09-30", "snippet": "Capitalism is very much in evidence in Warsaw decade after fall of Communism, but beneath impressive veneer, all is not well with Polish success story; low wages, rising unemployment, series of Government scandals and crisis on farms have enabled ...", "word_count": 1258, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Poland's Glossy Capitalism Displays a Darker Underside", "print_headline": "Poland's Glossy Capitalism Displays a Darker Underside", "body_text": " **********In the entrance to the offices of his growing movement, called Self-Defense, Andrej Lepper displays a framed quotation from Pope John Paul II: ''It is unacceptable to claim that after the fall of Communism, capitalism is the only alternative.'' **********A decade after the change known to Poles as ''the revolution,'' capitalism is very much in evidence here. Banners advertising Internet services hang from Stalin's vast Palace of Culture, mobile phones are de rigeur with the smart set, Western cars sit in bottlenecks where poky Fiat Polskis once made their way down empty streets. **********But beneath this impressive veneer, all is not well with the Polish success story. Low wages, rising unemployment, a series of Government scandals and a crisis on the farms, which still provide about 20 percent of Poles with their livelihood, have enabled Mr. Lepper to gain prominence with a potent brew of populism and nationalism. **********''The rights of our people are being trampled,'' Mr. Lepper said, sitting beneath a crucifix and a banner saying Poles will defend what is theirs. ''Our industry and land are being sold off, much of it to Germans. I often say that what Hitler failed to do by murdering millions is today being achieved by economic means.'' **********This farmer from northern Poland represents a minority view, but he has proved highly effective of late. Last week, he figured prominently in the largest demonstration here in some time, when about 50,000 people gathered in central Warsaw. All the disaffected turned out: farmers, miners, the unemployed, underpaid teachers and nurses, steelworkers and arms industry employees. **********Revolutions, of course, are topsy-turvy affairs. But it was a measure of the long road traveled in Poland that the workers were protesting against a Solidarity-led Government when, in 1980, it was the Solidarity union that first gave them an independent voice. Then, in 1989, Solidarity delivered the Soviet bloc's first bloodless transition. **********That, however, is history. Protest is one thing, the realities of Government another. And Poland, like the rest of central Europe, has discovered that a rising capitalist tide does not lift all boats. Some are bound to sink, not necessarily in silence. **********But just months after Poland's entry into NATO, the country is suffering more than the inevitable costs of change. Apparent misjudgments by the center-right Government of Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, whose approval rating has plunged to 20 percent, has sharpened frustrations, bringing people into the streets and raising eyebrows in Washington. **********The goings-on combine the burlesque with what often looks like plain incompetence. Pensioners are left unpaid because of computer glitches, the Interior Ministry has been left headless, generals and officials with high NATO clearance have been left jobless, and a sensitive safe has been left without a key. **********''In the world today, you go further on credibility than anything else,'' said Wanda Rapaczinsky , a prominent publisher. ''And right now our credibility is sinking in a way that could impede our economy. I understand our NATO friends are seriously unhappy, and frankly I don't blame them.'' **********First the Interior Minister, Janusz Tomaszewski, was forced out this month after reports surfaced that he had collaborated with the secret police of the former Communist regime. In his wake, under similar suspicions, a general in charge of one of Poland's elite combat units that has worked closely with NATO also departed. The general, Slawomir Petelicki, was not happy and took with him the key to what was reported to be a safe containing top-secret NATO documents. **********This in turn led the acting Interior Minister, Janusz Palubicki, whose sloppy dress has given cartoonists here a field day, to order agents to blast open the safe in the depths of the night. At this point, naturally, the cartoonists went wild. **********At the same time, another official with top NATO clearance, the former Deputy Defense Minister, Robert Mroziewicz, was also forced out after his role under the Communists was questioned. **********In effect, after leading the way in central Europe's ''velvet'' transitions, Poland has abruptly found the past rearing its head in disruptive ways. Entrance into NATO was supposed to symbolize stability, an accolade after a decade of consolidation. **********But the governing coalition of Solidarity Election Action and the Freedom Union reflects a broad and unwieldy spectrum. While there are many pragmatists, who value stability over a quest for justice, there are also vocal Solidarity hard-liners who want all collaborators with the Communists rooted out. **********''We are trying to walk forward with our heads turned backward,'' said Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the man who imposed martial law in 1981 and later negotiated a peaceful passage to democracy with Solidarity. ''No wonder we keep knocking into trees and falling into holes. The danger now is one of a witch hunt.'' **********Krzysztof Luft, the Government spokesman, denied that there was any witch hunt, but conceded that ''the longer investigations are delayed, the more doubts and tensions appear.'' He added that it was ''essential to complete the process of vetting'' designed to insure that anyone with a public post has an untainted past. **********The tensions over Poland's decade-old transition have been exacerbated by economic difficulties that have come to a head in recent months. The zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year, a once highly-flying stock market has been pummeled, unemployment is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has boiled over. **********In addition, the Russian crisis has hit Poland hard, effectively removing an important export market for farm goods and other products, and cutting off what was known as ''the unofficial market.'' This consisted of itinerant Russians traveling to Warsaw and other cities to buy Polish goods for resale at home. **********If a single difficulty has captured the problems of a Government now widely perceived as caring more for the view of international markets than the poor, it is the debacle at Poland's Social Insurance Office, known by its Polish acronym of Z.U.S. **********A new computer system has proved incapable of discovering which companies are not paying premiums, and payments to many pensioners have been delayed by administrative confusion. An abruptly discovered shortfall of about $1 billion will have to be plugged from the state budget. **********''We have called for the Government's resignation because of the ineptitude evident at Z.U.S.,'' said Marek Borowski, a leader of the opposition Alliance of the Democratic Left. ''Mr. Buzek has lost the support of the people by pursuing a doctrinaire approach of deficit reduction, while public money was needed as a buffer for our social crisis.'' **********There is no question that word of pensioners without their paychecks, farmers unable to sell their produce, and nurses with wages of $200 a month has hurt the Government at a time when the conspicuous consumption of the relatively small group comprising Poland's newly rich is evident to all. **********Mr. Buzek said this week that he was ''aware of the mistakes,'' and that he intended to listen more ''to the needs of ordinary people.'' But he is also aware that the markets that could so easily pull the plug on Poland are watching closely for any relaxation of fiscal discipline. His room for maneuver appears limited. **********As a result, a winter of discontent seems likely. Mr. Lepper, who said the price for his hogs was now so low he could no longer make a living, is working on building ''a peasant-national bloc'' to disrupt the Government. **********''We already have over 500,000 sympathizers, people who will no longer tolerate Poland being sold while they live below the poverty line,'' he said. ''We plan to continue our street protests and if necessary move to a general strike.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/04/technology/online-shopper-buying-groceries-online-forget-about-lamb-shanks.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Slatalla", "pub_date": "1999-11-04", "snippet": "Michelle Slatalla (Online Shopper) evaluates Internet grocery shopping; finds her great expectations of avoiding checkout line diminished by poor distribution system in New York area; also notes online grocers may not offer generic and store brand...", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Buying Groceries Online? Forget About Lamb Shanks", "print_headline": "ONLINE SHOPPER; Buying Groceries Online? Forget About Lamb Shanks", "body_text": " **********IF MY expectations for online grocery shopping were high, it was because I had heard many wondrous stories: of delivery ''ambassadors'' in Chicago who arrived at the door anxious whether the bananas were exactly ripe, of customers in Boston with refrigerators in their garages to accommodate round-the-clock ice cream delivery, of lucky mothers in Seattle who had not been inside a supermarket with a screaming child in months. **********What could be more perfect, I thought, than to order what I needed to make roasted lamb shanks for dinner. I was pretty excited as I drew up my debut shopping list -- meat, carrots, parsnips, beef broth, fresh rosemary, leeks, onions -- because I pictured myself finally escaping the tyranny of the supermarket system. Never again would I wait in a checkout line for 20 minutes, lug heavy bags to the car in the rain or revisit the deli aisle where, a couple of months back, the baby ripped open a plastic tub of red Jell-O and squished gobs of it into her hair. **********But when I logged on to compare the services of some leading online grocers -- Peapod, Netgrocer, Homegrocer, Streamline and Homeruns -- I realized that this was not going to be as easy as I had hoped. In fact -- let's not mince words -- there seemed to be a huge problem. Every time I typed in my ZIP code, I was taunted by a response like Peapod's: ''Local Delivery Currently Unavailable.'' **********As I discovered, none of the these online grocers offered local delivery in my neighborhood on Long Island. Unwilling to abandon my vision of the friendly delivery ambassador knocking on my door -- I imagined him in a uniform shirt with his name (Bud) sewn above the pocket -- I broadened my search. **********I went to my favorite comparison-shopping sources, www.gomez.com, which publishes useful scorecards ranking all kinds of online businesses. But of the 10 companies the site had reviewed, none offered local delivery in my area. **********I phoned Nick Karris, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors, to complain. But even after I explained the magnitude of the situation, including the fact that my family, who tend to get pretty surly when hungry, had been promised lamb shanks by 7 p.m., Mr. Karris seemed unmoved. **********''Where you live on Long Island, coverage is pretty thin,'' Mr. Karris said. ''In fact, the whole New York area is a bit of an anomaly because distribution is so difficult there. But really, to be fair, you have to look at the big picture.'' **********''Where do you live?'' I asked suspiciously. ''Boston area, right?'' **********''Yes,'' he replied, ''we have four major players who compete here. My groceries can be waiting for me in the garage, in a little refrigerator that one company put in there free of charge, or I can schedule any time I want them to arrive up until about 10 o'clock at night, so they're there right when I get home and want to make dinner. **********This was not improving my mood. Nor did it help to learn that most of America was in the same boat. Industry analysts estimate that online grocers are offering local deliveries to only a relatively few lucky shoppers who live in selected areas of the nation's 30 most populated metropolitan centers. **********Hearing that made me wonder what the holdup was. After all, some of these companies have been in business for several years. Peapod was founded in 1989. **********A Peapod spokeswoman, Paula Wheeler, tried to explain. **********''It's complicated,'' Ms. Wheeler said. ''We're constantly opening up new markets as fast as we can, but we have to find local retail partners to operate distribution centers, and we have to know that we will have enough customers to fill up a whole truck route. **********''We've come a long way from when we started out 10 years ago in a suburb of Chicago. We used to drive to the store and shop for a customer and then drive it right to their house.'' **********Believe me, I'd settle for that. For now, the only online option for me -- and most of America -- is to order from companies that will mail groceries, a process that can take several business days. **********To test the usefulness of this option, I placed mail orders for groceries with two companies: Netgrocer and Peapod. It took about 20 minutes to register and navigate each well-designed site, search the respective inventories of 7,000 items -- Peapod -- and 10,000 items -- Netgrocer -- for what I wanted and place orders for nonperishables like toilet paper, beef broth and Cheerios. **********Both sites sent immediate e-mail to confirm the order and allowed me to change it before it was mailed. **********Neither company will send fresh fruits or vegetables or even frozen foods through the mail, so my family can just forget about the lamb shanks. And you may have to wait days and days for delivery. My Netgrocer order arrived 24 hours after I placed it, but Peapod took four business days, or a total of six days, including the weekend. **********And mail-order online grocers may not offer generic and store brands. Since I typically buy inexpensive store brands of staples like one-liter bottles of seltzer (49 cents), Peapod's mail-order price of $1.19 for Schweppes seemed too much to pay for convenience. **********And don't forget to add the shipping fee: Netgrocer charged $5.99 on an order that cost $26.13, and that increases with the size of the order, depending on where you live, up to $73.99 for orders of $800 or more. Peapod, which has a different distribution system, charges a flat shipping rate of $7.95. **********Unpacking the orders from their big cardboard boxes, I was delighted with how much more pleasant and convenient it was to have groceries delivered to my doorstep than to drive to the store and get them myself. **********Except for the selection offered by Peapod and Netgrocer, the service was about the same, so yes, I would order again from both companies -- particularly if I wanted to order a year's worth of toilet paper, say, or arrange to have groceries shipped ahead to the Nantucket cottage we rent each summer. **********Another plus: both companies also stock some hard-to-find cult favorites like Quisp cereal (available from Netgrocer) and cans of Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes with Green Chili (at Peapod). **********But for dinner? I went to the supermarket -- where I avoided the deli aisle."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/15/news/in-britain-schools-repackage-softer-image.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Rosen", "pub_date": "1999-02-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "In Britain, Schools Repackage Softer Image", "print_headline": "In Britain, Schools Repackage Softer Image", "body_text": " **********LONDON\u2014                     For generations, parents have sent their children to British boarding schools for an experience often described as \"toughening up.\" But economic times and social attitudes have changed. These days, cold dormitories and colder showers are more likely to put off, rather than attract, prospective parents \u2014 not to mention their progeny. And the schools themselves have had to learn a hard lesson: adapt or die. **********Government statistics show there were 814 private-sector boarding schools in England in 1993; in 1998, there were 772. Today's industry is stronger and leaner, advocates say, but most definitely not meaner. **********The boarding experience today would be largely unrecognizable to the \"old boys and girls\" of yore. And while many schools used to rely heavily on family descendants to fill the rolls, these days it is rare to find a boarding school without a designated marketing person. **********\"Schools have become much more of a service industry\" over the last four or five years, \"very conscious of their customer and providing what their customer needs,\" said Ann Williamson of the Boarding Education Alliance, a promotional group representing about 180 schools. **********\"The schools have in fact changed, but the public doesn't seem to be aware of this,\" Ms. Williamson said. Today, she said, \"What you get out of boarding school is continuity, consistency and security.\" She added, \"It's not sending your child 'away.' It's giving your child a second home.\" **********Research commissioned by the Boarding Education Alliance in 1996 found that, in order to survive, boarding schools had to update their image and aim it at different groups: new money as well as old, first-time boarding families as well as longtime ones, students as well as parents. **********Today's customers want boarders to be comfortable, well fed and easily accessible to their families, Ms. Williamson said, adding that 40 percent of boarders' parents live within an hour's drive. **********\"I was very lucky if I ever got to see my parents at all in three months,\" recalled Jane Laing, head of Friends' School, Saffron Walden, in Essex. And she couldn't call home either. Today, most students at Friends' have phone cards, \"and they can telephone their parents anytime they want, within reason,\" she said. Many schools offer regular e-mail contact as well. **********- **********OFTEN, the schools said, day pupils actually ask to board. At St. Andrew's School in Eastbourne, research found many day pupils wanted to sleep at school. **********So two years ago, St. Andrew's began the \"sleep-over.\" Parents can phone on little or no notice and get their child dinner, bed and breakfast for \u00a315 ($20) a night. \"We can provide teddy bears and we can provide toothbrushes,\" said Pam Duffill, an English teacher who also serves as director of marketing. \"When you're thinking about paying a baby-sitter, you're evidently better off.\" **********It has been such a success \u2014 bed occupancy jumped 400 percent in the first year \u2014 that St. Andrew's now offers five nights for the price of four, Ms. Duffill said. Full-time boarding becomes increasingly popular as final exams approach, she added. **********Such \"flexi-boarding\" has become a pillar of boarding school success, answering the needs of parents with business trips as well as those of students with extracurricular activities. **********Friends' even offers sleep-over weekends built around sports and arts and crafts, which are aimed as much at children from other schools as their own. \"It isn't the kind of thing that we would have been doing five years ago,\" Ms. Laing said. \"We do a lot more active marketing as a school than we used to.\" **********Near York, Queen Ethelburga's College, a secondary school, uses national TV and radio and worldwide print ads to trumpet its many attractions. Bedrooms (some singles) are equipped with satellite TV and video, plus pay phone with answering machine, CD-player and heated towel rack. Older girls (boys board only until age 11) have access to a sauna and solarium. **********Queen Ethelburga's was founded in 1912; in 1991, it was bought by a parent/businessman and moved to its present site. Over the years, more has changed than just what meets the eye, said the principal, Erica Taylor. While students are still largely white, she said, the socio-economic mix of families, as well as what they want out of boarding school, is much different. **********Previously, \"The children we had had mothers who were old girls, whereas our present population are almost exclusively first-time buyers,\" Ms. Taylor said. \"Before it used to be old money, and now it's new money.\" **********The vast majority of Queen Ethelburga's graduates go on to higher education, compared with about 10 percent in the old days, Ms. Taylor said. \"On the old site we were academically reasonable, and it would be fair to say we turned out young ladies,\" she said. \"Now we are academically good,\" and turning out \"career women.\" **********BARBARA ROSEN is a freelance journalist based in London."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/14/business/private-sector-top-hat-for-a-bad-boy.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1999-11-14", "snippet": "Federal District Judge Shira A Scheindlin is about to rule on whether United Way of America must pay 'top hat' pension to its former president William V Aramony, who is in federal prison for embezzlement (S)", "word_count": 252, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'Top Hat' for a 'Bad Boy'?", "print_headline": "PRIVATE SECTOR; 'Top Hat' for a 'Bad Boy'?", "body_text": " **********As early as this week, a federal judge will decide how much more United Way of America must pay to its former president, William V.

He claims to have inspired ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' the 1952 novella  about an old Cuban fisherman from Cojimar who catches a giant fish and then has to battle sharks for it. **********But Mr. Fuentes has not bothered to read this or any of his friend's other books. **********''What for?'' he said in a bellicose tone. ''I've lived them with him.'' **********Mr. Fuentes is a fixture on a Cuban tourist trail dedicated to Hemingway, an American whom Cuba flaunts as a national treasure despite four decades of hostility between Fidel Castro's Government and the United States. This year, the centennial of Hemingway's birth, commemorations in Cuba include an international colloquium of Hemingway historians and ballet and symphony galas. **********Hemingway, who lived, wrote, drank and fished in this island intermittently between 1932 and 1960, is hard to miss in Cuba. His books sell in Government curio shops alongside left-wing works by Che Guevara. His likeness adorns T-shirts and billboards, and a bronze bust of him donated by local fishermen looks out to the sea from a small rotunda here. And his name is attached to landmarks like parks and marinas, to fishing tournaments and to sugar-free daiquiris. **********Just as the writer has been thoroughly exploited for tourism in places like Key West, Fla., which drew criticism from the writer's three sons a couple of years ago for tarnishing Hemingway's image with too much banality, cash-starved Cuba has not let Communism stand in the way of foreign exchange. **********A tour of Hemingway sites, including the lush estate outside Havana where the writer lived with Martha Gellhorn and Mary Welsh, his third and fourth wives, cost anywhere from $15 to $40 a person. A ''Papa Hemingway'' daiquiri (lime and grapefruit juice, maraschino and a double shot of white rum) at his old drinking haunts like El Floridita in Old Havana costs $6. **********And Mr. Fuentes's 45-year-old grandson, Rafael Valdes, charges visitors $50 for 15 minutes of the captain's time, although haggling can cut the price by more than half. **********Still, American visitors and some Hemingway family members note a special reverence for the man in enemy territory, a personal appropriation by Cubans of a great writer who chose to celebrate their country in his prose. **********''Over there, it's like he's more of a real person,'' said Mina Hemingway, 38, a granddaughter of the writer who lives in Florida and has twice won the Ernest Hemingway fishing tournament held at Marina Hemingway in Havana, in the women's division. ''They seem to have a real respect, almost awe, for him and his work.'' **********The feeling was mutual. In his book ''Hemingway in Cuba'' (Lyle Stuart, 1984), the exiled Cuban writer Norberto Fuentes, no relation to the captain, said Cuba first lured Hemingway, who used the island as backdrop for ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' ''To Have and Have Not'' and ''Islands in the Stream,'' with its abundant marlin fishing, its beautiful scenery and its low cost of living. But in the end, Mr. Fuentes said, ''Cuba won him completely.'' **********''There he settled, lived, worked, made friends, enjoyed life and transformed his surroundings into art,'' Mr. Fuentes wrote. ''What more could a writer demand from his abode?'' **********When the cold war, and the United States' break with Cuba after the 1959 revolution, interfered in this love affair, ''it was a great tragedy for our family,'' Patrick Hemingway, 70, one of the author's sons, said from Montana. **********''Any American living in Cuba had to choose,'' he said, adding that not being able to return to Cuba contributed to his father's depression, which ended with his suicide in 1961. ''He really loved Cuba, and I think it was a great shock to him at his age to have to choose between his country, which was the United States, and his home, which was Cuba.'' **********Today, much of Hemingway's life on the island, where the Roman Catholic Church keeps the Nobel Prize medal he won for literature in 1954 and dedicated to Cuba's patron saint, Our Lady of Charity of Cobre, is documented in black and white photographs that hang from walls in his house and bar-restaurants he frequented like El Floridita in Old Havana and La Terraza in Cojimar. **********Some pictures show him handing out fishing tournament trophies to a young Fidel Castro in 1960, the only time the two met. Although Mr. Castro has called Hemingway his favorite author, the extent of the writer's support for the revolution has been the subject of debate. **********Pictures also show Hemingway carousing with the likes of Errol Flynn and Gary Cooper. But it was his lack of pretension, notwithstanding his fame, that makes the writer stand out for many Cubans. **********''He was very simple,'' said Evelio Gonzalez, a tour guide at the house on a hill Hemingway bought in 1940 known as Finca Vigia. ''His friends were fishermen. He never related to high society.'' **********At the house, now a museum preserving the home just as the writer left it (visitors can only peek from the windows), other passions are in evidence -- bullfighting artwork, including a plate with a drawing of a bull's head by Picasso; hunting trophies from safaris in Africa; more than 8,000 books. **********Outside, the fishing yacht Pilar,  donated to the museum by Mr. Fuentes, to whom the writer bequeathed it, sits in a special shed. **********Mr. Fuentes, a Spaniard who moved to Cuba as a child, said he met Mr. Hemingway in 1928 in Dry Tortugas off Florida after both were caught in a storm. In 1934, after  Hemingway had visited Cuba several times, Mr. Fuentes said, ''he told me I'm building a boat and I want you to work with me and be the captain.'' **********Mr. Fuentes, the ''Antonio'' in ''Islands in the Stream,'' was both skipper and cook, becoming a constant companion who took part even in  Hemingway's missions on the Pilar hunting German submarines off the coast of Cuba during World War II. He remembers the author as ''a man apart,'' worldly and capable of immense generosity and valor. **********''Imagine what kind of man he was that, when we were in Africa, he ordered us to hush and not move because he could smell the lion that was coming to eat him up,'' Mr. Fuentes recalled recently. ''The lion came and scratched him and he stuck his gun into its mouth and killed him.'' **********''Everywhere he went people treated him like a god just arrived from heaven,'' he added.

They succeeded in delaying a handover of the investigation to the FBI. **********U.S. investigators have gradually moved toward the conviction that Mr. Batouti, 59, acting while he was briefly alone in the cockpit, uttered a prayer, plunged the plane into a sharp descent, then struggled to keep its nose down as the captain returned and fought desperately to forestall a calamity. **********All 217 aboard died in the Oct. 31 crash of what was scheduled as a New York-Cairo flight. **********A widely, if unofficially, reported portion of the audio tape recovered from the wreckage has Mr. Batouti saying, \"I put my trust in God,\" shortly before the autopilot was switched off and the Boeing 767 began its fatal dive. The voice of the captain, apparently returning to the cockpit, is then heard, saying, \"What's going on?\" and then \"Pull with me! Pull with me!\" **********Ambassador Nabil Fahmy said Thursday that he had listened to the tape and that it did not appear t o point to suicide. Egyptians, he said, were \"angry about the way this is being reported.\" **********He cautioned against leaping to conclusions as, he noted, happened with the Oklahoma City bombing of a federal building in 1995, when Islamic militants were at first suspected, or with the bombing at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, which was wrongly attributed to a security guard. **********Even as leaks have continued from the investigation, virtually all pointing to Mr. Batouti's suspected role, U.S. officials have sought to defuse Egyptian anger. Mr. Holder said that Egyptian cooperation had been excellent. **********At the same time, he indicated that the investigation would not be guided from Cairo. \"I would not say anything is contingent upon the approval of the Egyptian government,\" he said. **********Mr. Batouti's family has rejected suggestions that he was suffering from financial woes or psychological depression. He was not an Islamic extremist, they say, nor, as a Muslim, would he have considered suicide, let alone what would amount to mass homicide. **********Amid the confusion and sharp dissent over what the tapes reveal, the next few days of listening, translating and analyzing the data for context \u2014 and correlating what was said with information on when different cockpit controls were activated \u2014 could prove crucial. **********The National Transportation Safety Board, which has found no sign of any mechanical disability in the Boeing 767, said it would work through the weekend to provide a \"literal, factual transcript of all conversations and sounds\" aboard the plane. **********A meticulously coordinated time line could answer key questions. A prayer by the co-pilot would have a dramatically different meaning if uttered just before he sent the plane into a dive than if it came after he had discovered some grave mechanical malfunction. Or if, as some Arabic speakers say, his prayer was a commonplace one, of the sort heard in some countries even when one boards a taxi. **********On Thursday, Abdel-Fattah Kato, head of the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, and the EgyptAir operations manager, Hassan Misharrafa, arrived in Washington to help review the tapes. **********But the data analysis will not be an easy task, and it is not clear whether the American and Egyptian authorities will ultimately be able to agree on all points. **********U.S. officials said it could take five days for a precise transcription of the final minutes of the flight to be completed. **********The analysis now involves safety board experts, FBI agents, outside translators and Egyptian specialists. For the first time Thursday, representatives of Boeing Co. and of Pratt & Whitney, which built the plane's jet engines, were included in meetings to listen to the tape, along with officials of the Federal Aviation Administration. **********The problem of understanding and translating the taped voices of the crewmen has been a thorny one. Different interpreters have rendered various phrases differently. **********The stakes are considerable and help explain some of the U.S.-Egyptian friction. The countries work closely on many issues. Egypt is one of the largest recipients of U.S. aid. **********Some Egyptians, however, suspect that U.S. authorities are acting to protect the interests of Boeing. Egyptian officials fear that their vital tourism industry might be damaged by any doubts about EgyptAir planes or crews. **********There is also the question of what could be a huge legal liability bill. **********On Wednesday, a dollars 50 million wrongful-death lawsuit was filed by the estate of a New Jersey man, Ghassan Koujan, 38, of Paterson, who died in the crash. **********The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, named EgyptAir and Boeing as defendants. **********Family members, meanwhile, continued to protest reports that Mr. Batouti might have had reason to kill himself. A report that the co-pilot had sent money back with a colleague a day before returning himself was explained by a son, the Los Angeles Times reported. The son, Mohammed, a police officer, said he personally had asked his father to send dollars 300 as soon as possible **********A nephew, Sharif Batouti, denied that medical bills for Mr. Batouti's daughter had left the family in financial difficulty.

Its shares, which closed up 50 cents at $18.9375 on the New York Stock Exchange, slipped as low as $17 in after-hours trading. **********Today's warning comes after a similar statement a month ago, when Advanced Micro said that pricing pressures on microprocessors might leave it with a loss for the quarter, prompting a two-day rout of the technology-laden Nasdaq stock market. Advanced Micro said then that price cuts by the rival Intel Corporation would prevent it from realizing the benefit of increased production volumes of its fastest chips. **********Analysts were already projecting a loss of 9 cents a share, according to the First Call Corporation, which tracks company earnings. Advanced Micro lost $55.8 million, or 39 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. **********But S. Atiq Raza, Advanced Micro's co-chief operating officer and chief technical officer, said today that the company would fall short of its goal of shipping 5.5 million units of its K6 family of microprocessors in the current quarter, leading to an operating loss. **********''We expect to ship no more than five million units of AMD-K6 family products in the first quarter,'' Mr. Raza said during remarks delivered at the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Semiconductor and Systems Conference in Laguna Niguel, Calif. **********Mr. Raza blamed lower yields in the first eight weeks of the quarter for the shortfall and said that subsequent modifications had improved production volume of the company's fastest chips. **********Drew Peck, an analyst with S. G. Cowen Securities, said this explanation left too many unanswered questions. ''It would seem to be a resurrection of the same problem that caused them to disappoint in the fourth quarter,'' he said. ''You're looking at a company that has struggled with yields for years, and which is now facing the toughest pricing environment it's ever seen. It's not a pretty picture.'' **********Indeed, analysts who have covered the semiconductor industry have seen this situation before. Intel introduces a new generation of microprocessor; Advanced Micro rushes to offer a compatible product but runs into manufacturing glitches that keep volumes low. Then, when Advanced Micro catches up and is ready to begin shipping increased numbers, Intel cuts prices and gets ready for the next generation of chip. **********''A.M.D.'s No. 1 problem has always been manufacturing,'' said Jonathan Joseph, an analyst with Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. The K6 ''is a good part, and they've taken a ton of market share, but they just can't manufacture them at a profit,'' he said. **********''The problem is we need a viable competitor to Intel just to keep the market healthy,'' Mr. Joseph added. ''It's probably not a good thing for consumers for the second-tier player to be losing so much money.'' **********Last month, Advanced Micro announced that Gateway had begun using its microprocessors and said that market research results showed that its share of the retail desktop PC market had passed that of Intel for the first time. Advanced Micro is particularly strong in this segment because it was first to market with a microprocessor aimed specifically at computers that cost less than $1,000, which have become the fastest-growing part of the business. **********''Demand for our desktop and mobile products remains strong,'' Mr. Raza said. ''We plan to ship a minimum of five million units in the second quarter and believe we will meet our goal of shipping 20 to 25 million microprocessors this year.'' **********Separately, Advanced Micro said it would cut about 300 jobs, or 2 percent of its work force, over the next two quarters as part of a reorganization, which is intended to focus the company more closely on microprocessors and other PC-related products. The company said it would take unspecified charges in the first and second quarters for the cuts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/23/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-new-executive-at-abc-television.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-09-23", "snippet": "Chris Moseley is named executive vice president for marketing at ABC Television Network; succeeds Alan Cohen, who will assume new post of executive vice president for marketing at ABC Entertainment Television Group (S)", "word_count": 112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Executive At ABC Television", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; New Executive At ABC Television", "body_text": " **********Chris Moseley, a well-known cable television executive, has been named executive vice president for marketing at the ABC Television Network in New York, part of the ABC unit of the Walt Disney Company. **********Ms. Moseley, 49, had been senior vice president for advertising and promotion at Discovery Networks U.S. in Bethesda, Md., a unit of Discovery Communications that includes the Discovery Channel and the Learning Channel. **********''I see tremendous opportunity for ABC,'' Ms. Moseley said, ''and I am very excited to work with other parts of Walt Disney.'' **********Ms. Moseley succeeds Alan Cohen, 43, who will assume the new post of executive vice president for marketing at the ABC Entertainment Television Group in Burbank, Calif."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/25/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-fuel-oil-flowing-to-yugoslavia-despite-nato-s-exertions.html": {"writer_name": "Raymond Bonner", "pub_date": "1999-05-25", "snippet": "Oil continues flowing into Yugoslavia despite NATO's air campaign; officials say barges filled with oil in Ukraine travel up Danube River through Bulgaria and Romania; have appealed to Ukraine to halt trade and Cyprus to freeze bank account used b...", "word_count": 913, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Oil Flowing to Yugoslavia Despite NATO's Exertions", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: FUEL; Oil Flowing to Yugoslavia Despite NATO's Exertions", "body_text": " **********As part of the campaign against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the Clinton Administration and NATO have tried to cut off his oil supply and his bank accounts. **********It is a campaign that has not gone well, American and NATO officials said. Barges are filled with oil in Ukrainian ports and cross the Black Sea to chug up the Danube River through Bulgaria and Romania. To pay for it, Mr. Milosevic has been using money he secreted in banks in Cyprus during the earlier period of sanctions against Yugoslavia, the officials said. **********The Administration and European Governments have appealed to Ukraine to shut down the trade and they have asked Cyprus to freeze Mr. Milosevic's bank accounts, American and NATO officials said. **********During his visit to Washington last week, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's commander, raised alarms about the oil shipments traveling up the Danube and said that action needed to be taken to stop them. He said that route was increasingly being used because NATO had been somewhat successful in choking off the supply coming into Montenegro. **********American officials said that they did not have a good fix on the volume of oil Mr. Milosevic was getting through the Danube route. But they did say that it was Russian oil, and that the deals were being arranged by middlemen who were making a tremendous profit because of the risks involved. **********Asked how much oil Mr. Milosevic was getting, one Administration official said, ''all he needs.'' Another official said that was an exaggeration, but he conceded that the Serbian leader was getting enough oil to keep his military machine going. A third official replied, simply, ''too much.'' **********The Clinton Administration and NATO have tried to deal with the matter quietly, fearing that making it a public issue could backfire. **********When an oil embargo was last in effect against Yugoslavia, as part of a comprehensive sanctions regime from 1992 until the signing of the Dayton peace accords in 1995, Bulgaria and Romania were major conduits for oil in violation of the sanctions. (Greek and Italian oil companies were major suppliers, with most of their oil moving through Albania, a route that has now been largely shut down.) **********But Washington and European capitals expect to have more success now. The Governments in Bulgaria and Romania have become more stable and have better-trained law enforcement agencies; above all, they have moved from their Communist pasts, expressing a strong desire to get into NATO and the European Union. **********Still, Bulgaria and Romania have not done as much as the Administration believes they could. **********Those Governments have argued that they cannot interfere with traffic on the Danube because it is an international waterway covered by the Danube Convention of 1948, which calls for free movement of ships. But American officials have dismissed those assertions, noting that the convention was signed by the Danube riparian states when they were part of the Soviet Union; West Germany was the one Danube state that did not sign. **********Above all, American and NATO officials said, the major problem has been Ukraine, the source of the oil transportation. **********Last week during meetings in Brussels, Boris Tarasyuk, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, was cordially but firmly told that his country must stop the barges from loading up with oil in the Ukrainian ports, a NATO official said. **********Mr. Tarasyuk countered with complaints about the economic damage Ukraine was suffering because of the war against Serbia. He said that it had cost his country $220 million in lost trade, that Ukrainian ports alone had lost $12 million, and that a Danube shipping company in Ukraine was losing $313,000 a day. Who was going to compensate Ukraine for that, he demanded of NATO. **********Nearly 90 percent of the Ukrainian population is against the NATO bombing, according to recent polls there, an American official said. For that reason, the Administration did not feel that it could make a public issue out of Ukraine's lack of cooperation. **********In Cyprus, too, the Clinton Administration has been worried about upsetting the Government and so has not said anything publicly, but it is not happy that the Cypriots have refused to close the bank accounts belonging to Yugoslav companies. **********With its secretive banking laws, Cyprus has become a major money-laundering center, especially for Russian organized criminal operations, American and European law enforcement officials said. European law enforcement officials said many of the continent's cigarette-smuggling operations use Cyprus. **********American officials said they did not know how much Mr. Milosevic has in the accounts, in part because finding his assets has never been a priority of the C.I.A., several officials said. **********But however much is in the accounts, the Cypriots have told the Clinton Administration and NATO that there is no legal basis for freezing them because there are no United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia. **********Of course when the earlier sanctions were in effect, Cyprus did not cooperate either, American and European officials said. ''They always found loopholes,'' an American official said. **********This evening, the Cypriot Embassy in Washington said that because of the country's desire to join the European Union, the Government was endeavoring to cooperate and was studying what it might do to freeze the accounts."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/19/business/company-news-gambro-plans-to-lay-off-1000-employees-worldwide.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-01-19", "snippet": "Gambro AB will layoff 1,000 employees worldwide, including at least 450 in US, as part of reorganization (S)", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GAMBRO PLANS TO LAY OFF 1,000 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; GAMBRO PLANS TO LAY OFF 1,000 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE", "body_text": " **********Gambro A.B., a Swedish company with the world's second-largest business in products related to kidney dialysis, said yesterday that it would lay off 1,000 employees worldwide, including at least 450 in the United States, as part of a reorganization.

Currently, they can borrow just twice what they have in equity. **********The proposed changes would also, however, make it more difficult for traders to lend each other money to meet margin requirements. **********The stock markets said the proposed changes would affect traders who buy and sell the same stock four times in a five-day business week. Many day traders will move in and out of individual stocks much more frequently than that in a single day. **********''It is a logical thing to do because this sort of trading is not well covered by current rules,'' said Elisse Walter, chief operating officer of N.A.S.D.

The industry has just suffered through one of the worst years in its history. **********First, the critical supply-demand balance of oil fell apart, as the Asian economic crisis caused demand to plummet, and Iraqi production increased. The final blow came when the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided in late 1997 to boost production, dumping oil on a market that was already oversupplied. **********The result was disastrous for oil prices and energy companies. Crude oil plunged from about $20 a barrel 18 months ago to about $12.60 currently, and the profits of oil companies plummeted right along with it. **********Many major players saw their earnings decrease by more than 30 percent, while others had even worse results. Royal Dutch/Shell Group, for example, saw its net income plummet 95 percent last year. **********But the good news for investors who like to bottom fish and are willing to be patient for the next 12 to 18 months, is that the worst may be over, leaving oil company share prices at bargain levels. **********Although still-cautious analysts warn that 1999 will be a tough year, their outlook is improving for several reasons. The steep fall in demand from Asia appears to have finally bottomed out. **********\"Asia will see only a slight improvement this year, but it won't have any more decline in demand,\" said Douglas Terreson, who follows international oil companies for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. from Houston. **********In keeping with Morgan Stanley's house view that the American and European economies will grow, he said he expected continued good demand from those regions. **********At the same time, Mr. Terreson pointed out that the oil glut, while still significant, is shrinking. **********Current world oil production is 75 million barrels a day, while consumption is only 74 million. But OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts are causing the oversupply to fall about 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, and he figures that by the end of the year it could be 400,000. **********\"It won't fully rectify the situation, but it should improve the balance,\" he said. **********If those estimates hold, he figures that the price of crude oil will recover to about $15 a barrel by year's end, which is still well below its high, but enough to help oil companies start to recover. **********But he warned that earnings growth was likely to be negligible this year. **********Most likely to benefit, in Mr. Terreson's view, are the big international, integrated oil producers, who do everything from exploration and drilling to refining and producing petrochemicals. **********He especially favors the two mega-merger stories of last year, BP Amoco PLC and the pending union of Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., expected to be approved by mid-year. **********These companies are better positioned than others to benefit from even a small improvement in price because their mergers are enabling them to cut costs dramatically. **********BP Amoco, for example, has announced that it will slash at least 7,000 jobs from its 100,000 employees around the globe. Mr. Torreson likes the opportunities that come from divesting assets and redeploying them into more productive areas. He also noted the company's \"unsurpassed\" portfolio of investments in oil drilling, in sites ranging from the Caspian Sea to Mexico and South America. **********\"These companies were already strong before the merger,\" he said. \"Now they're outstanding.\" **********The big leap in profitability is likely to come in 2000, when he is projecting earnings per share of $4.55, compared with $3.50 for this year. **********\"And those estimates could be boosted as benefits from the merger accrue,\" he added. **********Michael Mayer at Schroder & Co. said he had outperform ratings on all the major integrated oil stocks he follows because they were currently so cheap. **********But his valuation model for the biggest companies, which measures the relative attractiveness of 12 concerns, has come up with USX-Marathon Group and Texaco Inc. as the best buys. **********Currently trading about 39 percent below Mr. Mayer's target price of $32, Marathon increased oil and gas production and cut costs last year, only to see the savings eroded by falling oil and gas prices and declining margins for its refineries. **********Mr. Mayer said he thought the cost cuts would enable Marathon to earn twice as much this year on $15-a-barrel oil as it did in 1995, when the price of crude averaged $18.40 **********- **********TEXACO, which according to his model has no more than 1 percent downside risk and a 53 percent upside, is suffering from many of the same problems as Marathon. It also must deal with currency loses last year that amounted to about 20 cents a share. **********With oil at $15 and assuming no foreign-exchange losses, Mr. Mayer is forecasting about $2.10 a share in earnings this year. **********Texaco is currently trading at about $ 47, and his target price is $63. **********But just how quick a recovery to $15 a barrel oil will be able to make depends on the OPEC countries. The members plan to meet on March 23 to decide whether they will cut or maintain their current oil production. **********Mr. Mayer is not betting on one result or the other. **********\"In terms on which way they will go, you could flip a coin,\" he said. **********To cover both possibilities, he has laid out two scenarios. Even if OPEC decides to keep producing at its current rate, he figures oil company stock prices are already so low, they would probably not fall much farther. But it would take longer for oil prices to recover because it will depend more heavily on non-OPEC countries cutting back, he said. **********On the other hand, he said, \"If they cut production, you might make a quick 10 to 15 percent profit.\" **********A cut in production, he noted, would mean that the surplus inventories that have piled up would be gone by the end of the year. **********But for investors, the real opportunity, these analysts agree, is in buying these stocks now, while prices are near their lows, and sentiment is still extremely negative. Then, sit back and wait for the profits to roll in a year or two from now."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/business/the-media-business-wal-mart-agrees-to-settle-lawsuit-against-amazon.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-06", "snippet": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc agrees to settle lawsuit against Amazon.com that accused company of having raided Wal-Mart's workers to learn about its computer system; settlement calls for Amazon and Drugstore.com, on-line drug seller in which Amazon owns 46...", "word_count": 484, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wal-Mart Agrees to Settle Lawsuit Against Amazon", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Wal-Mart Agrees to Settle Lawsuit Against Amazon", "body_text": " **********Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the giant retailer, has agreed to settle a lawsuit against Amazon.com that had accused the company, the No. 1 Internet bookseller, of having raided Wal-Mart's workers to learn about its computer system, the companies said today **********The settlement calls for Amazon and Drugstore.com, the on-line drug seller in which Amazon owns a 46 percent interest, to reassign former Wal-Mart executives and consultants to jobs that do not involve their expertise with Wal-Mart's computer merchandising system, according to a statement issued jointly by the companies.

With more than a quarter of Hewlett-Packard's managers women -- including one who was a main rival of Ms. Fiorina for the top job -- it seemed incontestable that the glass ceiling that stops the rise of female executives at so many other companies had been shattered. **********But who hurled the rock? **********The surprising answer: a middle-aged white guy who never thought much about women in the workplace  -- until he was thrust suddenly into the challenging role of single parent. **********The struggle of Lewis E. Platt, now the company's 58-year-old chairman, to juggle the competing duties of father and breadwinner when he was a rising senior executive nearly two decades ago had a happy ending for Hewlett-Packard. And his success in turning company policy around from the traditional ''man rules the roost'' culture to a gender-blind ethos holds an important lesson for the rest of corporate America: A little direction at the top can go a long way. **********It all began in 1981. Back then, Mr. Platt was a general manager, and Hewlett-Packard was what he describes as a ''white male haven,'' populated by graduates of engineering schools in dark suits with starched white shirts. He was, he says, quite comfortable working in that male-dominated environment and leaving the child-rearing and housekeeping chores to his wife of 16 years, Susan. **********Then, his world fell apart: Susan died of cancer, and suddenly, he was the one who had to make dinner for his two daughters, Laura and Caryn, then 9 and 11, get them to school, make sure they did their homework in the evenings and even find the time to go grocery shopping. **********''My mother had really been the one running the show on the home front,'' said Caryn, now 29, who runs her own social services business. She has memories of standing with her father and her sister in a supermarket aisle wondering whether there were enough varieties of Hamburger Helper, one of the few dishes Mr. Platt could prepare, to dine on that week. **********His sudden vulnerability, Mr. Platt says, shattered his old assumption that any difficulties women had in the workplace were of their own making. ''Here I was a white male, doing really well at H.P.,'' Mr. Platt recalled in an interview at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. ''I was suddenly thrust into a different role.'' In the position of having double duty at home and at work, ''I couldn't cope any better than they did,'' he said. **********For six months after his wife's death, he said, his co-workers allowed him to grieve and concentrate on getting his personal life in order instead of putting his full energy into his career. ''I was probably a pretty marginal performer,'' he admitted, but he came to understand the ebb and flow of careers. ''One day I would be back and give the time and energy to be a senior manager,'' he said. **********As the months rolled by, his life remained frantic, he says, a never-ending grind of traveling, working late in the office, getting up early to be with his children and turning to grandparents or nannies to care for them when he was not around. At one point, he debated leaving Hewlett-Packard; but as a lifelong employee, who had joined right out of business school in 1966 and worked his way up the ladder, he soldiered on. **********When he married again in 1983, his second wife, Joan, took over the household responsibilities, freeing him to indulge his workaholic tendencies. But rather than retreating to his old way of thinking, he found he sympathized with the plight of the average working woman more than ever. The new Mrs. Platt had two daughters of her own, Amanda and Hillary, then 9 and 7, and surrounded as he was as the sole male, he had little choice but to look at their side of things, noted his daughter, Caryn. ''We would gang up on him pretty mercilessly,'' she recalled. All four daughters are now working. **********Named a vice president in 1983, Mr. Platt continued his ascent at Hewlett-Packard, managing various parts of the company's computer business before becoming an executive vice president in 1987. During that time, more women were rising to the level of manager, but few were making it to the highest ranks. **********By the time he became chief executive in 1992, he says, droves of those women managers were leaving. ''The pipeline didn't look very good,'' he said. After an outside consultant conducted interviews with many of these women, he came to realize that despite his own open-mindedness on the subject, the company's policies were not flexible enough to accommodate their lives outside the workplace. **********What concerned him in particular were the women in their late 30's who left the company to devote more time to their children, never to be seen again. ''They were gone,'' Mr. Platt said. ''We were no longer connected to them.'' **********So he decided to take action. Working with other top executives, Mr. Platt developed what for Hewlett-Packard was a new workplace strategy. Over the next several years, the company began to encourage employees to adjust their workweeks, arrange flexible work schedules, work at home if necessary and even share jobs -- all so that they could meet their personal responsibilities. They could even take sabbaticals -- yearlong unpaid leaves from the company -- no questions asked. **********While many companies offer these options, few corporations actually encourage their use. Hewlett-Packard did. Mr. Platt made speeches, reminding managers that they needed to consider seriously any of their employees' requests to take advantage of this new flexibility, and he put his name on memos sent to managers across the world. ''Work/life issues are a business priority,'' one statement said. ''Attention to work/ life issues strengthens H.P.'s competitive edge and improves teamwork within H.P.'' **********Even high-level employees take advantage of the new flexibility. Janice Chaffin, an 18-year Hewlett-Packard employee and general manager in charge of providing large computer systems to companies, for example, shared that position, just one rank below division president at the company, for a year. **********Ms. Chaffin says she has never come under any pressure to put in time in the office for the sake of appearance -- her bosses' boss even encouraged her to make clear to her own manager, who was known for spending nearly every waking hour at the office, that she would not do the same. ''It was never an issue,'' she said. **********Nearly all employees determine their own hours to some extent, according to the company, and large numbers opt to work at home at least some of the time. About 12 percent have formal telecommuting arrangements, and employees are routinely asked about how receptive their managers are to their needs in balancing work with the rest of their lives. **********Perhaps most important, Mr. Platt has been vocal on the issue, according to Jerry Cashman, the company's director of programs that encourage work-life balance and diversity. He also likes to remind male colleagues of some of the built-in disadvantages women operate under; he never tires of noting that while the vast majority of them are married to men who work, two-thirds of male managers have stay-at-home wives. **********Mr. Platt says the new policy is not just the right thing to do -- it is the smart thing. ''Anything you can do to attract and retain the best talent is really critical,'' he said. **********The results, in fact, have been dramatic. In the early 90's, the turnover for women was twice that of men, according to the company; now, the gap has been eliminated and the rates are almost identical. Moreover, the company says it loses fewer than 5 percent of its employees each year, compared with an industry average that the consulting firm William M. Mercer puts at 17 percent. **********Brenda Vathauer, a high-powered marketing manager, says the freedom to set her own agenda persuaded her to return to Hewlett-Packard after her maternity leave. But she found herself in an odd position: She did not want a part-time job, which she noted is too often considered a ''subjob'' at most companies, but she did not want to work the 60 hours of a typical full-time job, either. **********The solution: She teamed up with another working mother to share a full-time management position in customer service. Each woman now puts in three 10-hour days a week, each receives three-quarters pay and benefits -- and each gets to spend four days a week at home, counting weekends.

Bill Hornung, also a customer-service manager, describes himself as ''a telecommuter poster child'' for other men because he works at home so can he care for his two children, 5 and 9, when his wife, a flight attendant, is in the air. **********To be sure, Hewlett-Packard is not an equal-opportunity utopia. Mr. Platt readily admits that the company has had difficulty recruiting and promoting blacks. The company said it does not disclose the percentage of managers within certain ethnic groups. **********Even so, to the outside world, the promotion of Ms. Fiorina to chief executive -- she is only the third woman now heading a Fortune 500 company -- was seen as a groundbreaking event. And though it was greeted as policy as usual inside the company, some Hewlett-Packard employees reveled in the symbolism. Just as the victory of the American women's soccer team provided important role models for young women, so did the selection of Ms. Fiorina, they say. **********Bart Coddington, who works with analysts studying the computer industry for the company, says his 3-year-old granddaughter, Sydney, ''will grow up with all that. **********''I'm just so excited for her,'' he said. **********Now that the white, middle-aged guy responsible for ushering in this era of equality will step down as chairman at the end of the year, what about the woman who replaced him as chief executive? When she was appointed, Ms. Fiorina made a widely reported, controversial assertion that there was no glass ceiling. She has since told colleagues that her remark may not apply throughout corporate America, and she has emphasized the need to look for talent wherever it can be found, regardless of sex, race or age. She is not giving interviews. **********As for Mr. Platt, he is leaving it up to the company's employees to make sure Hewlett-Packard does not revert to its old self. Specific programs are not important, he says. ''It's the core values.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/04/business/company-news-fresh-america-to-merge-with-freshpoint-in-stock-deal.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-05-04", "snippet": "Fresh America Corp to buy Freshpoint Inc for $101 million in stock; will form company called Freshpoint America (S)", "word_count": 99, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRESH AMERICA TO MERGE WITH FRESHPOINT IN STOCK DEAL", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; FRESH AMERICA TO MERGE WITH FRESHPOINT IN STOCK DEAL", "body_text": " **********The Fresh America Corporation agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Freshpoint Inc. for about $101 million in stock to form one of the world's largest produce distributors.

In doing so, these sites are further crushing the myth that E-commerce companies can get by without investing in a real, live customer support team. **********''Many players are looking at this,'' said Judy Neuman, vice president for interactive media at Eddie Bauer, and the secretary of Shop.org, an industry trade group. ''It will become the cost of entry going forward.'' **********In addition to Eddie Bauer, which is owned by Spiegel Inc., companies like 911Gifts.com, Etoys, CBS Sportsline, Furniture.com, Lands' End, Hewlett-Packard and 1-800-Flowers.com, among others, indicated they were implementing live customer service. In Eddie Bauer's case, Ms. Neuman said, customers will be able to click on a button and communicate with a customer service representative via a one-on-one, text-based chat. If that doesn't suffice, customers will be able to speak to a representative through their computer, using Internet telephony technology. **********''Especially as the Internet moves into the mainstream, consumers are looking for that comfort zone that ties into the world they're used to,'' said Chris McCann, senior vice president of 1-800-Flowers, which is implementing an Internet telephony package to provide customer service. ''Once users get used to shopping on the site, they won't use it as much, but we like to think of these things as training wheels for new users.'' **********Ms. Neuman declined to name the customer service vendor Eddie Bauer will use or the cost of the system -- although she did say the cost was ''substantial''and that the service would be available starting in October. To handle the rush of inquiries during the holidays, Ms. Neuman said the company would bolster its customer service staff from roughly 12 people to a maximum of 60. **********According to Ken Allard, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, companies that sell customer service applications have proliferated in recent months. Some, like Webline, offer a range of products, from software that sends out automated responses to E-mail inquiries to Internet telephony packages and chat software. Webline's customers include Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Mortgage.com and GTE, among others, and its comprehensive customer service system costs roughly $1,500 per representative to implement. **********Other companies address only part of the customer service equation. For instance, Liveperson offers chat-based customer service for roughly $250 a month per representative; its system is utilized by CBS Sportsline's on-line golf store, among other sites. Meanwhile, Net2phone Inc., a unit of the IDT Corporation offers an Internet telephony-based customer support package, which is currently being tested by 1-800-Flowers. The system costs between $500 and $5,000 a year per representative, depending on the size of the customer service team. **********Industry analysts and executives said the trend toward improved customer service on line began with a chorus of complaints after last year's holiday shopping season, when many sites were caught off guard by the tremendous influx of shoppers. Those sites often failed to deliver products on time, then failed to respond promptly to customers' E-mails. Meanwhile, because many E-commerce companies were founded on the assumption that customer service should be fully automated, the sites frequently lacked phone-based support systems. **********In addition to losing repeat customers, executives say feeble customer service systems have resulted in customers not spending money in the first place. In the last six months, several studies have indicated that between 33 and 66 percent of customers bail out of transactions before they are completed. With more customer service options available to steer consumers through the purchase, executives hope to convert shoppers into buyers at a much higher rate. **********E-commerce sites also say the average amount of an order is typically higher when customer service representatives assist in sales because they can ''upsell'' additional items to potential customers. If that bears out, the cost of additional staffing suddenly looks like a bargain, according to Peter Baltaxe, president of 911Gifts.com. ''Say a customer service rep converts five shoppers to a sale every hour through a chat,'' said Mr. Baltaxe, who plans to implement such a service in the coming months. ''Assuming a $100 gross margin revenue, and the fact that we pay a customer service rep between $10 and $15 an hour, the return seems to be a no-brainer.'' **********Even with the more costly customer service packages, however, the payoff is fast, according to Lou Zambello, senior vice president for operations at Etoys. Mr. Zambello said the company planned to implement live customer service support, which will include both a chat component and an Internet telephony package. While declining to cite the company's planned customer service expenditure, he said a full suite of customer service applications could cost retailers ''a few million, when all is said and done; but it will still pay for itself pretty quickly.'' **********Mr. Zambello added that Internet retailers can afford to pay for such services because they spend comparatively little on routine transactions, which are handled electronically. ''It then makes sense to spend more on the tougher transactions, which are the ones where you'll win the most loyal customers,'' he said. **********As for the idea that live customer service represents an unexpected and unwanted addition to the E-commerce business model, Mr. Baltaxe of 911Gifts said the practice fitted a larger trend. **********''People look at Amazon buying warehouses and realize that it does make sense to have a warehouse, and that the low-overhead, virtual, personless business model doesn't really exist,'' he said. ''It's the same with this. We still have to talk to customers. It's another piece of the model where people are starting to add more overhead costs. Internet businesses still have tremendous advantages, but I think it's turning out to be a little different than some people expected.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/18/world/strategy-for-a-charlatan-in-china-claim-deity-then-steal-and-seduce.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Faison", "pub_date": "1999-09-18", "snippet": "Article on Liu Jiaguo, leader of Supreme Diety cult in China, notes that he was sentenced to death in June (M)", "word_count": 957, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strategy for a Charlatan in China: Claim Deity, Then Steal and Seduce", "print_headline": "Strategy for a Charlatan in China: Claim Deity, Then Steal and Seduce", "body_text": " **********A delicate-looking man with bright eyes showed up in this dusty town a few years ago, preaching that he was a resurrected god, though with a scraggly beard and a preference for plastic flip-flops, he hardly looked like one. **********Finding a deep spiritual hunger among ordinary townspeople, the would-be god, Liu Jiaguo, quickly attracted thousands of followers who eagerly subscribed to his bizarre teachings and revered him as the ''Supreme Deity.'' **********More than a dozen of his devotees, the authorities now say, were young women who were coaxed into his bed. Countless others were persuaded to empty their wallets in hopes of achieving the pay-back that the Supreme Deity promised would follow. **********This cult, attracting more than 10,000 people at its peak in 1997, is one of hundreds that have appeared in China, demonstrating a marked eagerness of ordinary Chinese to seek spiritual fulfillment in a fast-changing society that many find bewildering. **********When Chinese authorities began a crackdown in July on Falun Gong, one of the largest spiritual movements in China, with perhaps 20 million members, they lifted a lid on a multitude of cults that have thrived. In an effort to show how easily people can be tricked by charlatans like Mr. Liu, the authorities have been publicizing cases that had been kept secret. **********The Supreme Deity cult was the inspiration of Mr. Liu, 44, who was sentenced to death in June, convicted of rape and extortion. **********As a young man, Mr. Liu joined a Christian church in his hometown in Anhui Province, in central China, apparently because his mother was a practicing member. He was not particularly devoted, by his own account, but he began working at the church because he was unemployed and had little else to do. **********In telling his story, recounted in an official report that was printed in a Beijing newspaper, Mr. Liu said he was approached in church in 1993 by two followers of an obscure sect who swore they had found the reincarnation of a god. The supposed god, described by the authorities as a con man named Wu Yangming, looked quite ordinary to Mr. Liu, but the religious operation was raking in thousands of dollars from the newly faithful. **********Mr. Liu became a proselytizer for the sect and moved here to Xiangtan, a city of 700,000 in Hunan Province. Preaching for someone else's cause has its limitations, however, and in 1995, after disputes with Mr. Wu's operation, Mr. Liu formed his own group. **********''My experience let me see that, nowadays, people blindly believe in gods and spirits,'' Mr. Liu said, according to the official account. ''People do not really know what gods are, but if you flaunt a divine banner, people believe in you and are willing to dedicate everything they have to you. So I thought, if Wu Yangming can be a god, so could I.'' **********Proclaiming himself to be the Supreme Deity, selected by the heavens to lead people to salvation, Mr. Liu assiduously went about recruiting followers. By May 1997, he convened a national congress that drew disciples from 15 provinces, representing more than 10,000 followers. **********Mr. Liu found it was relatively easy to exact tribute. **********According to the official account, a follower named Zhang Mo was told by one of Mr. Liu's top assistants that their new god needed a mobile phone. ''Everyone has a mobile phone; how can it be right that the Supreme Deity does not have one?'' Mr. Zhang recalled being asked. **********Hoping that his personal troubles would be absolved by such an act, Mr. Zhang bought a phone for Mr. Liu, registering it in his own name. **********''He originally thought that life's disasters would go away after he paid the money,'' the official account said. ''Unexpectedly, he incurred a disaster on himself. Every month the Supreme Deity's mobile phone bill ran from several hundred yuan up to more than a thousand.'' (A yuan is worth about 12 cents.) **********With the largess of his credulous followers, Mr. Liu spent money on expensive suits, a motorcycle and a string of mobile phones. **********Drawing followers to a religion also provided Mr. Liu with temptations of a more illicit nature. Keeping his eye out for attractive young women among the many who flocked to his prayer sessions in the basement of an abandoned building, Mr. Liu used his lieutenants to persuade several to accompany him to bed. **********In June 1998 the authorities arrested Mr. Liu and charged him with raping more a dozen women. Twenty-six of his assistants were also arrested and charged with crimes from robbery to extortion. **********In his own defense, Mr. Liu said he had never forced himself on anyone. Instead, he said, he or his lieutenants would ''summon'' young women to his bed, and they went voluntarily. **********One victim later gave the authorities an account of what a lieutenant said when she resisted her ''summons.'' **********''If you disobey, catastrophes will befall you,'' the woman recalled being told. ''If you agree to be summoned by the Supreme Deity, you should never tell anyone about it, otherwise you will be punished by God!'' **********The woman relented. **********Mr. Liu did not stop at such seduction, however. Adopting a common practice of wealthy businessmen in China, he took a handful of women as regular mistresses and set them up in separate apartments. **********One such woman, who bore Mr. Liu a son and told the authorities about it later, said Mr. Liu arranged for a two-bedroom apartment and a maid for her in Zhuzhou, a neighboring town, but went to see her only twice in a year. **********Once he was arrested by the authorities, Mr. Liu, perhaps in hopes of winning a reduced sentence by showing humility, readily admitted that he tricked his followers, and pointed to his own predicament -- stuck in jail -- as evidence. **********''If I were a god, would I be here today?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/06/business/world-business-briefing-europe-british-rate-anxieties.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1999-08-06", "snippet": "Bank of England policy makers decide to leave British interest rates unchanged at 22-year low of 5 percent; British stocks drop on fears that British rates are likely to rise later this year (S)", "word_count": 68, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITISH RATE ANXIETIES", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; BRITISH RATE ANXIETIES", "body_text": " **********Bank of England policy makers decided to leave British interest rates unchanged at a 22-year low of 5 percent.

But it appears that relatively few of the underlying restaurants were ever profitable. When they raised prices far enough to offset their costs, sales fell off. When they used coupons to bring in more customers, they sold more but lost money anyway. **********Boston Market was able to report profits by selling bonds and then lending the money raised to its franchise holders, who then used the cash to pay fees to the parent company that produced profits. That was clear from the financial statements, and was loudly proclaimed by short-sellers, who bet that the stock price would fall and predicted that the company would not be able to pay back its debts. But that forecast was largely dismissed by Wall Street, which said growth would solve all the problems. **********In 1998, the bears were proved right. Boston Market took a huge write-off -- more than offsetting all the profits it had previously reported -- and later filed for bankruptcy protection. **********Even though it has been clear for some time that shareholders of Boston Market would be wiped out, the stock has continued trading in the over-the-counter market. Yesterday, the shares fell 24.5 cents, to 16 cents. **********In the summer of 1996, when Boston Chicken was still a hot property on Wall Street, it brought in some badly needed cash by selling shares in another restaurant chain it controlled, the Einstein/Noah Bagel Corporation. Those shares, priced at $17, more than doubled within a couple of months. **********Boston Market retains majority ownership of Einstein/Noah, and that position is not being bought by McDonald's, leaving a possibility that senior creditors will get further payment. But the value of that position is questionable, even though the share price rose 34.4 cents yesterday, to 75 cents, indicating a value of $13 million for the Boston Market stake. **********Einstein/Noah has hired an investment banker in an effort to restructure its balance sheet and has warned that it might not be able to meet its obligations. Moreover, a buyer for the stake has been sought, but no deal has been announced. **********Though the price being paid would seem to indicate that McDonald's attributed little value to the Boston Market name or reputation, its plan to keep operating at least some restaurants under that name means there is still a chance that money will be made from ''the restaurant concept of the 90's,'' as a Merrill Lynch analyst called Boston Market when it was flying high. **********But if money is made, none of it will go to the investors who bought Boston Market's stock or bonds."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/29/business/computer-games-venture-into-the-world-of-gun-bow-and-big-game.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1999-03-29", "snippet": "Robert Westmoreland of Wal-Mart Stores Inc has been driving force behind phenomenal success of computer hunting games, led by Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter; Westmoreland is credited with prodding software industry to make hunting games ...", "word_count": 1400, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Computer Games Venture Into the World of Gun, Bow and Big Game", "print_headline": "Computer Games Venture Into the World of Gun, Bow and Big Game", "body_text": " **********The business mastermind behind one of the hot trends in computing today is not Bill Gates or Michael Dell, and not some Internet whiz kid from Silicon Valley or Seattle, but an anonymous middle manager from Bentonville, Ark. **********Yet Robert Westmoreland of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., has been the driving force behind the phenomenal success of computer hunting games, led by Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter. It was Mr. Westmoreland who, by all accounts, prodded the software industry to make hunting games and then promoted them heavily at Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer. **********''He's the man,'' observed Robert Kotick, chairman of Activision Inc., whose Head Games unit created two best-selling Cabela games. **********The hunting game phenomenon is a sure sign that personal computing is moving to the masses. These digital diversions are priced below $20, less than half the cost of classic personal computer games like Doom, Quake or Starcraft. **********The hunting games are also an early wave of what industry analysts call casual games, easier to play and more mundane in appearance than the special-effects-on-a-screen adventures preferred by what the industry considers hard-core gamers -- male techies in the 16-to-35 age range. Computer Gaming World, the bible of computer game purists, once criticized Deer Hunter as ''boring'' and ''repetitive'' with ''lame'' graphics. **********The outdoors games -- whose audience, though still mainly male, is often older and less technophile than gamers have been in the past -- took off last year, as computers priced below $1,000 became commonplace and the proportion of American households with computers rose to 50 percent. **********Five of the 20 top-selling computer games last year were low-cost hunting titles, according to PC Data, a research firm. And so far this year, the latest versions of Deer Hunter and Cabela's Big Game Hunter are high on the best-seller lists -- and more sequels are in the works. Even a spoof of hunting games, Deer Avenger, in which deer stalk people, has recently entered the top 10 list. **********The hunting games have prompted an elitist backlash, derided as ''red neck,'' ''Bubba'' or ''trailer park'' software. Yet others see the hunting-game phenomenon as simply a sign of the times. **********''The computer is a personal medium, and as it is more widely available and affordable its use will reflect the diversity of society,'' said Paul Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a research group in Menlo Park, Calif. ''Bubba software is one aspect of that diversity.'' **********And, of course, commercial success tends to breed respect, even if grudgingly. At the start of this year, Jeff Green, a columnist for Computer Gaming World, conceded that the industry first made fun of Deer Hunter, then scrambled to copy it. ''You don't have to admire the game itself,'' he wrote, ''but you've got to  love anything that makes the entire gaming industry, press included, look stupid.'' **********Certainly, Mr. Westmoreland, Wal-Mart's computer software buyer, faced considerable skepticism a few years ago when he first suggested the idea of inexpensive games for a mass market of newcomers to personal computers. Mr. Kotick of Activision recalled a meeting with Mr. Westmoreland in a Las Vegas hotel room during the Comdex computer trade show in the fall of 1996. **********At the time, Mr. Westmoreland's concept was sharply at odds with the prevailing thinking and culture of the PC game business. The major game companies regarded video games, running on the console technology of Sony, Sega and Nintendo, as the mass-market channel. **********Personal computers, by contrast,  were viewed as the preferred technology for hard-core gamers. PC games, with multimillion-dollar production budgets and priced in the $40 to $50 range, strove for Hollywood-style special effects best displayed  on turbocharged, cutting-edge PC's. **********So at that 1996 meeting, Mr. Kotick listened in disbelief to Mr. Westmoreland's suggestion. ''He described his grand vision of under-$20 software, and I looked at him as if he had three heads,'' Mr. Kotick recalled. ''I almost walked out of the room on him. But he was absolutely right.'' **********By last June, Mr. Kotick was ready to reverse field and plunge into the market for low-cost PC games, as  Activision purchased Head Games Publishing of Minneapolis, producer of Cabela's Big Game Hunter. **********But Mr. Westmoreland had found a more receptive audience when he met in Minneapolis with executives of the Wizardworks unit of GT Interactive Software in April 1997. Seeing the large sporting goods sections in Wal-Mart and the falling price of computers, Mr. Westmoreland began to think that an inexpensive hunting game for PC's could be a winner. **********''He said, 'You make me a deer-hunting title, and I'll get behind it,' '' recalled Paul Rinde, a senior vice president of Wizardworks. **********Wizardworks, based in the Midwest, was perhaps less influenced than game developers elsewhere by the industry penchant for Hollywood-style productions and cutting-edge computing. Like most software publishers, Wizardworks taps a network of contractors. **********In May 1997, Mr. Rinde visited Anthony Campiti, president of Sunstorm Interactive Inc. in Indianapolis. Sunstorm was a six-person software developer working on PC versions of simple games like pool and darts, and when Mr. Rinde suggested a deer hunting game, Mr. Campiti had his doubts. **********''I asked,'' Mr. Campiti recalled, '' 'How in the world can you make a game about sitting in the woods for three hours, doing nothing?' '' **********But Wizardworks was offering Sunstorm a job it needed. So Mr. Campiti, not a hunter, started researching the subject. He talked to hunters, read hunting magazines and gained respect for the sport. ''I learned there is a lot of skill involved in hunting,'' he said. **********Mr. Campiti ended up designing a simple hunting-simulation game in which the virtual hunters can use decoy calls, cover their scent and choose their weapons (rifle, shotgun or bow). It was called Deer Hunter, and it proved a stunning success. **********''In hindsight, everyone is a genius,'' Mr. Westmoreland said. ''Did the sales of Deer Hunter surprise me? Of course. But what did not surprise me was that there was a big market for casual gaming software, priced below $20, waiting to be tapped.'' **********Mr. Rinde agrees that the timing is right. **********''The growing installed base of PC's and expanding demographics have created the casual gaming market -- the hunting games are just the beginning,'' Mr. Rinde observed. ''This is PC game software for the rest of us. People who don't care about being transported to the year 3000 and battling aliens on the planet Zorak.'' **********''The casual game market,'' Mr. Rinde added, ''is for people who want to do much the same things on the computer -- hunt, fish, play cards, whatever -- that they do in real life.'' **********The other lesson of the hunting game phenomenon is that as software becomes more a mass-market product, the mass-market retailers -- more than specialized computer stores -- may become the vital channel of distribution. In short, Mr. Rinde said, ''Wal-Mart can make a title, if they get behind it.'' **********And the Bubba market is not without its ironists. Wal-Mart shoppers have also helped make the satirical ''Deer Avenger'' game a best seller. ''There's a good-sized crossover market of Wal-Mart customers who do have a sense of humor,'' said Brian McCann, the game's creator and a writer on the television show ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien.'' **********But beyond mockery, Mr. McCann contends that his game is simply more compelling to play, with its  ''kill scenes'' in which a deer can use everything from slingshots to bazookas to zap the virtual humans. ''It's far more rewarding than watching a deer slump over sadly,'' he said. **********The business model in the casual game market is a world apart from the glitzy, fantasy war-and-strategy games. Production schedules tend to be four months instead of two years, and production budgets generally range from $150,000 to $200,000 instead of $2 million to $4 million. **********The low-cost economics are opening the door in the PC game market for the first time in years to tiny start-ups with bootstrap financing. One such fledgling venture is Rise Software in Rogers, Ark. Its assets so far are story boards for a few games and hopes of success. **********Its founder and chief executive is a 32-year-old entrepreneur who started puttering with PC's as a 12-year-old and who may have some useful experience and acquaintances in the industry. His name: Robert Westmoreland, whose last day at Wal-Mart will be this Friday. **********''I'm going down the road myself, trying to capitalize on this emerging market,'' he said. **********He would not discuss his product ideas, except to say they will not be hunting games."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/09/business/company-news-midcoast-energy-sets-deal-to-add-kansas-pipeline.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-11-09", "snippet": "Midcoast Energy Resources agrees to buy Kansas Pipeline Co for about $190 million in cash (S)", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MIDCOAST ENERGY SETS DEAL TO ADD KANSAS PIPELINE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MIDCOAST ENERGY SETS DEAL TO ADD KANSAS PIPELINE", "body_text": " **********Midcoast Energy Resources agreed yesterday to buy the closely held Kansas Pipeline Company for about $190 million in cash, giving it pipelines that deliver natural gas to Wichita and Kansas City, Kan.

And while the consortium that is creating the standards, the Secure Digital Music Initiative, represents the music, consumer electronics and computer industries, it is not at all certain that the makers of portable music players will comply with standards that are being dictated largely by the interests of record labels. **********All of which is likely to leave consumers bewildered in the coming months, even as electronics companies ramp up production of the new players -- solid-state equivalents of today's portable cassette and CD players -- in the hopes of making the coming holiday season the first digital-music Christmas. **********What is certain is that with the preliminary release of new standards for distributing music electronically -- music companies are preparing for on-line sales of their recordings, as evidenced by two disclosures today from Bertelsmann, the parent company of BMG Entertainment. **********A Bertelsmann subsidiary, BMG Storage Media, based in Guetersloh, Germany, that records audio CD's and video DVD's, announced a partnership today with Intertrust and Reciprocal, two American companies that make technology for distributing music in digital form while preserving its copyrights. **********Officials from BMG Storage Media said that starting next quarter, the partners would test technology to print new CD's that are compliant with the consortium's  standard, which means the music cannot be played on portable devices if the device's owner has not paid for the music. **********This is not simple to accomplish. First, future CD's have to be playable on existing CD players, which tend to be highly sensitive to the way data are organized on a CD. Second, because the Home Recording Act of 1992 allows anyone who purchases a CD to make a copy for personal use, the protection technology will have to distinguish between a recording device owned by the purchaser of the CD and a device owned by someone else. **********As the Intel and Microsoft Corporations discovered this year, machines that try to identify themselves or their owners on a network provoke angry outcries from privacy advocates. **********On a different front, BMG, among the biggest of the record companies, announced today that it would begin selling music over the Internet in the fall. But, as is the case with other major record labels planning on-line sales, BMG has yet to decide which artists it will sell on line, whether it will sell just singles or entire albums, what prices it will charge and what technology it will use to prevent illegal copying. **********''These are all good questions,'' said J. Scott Dinsdale, a spokesman for BMG. ''We're going through that process right now.'' **********Also, today was the start of a project in which the five major record labels are testing the sale of music over the Internet using I.B.M. technology. Trial participants in 1,000 homes in San Diego equipped with cable modems can order music on line, pay for it with a credit card, download it onto their PC and record into homemade CD's. **********Further, it remains to be seen how soon consumers will buy into the on-line music revolution, given that it takes 10 minutes to download a single song (more than three hours for a typical album) using a standard dial-up modem, and the downloading process is often fraught with technical difficulties. **********The preliminary standards -- set to be made final within the next month -- are meant to dictate the technical specifications for portable digital players, hand-held devices that record and play music on silicon circuitry called flash memory. The new players are the center of a shift in musical products that many in the recording industry see as revolutionary because the devices enable people to download music from the Net, organize it, easily erase it and listen to it portably in CD-quality form. **********Not surprisingly, the players are  generating deep-seated fears within the music industry of widespread  piracy because the music they record and play can be taken from commercial CD's or the Internet and copied illegally. Under the standards announced on Monday, these players eventually -- the consortium estimates about 18 months -- should not be allowed to play illegally copied music. **********Theoretically, what will happen is that the portable players will read a piece of software code embedded in the digital version of each song that tells the player whether making a copy is permissible. Record labels have said they will start to encode each song sold over the Internet with copyright protection information. Within 18 months, the companies also intend to start encoding each CD sold in a store with similar technology, known generically as a digital watermark. **********But this technology is not yet perfected; numerous companies have submitted proposals to the consortium, but none have yet been chosen, and it is unclear whether any single solution will accomplish the task. **********Some critics assert that consumers who have already amassed a sizable library of digital music cannot yet be sure that in the future digital players will be capable of playing recordings that are not compliant with the standards. Howard A. Tullman, chief executive of Tunes.com, a Chicago-based Web site that publishes thousands of songs from unsigned artists and independent record labels, says he worries that the standards will lead to players that will play only music that has the big record labels' stamp of approval. **********''People have invested hours and hours or days taking own music collection and making it portable,'' he said. ''You can't tell the person no, that's no good.'' **********Tara L. Lemmey, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an on-line civil liberties group, said the organization was exploring whether the consortium's standards might represent a violation of antitrust laws or ''fair use'' policies that permit the use of music and other media for education or esthetic criticism. **********Representatives of the consortium  said portable devices would be permitted to play existing digital recordings -- most notably the thousands of MP3 files now on the Net. They have said that even when portable devices are in full compliance -- when the final rules come into play  -- the devices will play all music unless the music itself contains the protection software permitting it to be played only by a copyright holder. **********That said, even consortium officials -- and some of the 150 or so technology, music and electronics  companies in the group -- say many of the questions cannot be answered until the final specifications are approved."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/20/world/world-briefing.html": {"writer_name": "Terence Neilan", "pub_date": "1999-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 917, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Briefing", "print_headline": "World Briefing", "body_text": " **********EUROPE **********RUSSIA: ATTACK ON MONEY LAUNDERING -- Prime Minister Vladimir V.

Peace talks broke down in Paris as the Serbs refused to sign a peace accord accepted on Thursday by delegates of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. [Page A6.] **********Western Governments began removing cease-fire monitors and nonessential personnel from Yugoslavia. **********The Pentagon announced that it was dispatching additional combat aircraft to the region in anticipation of a series of air strikes intended to reduce Serbia's ability to move against the separatist rebels. **********Mr. Clinton spent most of his day making a case for United States participation in NATO-led military strikes in the Balkans, meeting a large contingent of members of Congress in the morning and speaking extensively on the subject with reporters this afternoon. **********He also met senior foreign policy advisers to review plans for possible strikes, including timing, sequences and targets. **********Congressional leaders emerged from the White House meeting skeptical about the reasons for United States involvement in hostilities in the former Yugoslavia. **********Senator Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader, said the Senate would debate policy in Kosovo early next week. **********''We believe that the President now recognizes the need to say to the American people,'' Mr. Lott said, ''exactly what's at stake here, why would an action be taken, what would those actions be and what are the risks.'' **********Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the deputy Republican leader, said he had told Mr. Clinton that the United States should not initiate a bombing campaign unless President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia engaged in a systematic assault on the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. **********Mr. Clinton argued at his news conference that Mr. Milosevic had already carried out numerous massacres and other atrocities in Kosovo, as well as earlier in Bosnia. **********''I think that the threshold has been crossed,'' Mr. Clinton said, citing the killing of more than 40 ethnic Albanian civilians in January in the village of Racak. **********''With all the troops that have been massed, and what we know about their plans, and what they have publicly said about them, I would hate to think that we'd have to see a lot of other little children die before we could do what seems to be, to me, clearly the right thing to do to prevent it,'' the President said. **********Later Mr. Clinton added, ''I do not believe that we ought to have to have thousands more people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields before we do something.'' **********The conflict has created more than 400,000 refugees. An estimated 20,000 have been displaced just in the last week by military operations in and around Kosovo. **********Mr. Clinton said the rationale to use force went beyond humanitarian concerns. He said a raging conflict in Kosovo could send tens of thousands of refugees across borders and, potentially, draw Albania, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey into the war. **********''This is a conflict with no natural boundaries,'' he said. ''It threatens our national interests. If we don't act, the war will spread. If it spreads, we will not be able to contain it without far greater risk and cost. I believe the real challenge of our foreign policy today is to deal with problems before they do permanent harm to our vital interests. That is what we must do in Kosovo.'' **********Mr. Clinton faced pointed questioning on Kosovo both in his Congressional meeting and in the news conference. **********He was asked why Mr. Milosevic should take American threats seriously, after Mr. Clinton and other Western leaders had backed down from earlier threats and allowed numerous negotiating deadlines to pass. **********He was asked why NATO had delayed action, even though Mr. Milosevic has carried out a continuing campaign of repression against Albanians, Bosnian Muslims and other minorities in former Yugoslav provinces. **********''I think he should take this seriously, because we were serious in Bosnia,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''My intention would be to do whatever is possible, first of all, to weaken his ability to massacre them, to have another Bosnia.'' **********He said the peace talks between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians had been extended at the request of the two sides, not because of American irresolution. He noted that Russia had consistently opposed NATO military action against Moscow's allies in Serbia. **********Mr. Clinton and European leaders have enlisted Russian support for peace efforts in Kosovo. But Moscow has steadfastly refused to endorse any threat of force against Belgrade. The issue is certain to arise when Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia visits Washington beginning next Tuesday. **********The House narrowly voted last week to endorse Mr. Clinton's plan to send American troops to Kosovo to enforce a peace accord if all parties reach one. The United States would supply 4,000 soldiers to a 28,000-member NATO peacekeeping force. **********But Republicans have complained that the Administration is wading into a quagmire with no clear means of exit and without sufficient support. **********''Americans are going to be killed,'' Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, said in a speech on the Senate floor today. ''They are going to come home in body bags, and they will be killed in a war that Congress has not declared.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/01/business/world-business-briefing-asia-cathay-flights-canceled.html": {"writer_name": "Mark Landler", "pub_date": "1999-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 86, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CATHAY FLIGHTS CANCELED", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; CATHAY FLIGHTS CANCELED", "body_text": " **********A labor dispute at Cathay Pacific Airways has forced the airline to cancel about one-third of its flights each day since Saturday.

Cramer, the tireless fund manager, market commentator and Internet entrepreneur, has scored a hat trick: He has earned renown as the Wall Street equivalent of player, coach and owner. **********As a player, though, he's been in a slump. **********For Cramer-Berkowitz & Company, Mr. Cramer's high-flying, fast-trading hedge fund, 1998 was the worst year in a decade. Though the fund produced a positive return of 2 percent after fees for investors, it fell short of the total return on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by about 27 percentage points. The bad year left Mr. Cramer trailing the benchmark index for the last five years, though he still beats it over 10 years. **********Many other hedge funds did poorly in 1998 as well, including some, like Cramer-Berkowitz, that specialize in United States stocks. But Mr. Cramer is not just another hedge-fund manager. **********Cramer-Berkowitz manages about $300 million on behalf of elite investors who generally put up at least $2.5 million to become partners in the all-star fund, known for its hybrid strategy of long-term stock-picking and hyperactive buying and selling. Mr. Cramer is also one of the investment world's most prolific journalists, detailing his thoughts about the stock market on line, on air, in print, often many times each day. TheStreet.com, a World Wide Web-based financial news and analysis service he started, just announced an initial public offering that aims to raise $75 million. **********Appearing regularly on CNBC's ''Squawk Box'' stock-talk show and writing for national magazines as well as on his own Internet service, Mr. Cramer espouses active trading -- he has described his own pace of buying and selling as manic -- as a way of beating the market in good times and bad. He has become an icon in the fast-expanding world of Internet day traders, a group many analysts see as driving the market these days. **********His columns regularly contain exhortations like this one: ''Moral: Never let a trade turn into an investment. But just because you are an investor, don't be afraid to trade. I am neither a trader nor an investor, I am an opportunist. You should be, too.'' **********But last year Cramer-Berkowitz, which Mr. Cramer runs with Jeff Berkowitz, stumbled with their stock picks, the partners said in a letter to investors obtained by The New York Times. It also suffered because many investors decided to withdraw money in October, when the fund's performance was deep in the red and world financial markets were shaky. The letter said that the fund had to sell some good stocks at a bad time to return that money. **********One investor who made withdrawals was New York's Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, who at the time was running for his post and was financing an expensive campaign. Two investors who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Mr. Spitzer's need for campaign funds prompted the hedge fund to allow redemptions, which by law must be extended to all investors. **********Mr. Spitzer declined to comment about his relationship with Mr. Cramer. A spokesman for Mr. Spitzer confirmed that he had made withdrawals from the fund. **********In the letter to investors, Mr. Cramer and Mr. Berkowitz said that redemptions were one factor hurting the fund's performance. **********''We were also hit, at the worst possible time -- the bottom of the 1998 market -- with requests for redemptions,'' they wrote. ''Our October opening forced us to sell stocks at precisely the time we would have been buying.'' **********Several big investors have stood by Mr. Cramer. \"There were many superb hedge funds that did not have a good year last year,\" said Martin Peretz, publisher of The New Republic and a longtime Cramer partner. ''Many have already recouped some of their losses in the first two months of this year.'' **********Mr. Cramer declined to comment about the fund's performance. A lawyer for the hedge fund said that Securities and Exchange Commission regulations prohibited Mr. Cramer from commenting at this time. **********As a result of last year's weak performance, Cramer-Berkowitz has strengthened its research department, the partners wrote. The hedge fund also sold many small-company stocks in favor of big-company stocks that make up the main stock market indexes. The partners said that they would not open the fund to redemptions as often as they had previously, but did not provide specifics. Unlike mutual funds, which allow redemptions at any time, hedge funds may require an investment for six months, a year or more. **********In his column for TheStreet.com entitled ''Wrong!,'' Mr. Cramer deals more with day-to-day, or even minute-to-minute market action, than he does with long-term investment strategy. He also keeps management of Cramer-Berkowitz separate from TheStreet.com. **********The New York Times Company is the third-largest shareholder in TheStreet.com. **********Some columns that he wrote in the fall, when his hedge fund faced the strongest head winds, reveal Mr. Cramer's gloominess about unfavorable markets. But his writing does not flag a change in investment strategy at Cramer-Berkowitz or give a reader a sense of how far his trading strategy put him behind the market indexes. **********He does complain, though, about how the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund that was rescued by a consortium of Wall Street banks and brokerage houses in September, soured investor sentiment toward hedge funds in general. In one column he compared Long-Term Capital to the Three Mile Island nuclear-plant accident 20 years ago. **********''The fallout in hedge fund land hurts those of us who run by hydro or natural gas or plain old No. 6 oil to generate solid returns,'' Mr. Cramer wrote in late September. ''That's too bad, because what I do for a living has nothing to do with what the geniuses at Long Term -- and I use that term loosely -- claimed to be doing, or were actually doing with investors' dollars.'' **********Mr. Cramer has described his investing as taking two forms -- classic value investing and shorter-term, trading-oriented transactions. While it's hard to track the results of Mr. Cramer's short-term trading, it's clear that big losses in several long-term stock holdings dragged down his performance last year. **********According to documents filed with the S.E.C., Mr. Cramer's largest holding at the end of September was Bay View Capital, a San Francisco-based bank. But the 1.8 million Bay View shares the fund then owned, most of which were bought for more than $30 a share, would now be worth about $19 each. **********Mr. Cramer's September filing with the S.E.C., the most recent available, also shows his second-largest position as being 2.2 million shares of the Fairchild Corporation, an aerospace company. Those shares were bought at an average price of about $16 each, but would now be worth $12 apiece. **********Market swings that have surprised even the most savvy traders have continued so far this year, as has Mr. Cramer's frustrated commentary. **********''This market needs a double dose of Zyprexa with some lithium laced in,'' he wrote in a TheStreet.com column this month. ''It has to stop the manic-depressive behavior before it drives us all crazy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/business/databank-april-26-30-an-off-key-finale-for-a-spectacular-april.html": {"writer_name": "Mickey Meece", "pub_date": "1999-05-02", "snippet": "Roundup of stock market performance, Apr 26-30; graphs and tables on stocks in news; tables (M)", "word_count": 198, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DataBank: April 26-30; An Off-Key Finale for a Spectacular April", "print_headline": "DataBank: April 26-30; An Off-Key Finale for a Spectacular April", "body_text": " **********The Dow Jones industrial average ended the last day of April with a whimper, suffering its biggest loss of the month on concerns the economy was growing too fast, threatening to hasten inflation and cause interest rates to rise. **********But over the month, the Dow did not go quietly: it rose 10 percent, crossing the 10,000 milestone; set 13 new highs, and flirted with 11,000 before closing at 10,789.04 on Friday. **********In the first four months of the year, the Dow added 18 percent, surpassing what it gained for all of 1998. **********It has been one of the most spectacular months ever for the Dow, Scott Bleier, chief market strategist for Prime Charter Ltd., told Reuters on Friday. **********Investors jumped on inflationary fears and the month's end as reasons to take profits.

But the campaign for the first directly elected mayor of this city of eight million residents has caught British politicians ill-prepared, with embarrassing consequences all around. **********Selection of the Conservative and Labor nominees for the election in  May has been delayed until next month, and the contest for an office that will have a larger popular mandate than any other in Britain has become the stuff of soap opera, with the sex scandal resignation of one candidate and the barring of another for his confessed serial adultery. **********A political contest in which personality suddenly plays a more important role than party voting habits has shaken headquarters control and attracted hopefuls from nontraditional sectors. Among them are two baronesses, a gay rights activist, a punk rock entrepreneur, an Internet millionaire, the novelist Jeffrey Archer and the Academy Award-winning actress Glenda Jackson. **********''I am quite an imaginative person,'' Ms. Jackson said when asked about the chaotic course of events, ''but in my wildest imaginings I would never have imagined this. If somebody had put it before me as a script, I would have thrown it across the room as unbelievable.'' **********The idea to grant Londoners the right to elect their mayor is part of Prime Minister Tony Blair's project known as ''devolution'' under which the highly centralized control that the capital exercises in British life is being diluted and spread out -- ''devolved'' -- to the country's regions. New legislatures have been created in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and a bill is now moving through Parliament to permit direct elections for mayor in other British cities. **********London had a limited form of local government until 1986, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council and turned the running of the city over to the national government. (The unrelated position of Lord Mayor, dating from 1215, is an appointive office that names a business leader to oversee the City of London financial center for a year at a time.) **********The London mayoralty has thrown up a new contradiction in British public life that has produced the current gaudy confusion. The national parties are taking part in an effort that gives local people a more direct role in deciding who represents them, but are showing no willingness to relax their grip over the choice of candidates and the makeup of platforms. **********''The tradition in Britain has been for the bosses to control nominations, while the way of doing it in other places is primary elections where the people are in charge,'' said Anthony King, a professor of government at Essex University. ''What they're now trying to do here without thinking about the consequences is a hybrid of the authoritarian and the democratic where the bosses end up intervening ineffectively and the people end up without much of a say.'' **********The clash has been catastrophic for both Labor and the Conservatives. **********In Labor's case, the candidate who has emerged on top in the competition for its nomination is the member of the party that Mr. Blair and other government leaders would least like to see representing them: Ken Livingstone, 54, the last head of the ill-fated Greater London Council. Long known as ''Red Ken,'' he comes from the so-called ''loony left'' of the 1980's that Mr. Blair, who likes to call his party New Labor, faults for having made Labor extremist and unelectable for years. **********Mr. Livingstone's mix of populism and impudence may have marginalized him in national politics, but it has proved an asset in London city-style politics, where a little eccentricity and cheek go a long way. Labor underestimated the importance of style and personality in direct local elections, and its awkward maneuvers to block his candidacy and exert central control have only made  him more popular still. **********Headquarters also failed to persuade Ms. Jackson, 63, a former minister for transportation in London who entered Parliament in 1992, to bow out and support the party's favored candidate, former Health Secretary Frank Dobson, 59. Ms. Jackson protested that there ought to be room for one woman entrant, and she remains in the race for the Labor nomination. **********The Conservatives, as has been their continual fate since losing power by a landslide in the 1997 national election, failed to capitalize on Labor's quandary and ended up creating an even deeper one of their own. They let Lord Archer, 59, enter the lists without any vetting of his rumor-haunted past, and they were punished for their lapse when a 1986 scandal over payments to a prostitute resurfaced and forced him to resign the nomination he had just won. **********The party reopened the nomination process and turned to Steven Norris, 54, a former member of Parliament with a hearty personality well suited to big city politics but also with a tabloid past of his own. **********While in the House of Commons, he had five affairs and on leaving in 1997 wrote a boastful book about it all. He was abruptly rejected by the local selection committee in favor of four little-known figures, two of them baronesses. **********Mr. Norris raged against what he called a ''monstrous regiment'' of ''blue rinse'' Tory women whom he blamed for shooting down his bid, and the Conservatives reinstated him days later as their leading candidate for the nomination. **********Seeing the fanciful way things were going, Malcolm McLaren, creator of the Sex Pistols, entered the contest as an independent on a platform of legalizing brothels and marijuana, ending closing hours in pubs and doing away with entry fees to museums and galleries. **********The succession of pratfalls has shaken the Labor and Conservative leaderships, and inevitably, American influence has been blamed for the whole thing. ''I don't think that U.S.-style politics is a model to be held up to the world,'' said Professor King. But the robust British press has had a jolly time, and some commentators have even found the spectacle reassuring. **********''Politics refreshed,'' Simon Jenkins called it in his column in The Times of London. ''Direct election is drawing the poison of control out of national party rule.'' **********Jonathan Freedland, a columnist for The Guardian and author of a book championing American political institutions, said that the authors of the idea of direct mayoral elections had nothing to apologize for. **********''After all,'' he said, ''this is what the advocates always predicted -- that direct election of individuals would spark noisy, vigorous debates, teasing out the issues that course through the veins of any big city.'' **********Professor King countered: ''I can't say I think the same thing.

The right-of-center National Action Party said the council's idea for a nationwide primary seemed to resemble one the party had already rejected.

Mitchell said the Northern Ireland peace agreement was the only ''credible'' way forward for the province and that he was ''still hopeful, notwithstanding the difficulties.'' The April 1998 accord is deadlocked over the issue of disarming guerrillas before allowing their political representatives into government, and Mr. Mitchell was ending the third week of his mission to break the stalemate.

Any shopper who fretted over whether an item would arrive on time could order a gift online and then pick it up at the store. **********Like a number of other Internet innovations, Circuit City's ''express pickup'' system did not always function perfectly this holiday season. But it underscored the growing realization in the retail industry that far from being in conflict with each other, e-commerce and earthbound retailing can often operate in tandem. **********After standing on the sidelines for an agonizingly long time during the explosive growth of Internet commerce, many traditional retailers have recently jumped onto the Web with both feet, trying to capitalize on some of the advantages they enjoy over their virtual competitors. **********National chain stores, after all, do not have to build brand awareness from scratch with expensive advertising. They already have thousands of customers. And when it comes to returning an item, they have sensed that most consumers prefer to do it in person, not through the mail. (Of course, online retailers have advantages of their own -- for now, at least -- like access to plentiful capital without having to show earnings.) **********As the holidays approached, many traditional retailers began to see that the Internet could serve as an additional distribution channel for their merchandise, and stopped worrying about cannibalizing in-store sales. ''The point is to give your customers a choice, so they can decide where they want to shop and when they want to do it,'' said Eileen M. Leary, an analyst for State Street Research in Boston. **********Ultimately, according to Michael E. Hansen, co-chairman of the e-business practice at the Boston Consulting Group, ''the consumer wants to shop in both channels, and wants to have a seamless experience.'' **********Knowing this, some leading retailers, including Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores, which is introducing a new Web site, have elected to move slowly rather than risk disappointing customers with a premature and poorly designed site. **********But the number of traditional retailers that have taken the plunge is big enough now that analysts are starting to identify those they believe will be most likely to succeed online. **********At or near the top of many lists are chains that came to the Internet with extensive experience in catalogs and mail order, which share with Internet retailing the crucial need for reliable delivery. A widely cited example is Williams-Sonoma, the kitchenware retailer, which opened its Web site for business Nov. 1 and racked up $1.5 million in Internet sales in its first month. ''They know how to get the product to the customer in a timely fashion,'' said Brian S. Postol, an analyst for A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. **********Other retailers used to catalog sales expected to thrive on the Internet include Staples and Office Depot in stationery and office supplies, and Victoria's Secret, the lingerie retailer owned by Intimate Brands. Unlike most retailers, Victoria's Secret does not offer its Internet customers the option of returning items bought on the Web site at its stores. But the relative privacy of shopping on the Web appeals to men who find browsing in a lingerie store uncomfortable. **********Among department-store chains, two have taken sharply different approaches to the Internet. Federated Department Stores, parent of Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Stern's and other chains, signaled a big foray into e-commerce when it bought Fingerhut, the catalog company, in February. **********Several analysts said that Fingerhut's expertise in order fulfillment gives Federated an online edge. But some wondered if the Internet lends itself to buying sportswear, suits and dresses, and said that Federated's Web sites so far do not offer enough depth of selection to sustain customer interest. **********By contrast, Nordstrom, which began as a shoe store, is emphasizing depth, not breadth, on its new shoes-only site, www.nordstromshoes.com. The company says that the site lets customers choose from among 20 million pairs of shoes. **********The new site, which may be a prototype for other specialized Nordstrom sites, leaves many analysts skeptical, but Dorothy S. Lakner, of CIBC World Markets, is optimistic about its prospects. Since 30 percent of the company's catalog sales come from shoes, she said, the company ''knew that people would buy shoes without trying them on.'' **********Analysts point to Costco as the general merchandise retailer to watch on the Web, because of its success in selling merchandise online that is not carried in its sprawling stores, including items like jukeboxes, pool tables and even diamond jewelry. **********Some may find it hard to imagine buying a $70,000 ring online from a warehouse store, but Costco seems to inspire an unusual level of trust in customers. ''They are known for having good-quality items,'' said Michael J. Shea, an analyst at D. A. Davidson in Great Falls, Mont. ''And you know you're getting the best deal.'' **********Not all analysts say Costco's online product strategy makes sense. Daniel T. Binder of Brown Brothers Harriman faulted the company Web site's limited selection. ''The beauty of the Internet,'' he said, ''is being able to offer a greater breadth of product, which they don't do.'' **********But like other retailers, Costco has found that the Internet presents a low-cost opportunity to promote its products and establish a bond with customers. **********For now, like many ''click-and-mortar'' retailers, Costco's revenues from the Internet are fairly insignificant: It expects just $60 million in online sales in the fiscal year ending in August, a pittance next to overall sales of $27.5 billion. And the portfolio managers who are buying the stock, including Ronald E. Elijah of the RS Value and Growth Fund, said that the company's fundamentals are the attraction, not its Internet performance. **********Analysts and investors, though, may have doubts about any large retailer that fails to have an e-commerce strategy, though. ''We worry about the ones that don't understand it, that are holding out,'' Mr. Elijah said. ''They're going to get challenged.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-news-analysis-shadows-they-led-glory-days-of-alliance.html": {"writer_name": "R.

No politician thinks otherwise. Yet it was poignant to see some of the commanding figures in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's great triumph in the cold war languishing in the shadows this weekend as the alliance commemorated its 50th anniversary. **********Ronald Reagan, the implacable foe of the ''evil empire,'' as he called the Soviet Union, remained in seclusion on the other side of the continent, his public career ended by Alzheimer's disease. **********Helmut Kohl, who more than anyone else brought about the reunification of Germany, came to Washington for the NATO summit, and President Clinton on Thursday bestowed upon him the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom. Mr. Kohl ranked among the greatest leaders of the 20th century, the President said, along with Churchill, Roosevelt and de Gaulle. **********Still, when the official ceremonies got under way, it was of course not the former Chancellor who represented Germany but his successor, Gerhard Schroder, the man who denied Mr. Kohl another term in a hard-fought election campaign last year. At the time, Mr. Kohl said one of the worst things about his defeat was that it meant he would not be in office for the NATO anniversary. **********''I have had my troubles in my time in office,'' he said wistfully in his response to Mr. Clinton. **********Lech Walesa, the shipyard organizer in Gdansk who helped to set off the revolts against Soviet domination all across Eastern Europe, came to Washington, too, as ''a guest of honor'' of the Polish delegation. **********But he is a former President now.  He was invited to meet with the editorial staff of The Washington Times, where he said NATO's policy toward Yugoslavia was ''too soft.''  The alliance, he said, should use ''force serious enough to paralyze them.'' **********Photographers sought him out, fascinated as ever by his distinctive mustache, which is now almost white. One caught him sitting almost alone, in a sea of empty chairs near the back of the Mellon Auditorium, reading and waiting for Friday's commemorative events to begin. **********And when they did begin, it was not the familiar Mr. Walesa who spoke for Poland. Instead, it was the nation's current President, Aleksander Kwasniewski, who spoke eloquently of membership in NATO as ''a symbol of the definite end'' of three centuries of national tragedy. **********As Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Eduard A. Shevardnadze applied perestroika to foreign policy, easing tensions between East and West -- a major step toward NATO's bloodless victory in the cold war. But now he is the President of Georgia, a much smaller country that is one of the NATO wannabee's, and not even near the head of that list. So he came on a B-ticket and sat in a back row. **********He met with the Texans he had dealt with in the heady days a decade ago -- former President George Bush and former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But this time Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze talked about Caspian Sea oil. **********The Georgian had his say on the Balkan crisis at a dinner on Friday night at the Nixon Center, a foreign policy think tank, strongly endorsing the NATO bombing against Yugoslavia. Otherwise, he said, ''we would have encountered a catastrophe with ten times the casualties.'' **********He added, making crystal-clear his differences with Moscow: ''There is no other way but to use force. This is the only way to stop the ethnic cleansing and extreme separatism.'' **********Only President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic was on the stage at the Mellon Auditorium and at the White House dinner to represent the national leaders who played pivotal roles in the unraveling of the Soviet Empire in the 1980's. And only he -- with the obvious exceptions of Mr. Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Jacques Chirac of France -- was at all familiar to most Americans. **********So it remained for Mr. Havel, the playwright-politician who led the ''velvet revolution,'' to hark back to the cold war. He told his colleagues that the admission to NATO of nations that once belonged to the Warsaw Pact, including his own, ''signifies the real and definitive end of the imposed division of Europe and the world, the real and definitive fall of the Iron Curtain, and the real and definitive demise of the so-called Yalta agreement.'' **********But events, and NATO, have moved on to Kosovo, robbing the summit meeting of much of its historical dimension. Weary of yesterday, focused on today, CNN even cut away from Mr. Havel's speech for a war report before he had finished."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/business/worldbusiness/IHT-sound-economic-outlook-drives-market-rally.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-04-06", "snippet": "Stock prices rallied to record levels Monday, the first day of trading after a generally favorable report on the U.S. labor market, as traders concluded that economic growth could remain steady, fueling gains in corporate profits..The employment r...", "word_count": 1646, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sound Economic Outlook Drives Market Rally", "print_headline": "Sound Economic Outlook Drives Market Rally", "body_text": " **********Stock prices rallied to record levels Monday, the first day of trading after a generally favorable report on the U.S. labor market, as traders concluded that economic growth could remain steady, fueling gains in corporate profits. **********The employment report \u2014 issued while markets were closed for Good Friday \u2014 showed a decrease in the jobless rate but a smaller increase in wages than had been expected. **********At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 174.82 points at a record 10,007.33, the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 27.40 at 1,321.12, also a record, and the Nasdaq composite was up 58.82 at 2,552.19, also its highest level yet.

Through his own work and as producer of the Jazz in July concerts at the 92d Street Y, Mr. Hyman has spent his career educating audiences about the great figures of prewar jazz. As a result, the videos, etudes,  biographical nuggets and diabolically difficult quiz on this two-disk set are weighted toward the giants of jazz piano -- Jelly Roll Morton, Art Tatum, Fats Waller, Earl Hines, Teddy Wilson. Oh, yes: and Dick Hyman. **********The project tries to be comprehensive (it covers 63 pianists), though it shouldn't need to; presumably, no aspiring pianist is going to learn everything from one source, and since Mr. Hyman has more to say on the prewar styles, he might have done better simply to devote both disks to the first half of the century. **********In any case, Century of Jazz Piano is full of valuable and specific knowledge. Mr. Hyman isn't offering beginner piano lessons here. But for pianists or even vaguely interested casual musicians with a bit of jazz knowledge, Mr. Hyman gracefully, if a bit too self-referentially, connects the dots of a historical line that can be hard to follow. **********Some of the features reviewed here, like the MIDI files, the quiz and the video lessons, are included only in the Pro version. **********Mr. Hyman has studied every period of jazz piano. That works in his favor where permission fees are concerned: for Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, Cecil Taylor, Bill Evans, McCoy Tyner and others of the last 50 years, he often supplies his own etudes based in their style or plays a standard in their style. His imitations are skillful and useful, but sometimes they amount to parlor tricks pushed a bit too far. In the Chick Corea section, for example, he presents improvisations rooted very generally in Chick Corea's style, although, as he puts it, his improvisations ''are in no way based on any of Chick's.'' Something this far removed from the source really belongs in the Dick Hyman section, if it belongs at all in a history of jazz piano. **********Elsewhere on the disks, in a MIDI application (MIDI being the computer language used for musical notation), the user can see all these tunes -- originals and Mr. Hyman's imitations -- played on a digitized keyboard seen from above, with red dots lighting the appropriate keys as the music moves along. That is helpful, though not for sight-reading; even better would have been an added application where one could read notated transcriptions of the tunes and improvisations, with staff-notes lighting up along the way. **********There are a few dozen Quicktime video lessons, each one lasting a few minutes. Mr. Hyman plays stylistic examples as he talks. He's comfortable in this role, and good at it. One large section is given over to Art Tatum, where Mr. Hyman details runs and intervals, analyzing Mr. Tatum's style; in ''Ragtime to Stride'' and other segments, he emphasizes how successive styles built on what came before, such as how the role of the left hand gradually changed from ragtime (a basic oom-pah) into stride (richer or leaner bass accompaniment) to the sophisticated post-stride of, say, Teddy Wilson and finally to the jabbing bebop minimalism of Bud Powell. **********On the other disk, an image of New York's 52d Street clogged with 1950's cars and giant nightclub marquees offers you eight genre options, including Harlem, Kansas City, Ragtime, Greenwich Village and, yes, Dick Hyman. A click on Greenwich Village yields two options: the Village Vanguard and the Knickerbocker Bar and Grill. Click on Knickerbocker, and you're presented with five artist choices, among them Teddy Wilson and Dave McKenna. Click on Dave McKenna and you get either a McKenna tune or a Hyman tune in the style of Mr. McKenna; a short, generalized analysis of it written by Mr. Hyman; a few still photographs, and in some cases, a short film. And for each artist there is a link to the MIDI function, so that you can see the keyboard fingering of the songs as they move along; while that happens, you can change the tempo, create a loop to repeat a section of the piece, or transpose its key. **********There are some bugs in the disks. In some of the MIDI files, ghost keys seem to be held down for long periods, making you wonder if Mr. Tatum actually had three hands. **********The jazz quiz is the most flummoxing part of the tutorial; it will reduce  almost everybody to the status of jazz moron. I headed straight for the  advanced questions and was quickly humiliated. ''Why did Dave McKenna develop a powerful left hand when he started playing for money at age  13?'' Among several plausible answers, the correct choice is ''D: A lack of bass players in Milford, MA.'' (Of course!) In the easier questions, I learned some interesting things about interventions into the careers of Oscar Peterson and Thelonious Monk by their mothers and the various nicknames under which Dick Hyman has performed. **********There is a short audio interview with Art Tatum from the 1950's. What do you suppose Mr. Tatum talked about -- technique? His own history? Actually, he was asked to name some of his favorite contemporaries. ''Well, ever heard of a kid by the name of Dick Hyman?'' he said. He's a very good pianist.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/28/business/mala-rubinstein-93-executive-who-was-an-expert-on-beauty.html": {"writer_name": "Nick Ravo", "pub_date": "1999-07-28", "snippet": "Mala Rubenstein, beauty expert and longtime executive at Helena Rubenstein, dies at age 93; photo (S)", "word_count": 293, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mala Rubinstein, 93, Executive Who Was an Expert on Beauty", "print_headline": "Mala Rubinstein, 93, Executive Who Was an Expert on Beauty", "body_text": " **********Mala Rubinstein, a beauty expert and longtime executive at Helena Rubinstein Inc., as well as an art collector and patron, died on Thursday at a hospital in Manhattan.

Global Crossing went public last year in a $399 million initial stock offering. It is backed by its founder, the financier Gary Winnick, who is the main architect of Global Crossing's strategy. He is a former associate of the junk bond financier Michael Milken. **********But along with Mr. Winnick, Global Crossing has an executive suite already packed with high-powered executives. Global Crossing's chief executive is Robert Annunziata, the former founder of Teleport Communications Group, a company acquired by AT&T last year for about $12 billion. Mr. Annunziata worked briefly at AT&T before joining Global Crossing and has said that he was willing to quit AT&T only if he could run a company again. **********But in the combined company, he will have to share the chief executive spot with Solomon D. Trujillo, chairman and chief executive of U S West. They will be advised by a board of 22 directors, 10 from U S West and 10 from Global Crossing-Frontier, with two to be added later. **********Global Crossing was advised by Salomon Smith Barney and Chase Manhattan Bank.

''I have every confidence in my ability to maintain the impartiality and the independence of the BBC, which I feel enormously strongly about,'' he said. **********The debate about his appointment is emotional here because many Britons feel proprietorial about the BBC. They nickname it Auntie for the staid image that emanates from the historical dramas, political debates and solid news coverage that run alongside British soaps, dramas and sports in its programming. **********They finance it through a compulsory $160-a-year license fee that is supposed to cover many of the costs of domestic public radio and television. And it is credited with wielding broad political influence. **********Mr. Dyke, by contrast, is associated with such television coups as rescuing the commercial Independent Television's ''TV-AM'' breakfast show in the 1980's by promoting a puppet called Roland Rat. **********In the late 1980's, at the commercial London Weekend Television, he commissioned such programs as ''Blind Date'' and ''Gladiators'' -- the first based on televised romance, the second on displays of male and female muscle. **********At Pearson Television, the broadcasting arm of the Pearson P.L.C. media group, he supervised the acquisition of All American Communications -- which produces ''Baywatch'' and ''The Price Is Right.'' **********Mr. Dyke belongs to a coterie of senior broadcasters including Sir John Birt, who is to retire in March, and Sir Christopher Bland, the BBC chairman, who is said by BBC insiders to have pushed hard for Mr. Dyke's appointment. All three worked closely together at London Weekend Television in the 1980's and early 1990's. **********Unusually, though, in the world of the public broadcasting elite, Mr. Dyke describes himself as part of what he calls the ''elevated working class.'' He went to a public grammar school, not a private school, and worked in jobs that included trainee store manager and newspaper reporter before starting his broadcasting career 22 years ago. **********In a land that calibrates social status in part by people's accents, he speaks with traces of the so-called estuary English of southeast England rather than the Oxford English once associated with the BBC. **********But for British politicians the issue has been his affiliation with Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party. Mr. Dyke ran unsuccessfully as a Labor candidate in a local election in 1977 and as a young television researcher was seen as a radical labor unionist. **********Since then his radicalism has mellowed somewhat: as a cost-cutting television executive, he was reported to have garnered some $13 million in a stock option plan that paid off when London Weekend Television was taken over by Granada Group in 1994. **********But the Conservative opposition still does not trust him. ''In the current climate of Labor cronyism, we are concerned that the appointment of Mr. Dyke, who has given recent and substantial financial support to the Labor Party, may be prejudicial to the BBC's reputation,'' said Mr. Hague, the Conservative leader. **********In a well-publicized race, Mr. Dyke fought off challenges from three other candidates. The BBC's board of governors said that after a ''rigorous dialogue,'' the board had concluded that Mr. Dyke ''would be determined and able to protect the BBC's independence, reputation for impartiality and resist pressure from whatever source.'' **********For his part, Prime Minister Blair denied any interference.

A recent sighting: In the March 28 issue of The New York Times Magazine, G. Richard Shell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and author of ''Bargaining for Advantage,'' soon to be published by Viking, interviewed Richard Butler, the chief United Nations arms inspector, about what was described as ''Saddam Hussein, 2-year-old children and the art of getting one's way.'' **********The one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with people has a history, according to two of Mr. Shell's colleagues at Penn. In America, ''this straddle has always been there between what works in business and what works with personal relations,'' said Michael Zuckerman, a historian. Consider, he said, Dale Carnegie and his 1937 ur-guide, ''How to Win Friends and Influence People,'' or Benjamin Franklin and his worldly-wise ''Autobiography.'' **********Now, with the stock market ''a national obsession,'' said Jerry Jacobs, who teaches sociology at Penn, business is increasingly ''where all our metaphors are coming from.'' A pattern of working at home adds to the trend, he said, and ''there's an interesting blurring going on.'' **********Three new books on negotiating and resolving conflicts contribute, in varying degrees, to that blurring. **********In my local bookstore, ''Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most'' (Viking, $24.95), by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton and Sheila Heen of the Harvard Negotiation Project, pops up in three places: on the general-interest tables, among the business books and in the self-improvement display, rubbing spines with ''How to Succeed With Women.'' **********Jane von Mehren, the book's editor at Viking, said the ubiquity is intentional: ''We wanted to grow the book beyond the traditional business-book market,'' which she sees as ''potentially lucrative, but somewhat limited.'' The aim is to create another blockbuster like ''Getting to Yes,'' the Harvard group's 1981 hit negotiating guide, by Roger Fisher and Mr. Patton. **********But enough about marketing. What about making sense? Does this book deliver on the jacket's promise of an effective way through sticky situations, whether ''with your baby sitter or your biggest client''? **********It does. But be advised that the ''Harvard Method,'' as this style of communicating is known, requires insight, a certain comfort level with psychology and, for best results, a willing, not-too-neurotic talking partner. It's a method a marriage counselor might use. **********Briefly, ''Difficult Conversations'' theorizes that each difficult conversation (fighting about a family will, laying off an employee, visiting a child's concerned teacher) is really three simultaneous communications. There's the ''what happened'' conversation, with its competing versions of reality and import. There's the ''feelings'' conversation, with unacknowledged emotions running amok and therefore running the show. And there's the ''identity'' conversation, a parallel internal monologue about one's own guilt or sense of self in the matter at hand. **********Carefully, and with less jargon that you might expect, ''Difficult Conversations'' unpacks each of these, using credible examples from work and personal life. The aim is to explore ''each other's stories'' (there's that jargon) in a kind of mutually therapeutic way, while acknowledging, and thus taming, emotional reactions and taking note of inner self-doubts about what the argument ''means'' about us. That way, we can stop being defensive and move the conversation along. **********None of this is silly, and much of it is smart. And ''Difficult Conversations'' wisely stays away from inappropriate arenas -- merger talks, say, or global diplomacy. Still, it's difficult to imagine a company full of ''aware'' employees getting through a work day. (''Oh, no, there's Al from accounting -- he is, like, so stuck in his identity story.'') **********''NEGOTIATING in the Real World: Getting the Deal You Want'' (Simon & Schuster, $24), by Victor Gotbaum, also gives advice by drawing from both business and personal life: Mr. Gotbaum, a labor leader who for decades headed New York City's huge municipal employees' union, even discusses his own ''long, drawn-out divorce'' as an example of a failed negotiation. **********Mainly, Mr. Gotbaum's principles here are familiar, though there's a good section on how ultimatums can lead to disasters like the baseball strike of the mid-1990's. And because of the book's abrupt transitions and lack of contextual detail -- dates are omitted in a number of anecdotes -- there is no vivid sense of time or place. The author has some juicy stories to tell and lots of blunt opinions about the New York mayors he has tangled with, but he misses many opportunities. **********The focus is narrower in ''The Keys to Conflict Resolution: Proven Methods of Resolving Disputes Voluntarily'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, $22), by Theodore W. Kheel. The jacket talks of ''convincing the neighbor to mow the lawn at a normal hour,'' but the book mainly distills the experiences of its author, a national labor official who also mediated in business, civil rights and municipal crises, often at the behest of presidents, governors and mayors. **********The book has a quaint elder-statesman quality, with quotes from the Bible, Shakespeare and Robert Burns, and draws examples from fields as varied as diplomacy and baseball. But Mr. Kheel's advice is not as interesting as his ruminations on former New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo or the tangled history of New York City's newspapers, including the bizarre negotiations surrounding Rupert Murdoch's 1988 sale of The New York Post."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/29/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/27/business/world-business-briefing-asia-phone-company-profit-falls.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-11-27", "snippet": "Singapore Telecommunications Ltd posts its first profit decline since it went public in 1993; profit, before a gain, for six months ended in September fell 3.1 percent, to 966.2 million Singapore dollars ($578.6 million) from 997.6 million dollars...", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PHONE COMPANY PROFIT FALLS", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; PHONE COMPANY PROFIT FALLS", "body_text": " **********Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., Asia's No. 5 phone company, posted its first profit decline since it went public in 1993, hurt by big reductions in its international rates to prepare for competition.

You could give to the Make-A-Wish Foundation or the Grant-A-Wish Foundation, which is not the same as the Grant-A-Wish Network. Or perhaps the Children's Wish Foundation International or Fulfill a Wish Foundation or Wishing Well Foundation USA. **********Especially around the holidays, when many people whip out checkbooks or credit cards at the last minute, there is rampant confusion about exactly which charity has its hand out. Some charities happily exploit the confusion, trading on the names of better-known rivals. Others simply reap whatever comes their way and ask few questions. And some may not be charities at all. **********Of course, some confusion is inevitable because of groups with similar names. And, certainly, many sound-alike charities are not exploiting the public. **********But as the number of registered charities tops 650,000, and the Internet continues to bring more within easy reach, the problem of sound-alikes and look-alikes has intensified, forcing some established charities to hire lawyers and engage in uncharacteristic finger-pointing. **********Distinguishing among charities is ''becoming more and more of a challenge,'' said Bennett M. Weiner, an official of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, whose national office reviews 300 charities. **********There are well over 150 charities registered with the Internal Revenue Service with ''breast cancer'' in their name. Shop2Give.com, a Web site that promises to send to charity a percentage of what visitors spend on its site, lists 146 cancer charities in California alone. Searching for ferret rescue organizations? Yahoo, the Internet search engine, has 14. **********Knowing which charity is which can be nearly impossible when hearing a pitch by a fast-talking phone solicitor or when calling directory assistance. Donors ''don't really know,'' said Kathryn Jones, president of the Better Business Bureau in Idaho Falls. ''They hear certain words.'' **********For example, of six easily confused wish-granting organizations, only Make-A-Wish, the oldest, gets a passing grade from all three of the leading consumer groups that rate charities. The other five are either not rated or fall short. **********Yet the fund-raising company hired by the Wishing Well Foundation told potential donors, ''I'm sure you've heard of us; we send terminally ill children to places like Disney World,'' according to a lawsuit filed by the Minnesota attorney general's office. The suit, settled this month, contended that Wishing Well had misled donors by implying that it was a local charity -- it is based in Metairie, La. -- and by preying on possible confusion with better-known charities. **********Wishing Well and its fund-raiser, Gecko Communications, neither of which admitted to wrongdoing, agreed not to solicit Minnesota residents before 2004. They also agreed to pay civil penalties and legal fees of $22,500 and spend $38,000 for wish-granting in Minnesota. **********''There was no intention to be confused with anybody,'' said Matthew Brown, a lawyer for Wishing Well. Errol Copilevitz, a lawyer for Gecko, said that while there was a settlement, ''there were no findings of wrongdoing.'' **********In another case of mistaken identities, Robert Bardavid, who lives in Phoenix, was feeling generous in October when he got a flier from the Cancer Control Society asking for donated clothes and jewelry. He later learned that the group is unrelated to the American Cancer Society. **********Since he had promised a gift, Mr. Bardavid did contribute some items when the truck arrived. But he said: ''The organization is playing on the name of the cancer society. I think it's misleading.'' **********The Cancer Control Society, based in Los Angeles, has been around since 1973, said a founder, Lorraine Rosenthal. ''There is no similarity,'' she said. **********Businesses, of course, spend millions to advertise their names and  protect their trademarks in court. Charities, however, have traditionally been reluctant to use donor money to take on their doppelgangers. **********''This confusion is always going to exist,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, which had some problems with sound-alikes when a New Jersey charity, the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America, was accused by state regulators of misusing charitable funds. While the latter is operating under an interim consent decree with new management, the society continues to receive calls from confused donors.  Still, Ms. Rosenblat says it wants to spend its money on its mission, not public relations or lawsuits. **********But other nonprofits are tired of turning the other cheek. Many are explicitly flagging the more vexing look-alikes on their Web sites and advising donors to consult charity watchdogs or state attorneys general. **********The main concern ''is the loss of donors' trust,'' said Don L. Rigin, chief executive of the Arthritis Foundation, the largest charity doing arthritis research and education among some 150 related groups. **********Last year, the foundation joined with the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association in suing Citizens Action Group, a Glendale, Calif., group that was the subject of two recent investigations by the ABC News program ''20/20.'' The suit also named Kent Stryker, the group's president. The older charities contended that Mr. Stryker was collecting for various groups with names ''confusingly similar'' to their own, like the National Cancer Association or National Heart Foundation. The parties later settled. **********To be sure, no one suggests that different charities cannot tackle the same problem. ''There are thousands of children's nonprofits,'' said Brian R. Morrison, executive director of the Grant-A-Wish Foundation, a Baltimore charity he founded in 1982, two years after Make-A-Wish. ''It is very difficult to find a name that isn't somewhat similar to something else.'' **********But charities acknowledge that donors may not always realize which is which. Guide Dogs for the Blind and Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind, for example, have both been operating for more than 50 years and do much the same thing: provide guide dogs and training. ''There is an occasional time when we get checks made out to another organization,'' said Wells Jones, chief executive of the foundation. ''We will forward those checks.'' His counterparts at Guide Dogs say they do the same, but their Web sites (guidedog.org and guidedogs.com) make no reference to each other. **********And the confusion created by Mr. Stryker was not resolved as courteously. Mr. Stryker defends having picked names that struck some as clones. ''The major charities have been around for a long time,'' said Mr. Stryker, arguing that consumers could hardly be fooled. **********The big charities beg to differ. The parties reached an agreement in which Mr. Stryker faces restrictions on how he publicizes his causes. No longer using the name Citizens Action, Mr. Stryker continues to run the National Association for Alternative Medicine, which accepts donations of cars. He says he is in full compliance with the settlement agreement, and the charities do not dispute that. **********Other Johnny-come-latelys have also had to contend with lawsuits. Make-A-Wish recently settled its lawsuit against Fulfill A Wish, in which it contended that Fulfill was confusing donors. While the terms of the settlement are confidential, Fulfill now operates as Kids Wish Network. **********Though Make-A-Wish is reluctant to spend money on lawyers, it felt it had little choice, said Paul G. Allvin, a spokesman. ''We are not doing our job as a charity if we do not defend our name,'' he said. **********Charities also worry about the effect of publicity when a sound-alike gets into trouble. Grant-A-Wish Foundation lost sleep over an NBC News report about the Grant-A-Wish Network in October that criticized the network for not spending enough on children. The report never mentioned the foundation, yet the foundation felt obliged to spend $5,000 on a mailing to its own donors to clear the air. **********The network is no longer operating, said a woman who answered its telephone number but would not give her name. ''We never knew there was any confusion,'' she said. The woman said no one was available to answer questions. **********In many cases, it is anybody's guess how much of the money sent to some groups goes to charity. The Internal Revenue Service does not dictate charities' names, and enforcement is mostly left up to the states. So if organizations go out of business or leave town before they have to file tax returns that would disclose such details, state regulators may not have much to go on. **********The Internet only adds to the problem. Search engines can uncover huge numbers of charities, and some, like Goto.com, give priority to organizations that pay for placement, meaning that less-established charities can pay to bump aside better-known ones. **********MyCause.com, a shopping site that promises to forward some of what is spent to charity, does not accept such fees.

In the simplest terms, higher bond yields -- currently 6.16 percent for the 30-year Treasury -- make those instruments more attractive than stocks to many investors. **********Of course, the damage from rising rates is neither random nor universal. As Eric Sorensen, a quantitative research strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, points out, some industry groups have historically fared better than others. **********Mr. Sorensen examined the performance of 60 industry groups during five different periods of sustained rate increases in the last 22 years. The top-performing groups were the oil-and-gas drillers, which beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 27.6 percent; the oil producers and sellers, which outperformed by 25.4 percent, and computer software and services companies, which beat the index by 23.7 percent. **********Losers included shares of home builders, which underperformed the index by 27.3 percent; trucking companies, which fell 26.6 percent more than the S.& P., and engineering and construction firms, which lagged by 25 percent. **********Maybe even more vulnerable this time is a group that has produced some of the biggest profits in the current bull market: financial services companies, including commercial banks, brokerage firms and mortgage lenders. **********Charles W. Peabody, a bank analyst at Mitchell Securities, believes that the combination of rising interest rates and the hefty leverage on the books of these businesses will prove hazardous to their stock prices. ''Right here and now, money center banks and broker dealers are most vulnerable,'' Mr. Peabody said, ''because they are the most exposed to interest-rate-related products such as swaps and mortgages.'' **********The most popular of all derivative products is the interest rate swap, which essentially allows participants to make bets on the direction interest rates will take. According to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, interest rate swaps accounted for three out of four derivative contracts held by commercial banks at the end of last year. The notional value of these swaps totaled almost $25 trillion; 2 percent to 3 percent of that reflected the banks' true credit risk in these products. **********Derivatives of all kinds weigh heavily on banks' capital structures, as the accompanying chart shows. But interest rate swaps can be especially toxic when interest rates rise. And since only a few economists predicted a jump in rates for the first half of the year when 1999 began -- in fact, yields have risen 21 percent -- it is a good bet that many of these institutions now find themselves on the wrong side of an interest rate gamble. **********Moreover, as interest rates rise, Mr. Peabody noted, banks' income diminishes from interest-rate-related businesses like mortgage lending. ''Interest-sensitive sources of income will be the revenue disappointments this year,'' Mr. Peabody said. Last year, it was trading, he noted. **********With Treasury yields at their highest levels in a year and a half, a rate increase from the Federal Reserve at the end of this month seems all but certain.

And it was not until April that the Energy Department shut down its classified computer systems to impose tighter security over their data. **********Meanwhile, in February, the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, tried to delete evidence that he had improperly transferred more than 1,000 files containing nuclear secrets, officials said. **********The classified report contains numerous warnings and specific examples showing that outsiders had gained access to the computer systems at United States weapons labs  as recently as June 1998. **********Lawmakers from both parties have raised questions about why the Clinton Administration failed to address security breaches at the laboratories sooner, and the report, which has been shared with Congress, is certain to fuel the debate. **********The report, the first comprehensive review of its kind, was prepared by United States counterintelligence officials throughout the Government. It confirmed and elaborated on longstanding concerns about the vulnerability of the weapons laboratories to espionage. **********The report was distributed to the highest levels of the Government, including Bill Richardson, the Secretary of Energy; William S. Cohen, the Secretary of Defense; Janet Reno, the Attorney General; President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, and three dozen other senior officials at law enforcement, defense and intelligence agencies. A Government official gave a copy of the report to The New York Times. **********According to the report, the Energy Department recorded 324 attacks on its unclassified computer systems from outside the United States between October 1997 and June 1998, including instances when outsiders successfully gained ''complete access and total control to create, view modify or execute any and all information stored on the system.'' **********The document does not say where the computer attacks originated. **********A select Congressional committee sent the President additional warnings about the security of the weapons laboratories in a separate report that was also secret delivered in January of this year. **********Mr. Richardson said in an interview that he was briefed extensively on the report and that it ''confirmed the already strong counterintelligence measures I approved in October, including cyber-measures.'' **********The search of Mr. Lee's computer ''should have happened earlier,'' Mr. Richardson said. But he defended waiting until April 2 to shut down the computer systems at the laboratory, saying: ''It wouldn't have made much of a difference to have gone earlier.'' **********''The shutdown was the most extreme of measures,'' he said. After learning on March 30 that Mr. Lee had improperly moved vast amounts of nuclear secrets, Mr. Richardson said he decided to ''speed up'' plans adopted months earlier to improve computer security. **********He defended his department's performance but said that some Energy  officials might be disciplined once an internal inquiry he ordered had been completed. **********Incidents Involved Many Other Countries **********The 25-page counterintelligence report contains many examples of lax security and serious intelligence breaches at the labs that have not been previously disclosed, involving more than a dozen foreign countries. **********Foreign spies ''rightly view D.O.E. as an inviting, diverse and soft target that is easy to access and that employs many who are willing to share information,'' the report states. The Energy Department is responsible for building and designing America's nuclear weapons. **********China is cited in the report as posing the most serious security threat to the United States weapons labs. The report also singles out Russia and India as immediate threats. **********''China represents an acute intelligence threat to D.O.E.,'' the report said. ''It conducts 'a full court press' consisting of massive numbers of collectors of all kinds, in the United States, in China, and elsewhere abroad. **********''China is an advanced nuclear power yet its nuclear stockpile is deteriorating,'' it continued. ''As such, China has specifically targeted D.O.E. for the collection of technical intelligence related to the design of nuclear weapons.'' **********The report concludes, ''This effort has been very successful and Beijing's exploitation of U.S. national laboratories has substantially aided its nuclear weapons program.'' **********The report states that the maintenance of nuclear weapons, so-called ''stockpile stewardship,'' is the area of most intense interest to China. Mr. Lee was at the center of Los Alamos'  stewardship program for years. **********The report also includes detailed information about a number of incidents in which China could have obtained sensitive weapons information, as well as some of the ways the espionage could have taken place, including these: ***********A Chinese scientist working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, on Long Island, was able to send dozens of long, technical faxes to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, enabling the Chinese research center to duplicate Brookhaven experiments as they were being conducted. ***********China might be using its exchanges with American scientists for espionage. Chinese intelligence officials have also arranged the visits of American scientists to China to ''enable Chinese experts to assess and develop these contacts,'' according to the report. ***********Thirty-seven Chinese intelligence officers have visited or been assigned to the labs and other Energy Department facilities over the last five years. **********More than a half-dozen Congressional committees are examining  both evidence of Chinese nuclear spying and security failures at Los Alamos and other weapons labs. The secret November report, some officials believe, is the latest sign that the Clinton Administration and investigators moved too slowly and repeatedly missed opportunities to address the problems. **********President Clinton has said his Administration acted quickly once it learned of security problems at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories. White House officials cite the President's February 1998 directive to beef up security. That directive called for an assessment of the security threat against nuclear weapons and technology secrets at the Energy Department which was completed last November. **********But in recent days, with new disclosures about the extent of Mr. Lee's improper transfers of secret weapons data, the Clinton Administration is facing intensified questions about how his actions, which jeopardized secrets to virtually the entire United States nuclear arsenal, could have gone undetected for so long. **********''Why is it that nobody looked at his computer files until there was a crisis?'' said a senior Energy Department official. ''That's what we're trying to look into. **********Mr. Lee has not been charged. His lawyer left a message on a reporter's voice mail saying the allegations against his client are false. **********The report also focuses on security breaches at the labs involving other countries, citing numerous incidents. For example, Russian intelligence has intercepted communications from Los Alamos concerning nuclear power plants used for military purposes. In addition, the report says that an unknown individual sent 38 faxes to India from inside a sensitive area of the Oak Ridge Laboratory, in Tennessee, during a 30-day period in 1995 and 1996. **********The report grew out of a comprehensive counterintelligence review prompted by an investigation that came to focus on Mr. Lee in 1996. **********Questions were raised about Mr. Lee as far back as 1982. At that time, he telephoned a scientist who had been dismissed from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a result of an F.B.I. investigation of China's theft of neutron bomb secrets, officials said. In the phone call, Mr. Lee offered to help the other scientist with his problems with the lab. The F.B.I. investigated Mr. Lee as a result of the phone call and gave him a polygraph test in late 1982 or early 1983, officials said. He passed. **********Suspicions Raised By Congratulatory Hug **********Officials say that in 1994 or 1995, another Los Alamos scientist saw Mr. Lee being hugged by a visiting Chinese scientist in a manner that seemed suspiciously congratulatory. It turned out to be a scientist Mr. Lee had visited in China in 1988. **********The witness reported the encounter to the F.B.I., officials said, one of the factors that eventually led the bureau to suspect him in China's theft of design information about America's most advanced nuclear warhead, known as the W-88. **********Some in Congress have questioned whether the F.B.I. was aggressive enough in its pursuit of Mr. Lee in the W-88 case, especially since both Mr. Lee and his wife had informally provided information to the bureau in the past, officials said. **********Mr. Lee gave ''useful information'' to the bureau in at least one case in the early 1980's, and his wife, a secretary at Los Alamos, acted as an informant for the F.B.I. from 1987 to 1992, passing on information about visiting Chinese delegations. He finally emerged as the prime suspect in the W-88 case in early 1996. **********In April 1996, Energy Department officials briefed Mr. Berger, then the deputy national security adviser, on the case and how it related to China's nuclear strategy. Mr. Berger took no action and did not inform the President of the matter, White House officials have said. **********The F.B.I. meanwhile began a criminal inquiry. But little investigative work was done by F.B.I. agents throughout the rest of 1996. **********In 1997, the Justice Department declined an F.B.I. request to ask a court for authority to monitor Mr. Lee's phone and to gain access to Mr. Lee's office computer. Justice Department officials argued there was insufficient evidence to convince a judge to approve the surveillance. **********The F.B.I. had asked the Energy Department not to move Mr. Lee from his job at Los Alamos, fearing this might alert him that he was a suspect. But the inquiry appeared to be stalled. In April 1997, the bureau's agents in Albuquerque, N.M., told Energy Department officials they could transfer Mr. Lee to a less sensitive job. **********But that message apparently never reached Energy Department officials in Washington, officials said.  The job Mr. Lee was shifted to that month was one in which he was responsible for updating a computerized archive of nuclear secrets. **********Another Briefing, And a Second Case **********In July 1997, Mr. Berger was briefed again. This time, the briefing included evidence that the Chinese were focusing on computer systems at Los Alamos, in particular computer simulations and codes for nuclear weapons, according to one United States official. At about the same time, officials at the Energy Department, the lab and the F.B.I. were all also warned that the Chinese were attempting to gain access to computer systems at Los Alamos. **********The July discussion was also broader, including other security problems, the W-88 theft and other espionage cases, including one involving a scientist who had worked for weapons labs and their contractors, officials said. **********David C. Leavy, a White House spokesman, said today that the 1997 briefing ''included a number of troubling disclosures.'' He added that it was that briefing that led the White House to begin the process of seeking to tighten security at the labs. **********That second scientist, Peter Lee (who is not related to Wen Ho Lee) later pleaded guilty to attempting to pass classified information in 1985 and making false statements about a trip to China in 1997. The November 1998 report cited his case as ''a good example of China's use of cultural ties to collect successfully.'' **********After Mr. Berger's 1997 briefing, he discussed the matter with the President, and White House officials began to draft a Presidential directive ordering better security at the laboratories, White House officials said. **********Meanwhile, the F.B.I.'s investigation of Wen Ho Lee continued without success. **********In the summer of 1998, Chinese-American F.B.I. agents, posing as Chinese spies, tried to establish a covert relationship with Mr. Lee, officials said. In their sting, what the F.B.I. calls a ''false flag'' operation, the F.B.I. agents called him, pretending to be Chinese spies checking up on Mr. Lee in the wake of Peter Lee's conviction earlier that year, officials said. Wen Ho Lee listened, and then called the agents back to refuse their offer to get together. **********By the fall of 1998, both of the Lee cases were coming under the scrutiny of the select Congressional committee, headed by Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California. At about the same time, Mr. Richardson took over at the Energy Department from Federico Pena . **********In November, the secret counterintelligence report was completed. Mr. Richardson, prodded both by Congress and by the mounting evidence of security problems, took action to  screen foreign visitors to the labs, proposals that had lain dormant for years at the Energy Department. **********In December, Mr. Lee was subjected to a polygraph for the first time. **********During that first examination, for reasons that officials could not explain, investigators did not ask Mr. Lee to consent to a search of his office computer. Government attorneys had concluded that the earlier Justice Department denial for an F.B.I. surreptitious search required Mr. Lee's permission to examine his office computer. **********In February, Mr. Lee took a second polygraph. This time, officials said, he was asked about his computer use and some of his answers were seen as deceptive. Two days later, apparently aware that investigators were now suspicious about his computer use, Mr. Lee deleted between 1,000 and 2,000 files, officials said. **********Mr. Lee's deletions involved millions of lines of computer codes he had downloaded, mostly in 1994 and 1995, from his classified computer system to an unclassified system. Such unclassified systems at the labs have been successfully attacked by outsiders, according to the 1998 intelligence report. **********In early March, Mr. Lee was interviewed by the F.B.I. During the interviews he gave permission for his computer to be searched. On March 8, he was fired from Los Alamos for security violations. **********Over the next few weeks, investigators pored through his computer records, recreated the deleted files and learned that Mr. Lee had downloaded computer data and codes that, in effect, were the distillation of more than a half-century of research on how to perfect nuclear weapons, officials said. **********Investigators have not determined whether another country -- China, for instance -- obtained the computer data. But officials said they have found evidence that someone retrieved the renamed files that had been switched to the unclassified system. **********After learning of Mr. Lee's computer transfers, Mr. Richardson shut down the computer systems at the weapons labs. He ordered new procedures to make it more difficult to transfer classified data. **********The inadequacy of Energy Department's monitoring of lab computer systems had been pointed out for years in low-level Energy Department reports, as well as in the November 1998 intelligence report sent to Mr. Richardson. **********''The reason they didn't shut down computer systems earlier is because they weren't paying attention to the problem,'' said one Republican member of Congress."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/27/world/conflict-in-the-balkans-the-law-legal-scholars-support-case-for-using-force.html": {"writer_name": "William Glaberson", "pub_date": "1999-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 639, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Legal Scholars Support Case for Using Force", "print_headline": "CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE LAW; Legal Scholars Support Case for Using Force", "body_text": " **********The NATO attack on Yugoslavia skirts the edge of international law, legal experts say. But there are few meaningful sanctions that could be imposed under international law, and legal principles are vague enough to provide justification for the bombing as a humanitarian act. **********The central assertion of the Yugoslav Government, Russian officials and other critics of the attack is that NATO has illegally intervened in a sovereign nation's internal dispute. That argument rests on the United Nations charter, which prohibits the use of force except in self-defense, when a nation is threatened with aggression or when the Security Council authorizes a military operation for humanitarian or other reasons. **********Although the Security Council has passed resolutions expressing concern over the situation in Kosovo, and has rejected a Russian resolution demanding an immediate end to the air attacks on Yugoslavia, it has not specifically authorized force. **********But by calling the attack a ''moral imperative,'' President Clinton appears to be staking a claim to what some legal experts say is an emerging exception in international law to the United Nations charter's general prohibition on the use of force. That exception, some legal scholars say, would authorize an attack to save people like the Kosovo Albanians from persistent assault. **********The NATO bombing ''flouts the traditional interpretation of the charter,'' said Allan Gerson, a former counsel to the United States mission to the United Nations and now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. **********''But it is compatible,'' Mr. Gerson said, ''with the emerging international humanitarian law that recognizes the rights of individuals to be protected from genocidal practices, torture and other gross human rights abuses.'' **********Jack Goldsmith, a professor of international law at the University of Chicago Law School, said that critics of the NATO bombing ''have a pretty good legal argument.'' **********''If you just read the letter of international law, it does not expressly provide an exception for a humanitarian intervention,'' he said. ''But many people think such an exception does exist as a matter of custom and practice.'' **********Administration officials have stated several grounds for the attack. In addition to the claim that the Serbs' treatment of the Kosovo Albanians was a humanitarian emergency, officials have argued that Serbia has failed to abide by international agreements and that the conflict could spread in the Balkans, threatening world peace. **********Mr. Gerson said that that argument was similar to the arguments the United States made to justify its intervention in Grenada in 1983. At that time, the United States, which was criticized by other countries at the United Nations, said that ''unique circumstances,'' including a danger to hemispheric stability and human rights abuses, justified military action, even though the United States was not in imminent danger of attack. **********In 1983, as now, he added, the United States took the risk that it would be rebuked for violating international law. But since the United States' veto power means the Security Council could not formally declare it in violation of law over American objections, the debate about legality is largely theoretical. **********''In a situation like this, it is very hard to see what the punishment for the United States or NATO could be,'' said Professor Goldsmith, of the University of Chicago. ''At the end of the day, the consequences will be political and military and not legal.'' **********Still, both internationally and domestically, the political debate about the propriety of the NATO action was already being influenced by the debate about international law. **********Some critics scoffed at the Administration argument that the bombing was required because of a humanitarian emergency. **********''Anything can be an emergency if the intervening country declares it so,'' said Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy specialist at the Cato Institute in Washington, which calls itself a libertarian think tank. **********''It has been a longstanding standard of international law,'' Mr. Carpenter said, ''that internal disputes in a country, however disagreeable, do not justify external military intervention.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/21/business/international-briefs-sweden-and-norway-set-phone-company-merger.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-01-21", "snippet": "Sweden and Norway will merge state-owned Telia AB and Telenor AS to form telephone company with annual sales of $10 billion and scope to compete in foreign markets; Telenor's Tormod Hermansen will be chief executive, while Telia's Jan Stenberg wil...", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sweden and Norway Set Phone Company Merger", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Sweden and Norway Set Phone Company Merger", "body_text": " **********Sweden and Norway said yesterday that they would merge the state-owned Telia A.B. and Telenor A.S. to form a telephone company with annual sales of $10 billion and the scope to compete in foreign markets. **********The Governments will sell 33.2 percent of the new company, to be based in Stockholm, to investors ''as soon as possible'' and before 2001.

''Our case inventory is building up because we are not working as many cases,'' he said. **********Tax consultants say some wealthy taxpayers are also shielding assets from the I.R.S. by putting them into homes, fully aware that the Government -- which used to seize as many as 1,000 houses in a year for nonpayment of taxes -- has not seized one in more than 14 months. **********Though some tax advisers say it remains risky to dodge tax debts, even some high-level I.R.S. officials acknowledge that the latest ploys may be successful. They blame antiquated computer systems, the shortage of collectors and complex new regulations that taxpayers can manipulate to delay collection. **********''We don't have the resources anymore to do hand-to-hand combat'' with recalcitrant taxpayers, said Harry Manaka, the I.R.S. chief of collection practices. **********Since 1990, the number of tax returns filed has increased 13 percent, to 226 million this year, but Congress has cut the number of tax collectors 19 percent, to about 6,800. Meanwhile, restrictions imposed by Congress to protect people from overzealous I.R.S. officials mean tax collectors handle far fewer cases. **********Some of the new rules were imposed after Senate Finance Committee hearings in 1997 and 1998 during which armed raids, bullying tactics and other abuses of taxpayers were described. While some of the testimony has since been discredited, Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who was chairman of the hearings, said that they nonetheless showed that the I.R.S. was out of control and needed to change its ways. **********Senator Roth said the problems in collections ''are like growing pains'' and that the new protections for taxpayers ''were never intended to allow tax cheats to escape the consequences of their lawless behavior.'' Once the new policies are fully in place, he added, if the I.R.S. ''for some unintended reason lacks the authority and resources necessary to pursue individuals who break the law, I can assure you we'll revisit the issue.'' **********Still, the new strictures on the agency have had a variety of unintended consequences -- most notably the de facto all-or-nothing policy on tax debts. **********The policy stems from a requirement by Congress that the I.R.S. negotiate all terms of a tax-collection agreement up front. In the past, the agency would often collect what it could from a taxpayer, and then -- as the period for collection was about to end -- threaten action such as seizing a house to persuade the debtor to pay the balance or extend the collection period, sometimes for decades. **********Now, according to tax professionals, if a taxpayer does not agree to pay in full, collectors are quick to designate the debt ''currently noncollectible,'' which, for the purposes of performance reviews, effectively closes a case. **********''Revenue officers are no longer judged by the dollars they collect, but by the efficiency with which they close cases,'' said Mike Wellman, a tax accountant in Longview, Tex., with numerous clients who he says could pay more than half of their back taxes but are paying nothing. **********Mr. Rossotti said he now limits extensions of the statute of limitations on collecting back taxes to an extra five years. And if the taxpayer will not grant an extension -- or if regular payments would not cover 100 percent of the debt even with the extended pay period -- the I.R.S. is refusing to accept an installment agreement and suspending its collection efforts. If the statute of limitations expires without I.R.S. action, the taxpayer successfully avoids paying the debt. **********The danger, explained Mr. Manaka, the I.R.S. collections executive, is that the agency could revive the case within the allotted time -- and seek penalties and interest. ''Tax professionals who advise clients to do this are taking a risky approach,'' he said. **********Mr. Manaka acknowledged, however, that the chance of a case being revived is small, provided the taxpayer continues to file annual tax returns and there is no evidence of a sharp increase in income. Adjusted gross income would have to rise between 25 percent and 200 percent, depending on the taxpayer's income level, before I.R.S. computers would flag the case for review, tax professionals and former tax collectors said. **********Mr. Kassel, the California tax preparer, said that for taxpayers with a stream of income sufficient to pay part of their back taxes, but no significant assets, there was no incentive to grant the I.R.S. an extended collections period, let alone pay delinquent taxes. **********One of his clients, Louis, a Connecticut taxpayer who insisted his last name not be used, said the I.R.S. initially told him it would accept payments that would total $66,000 of the $90,000 of back taxes owed on his family's failed food business. Six months later, another I.R.S. official said the payment agreement could not be accepted, because it would not cover the full tax bill. **********Because his income may rise, and so expose him to renewed attention from the I.R.S., Louis said he was negotiating to settle his tax debt with a lump sum payment -- a payment that may be as little as 22 percent of what he would have paid in installments. He called the I.R.S. policy ''crazy.'' **********Mr. Rossotti said the all-or-nothing policy shows that ''there are some combinations of circumstances that we still need to work on.'' **********In the meantime, many tax professionals say that they have clients who should be made to pay, but who are facing no I.R.S. enforcement. **********Rick Oelerich, an accountant in Davenport, Iowa, said that until recently he represented an Illinois doctor who owes millions of dollars in Federal income taxes, but has not faced any collection attempts by the I.R.S. -- even though he has a substantial income and substantial equity in his home. **********''The doctor's conduct was flagrant up and down the line,'' said Mr. Oelerich, who serves on a national board that advises Mr. Rossotti. ''I was not happy that I had taken the case, because the farther I got into it, the more I could see that there was no doubt that this taxpayer was abusing the system. The revenue officer had dotted his i's and crossed his t's, and yet nothing is being done to collect, and it stinks.'' **********''As a taxpayer I am outraged,'' Mr. Olerich said, adding that he has two other clients who also could, and should, pay back taxes, but whom the I.R.S. is ignoring. **********Marc Albaum, a Manhattan tax accountant who works on collection cases, said he would advise most clients against counting on the I.R.S. to ignore their tax debt, especially if they had most of their assets in their home. Knowing that the Government might seize your house, he said, ''is a terrible way to live.'' **********Still, he said, ''there is no question the I.R.S. is going to lose a lot of cases because the statute of limitations will expire.'' **********Mr. Rossotti acknowledged that it is widely believed within the I.R.S. that he has an unwritten policy against seizing homes to pay back taxes, except in cases involving major drug dealers or people who make their living claiming that the income tax is a Government hoax. **********''That is absolutely not true,'' he said. ''We have heard that some managers have said, 'Don't ever, ever send a home seizure case to me,' and we're working to get over that. The fact is that we do have the power to seize homes, and we will.'' Seizures will resume, he said, once collection officers are fully trained in the new rules governing their conduct. Every significant tax delinquency will be pursued, he said. **********By far the Government's biggest source of tax dollars is withholding from paychecks. Yet in interviews, tax collectors said thousands of cases of withheld taxes not being paid over to the I.R.S. by employers were simply being recorded in computer files, with little or no action to collect the money. **********In some I.R.S. offices, tax collectors said, managers have coped with a shortage of tax collectors by simply raising the threshold for when prompt action is required, in some cases to more than $100,000. **********''Some of these cases are so old that by the time we go out, the business will be gone and we'll never see a dime,'' said one tax collector in San Francisco. **********Mr. Rossotti acknowledged that there had been a significant increase in instances of small businesses failing to turn over withheld taxes. His staff said it had no current figures, however. He wants the I.R.S. to adopt the same collection practices as private industry, with an emphasis on contacting taxpayers within days after a payment becomes overdue. **********But tax collectors say it takes weeks, and sometimes months, before the service's ancient computers flag cases. **********Mr. Rossotti characterized the collection problems as transitory while collectors are trained."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/28/world/turkey-faces-a-quandary-on-rebellions-by-its-friends.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1999-11-28", "snippet": "Turks overwhelmingly support desire of people in Kosovo and Chechnya to establish their political independence, but if their government were to express that view, it would certainly face difficult question: if people in Kosovo or Chechnya deserve ...", "word_count": 654, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Turkey Faces A Quandary On Rebellions By Its Friends", "print_headline": "Turkey Faces A Quandary On Rebellions By Its Friends", "body_text": " **********The war raging in Chechnya has exposed one of Turkey's most delicate diplomatic problems. **********Nearly all Turks seem to support the uprising in Chechnya and deplore Russian actions there, yet the government can protest only gently. If it gives any support to ethnic rebellions abroad, it might give the outside world a basis to criticize Turkey's policy toward its Kurdish minority. **********In recent months this problem has become especially painful, because two groups of Muslims with whom Turks feel deep ethnic and cultural kinship, Kosovars and Chechens, have rebelled against their governments. Most Muslims in Chechnya are ethnic Turks, and those in Kosovo are the descendants of people who adopted Islam during the centuries when they were part of the Turkish-dominated Ottoman Empire. **********Turks overwhelmingly support the desire of people in Kosovo and Chechnya to establish their political independence. But if their government were to express that view, it would certainly face a difficult question: if people in Kosovo or Chechnya deserve autonomy or independence, why not Kurds in Turkey? **********Fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party, known as the P.K.K., have been waging war against the Turkish state for 15 years. The rebels say they are now ready for peace, but the government has spurned their overtures and demanded that they surrender unconditionally. **********Successive Turkish governments have refused to grant any form of self-rule to the Kurdish region. They have said they cannot accept the establishment of Kurdish-language universities or television stations because doing so would threaten national unity. This position makes it  difficult for officials here to support demands for self-rule in Kosovo or Chechnya, at least in public. **********The awkwardness of this situation was evident during this month's Istanbul summit meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Many countries with far less emotional connection to Chechnya strongly protested Russian actions. President Jacques Chirac of France called Russian policy ''a tragic error for the whole region,'' and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany condemned Russia for waging ''a war against a whole people.'' **********Turkey, however, was all but silent. Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said on the eve of the meeting that Turkey was ''confident that the problem can be solved peacefully in line with the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation.'' **********The same reluctance was evident when Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit visited Moscow before the meeting. **********Opposition figures, especially those who portray themselves as friends of Muslims and Turkic peoples, urged Mr. Ecevit to cancel his trip in protest over Russian actions in Chechnya. He refused to do so, and before leaving called Chechnya ''Russia's internal problem.'' **********''We give as much importance to the unity of other countries, including Russia, as we give to our own unity,'' Mr. Ecevit said. **********Comments like these have upset many people in Turkey, where there is widespread sympathy for Muslims in nearby countries. The human rights committee in Parliament has taken the unusual step of preparing its own statement denouncing Russian actions in Chechnya. It is to be released on Monday. **********''On his way to Russia, Mr. Ecevit said that Chechnya is Russia's internal affair,'' a columnist, Ismet Berkan, wrote in a news commentary. ''But in today's world, there can be no such thing. Human rights have become globalized, and no state can justify violating those rights by saying, 'This is our internal concern.' '' **********Defenders of Turkish policy toward the Kurds, however, say there is no connection between Kurdish nationalism, which they say is propelled by terror, and Chechen nationalism, which they describe as a drive for liberation from a cruel colonial power. **********''Those who point to such similarities,'' said Dogan Gures, a retired general who is now a member of Parliament, ''are either quite ignorant or harboring bad intentions.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/13/business/technology-local-signals-may-be-costly-for-satellite-tv-providers.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1999-12-13", "snippet": "Nation's big satellite television companies, DirecTV and EchoStar Communications, may have to spend as much as $1 billion to deliver local stations, including local affiliates of four big broadcast networks, to dozens of markets nationwide; Satell...", "word_count": 1503, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Local Signals May Be Costly For Satellite TV Providers", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; Local Signals May Be Costly For Satellite TV Providers", "body_text": " **********Talk about putting your money where your lobbyists' mouths are. **********For years, the nation's big satellite television companies, DirecTV and EchoStar Communications, have wailed and railed in Washington for the right to include local broadcasters in their services. Two weeks ago, they finally got it. **********Now comes the really hard work. **********Between them, DirecTV, with about eight million subscribers, and EchoStar, with about three million, may have to spend as much as $1 billion to deliver local stations, including local affiliates of the four big broadcast networks, to dozens of markets nationwide. **********Even so, not every satellite subscriber will get local stations; there may not be enough satellite capacity -- or economic motive -- to rebroadcast hundreds of local television stations and there probably never will be. And in the case of EchoStar,  even in areas where the local service will be offered, many of its customers will require new, slightly larger satellite dishes to pick up the rebroadcast local signals. **********But such are the tradeoffs in the confluence of technology, politics and finance that has characterized the development of the satellite television business. **********Until two weeks ago, the satellite operators were forbidden by law to transmit local channels -- including ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC affiliates -- to most customers. The rationale for the restriction was that the national satellite services might harm local broadcasters by, say, beaming a New York City station into Des Moines. **********But for years, the satellite companies howled that the local restriction hurt them and consumers by keeping satellite television from providing full competition to local cable television monopolies. **********''We realized a while ago that it was, in our opinion, very important if we were going to be effective competitors to cable that we have the ability to offer local programming on fair terms,'' said David K. Moskowitz, the EchoStar senior vice president who oversees the company's local broadcasting initiative. **********So when President Clinton signed the Satellite Television Home Viewers Act, which lifted the restriction, on Nov. 29 as part of a spending bill, the satellite companies largely hailed the development as opening the final door to competition with the cable monopolies. **********''This is a big fix,'' said Eddy W. Hartenstein, president of DirecTV, which is part of General Motors' Hughes Electronics subsidiary. ''The last remaining barrier why people haven't gotten the service is they say, 'Can I get my local channels?' '' **********But for the satellite companies, the potentially lucrative opportunities of carrying local broadcast signals will come at considerable cost. DirecTV and EchoStar have already begun transmitting local signals to big markets, including New York and Los Angeles, and want to expand their offerings to dozens more markets by the end of the year. But as the carriers roll out their local offerings across the nation, the capacity of their existing satellites will be sorely tested. **********Moreover, the Federal Communications Commission has yet to write the rules for implementing the new law. A big open question is how many local stations within a market the satellite company will be obliged to carry. While both DirecTV and EchoStar say they want to offer the four major commercial broadcast network affiliates, they argue that they should not be compelled to rebroadcast the dozen or more less-watched stations in some big metropolitan areas. **********For both consumers and the satellite carriers themselves, the wrinkles in offering local stations are largely a product of how satellites are deployed and managed. **********Some 22,300 miles above the equator, there are three orbital slots authorized for direct-broadcast satellites. At that altitude, a satellite positioned at 101, 110 or 119 degrees west longitude can serve all 48 contiguous states. **********At each of the three direct-broadcast satellite slots, there are 32 available frequencies. And on each frequency, current video compression technology allows the satellite companies to transmit up to 10 standard television channels. **********By the legacies and luck of F.C.C. licensing, DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies at the 101-degree slot, an additional 3 at 110 degrees and another 11 at 119 degrees. EchoStar, meanwhile, controls no frequencies at 101 degrees, 29 at 110 and 21 at 119. **********That means EchoStar, with 50 frequency slots, has more total capacity than does DirecTV, with 46 frequency slots. The big catch, however, is that standard satellite dish antennas can receive signals from only one slot at a time. Almost all DirecTV subscribers have their dishes pointed at the 101-degree position, where DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies Almost all EchoStar subscribers aim at the 119-degree slot, where EchoStar has 21 frequencies. **********The difference has major implications for the ways the companies will introduce local programming and for the steps users will or will not have to take to view it. **********Because DirecTV controls all 32 frequencies at the 101-degree slot, most DirecTV subscribers can theoretically receive up to 320 channels. DirecTV, however, now generally offers its customers a maximum of about 225 channels. **********DirecTV intends to use the unused channel capacity at 101 degrees to beam down local broadcast signals. By the end of next month, it plans to use its available channels to offer the four major local broadcast affiliates to each of 20 to 25 markets, or about half of the nation's TV households. **********But it is an inefficient process, since every  DirecTV dish antenna in the country will be catching signals of all of those 80 to 100 local affiliates. By scrambling and selectively unscrambling the signals, DirecTV will enable subscribers in any one local market to view only the local broadcasters from their home market. **********And yet, DirecTV subscribers in those 20 to 25 markets will not need to recalibrate their dishes or buy new ones. That is why DirecTV appears excited about the prospects of convincing its existing customers to pay an additional $5.99 a month to receive local programming as part of their satellite service. If even 20 percent of DirecTV's existing eight million customers sign up, that means about $115 million in additional annual revenue for the company. **********EchoStar, however, finds itself in a somewhat more difficult position. Since almost all EchoStar subscribers' dishes point to 119 degrees, where EchoStar controls only 21 frequencies, EchoStar will not be able to deliver many, if any, new local channels to subscribers using their existing dishes. **********And so, EchoStar intends to beam local channels mostly from satellites in the 110 degree slot, which EchoStar obtained rights to only last summer in a deal with the News Corporation and MCI Worldcom. Receiving those signals, however, will require most EchoStar customers to either add a second dish or replace their existing dishes with a new model that can capture signals from two orbital slots at once. **********That is why EchoStar does not talk so much about offering local channels to existing customers but is promoting the new local services to attract new customers. **********''Most of our existing customers have found ways to satisfy themselves without the network channels from our service,'' Mr. Moskowitz said. ''But there is an enormous population that has not yet pulled the plug on cable because of the absence of local on satellite. And that's what's so neat about this; it gives new customers that reason.'' **********Whatever their competitive positions now, though, both DirecTV and EchoStar face the same regulatory uncertainty as the F.C.C. writes the rules to put the new satellite television law into effect. **********The problem for the satellite companies is that they want to offer only the four big-network affiliates -- and maybe a few other popular stations -- in each local market. But the F.C.C. is expected to rule that entering a given market obligates carriers to retransmit every broadcast station in that market. **********Cable television systems are under a similar obligation, which is known as the must-carry rule and which is meant to prevent smaller stations from discrimination. **********The satellite companies say the requirement, which is expected to take force in 2002, will require them to offer local service in fewer markets than they might otherwise because it will quickly consume too much of their satellites' channel capacity. **********''Must-carry is a terrible thing, and I just don't understand the logic of it,'' said Mr. Moskowitz, the EchoStar executive. **********Last week, DirecTV announced that it would buy and launch a new satellite to help meet its must-carry obligations. Unlike the company's traditional satellites, which beam signals to the entire nation, the company's new so-called spot-beam satellite is expected to make more efficient use of the companies' frequencies, allowing them to be reused in different markets for rebroadcasting local television channels. **********With communications satellites generally costing $250 million each, EchoStar and its chairman, Charles W. Ergen, have not yet committed to launching a new spot-beam satellite. **********Even without launching additional satellites, the companies could end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the various other on-the-ground systems that will be required to transmit local channels to dozens of markets, analysts said. **********But in the satellite industry's continuing battle against cable television, local stations may be the final weapon, one too valuable to turn down. **********''We're in a growth business,'' Mr. Hartenstein said. ''We're creating value from a business perspective, and we're creating a great alternative to cable, especially with this last local offering.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/01/business/international-briefs-banca-commerciale-says-2d-bid-may-be-in-offing.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-05-01", "snippet": "Banca Commerciale Says 2d Bid Mayt8", "word_count": 77, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Banca Commerciale Says 2d Bid May Be in Offing", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Banca Commerciale Says 2d Bid May Be in Offing", "body_text": " **********Banca Commerciale Italiana S.p.A. said yesterday that it was discussing a merger with Banca Intesa S.p.A. in a move that could result in a better offer for Banca Commerciale shareholders than a $15.3 billion offer by Unicredito Italiano S.p.A. last month.

A U S West and Global Crossing combination would comprise two separately traded stocks: one for the traditional telephone company assets for Frontier and U S West, the other for the three companies' higher-growth Internet and data assets. U S West shareholders would swap their shares for stock in Global Crossing, with each company's original holders owning 50 percent of the combined company. Investors would have the option to receive shares in one or the other of the separately traded stocks. **********The two companies would also have significant cultural issues to overcome. Most analysts agree that executives from Global Crossing, which was founded by Gary Winnick, a former associate of Michael R. Milken, would really run the show. Solomon D. Trujillo, chairman and chief executive of U S West, would be expected to be named co-chief executive along with Robert Annunziata, the chief executive of Global Crossing. **********''Global is a fast-paced entrepreneurial firm, the other a traditional phone company,'' Richard Klugman, a telecommunications analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., said. '''Any time you introduce two different cultures, there is likely to be a clash.'' **********There are serious regulatory hurdles as well. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 bars the Bells from offering long-distance service in any state within their operating territory until they convince the Federal Communications Commission that they have opened their local phone networks to potential competitors. **********No Bell has yet passed that test, and U S West is seen by most analysts as being farther away from winning long-distance entry than any of its Bell brethren. **********Frontier, meanwhile, has long-distance customers nationwide, including some within U S West's territory, which includes Phoenix, Denver, Seattle and Minneapolis. **********Even if a disproportionately small number of Frontier's customers are in U S West's territory, which also includes rural states like Wyoming and the Dakotas, a merger between U S West and a company that includes Frontier would appear to be a clear violation of the communications act, many communications experts said yesterday. **********''U S West is farther behind any of the Bells in being able to get relief from the F.C.C., and realistically it's at a minimum a year out and probably a lot longer,'' said Scott Cleland, a communications policy analyst in Washington for the Legg Mason Precursor Group. ''There aren't any states in U S West territory where regulators think they're close.'' **********There are moves that could potentially solve the problems, such as selling all of Frontier's long-distance customers in U S West's territory. And regulators may look more kindly on a U S West deal than they did on the abortive merger talks in 1997 between AT&T and SBC Communications Inc. because U S West is the smallest Bell; a deal with Global Crossing could allow U S West to compete more effectively. **********But what appears to be a more workable deal would be for U S West to take a mere 10 percent interest in Global Crossing-Frontier, the limit stated in the law. Earlier this year, SBC agreed to acquire as much as 10 percent of the Williams Companies' communications unit, a long-distance upstart, while the BellSouth Corporation agreed to acquire 10 percent of Qwest Communications International Inc., another new long-distance carrier. **********In such a deal, Frontier could also sell U S West its far-flung local phone properties, which are scattered in 13 states.. **********The one million local customers could be expected to command perhaps between $2 billion and $3 billion, while 10 percent of a combined Global Crossing-Frontier would have a market value of about $3.6 billion. To pay a price of $6.6 billion, U S West could assume some of Global Crossing-Frontier's debt and might put up some cash to help Global Crossing pay for its network construction. **********Such a deal would give Global Crossing an anchor tenant for its long-distance network, since U S West can currently sell long-distance calls as part of its less regulated operations like wireless service. U S West would be assured of low-cost long-distance capacity to meet its needs for years to come. **********Global Crossing's shares gained $1.375, closing at $61.375 in Nasdaq trading after CNBC, the cable network, reported that the company was in talks with U S West. Shares of U S West closed at $62.25, up $2.25, while shares of Frontier lost $2.75 to close at $56.125."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/02/technology/unraveling-the-mysteries-of-sherlock-holmes.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Pollak", "pub_date": "1999-12-02", "snippet": "Sherlock Holmes is the focus of a number of Web sites (M)", "word_count": 744, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Unraveling the Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes", "print_headline": "Unraveling the Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes", "body_text": " **********WHAT would Sherlock have thought of the Internet? **********Its spreadsheets would have been invaluable time-savers (for correlating soil colors and granulations by London neighborhoods, for instance; or trouser threads by manufacturer and tailor). He would have found it quite useful as a library and a correspondence tool, if only for cataloging and exposing the mistakes of others. As a code-breaker, it would have been entirely unnecessary; his own intellect was enough. **********As biography, he would have declared it absolute rubbish. But that is only what Sherlock Holmes himself would have thought. For more than a century, Holmes devotees have been enthusiastically filling the gaps left by the incomplete journals of Dr. John H. Watson, Holmes's friend and chronicler, and they have lost no time putting their speculations online. Sherlockian trivia is legendary, and since ''obsessive'' would be Holmes's middle name if he had one, there is no shortage of Web sites. **********One of the most comprehensive sites is at Yoxley Old Place (www .geocities.com/sherlockian /index.html), compiled by ''Fred Porlock,'' who is also the host of a Baker Street Web ring. From Yoxley, one can find information on everything from The Baker Street Journal, the quarterly publication of the Baker Street Irregulars, perhaps the most famous Holmes society, to collectable and trivia sites. **********One can also link to ''A Matter of Attention'' by Greg Stoddard, an essay contending that Holmes suffered from attention deficit disorder, and to ''Was Sherlock Holmes Autistic?''  by A. Michael Maher. ''The Detective in Montana,'' by Bruce A. Trinque, concludes that both Holmes and Watson served incognito in the Seventh Cavalry and survived the Battle of the Little Bighorn. In ''The Truth About the Speckled Band,'' L. M. Klauber, a herpetologist, writes that there is no such Indian reptile as a ''swamp adder,'' that Watson misunderstood Holmes as usual and that, in fact, the villain in the case had made a hybrid, crossing a cobra and a Gila monster. **********''Fred Porlock'' is the nom de Doyle for Rick Freeman, 40, a Canadian civil servant who lives in Chatham, Ontario. ''When I first began Yoxley, there were only a handful of sites with a lot of Holmes/Doyle content, but that has grown so quickly that it is hard to keep up,'' Mr. Freeman wrote in an e-mail message. ''I say I have over 1,200 links on my site, but I don't know really how many anymore.'' Non-English sites are growing especially fast, he added, noting Holmesiana in French, German and Polish. (Yoxley Old Place, incidentally, is the name of a house in the Holmes short story ''The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez,'' which takes place not far from Chatham, England.) **********Whether touring Holmes Web sites or actual British sites, one should be aware of the Game. The Game is not what's afoot; it is a premise of Holmesian research. Mr. Freeman explained: ''Those who follow the Game 'believe' Holmes was real, Watson wrote the stories and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was merely the literary agent who brought them forward for publication. Doyleans dislike the Game intensely and say it takes away the credit Doyle should get for Holmes as well as his many other works. I don't speak for all Sherlockians, but personally, I think we all know what a genius Doyle was.'' **********Other issues can turn the chat lines red-hot, Mr. Freeman wrote. One is original stories, most of which can be downloaded off the Web, versus pastiches. (For a list of public-domain stories, see watserv1 .uwaterloo.ca/credmond/canon .html as well as Yoxley.) ''People either like and accept well-written pastiches or hate every one,'' Mr. Freeman wrote. Another is choosing the best Holmes actor and best film. On the other hand, should Holmes be enjoyed only in book form? Just how many times was Watson married? (Doyle is not consistent.) Were Holmes and Watson gay? (The majority say no, but there are strong opinions for each side.) **********As for the source of Holmes's enduring popularity, ''Personally, I think it has to do with Doyle's writing style,'' Mr. Freeman wrote. ''Doyle began to hate Holmes, even killing him off in the early 1890's so he could get on with his 'important' work. Since he didn't take Holmes seriously, he was a bit careless with details and continuity (which makes for a lot of what 'the Game' entails). However, he wrote about the times in a way that brings them back to life for many. **********''You don't just read the stories; you're transported back in time and become part of the story.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/business/william-j-de-lancy-82-headed-republic-steel.html": {"writer_name": "Saul Hansell", "pub_date": "1999-04-06", "snippet": "William J De Lancy, who ran Republic Steel Corp during some of its toughest times, dies at age 82 (M)", "word_count": 360, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "William J.

Steel industry employment was at its lowest level since 1933. **********In 1980, Mr. De Lancy became president of the industry's trade group, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and he led a lobbying effort aimed at strengthening the existing government restrictions on imports of steel. **********The industry contended that European and Asian steelmakers were ''dumping'' steel in the United States; that is they were selling the steel at artificially low prices, possibly for less than their cost of production. **********In 1982, Mr. De Lancy turned 65, and he retired both from Republic and the steel institute. **********The company and industry continued to suffer. Steel production hit a postwar low of 75 million tons in 1982, and production did not return to 1980 levels until 1994.

Analysts expect more than 3.5 million digital cameras to be sold this year in the United States, typically to PC owners who want to send photographs via an e-mail message, create family photo albums on personal Web pages or simply explore digital imaging as a hobby. **********The popularity of digital photography is such that America Online, the world's largest Internet service provider, has added a ''You've Got Pictures'' greeting to augment the familiar ''You've Got Mail.'' **********Early digital cameras were expensive and had such low picture quality, or resolution, that they fared poorly in a comparison with a $10 disposable camera. But that changed this year. Megapixel digital cameras, which capture images made up of more than a million picture elements, or pixels, are now available for less than $500. A new generation of even better cameras, with two-megapixel resolutions, arrived this summer for about $1,000. The smallest of the two-megapixel cameras, the Fuji MX2700, is made of aluminum and can be carried discreetly in the pocket of a jacket. It is available for less than $600. **********Coupled with relatively inexpensive, photo-grade inkjet printers and photo scanners, these cameras along with computers enable consumers to take, edit and print high-quality color photographs at home. Using glossy paper, even a casual shutterbug can produce photos that are nearly indistinguishable from the prints from a decent 35-millimeter camera and a professional film developer, except that no film is involved. The high-grade paper is expensive, though, about $1 per 8-by-10 sheet. **********Meanwhile, digital video cameras that can transfer movies directly to a home computer for editing are becoming common. The new Apple iMac DV computers come with a program called iMovie that lets amateur videographers create home videos or short features. Apple expects desktop video to become as popular as desktop publishing someday. **********One tip: If digital imaging seems appealing, make sure the computer has lots of processing power and fast connection ports. **********1. NIKON COOLPIX 950 **********Resolution, measured in megapixels, is one way to evaluate a digital camera. On that score, the Coolpix 950 offers an impressive 2.1 megapixels. The camera has an excellent autofocus and gives the serious amateur photographer control over aperture, shutter speed and metering. The lens is top-notch and offers 3X optical zoom. But the memory provided by the eight-megabyte Compact Flash card is stingy. The price of the camera is listed at $999, but is frequently discounted. Batteries and a charger are extra, so expect to spend about $1,000 even if the camera is discounted. **********2. CANON CANOSCAN FB 1200S **********Most people have albums and shoe boxes full of old photographs. The Canoscan FB 1200S is a convenient way to capture those prints as digital images so they can be stored and edited on a computer. This flatbed model has an optical resolution of 1,200 dots by 1,200 dots per inch, with a color depth of 36 bits (yielding more accurate colors than many other scanners). It can be found online for less than $500. **********3. VISIONEER ONETOUCH 7600 **********The OneTouch scanner makes it simple to copy documents and attach them to e-mail messages, make faxes and, of course, scan color photographs. Although the speed and quality (maximum 600 x 1,200 dots per inch) will not be quite as good as that of the Canon Canoscan, the price is better, less than $150. It is easy to use, and made easier by a U.S.B. connection. **********4. SONY DCR-TRV510 DIGITAL HANDYCAM **********Sony's Digital 8 Handycam has many of the features of the new digital camcorders, including superior picture quality, near CD-quality sound and the ability to snap digital still photographs, add special effects and easily transfer images to a personal computer. Unlike other digital camcorders that require special cassettes, the Sony Digital 8 uses the less expensive and widely available 8-millimeter and Hi8 video cassettes. The DCR-TRV510 is larger and heavier than most digital-video camcorders. The list price is $1,399. **********5. HEWLETT PACKARD DESKJET 970CSE **********The Deskjet 970Cse printer ($399) does a superb job with digital photos and text documents. It prints text pages at up to 12 pages per minute, and it can print on both sides of a page.

It would also be Nissan's seventh annual loss in the last eight years. **********But rather than portraying the results as a sign of weakness, Nissan officials presented them as a stark reflection of their excruciating effort to overhaul the sagging, debt-ridden operations of the company, the No. 3 Japanese automaker, which sold a 37 percent stake in itself to Renault S.A. of France last March. **********Renault took management control of Nissan as part of the deal and has been working aggressively to clean up longstanding financial problems that have lurked on Nissan's balance sheet. The Renault-Nissan partnership has been closely watched not only by the global automotive industry but as an indication of corporate Japan's willingness to change. **********Nissan said losses for the six months that ended Sept. 30 totaled 325.6 billion yen, or $3.05 billion at current exchange rates. The company said the loss would widen to 590 billion yen, or $5.57 billion by the end of its fiscal year in March. **********Most of the six-month loss reflects accounting adjustments for setting aside 274.2 billion yen, or about $2.6 billion, to plug a hole in Nissan's pension fund. The company also set aside 48.1 billion yen, or about $450 million, against future warranty obligations and 46.6 billion yen or about $440 million for the first installment of its ''revival'' plan, the all-encompassing overhaul it announced last month. **********''We are clearing the past to pave the way for the future,'' said Thierry Moulonguet, Nissan's deputy chief financial officer who joined Nissan after his former employer, Renault, purchased its stake in Nissan. **********A bit of the future was embedded in the company's announcements today. It used what are known as consolidated accounting rules, which cover the entire Nissan group of businesses, to calculate the company's profits and losses and assess its balance sheet, six months ahead of the deadline for adopting such rules. **********And the news release was composed in English, the language the company has adopted since Renault's investment, and translated into Japanese. **********Those breakthroughs were lost, however, in Nissan's sea of red ink. ''I thought they had misplaced the decimal point when I first saw the headlines,'' said Koji Endo, an automotive analyst at Schroders Japan Ltd. **********Mr. Endo said he was taken aback by the size of accounting adjustments that the company was making beyond the expenses recorded for its restructuring plan, under which it will close five plants, lower costs by 1 trillion yen and eliminate 21,000 jobs. Additionally, Nissan will record a 141 billion yen accounting charge for restructuring in the second half of the fiscal year, thus meeting its goal of paying for the plan in one year. **********''The cost of the extraordinary charges in addition to the restructuring charges is big,'' Mr. Endo said. ''And this might not be the end of those kinds of charges.'' **********It was precisely that fear that scuttled a deal between Nissan and DaimlerChrysler earlier this year, leading Nissan into an alliance with Renault instead. **********The results announced today also showed sales slid 9.9 percent, to 3 trillion yen, or $28.7 billion, in the first six months of Nissan's fiscal year, as the company lagged behind its competitors in the Japanese and European markets. **********Nonetheless, declines in the cost of servicing Nissan's debts and gains on stocks the company holds helped push operating profits in the first six months of the year to 58.5 billion yen, or $551.8 million, a 125 percent increase over last year. **********The company said that it expected operating profits to climb to 90 billion yen by the end of the fiscal year, somewhat short of the goal announced in May and an 18 percent decline from the previous year, when operating profits were 109.7 billion yen. **********But considering that the yen's value has risen steeply in the last six months, the results were surprisingly strong. In the first half of the current fiscal year, the average exchange rate was 117 yen to the dollar, compared with 137 yen to the dollar in the period a year earlier. A stronger currency tends to hurt the earnings of a company by reducing the profits from businesses overseas. **********Nissan said it had also made progress in whittling down its pile of debt, largely because of Renault's investment. Its total consolidated debt was 2.53 trillion yen on Sept. 30. **********The debt figures in particular demonstrated the effect that consolidated accounting will have on corporate Japan, which is required to adopt the practice by the end of this fiscal year. At the end of the last fiscal year, Nissan's net debts stood at 2.91 trillion yen. The figure was restated today: on a consolidated basis, it had climbed to 3.53 billion yen. **********Nissan has pledged to reduce its debt to 700 billion yen by the end of fiscal 2002. **********The company released its financial data after Japan's stock market had closed. Nissan shares fell 33 yen, or 5.6 percent, in Tokyo trading to 550 yen, but are still up about 57 percent so far this year. **********Nissan's American depository receipts, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 67.5 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $10.125."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/17/technology/state-of-the-art-skinny-laptop-hefty-keyboard.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Lewis", "pub_date": "1999-06-17", "snippet": "Peter H Lewis assesses IBM's new Thinkpad 240 ultralight portable computer; drawing (M)", "word_count": 1250, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Skinny Laptop, Hefty Keyboard", "print_headline": "STATE OF THE ART; Skinny Laptop, Hefty Keyboard", "body_text": " **********PORTABLE computing, like life, has always been about compromise. The smaller the computer gets, the more compromises have to be made. It is like dieting: to lose pounds and girth, one often has to bid adieu to some pleasures like extra-cheese pizza or double chocolate mocha fudge cake. Life is hard. **********And so it is with I.B.M.'s new Thinkpad 240, the latest in a relatively new class of portable computers called ultralights. It is a Windows 98-based portable that weighs 3 pounds, measures about 10 inches wide and 8 inches deep, and is about an inch thick. The ultralight category was created by the Sony Corporation last summer with its breakthrough Vaio Superslim 505 model. Similar models are made by Toshiba, Sharp and Compaq. **********But just as not everyone dreams of being as skinny as Ally McBeal, not everyone will be attracted to these ultralight computers. It is a niche product for people with small niches. For people who must travel a lot, need a full-powered computer and dread carrying around the typical 7- to 9-pound notebook computer all day, the ultralights have definite appeal, despite their compromises. **********There are some compromises that are just too much for some people to bear, however. In my case, I absolutely draw the line at giving up cheeseburgers and comfortable computer keyboards. **********The Thinkpad 240, which will have a list price of $1,999 when it goes on sale early next month, is the first ultralight model with a keyboard that does not feel lifeless and cramped. **********It has a number of other nice features, of course, like a zippy 300-megahertz Celeron processor, 64 megabytes of RAM, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive and a convenient selection of connection ports, but the keyboard won me over. That, and the fact that it easily slips into a briefcase or backpack that I can carry all day and not suffer afterward. **********As with all the ultralights -- and even with the next-larger class of machines called ultraportables, which generally weigh 4 to 6 pounds, measure about 12 inches by 9 inches and have 12-inch or larger screens -- the Thinkpad 240 has compromises galore. The big question is whether the compromises are worth the reduction in size and weight, and that is a personal decision to be made after consulting with one's trapeziums and deltoids. **********For starters, the Thinkpad 240 achieves its lightness by banishing the diskette and CD-ROM drives to the desktop. The computer comes with an external diskette drive, but the CD drive is a $289 option. **********As a result, the 240 is a machine best suited to travelers who get along on trips without needing external drives. After all, when you tally the weight of an AC power adapter, external drives and cables, the Thinkpad's travel weight comes to more than six pounds -- not to mention the hassle of dealing with all the wires and clutter. **********Those who need the CD drive frequently, even if only to listen to audio CD's on an airplane, would probably be better off with a larger (and only modestly heavier) portable that has built-in CD and diskette drives. **********Ultralights also suffer from the trade-off between weight and battery capacity. The average time between recharging for the Thinkpad unit I tested was a very modest one and a half hours, although you can double that by adding more weight to the computer and lightening your wallet by $189 (for an optional double-capacity battery). **********The Thinkpad's bright, liquid crystal display screen is 10.4 inches measured diagonally, which is about as small as today's World Wide Web and Windows users will tolerate. It has a maximum resolution of 800 pixels by 600 pixels (known as SVGA), which I found to be adequate for my most common tasks of word processing, handling E-mail and browsing the Web. The Sony and other ultralight competitors achieve higher resolutions (1,024 by 768, or XGA) on their small screens, which comes in handy for working with detailed graphic images, but can reduce the size of text. **********Ultralights also tend to be lightweights when it comes to processing power, at least in comparison to larger portables. The Intel Corporation just announced the availability of mobile Celeron and Pentium II chips operating at 400 megahertz, and we could see mobile Pentium III systems before long -- but those chips will show up first in larger, heavier and more expensive portables. The 300-MHz Celeron in the Thinkpad 240 is a nice step up from the mobile Pentium MMX chips used in the first generation of ultralights. The MMX chips are at the end of their life cycle. **********And some of the ultralights cheat by moving their serial, parallel and video ports onto a separate gizmo called a port replicator. In general, the replicators can stay on the desktop when the computer goes in the travel bag. **********Still, the Thinkpad 240 eliminates the need for a replicator attachment altogether by offering a nice array of built-in ports. Included are a serial port for attaching a Palm Pilot or other connected device, a parallel printer port, a video port (for attaching an external monitor), a diskette drive port, one Universal Serial Bus port, a mouse port (for those who prefer a mouse over the Thinkpad's built-in pointer on the keyboard), an infrared communications port for wireless printing to infrared-equipped printers or other wireless data transfers, and holes for stereo headphones, a microphone and external speakers. **********There is also an internal 56K modem, and a single PC card slot that can be used for add-ons like the CD drive or an Ethernet network adapter ($349 from the International Business Machines Corporation, but much cheaper from other vendors). **********The built-in ports are nice, but the keyboard is really the thing that sets the Thinkpad apart from other ultralights, said J. Gerry Purdy, president of Mobile Insights, a consulting company in Mountain View, Calif. ''The keyboard is the most difficult thing to get right in this category,'' Mr. Purdy noted. **********With a desktop computer, if you don't like the keyboard, you can replace it at a relatively modest cost. With a notebook computer, however, you're stuck. So, if typing is going to be the prime activity on the computer, it's important to spend time testing the keyboard before you buy. **********The typical portable computer keyboard has a pitch of 19 millimeters, the distance between the centers of adjacent keys. One of the compromises Sony made in designing the original Vaio 505 ultralight was to shrink the keyboard pitch to 17 millimeters and reduce the distance the keys travel when depressed, to the point that typing on the Vaio 505 felt scrunched and brittle. And the Sony is actually better than some other ultralights. (Sony has just introduced a couple of Vaio models that offer bigger keyboards and bigger screens, and some intriguing new features, but at the cost of higher weight and price.) **********On the Thinkpad 240, I.B.M. has managed to retain a key pitch of 18 millimeters, a millimeter more than the Sony, but still noticeable even to those of us who type with two fingers. The key travel is also deeper, the equivalent of walking on plush carpet after standing on bare floors. **********Alas, there are compromises on the keyboard, too. The one that drives me crazy is the half-size Tab key, located where the Caps Lock key (which was left off) normally resides on other keyboards. But hey, I'm willing to compromise, too. I can put up with a temporary cramp in my left pinky if it means avoiding the spine-twisting cramps and aches that come from carrying a heavier portable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/10/business/worldbusiness/IHT-stagnation-in-germany-spoils-hopes-for-a-recovery.html": {"writer_name": "John Schmid", "pub_date": "1999-09-10", "snippet": "The German economy ground to a halt in the second quarter, the government reported Thursday, tempering a recent surge of optimism about growth prospects for Europe's biggest economy.. \"This is a reminder of how tentative and how weak the recovery ...", "word_count": 3573, "score": null, "source": "International Herald Tribune", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": null, "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stagnation In Germany Spoils Hopes For a Recovery", "print_headline": "Stagnation In Germany Spoils Hopes For a Recovery", "body_text": " **********The German economy ground to a halt in the second quarter, the government reported Thursday, tempering a recent surge of optimism about growth prospects for Europe's biggest economy. **********\"This is a reminder of how tentative and how weak the recovery still is,\" said Adolf Rosenstock, a Frankfurt-based economist at Nomura International PLC. **********The Federal Statistics Office said the economy stopped growing in the April-June period, compared with the first three months of the year.

But the Bundesbank, which compiles its own economic figures, put the year-on-year GDP growth rate for the second quarter at a more modest 0.6 percent. **********Germany's static growth serves as \"a reminder that the recovery of the euroland economy is still at a very early stage,\" said Eckhard Schulte, an economist in Frankfurt at Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. **********The economy's stall came just as optimism was growing about prospects for the German economy, which accounts for over a third of the output of the 11-nation European currency zone. **********Hopes for a German-led rebound in Europe are pinned on an economic pick-up in the second half of the year. Since early summer, leading indicators such as factory orders and industrial confidence have signaled the end of a year of gloom amid sluggish and even negative economic activity. **********Earlier this week, the Finance Ministry further raised hopes with a report that industrial output rose 1 percent in July. **********The government expects annualized growth to accelerate to 2.5 percent next year, from 1.6 percent this year. In recent appearances, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has routinely credited his leadership with producing the brighter economic outlook. **********The GDP report coincided with a meeting of the European Central Bank's governing council, which voted to leave benchmark lending rates unchanged. (Page 17) **********Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Co. in Frankfurt, said the economic report card Thursday underscored how young and frail Germany's upswing remained. **********The economic cycle in Germany never blossoms into a vibrant domestic recovery complete with job creation and consumer spending, Mr. Mayer said. \"You get the upward knock from exports, fine,\" he said. \"Then companies make more profit from higher exports, fine. Then they look around and say, 'let's invest it abroad.' And that's the end of the chain.\" **********Since the deep recession of 1992-1993, no German recovery has lasted more than a year or two before it fizzled into stagnation. **********The April-June stall follows four quarters in which the quarter-on-quarter expansion rate has averaged a mere 0.1 percent. **********The term \"corrugated tin roof\" economy has crept into German parlance to describe the sort of on-again, off-again activity that shows small movements up and down on the economic growth charts, but which remains about flat on average. **********Hoping to change that, Chancellor Schroeder is fighting opponents within his own party to overhaul the nation's \"Social-Market\" economy, with a plan meant to scale back taxes and welfare benefits. He wants to cut 30 billion Deutsche marks ($16 billion) in spending and welfare programs from next year's budget. **********But after years of false starts for economic reforms in Germany, few economists cared to predict whether he would have greater luck than did his predecessor, Helmut Kohl."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/07/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-106496.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-04-07", "snippet": "John Diefenbach is named to new post of partner at New York office of Wolff Olins; Catherine Lukas is named advertising director at Forbes ASAP; succeeds Ted Gramkow, who resigned; Eden Collinsworth is named to new post of cross-media business dev...", "word_count": 327, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** John Diefenbach was named to the new post of partner at the New York office of Wolff Olins, London.

Coup-minded military officers, some Cuban exiles insisted. Or right-wing infiltrators from Miami. A nascent rebel underground, perhaps, supplied from abroad. **********But none of those theories help much to explain the role of Jazid Ivan Fernandez, a 28-year-old data processor from Guatemala City who is one of five Central Americans now in a Cuban prison on charges stemming from the attacks. **********Mr. Fernandez, people who knew him in Guatemala said, was a punctual if undistinguished bureaucrat, a pleasant young man who compiled bus statistics for a Government transport office. He devoted most of his free time not to politics, they said, but to whatever happened to be on television. **********The story of the accused saboteurs, assembled from interviews with the five in the Havana prison and accounts of their relatives, associates and others, suggests that even as radical Cuban exiles mounted their most intense campaign of violence in years against the Communist Government, their operations were less cloak-and-dagger than cut-rate and lucky. **********''These do not appear to be militants or activists or doctrinaire fanatics,'' said the Guatemalan Foreign Minister, Eduardo Stein. ''They seem to be something like what, in the drug-trafficking world, one would call mules.'' **********The Recruits **********Gang Couldn't Shoot, Straight or Otherwise **********The accused bombers were anything but professional. **********Two had had brief experiences as soldiers; a couple, at least, thought vaguely ill of the Cuban Government. But most important to the cause was that all of them were short of cash, struggling with debts on everything from cellular telephones to children's schools. **********The most successful of the group, a 28-year-old Salvadoran who needed money for car payments, got $2,500. Another, an executive at El Salvador's biggest car dealership who was struggling to support two children he had fathered out of wedlock, agreed to make the trip to Cuba for $1,000. **********Exactly who paid the bills is unclear. **********Luis Posada Carriles, an aging Cuban veteran of Central Intelligence Agency crusades against Fidel Castro, acknowledged organizing the attacks, suggesting that he did so with money provided by Cuban exiles in the United States. But he declined to identify them. **********United States officials said Federal prosecutors in Puerto Rico were also looking at the bombings as part of a grand jury investigation into what they say was a plot to kill Mr. Castro during a regional summit meeting in the Caribbean last May. **********The prosecutors have filed conspiracy charges against seven men, including three with ties to the most prominent exile political group in the United States, the Cuban American National Foundation. [A Federal judge recently decided to transfer these proceedings to Miami from Puerto Rico.] **********Cuban officials have repeatedly accused the foundation and its late chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, of orchestrating the attacks, a charge it vigorously denies. **********But recently Cuba made the charges more specific: In late October, the Government said that Mr. Posada's chief financier was Arnaldo Monzon, a wealthy businessman from Fort Lee, N.J., who is a director of the foundation. **********In an interview at his office above a clothing store in Union City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, Mr. Monzon dismissed the accusations as ridiculous. **********''That was the first I had heard of it,'' he said of the plot described by the Cuban Interior Ministry. ''I don't think that is a way to overthrow a government.'' **********Cuban security officials, speaking in interviews in which they discussed many details of their investigations for the first time, said they had already found traces of Mr. Monzon and other well-known Cuban-Americans as the pattern of anti-Castro attacks began to shift in 1994 and 1995. **********Until then, said Col. Adalberto Rabeiro, a senior official of the Interior Ministry's counterintelligence directorate, such actions had typically been pirate raids on beachfront hotels, with attackers firing automatic weapons from speedboats. Then the attackers grew bolder, aiming at the tourist industry, a key source of foreign exchange. **********Cuban officials allowed a reporter to interview the five suspects awaiting trial in Havana after Mr. Posada described his role in the attacks in articles published last summer in The New York Times. **********The interviews were conducted at the Villa Marista prison, in a room that appeared to be monitored by security agents. **********All five prisoners admitted the crimes of which they have been accused, and denied having been mistreated or coerced to do so. But several were held incommunicado for months, and though much of their accounts was corroborated by friends, relatives, employers and associates, it is impossible to tell whether parts of their stories might have been rehearsed. **********Cuban officials said the five were only the last in a recent series of attackers trained abroad. Two of the first, they said, were young Cuban emigres trained in Miami and dropped back on the island in 1995, with 51 pounds of plastic explosives. They and two other exiles, who entered Cuba with a small quantity of explosives in 1996, were arrested before they could blow up anything, the officials said. **********On April 12, 1997, however, a bomb exploded at the discotheque in Havana's newest five-star hotel, the Melia Cohiba, and another was found unexploded weeks later. Cuban officials said this marked the start of Mr. Posada's more direct management of the sabotage, a wave of 13 bombings that rattled Cuba for months. **********The Lures **********Jobless Salvadorans And Visions of Cash **********As his first mercenary, Cuban officials said, Mr. Posada hired Francisco Chavez Abarca, 29, a Salvadoran. Mr. Posada had met Mr. Chavez's father, a well-connected arms dealer, after arriving in El Salvador in 1985 to work for the United States National Security Council when it was supplying Nicaraguan contra rebels. **********That year Mr. Posada escaped from a Venezuelan prison where he had been held on charges of plotting the bombing of a Cuban airliner in 1976 in which 73 people were killed. **********How the younger Mr. Chavez made his living is unclear. But to the young men who hung out with him, the Fat Man, as they called him, had the trappings of small-time underworld success: a used BMW, spending money, a semiautomatic handgun. **********''I told him at one point, 'Look Francisco, I'm sure you're mixed up in the drug business,' '' said one of those young men, Raul Cruz Leon. '' 'When you've got a job, remember me.' '' **********Such activities were out of character for Mr. Cruz Leon, but his finances were getting desperate. His main job, driving Latin pop singers as the ''security chief'' for a Salvadoran promoter, rarely paid more than $500 a month. Between car payments, credit-card bills and his cellular phone, he owed nearly $6,000, and relatives said his mother finally mortgaged her small jewelry store to help him pay off the debt. **********''I was drowning in the interest payments,'' he recalled. **********Mr. Cruz Leon was clearly something less than the hardened military veteran that Cuban officials suggested and that many news accounts have described. **********The son and grandson of army veterans, he had dreamed of entering the Salvadoran military academy, a well-traveled social escalator for boys from the working class. **********But he had also studied at the Jesuits' Central American University, and said he was troubled by the military's killing of six priests there in 1989. Within a year of entering the academy, he rose almost to the top rank of his class -- then dropped out. **********When Mr. Chavez approached him about ''a little job'' in late 1996, he said, he agreed immediately. When Mr. Chavez told him later that he wanted to set off small bombs at Havana hotels, Mr. Cruz Leon said he suspected some dispute with a hotel owner. **********''I thought of that movie 'The Specialist,' with Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone,'' Mr. Cruz Leon recalled, looking pale and tired in a blue-polyester prison uniform. ''That guy planted a bomb, and he ended up a hero.'' **********Mr. Cruz Leon became the most able of the accused mercenaries, learning to assemble his bombs -- a small wad of plastic explosive, a detonator, a thin Casio alarm clock and a nine-volt battery -- in little more than a minute. **********Mr. Chavez, who is said by associates to still be living in San Salvador, appears from travel and telephone records obtained from the Cuban authorities to have been in Cuba when the Melia Cohiba hotel was bombed on April 12. Mr. Cruz Leon followed him in July, he said, getting past a strip search at the Havana airport to bomb two hotels for $2,500. He was arrested during a second trip in September, after another of his bombs killed a 32-year-old Italian businessman. **********Mr. Posada said he was unperturbed. ''He's not Cuban,'' he said in the interview, referring to Mr. Cruz Leon. ''He did this for money.'' **********But as attention focused on El Salvador after those attacks, Mr. Posada turned to Guatemala, where he recruited a pair of young men to plant two more bombs in August 1997. Guatemalan newspapers reported that one of those men, Marlon Gonzalez, 31, and another man were found in a dump truck last May, badly beaten and shot to death. **********Mr. Chavez apparently found his most unlikely recruits in late 1997, at the Guatemala City guest house of Maria Elena Gonzalez, a 54-year-old former school teacher who read tarot cards on the side. **********In a prison interview in Havana, Mrs. Gonzalez said Mr. Chavez had come to her because she knew a woman he wanted to kill, apparently on contract, to retaliate for the murder of a wealthy Salvadoran businessman. He spent days having his cards read and hanging about at her pink-plaster home where, coincidentally, the Cuban patriot Jose Marti had once lived. **********Cuban security officials suggested that some of their main evidence against Mr. Monzon came from his chatter during card readings by Mrs. Gonzalez. In two interviews, she said Mr. Chavez told her he was owed money by three men, two of whom he named as Arnaldo Monzon and Ramon Medina, an alias used in El Salvador by Mr. Posada. **********Mrs. Gonzalez said she also took a telephone message for Mr. Chavez from a caller who identified himself as ''the man from New Jersey.'' **********Eventually Mr. Chavez recruited another of Mrs. Gonzalez's sometime guests, Nader Musalam, a 28-year-old Guatemalan who had previously owned a small store where, he said, he had done a modest business in stolen clothing. He had gone to Cuba on vacation years earlier, looking for girls; although the bombs seemed like ''not such a good idea,'' he was eager to get back. **********''I liked it a lot,'' he said. ''It wasn't like they made it sound in Guatemala.'' **********According to a deal he said he made with Mr. Chavez early last year, Mr. Musalam was to receive $1,300 for each bomb he planted, enough for a down payment on a Hyundai sedan that he could drive as a taxi. For $800, Mrs. Gonzalez said, she agreed to carry two toothpaste tubes filled with plastic explosives and two small alarm clocks. But she also had to pay for her own plane ticket, which she bought on credit. **********''It was the end of the month,'' she said. ''I had to pay the water bill, the electricity bill. I thought this would be some quick money.'' **********Mr. Musalam was arrested at the airport, and Mrs. Gonzalez was picked up as she waited for him at his hotel. Mrs. Gonzalez's husband, Jazid Ivan Fernandez, 28, the data processor, said he had opposed the trip but helped pack the explosives. He was detained three weeks later when he traveled to Cuba to try to locate her. **********The Organizer **********Moving In, in Vain, To Keep Plot Going **********When his sabotage network started to fray with the arrests in 1997, Mr. Posada -- who acknowledged before the Cuban Government's announcement that three of his bombers had been captured -- became more directly involved. **********A retired Salvadoran Air Force captain, Alberto Barraza, whom Mr. Posada had known from the contra operation, said in an interview that he introduced Mr. Posada to Otto Rene Rodriguez, supposedly to buy inexpensive ammunition. **********Mr. Barraza denied any knowledge of the Cuba plot. He said Mr. Rodriguez bought lots of ammunition because of his job as the security supervisor for the Salvadoran company that owns the car dealership, a position in which he supervised more than 200 guards and other employees. Mr. Rodriguez had also spent time at the Gerardo Barrios military academy, leaving early to attend architecture school. And he too was in financial trouble. **********The son of a prosperous businessman and the nephew of one of El Salvador's most respected centrist politicians, Otto Rodriguez earned just under $1,000 a month at the car dealership. But in addition to supporting his two children by his estranged wife, he said, he was trying to help two children by other women with whom he had become involved. **********''With $1,000 I could solve my problem,'' he said. ''And I thought I could keep some of the expense money they gave me.'' **********He arrived at the Havana airport in August 1997, carrying the explosives in a back pocket, the transistor batteries in a front pocket. He said he planted a bomb at the Melia Cohiba, had a brief affair with a young Cuban woman and returned home to pay off his elder children's school tuition. **********After agreeing to try again, he was arrested at the Havana airport last June. This time he was supposed to meet a Cuban conspirator, identified to him only as Juan. Instead he has spent the last months wondering why he ever agreed to join Mr. Posada's campaign. **********''This really doesn't have anything to do with us,'' he said of the plot to bring down the Cuban Government. ''Sometimes, it takes a long time to figure out how lost you are.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/03/business/hughes-electronics-collects-us-payment.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-03", "snippet": "General Motors Corp's Hughes Electronics unit collects $154 million in damages from United States Government, ending 26-year legal battle over patented technology used to help orient communications satellites; Hughes held other companies used its ...", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hughes Electronics Collects U.S. Payment", "print_headline": "Hughes Electronics Collects U.S. Payment", "body_text": " **********The Hughes Electronics unit of the General Motors Corporation has collected $154 million in damages from the United States Government, ending a 26-year legal battle over patented technology used to help orient communications satellites. **********The payment resolves assertions by Hughes, the world's largest satellite maker, that from 1963 to 1982 the Government used the company's proprietary technology without permission. **********Hughes, based in El Segundo, Calif., said today that it had received payment from the United States Treasury Department on Tuesday, less than a month after the United States Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the Government. **********The dispute centered on a 1959 invention by a Hughes scientist, Donald Williams, to insure that the antennas on communications satellites would point toward the earth, allowing ground stations to track them throughout their orbit. **********In its lawsuit, Hughes contended that other companies used its invention in more than 80 satellites made for the United States military and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration over two decades. **********In 1983, a Federal appeals court agreed, ruling that the Hughes patent was valid."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/17/business/top-level-executive-shift-made-as-twa-continues-to-struggle.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "1999-03-17", "snippet": "Trans World Airlines says William F Compton, president, will take over as chief executive in May, succeeding Gerald L Gitner, who will remain as chairman; move comes at a time when TWA has been losing money while industry has recorded record profi...", "word_count": 297, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Top-Level Executive Shift Made As T.W.A.

For example, regulators may question the accuracy of a company's financial statements if executives had dismissed needed accounting changes after they realized that those adjustments would cause the company to miss the earnings estimates of Wall Street analysts or to miss a financial target that would award lucrative executive bonuses. **********A lawyer from the Securities and Exchange Commission described the regulators' proposed guidelines, which are expected to be issued in the coming weeks, during a panel discussion at the American Bar Association's annual meeting in Atlanta on Monday afternoon. **********Michael R. Young, a lawyer at the New York firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who also sat on Monday's panel, said the new rules would prevent companies from automatically dismissing adjustments to the financial books that were less than 5 percent of earnings. Now, financial executives and outside auditors often use the 5 percent limit when they are considering whether adjustments should be made to the books. If the adjustment is less than 5 percent of earnings, the auditors often agree that it is not significant, or not ''material.'' **********''The S.E.C. is telling the financial community that adherence to traditional materiality thresholds is not going to be enough,'' Mr. Young said.

Investors often pummel a stock price when a company misses its expected earnings by just a few pennies a share.

Just ask futures traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. **********They began betting last fall that the final days of 1999 would bring worldwide panic about potential Year 2000 computer glitches. They speculated that nervous people and businesses would hoard cash, putting a severe strain on banks and driving up borrowing costs for anyone needing credit. **********By the end of the year, the traders had driven December 1999 futures prices to levels that, in effect, projected a devastating jump of about 13 percentage points in dollar interest rates at the end of this year. They did it with trades known as ''butterflies'' that usually look a bit like the insects when their components are charted. By December, the charts for the ''millennium butterfly'' -- the purchase of a September 1999 contract, the sale of two December 1999's and the purchase of a March 2000 -- had wings at the sharpest angles in memory. **********The trading was greeted as an overdue guest by Year 2000 alarmists, who had been longing for evidence to support their predictions that Y2K, as the computer problem has been nicknamed, would make huge waves in the markets. It also grabbed much attention in banking circles. ''We are all looking for road signs as to what will happen,'' a Year 2000 project manager at a major New York bank confided at the time. **********The road sign has since been flattened, though, along with those who were certain it pointed somewhere. By last month, December futures prices had tumbled back into their traditional relationship with the September and March contracts. Participants were left wondering what to make of it all. **********''I think it was a bubble rather than anything substantive,'' said Galen Burghardt, a senior vice president at Carr Futures, a brokerage firm based in Chicago. ''If you really got a sense people couldn't bank at year-end, all hell would break loose.'' **********The aborted flight of the futures butterfly has reinforced the prevailing sentiment that it does not pay -- so far, at least -- to bet that Year 2000 problems will produce any sharp moves in stocks, bonds and other mainstream markets. Some managers say it is a mistake to think that bets on Y2K will ever be rewarded. **********''By definition, the stock market only moves on surprises, since today's prices reflect expectations,'' said Kenneth L. Fisher of Fisher Investments in Woodside, Calif., which manages $2.9 billion for institutions and private clients. ''Y2K is no surprise.'' **********GIVE Mr. Fisher a gold medal in the Understatement Olympics. It would be a feat these days to find an investor who has never heard that the decades-old practice of using two digits in computer dates, like ''99'' for 1999, could trip up computers, programs and electronically controlled machines reading year 2000 dates. The ''00'' might be read as 1900 or not recognized as a valid date; some malfunctions lead to shutdowns and others to faulty calculations. **********Still, many investment advisers and managers are not quite as confident as Mr. Fisher that the market has anticipated Y2K: Everyone may know that Y2K is coming, but there is great uncertainty over how extensive disruptions will be, where they will strike and when their impacts will be felt by individual companies and nations. Prices may plunge where disruptions hit or skyrocket where they do not. **********Well before Jan. 1, some analysts say, the prospect of volatility could force trillions of dollars in investment portfolios to be rearranged as managers try to reduce their risks. If that happens, those who move before the crowd will, as always, pay less to achieve their goals. So even skeptics must be poised to jump. **********''It's a puzzle to me,'' said Jonathan Muehl, a pension fund adviser at Buck Consultants in Pittsburgh, who sees no sign yet of Y2K hedging activity in options prices. (An option is the right to buy or sell a commodity, a stock or an entire basket of stocks for a specific price at a specific date in the future; a future is an obligation to complete such a deal.) **********Mr. Muehl says options that would protect investors from sharp stock-portfolio declines in the trading days before 2000 currently sell at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and in over-the-counter trading at prices that imply almost no increase in the risk that stocks will gyrate later this year. **********''It could be that the market isn't concerned, but part of me wonders whether the market has really focused on the issue yet,'' Mr. Muehl said. **********The prevailing wisdom -- reflected in a report this month from a United States Senate special committee tracking Y2K as well as recent analyses by leading Wall Street brokerage firms -- is that overseas markets are especially vulnerable to Y2K problems. Most countries started dealing with Y2K later than the United States, and many developing nations are hard pressed for resources. **********Just last month, the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, an international organization of more than 230 banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, dropped plans to publicly rate the readiness of 35 key countries after regulators fretted privately that such a move could ignite a disruptive flight of capital. But lagging nations -- and the businesses within them -- may have received only a temporary reprieve. **********''It is probably too early for Y2K factors to dominate an investment decision,'' said George A. Murnaghan, executive vice president and marketing manager at Rowe Price-Fleming International in Baltimore, which manages $30 billion for mutual funds and institutions with international portfolios. ''As the year goes on, it will become more important.'' **********To be sure, there has already been plenty of action involving the stocks of companies like Viasoft Inc. and Data Dimensions that have been beneficiaries of the billions being spent to repair Y2K defects. **********Starting in 1996, such stocks soared -- and often later crashed -- as investors placed bets on how big the repair effort would be and which companies would profit most. Now all those players are treating Y2K as history as they race to convince Wall Street that they have viable strategies to prosper when the Year 2000 work dries up. **********BUT such investments were never bets on either the actual impact of Y2K or on how individuals and business will act in the final run up to it. Other than the butterfly, which involved contracts so large that only large institutional investors and professional traders at the Merc waded in, the only hot Year 2000 investment action to date has been in market niches like gold and silver coins, where small investors are chasing limited supplies. **********The coins are being snapped up not only as investments but also because many alarmists see them as valuable assets for barter if the Year 2000 banking collapse they foresee comes to pass. Demand was so strong for 1998 Silver Eagles that the United States Mint ran out in early December; the 1999 version is already in short supply. **********''The shortages are just driving demand higher,'' said David Harper, editor of Numismatic News, a weekly newspaper for coin collectors, based in Iola, Wis. He said many dealer quotes for the coins have been  running at more than triple the once-common $1.25 premium to spot silver prices. **********He recently wrote an editorial that warned of the potential for a crash in the coin markets if, as most experts predict, Y2K disruptions turn out to be minor in the United States. Prices may also dive if the Mint sharply increases its output this year, he said. **********The coin markets are being stoked by feverish talk on the Internet of inevitable catastrophe come the millennium. More respected voices -- like Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, who gained a following on Wall Street for correctly forecasting the market boom of the 90's -- couch their warnings in terms of probabilities. Mr. Yardeni currently says there is a 70 percent chance that Y2K breakdowns will usher in a global recession and that the most likely impact on the stock market is a 30 percent to 40 percent decline. **********Investors who bother to look up Mr. Yardeni's full analysis, however, might sit tight. He expects a major rebound in 2001 and sees the Dow Jones industrial average, currently at 9,876.35, reaching 15,000 by 2005. Of course, if he and other forecasters who are relatively gloomy about Y2K are correct, there are huge profits to be made by selling now and buying just after prices tumble. **********''The market is currently priced for perfection, and that just won't happen,'' said Dennis G. Grabow, chief executive of the Millennium Investment Corporation, a Chicago-based investment adviser to pension funds with $20 billion in assets. **********Mr. Grabow advocates dumping investments in emerging markets, urban real estate and the chemical industry, among others, in favor of Government bonds. He expects a ''flight to quality'' to drive up demand for such bonds, creating profits for those who hold them. Investors, he said, can easily move their money back into stocks once markets have absorbed a Y2K hit. **********The market is not accurately anticipating Y2K, Mr. Grabow argued, because analysts are talking to their usual sources, like corporate financial officers, instead of those lower down the ranks who are managing repair work and testing. **********But Mr. Grabow's view has been, at best, premature. He had predicted that anticipation of Y2K would send stocks down 25 percent last year; in fact, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 26.7 percent. Small investors who saw Tony Keyes on Oprah Winfrey's television program last year and snapped up his book, ''The Year 2000 Computer Crisis: An Investor's Survival Guide'' (Y2K Investor, 1997), may also have turned defensive too soon. **********''I've left a lot of money on the table,'' conceded Mr. Keyes, a former computer systems analyst turned Washington talk-radio host. **********He outlines many investment choices in his book but chose a defensive posture emphasizing Government bonds for himself. Though he largely missed the latest leg of the bull market in stocks, he added, the upside is that he has been sleeping well. **********Such experiences underscore the exquisite timing skills that Y2K financial bets require -- exactly the kind of market timing that many Wall Street professionals and financial advisers tell investors to avoid.  Not only are there varying theories of when disruptions might strike -- it could take months, for example, for overseas problems to hurt many American businesses -- but it is also difficult to predict when investors might start reacting. **********Mr. Fisher, the California money manager, is fond of calling stock markets ''The Great Humiliator.'' **********He said he could easily envision a ''relatively normal correction'' this year in a market that has reached record prices. Such a correction, he said, could become exaggerated if ''Y2K people come screaming out of the woodwork.'' Investors trying to time the market, he added, could be lured into foolish selling. **********Others warn that even in the event of a New Year's debacle, the reactions in financial markets might not all be so obvious as a race into Government bonds. Y2K problems might not send markets tumbling in Asia, for example; so much money has already been pulled out of troubled stock markets there that major investors might simply delay reinvestment instead of selling more. **********Or how about this twist: Big companies with no Year 2000 problems might face selling pressure if mutual funds see selling those stocks as the least costly way to build up cash to buy stocks they regard as unfairly beaten down. That picture seems plausible to the chief strategist of one of the country's biggest pension funds. **********''We're long-term investors, but we're also opportunistic,'' he explained, speaking on the condition of anonymity. **********OF course, while institutions may have a variety of deft strategies for jumping on opportunities, history suggests that many will end up outwitting themselves if Year 2000 trouble develops. In every recent downturn, the big institutions have done the bulk of the misguided panic selling and small investors a large proportion of the timely buying. **********One could easily imagine Y2K producing a similar result. Many of the most skittish small investors are already out of the market and into coins or other defensive investments. If trouble hits, they will not be around for the panic selling. **********Instead, those left may well be mostly long-term investors perfectly willing to snap up any bargains the institutions create in their race to the exits. **********From One Bug to Another **********UNCERTAINTY about the Year 2000 computer problem has popped up in the pits at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where 90-day Eurodollar futures are traded by institutions trying to protect themselves from swings in interest rates. **********Normally, the further away the period covered by a 90-day Eurodollar futures contract, the higher the projected interest rate, just as a loan due further in the future will usually carry a higher rate because of the added risk. In other words, today, a June futures contract -- which embodies the market's guess at what interest rates will be from mid-June to mid-September -- would be priced to reflect a lower rate than a September contract, which projects rates from mid-September through mid-December. **********One common exception to the price patterns occurs because banks often need extra cash near year-end, especially over the New Year's holiday, when the Federal Reserve is closed. Speculating that the supply of money will be tight enough to force up interest rates temporarily, traders take a ''butterfly'' position across the September, December and March contracts. **********When turned into a chart, this phenomenon usually shows what looks like gently angled ''wings'' from the September and March contracts to the December ''body'' between them. That implies a modest interest-rate increase the last day of the year. A typical trading pattern was seen last Nov. 13, shown in Chart 1. **********However, late last year, Year 2000 fever drove implied interest rates way up for December 1999 futures, giving the butterfly sharply angled wings. At its peak on Dec. 28, the contract price indicated that traders expected a rate jump that was far larger than normal at the end of 1999, as shown in Chart 2. **********By late February, the patterns were closer to normal. Since then, the trend has edged toward slightly more nervousness. But volume has dropped sharply, indicating that many traders have decided that the butterfly spread this year is too unpredictable to trade. Chart 3 shows the current picture. **********How is the year-end butterfly turned into a calculation of projected interest rates? The difference between the projected December interest rate and the rate of the contracts on either side of it, September and March, is seen by banks as a starting point for estimating by how much market interest rates in the London currency market, where the Eurodollars are traded, will exceed the Federal Reserve overnight bank lending rate over the New Year's holiday. **********Because the three-day New Year's weekend beginning Dec. 31, 1999, is one-thirtieth of the 90-day contract period, bankers simply multiply the difference by 30 to come up with a number that roughly approximates how much the market expects interest rates to jump at the end of the year. **********As Chart 3 shows, traders still expect rates to climb, but not nearly to the extent that they did in December.

Col. Michael S. Waters, a spokesman for the American operation here in this base near the Mediterranean, said of the concrete. ''But there's no chance of collateral damage,'' he added, using the military's euphemism for civilian deaths. **********That makes it useful against military targets Iraq has positioned in residential neighborhoods in what American officials believe is Mr. Hussein's main objective in challenging the ''no flight'' zones over northern and southern Iraq: to foment international sympathy by publicizing civilian casualties. **********The concrete bombs are also an apt symbol of a low-level war against Iraq that is dictated as much by political and diplomatic sensitivities as strategic or military concerns. **********In what has become the longest sustained military operation since Vietnam, for more than nine months now Iraqi forces have routinely fired on the American and British jets that patrol the zones, and the American and British crews have routinely struck back. But it is a deliberately low-key war. **********''The way we're conducting this is kept within the parameters of political acceptability,'' said a senior Clinton Administration official. ''We don't want things to go wrong.'' **********And so pilots here at Incirlik (pronounced in-JER-lick) fly into combat with strict rules about what, when, where and how they may attack. **********The Turkish Government, wary of public sentiment about the repeated air strikes, limits the number of days the jets can fly and prohibits night operations. The United States European Command, which oversees operations here, has put northern Iraq's most significant military targets off limits, fearing international outrage over any escalation of the fighting. **********Above all, the pilots must avoid mistakes that could play into Mr. Hussein's hand. ''It's between none and minimal collateral damage that we'll accept,'' said Maj. Hugh Hanlon, an F-16CJ pilot stationed here. **********The result is something of a standoff. The American and British forces have struck more than five times the number of targets attacked during four days of intensive strikes against Iraq last December and flown more than three-quarters as many combat missions as NATO pilots did during 78 days of bombing Yugoslavia. **********The Iraqis say nearly 200 people, including many civilians, have been killed. American officials say that claim is exaggerated but they acknowledge people have been killed. **********American military commanders say the air strikes have inflicted severe damage to Iraq's air defenses. But they have not yet hit Iraqi forces hard enough to persuade the Government to stop resisting. **********Commanders here and at the Pentagon say the strikes will end as soon as Iraq stops firing on the patrols, even though they acknowledge that Iraq has the ability to resist this way for the foreseeable future. **********''It's reached a stalemate,'' said Group Capt. Graham P. Dixon, commander of the 200 British troops and six aircraft involved in the operations at Incirlik. ''I'm not sure there can be a way around this as long as Saddam Hussein is in power. I personally see this as a long-term proposition, not a short-term one.'' **********America and its allies created the zones after the Persian Gulf war in 1991 to protect Iraqi Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Iraqi forces. Officials in Washington say the zones remain important to isolate Mr. Hussein. **********Iraq never accepted the zones, but American and allied jets patrolled them largely unmolested for more than seven years. Then last December, the United States and Britain carried out four days of attacks to punish Mr. Hussein for refusing to allow the United Nations to continue inspections of his nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. **********Iraqi forces have since challenged virtually every patrol, firing antiaircraft weapons, launching surface-to-air missiles and sending MIG jets darting into the zones. **********While American officials decline to discuss their tactics in depth, including how or how long they have been using the concrete bombs, they do offer a stunning list of statistics. **********Since December, they say, American and British patrols have flown nearly 16,000 sorties and dropped 550 bombs against 135 targets in southern Iraq. Here at Incirlik, they have flown more than 11,000 combat or combat-support sorties and dropped more than 1,100 bombs against more than 250 targets. **********Those targets have included more than 150 antiaircraft artillery batteries, 30 radar or communication centers and 22 buildings used as command centers, said Brig. Gen. David A. Deptula, the Air Force commander here until last week. **********The air war has been decidedly one-sided. Iraqi forces have yet to hit an American or British aircraft, American officials said. **********According to American intelligence reports, Iraq has withdrawn its most sophisticated weapons from the no-flight zones in recent months to protect them. **********But that has not stopped Iraq from firing back with antiaircraft artillery. That still poses a threat, though much less of one since, the pilots and commanders say, the jets flying into northern Iraq stay high enough that they are less likely to be hit. Iraq has also positioned its remaining antiaircraft batteries in residential neighborhoods in or near the northern Iraqi cities like Mosul and Tall'Afar. **********General Deptula said that after American jets destroyed Iraq's main air-defense command center south of Mosul, the Iraqis moved their headquarters to the nearby historic ruins of Nineveh, the ancient capital of Assyria built in the seventh century B.C. -- a target presumably off limits. **********An American Government official with access to the intelligence reports said Iraq's tactics had significantly diminished its chances of hitting an aircraft, but were still accomplishing Mr. Hussein's goal of drawing attention to the patrols. **********''He's trying to provoke us to do something, but he's trying to do in such a way he doesn't lose assets,'' the official said. ''The ultimate intention of what Saddam Hussein is trying to do in the 'no fly' zones is not military.'' **********The tactics on both sides -- including the concrete bombs -- have turned the conflict into an odd game of cat-and-mouse. **********The United States has about 50 aircraft in the operation, from fighter jets to combat support. When they fly, they take off in one long, loud procession. Once they reach the border, about an hour away, only the fighter jets enter Iraq. The others fly over the khaki-colored mountains of eastern Turkey, out of harm's way. **********On a mission today, pilots reported seeing 57-millimeter antiaircraft fire, bursting in distinctive gray puffs 15,000 to 18,000 feet up, well beneath the jets. **********Pilots and commanders here say they try to respond. But from more than 20,000 feet, it is often impossible to see an artillery battery -- no larger than a truck and often hiding in orchards or towns -- and in those cases they attack other targets. **********Under their rules of engagement, the pilots most often strike at parts of Iraq's air defenses, including radio towers, radar stations and command centers that, according to the Pentagon, coordinate the Iraqi attacks. **********Today the F-16C's and the F-15's attacked separate targets at a communications center they had decided to hit in advance if threatened. **********France and Russia have criticized the strikes, and there are signs the strategy hampers United Nations Security Council negotiations over creating a new weapons inspection program in Iraq. A senior defense official said the Russians had tried to condition their support of new inspections on an end to the strikes. **********''Our mission has not changed,''  General Deptula said. ''The only thing that has changed is the threat, and we are employing ordinance to respond to that threat. But the larger question of the efficacy of the no-flight zones is a political one.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/07/business/media-talk-dow-jones-journalists-protest-pension-cuts.html": {"writer_name": "Felicity Barringer", "pub_date": "1999-06-07", "snippet": "Wall Street Journal reporters are declining to discuss their articles on CNBC because they are not allowed to appear wearing buttons that protest proposed cutbacks in their pension benefits; Dow Jones, which publishes the Journal, contracted to pr...", "word_count": 357, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Media Talk; Dow Jones Journalists Protest Pension Cuts", "print_headline": "Media Talk; Dow Jones Journalists Protest Pension Cuts", "body_text": " **********Six weeks ago, a large group of journalists at Dow Jones & Company decided to assemble in an unusual venue -- the company's annual meeting -- to express their dismay over proposed cutbacks in their pension benefits.

Breckenridge Jr., a retired California Superior Court judge, did not rule on how much money Disney owes Mr. Katzenberg, who was its studio chief. That will be decided after the next phase of the trial. **********But the ruling today means that Mr. Katzenberg will be entitled to interest payments on whatever that amount is. Since Mr. Katzenberg is seeking at least $250 million, the interest alone could reach tens of millions of dollars. **********Other parts of the ruling today went Disney's way. In particular, the referee found that there was no fraud on Disney's part. **********Mr. Katzenberg sued contending that he was owed a bonus based on all future profits of Disney movies made in the 10 years that he ran the studio -- movies like ''The Lion King,'' ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''Aladdin.'' **********The case, sometimes dubbed Katz v. Mouse, has captivated Hollywood as a spectacle of greed and of unbridled animosity between two industry titans, Mr. Katzenberg and his former boss, Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Disney. **********Mr. Katzenberg left Disney in anger in 1994 after Mr. Eisner declined to promote him to the No. 2 position after the death of the company president, Frank Wells, in a helicopter crash. Mr. Katzenberg, who then started the Dreamworks SKG studio with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, has contended that Disney denied him his bonus because of the personal animus of Mr. Eisner. **********The ruling did not refer to any personal animosity. Yet even today, the parties battled over the interpretation of the ruling, with both declaring victory. **********''Obviously I'm thrilled,'' said Bert Fields, the attorney for Mr. Katzenberg. John Dreyer, the chief spokesman for Disney, said, ''We're extremely pleased with the court's ruling.'' Both said a court order prohibited them from discussing the case. **********Disney, in a settlement, had already paid Mr. Katzenberg an amount that is said to be $117 million. Nevertheless, Mr. Eisner contended in the trial that Mr. Katzenberg had agreed to forfeit a substantial bonus by leaving the company before his contract ended. And Disney contended that it had not breached the contract and did not have to pay interest. **********But Mr. Breckenridge wrote in his seven-page opinion that his review had led to the ''inescapable conclusion (at least to the referee)'' that Mr. Katzenberg had not forfeited his bonus by failing to extend the terms of his employment. He said Mr. Katzenberg was entitled to ''good faith and fair dealing'' from Disney. **********He said that Disney was obliged to pay the bonus on or about Oct. 1, 1994, and that a breach of contract occurred on that date. But he left for later the decision on what date the interest owed to Mr. Katzenberg began accruing. **********Mr. Breckenridge also said that Mr. Katzenberg's bonus should include profits from some types of merchandise based on movies and that Disney had breached its fiduciary duty by not accounting to Mr. Katzenberg for this. **********Parts of the ruling more favorable to Disney said that calculation of Mr. Katzenberg's bonus should not include proceeds from Club Disney, which are urban play centers. It also said profits from ''Toy Story 2'' should be calculated based on a contract favored by Disney, though the referee left this matter partly open. **********Mr. Breckenridge also said Mr. Katzenberg was not entitled to any royalty for promotional uses of movies or characters on line. But he said that some on-line uses that produce measurable revenue to Disney could be included in the calculation. **********There has been some surprise in Hollywood that Disney did not settle the suit completely before it went to trial, thereby allowing the company's internal affairs to be made public. Mr. Katzenberg and his attorney, Mr. Fields, appear to have taken advantage of the opportunity to embarrass Mr. Eisner at the trial, which began April 26. **********At one point, Mr. Fields confronted Mr. Eisner with notes taken by the ghostwriter of Mr. Eisner's autobiography. According to those notes, Mr. Eisner had said of Mr. Katzenberg, ''I think I hate the little midget.'' **********For its part, the Disney side argued that live action films made under Mr. Katzenberg's tenure were $231 million in the red when he left the company, a rebuke to Mr. Katzenberg's image as a Hollywood whiz."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/16/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-clinton-s-view-of-us-goal-peaceful-time-for-europe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-04-16", "snippet": "Excerpts from Pres Clinton's address in San Francisco to American Society of Newspaper Editors (M)", "word_count": 908, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton's View of U.S. Goal: 'Peaceful Time for Europe'", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS; Clinton's View of U.S. Goal: 'Peaceful Time for Europe'", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from an address by President Clinton yesterday in San Francisco to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, as recorded by The New York Times. **********I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the crisis in Kosovo -- why we're there, what our objectives are, how this fits in with our larger vision of the future. . . . **********The tragedy in Kosovo is the result of a meticulously planned and long premeditated attack on an entire people simply on the basis of their ethnicity and religion, an attack grounded in a philosophy that teaches people to dearly love a piece of land while utterly dismissing the humanity of those who occupy it. **********That is what Mr. Milosevic has been doing ever since Yugoslavia started breaking up in 1989. . . . **********As these difficult days proceed it is important to remember that we have no quarrel with the Serbian people. They were our allies in World War II. They have often been our allies. In a sense, they are victims of this tragedy, too. And we must understand the anguish of Serbian-Americans who, like Albanian-Americans, are worried about their loved ones back home. **********Americans should not blame Serbs or look down on Serbian-Americans because we disagree with the Milosevic Government. We must not let his ethnic cleansing provoke us to ethnic bias. . . . **********We've struck at Serbia's machinery of repression, at the infrastructure that supports it. We've destroyed all of Serbia's refineries, half of its capacity to produce ammunition. We've attacked its bridges and rail lines and communications networks to diminish its ability to supply, reinforce and control its forces in Kosovo. Increasingly now we are striking the forces themselves, hitting tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers, radar missiles and aircraft. **********As the allies have said, all of us, repeatedly, Mr. Milosevic can stop NATO's bombing by meeting these conditions: **********1. Serbian security forces must leave Kosovo. **********2. The displaced Kosovars must be able to return. **********3. There must be an international security force to protect all Kosovars, including the Serb minority there, as they work toward self-government. **********If he refuses, our military campaign will continue to destroy as much of his military capability as we can, so that each day his capacity for repression will diminish. **********Meanwhile his actions, though absolutely devastating to the civilian population and horribly burdensome to the front-line states of Macedonia and Albania, have not destroyed the armed opposition among Kosovars. Indeed, their numbers and determination are growing. Ultimately, Mr. Milosevic will have to choose either to cut his mounting losses or lose his ability to maintain his grip on Kosovo. **********As for NATO, we are prepared to continue this effort as long as necessary to achieve our objectives. Our timetable will be determined by our goals, not the other way around. **********In the meantime, we must do more to aid the refugees. They are pouring out of Kosovo. We must help to preserve their lives and health and their hope of return. This week NATO approved Operation Allied Harbor, under which 8,000 troops will work with relief agencies in Albania to establish camps, provide logistical support, deliver aid and insure security. Thus far we have contributed in the United States $150 million to this effort. Conditions at the borders are beginning to improve. **********Now we are most concerned about the fate of the refugees, hundreds of thousands of them, trapped inside Kosovo. They are unable to leave but afraid to go home. Mr. Milosevic apparently wants to use them as hostages and human shields. And he's preventing relief groups from getting to them. People of good will all around the world today are trying to find ways to overcome this cruel and cynical manipulation of innocent human beings. **********Mr. Milosevic also continues to hold on to the three American servicemen his forces seized in Macedonia. He continues to flout his obligation to allow the Red Cross to visit them. I want to say again, as clearly as I can, the United States will hold him personally responsible for their welfare. **********Now, the stand we have taken, first in Bosnia, now in Kosovo, against organized ethnic hatred is a moral imperative. But it is also a strategic imperative. . . . **********The real question today is not whether Kosovo will be part of Serbia. The real question is whether Kosovo and Serbia and the other states of the region will be part of the new Europe. The best solution for Kosovo, for Serbia for Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and all the countries of southeast Europe is not the endless rejiggering of their borders, but greater integration into a Europe in which sovereignty matters, but in which borders are becoming more and more open and less important in a negative sense. **********It is to affirm the principle that Mr. Milosevic has done so very much to undermine that successful modern states make a virtue, not a blood feud, out of ethnic and religious diversity. . . . **********The Balkan war that began in Kosovo 10 years ago must end in Kosovo. It should be the last conflict of the 21st -- 20th -- century. It should not be the defining conflict of the 21st century. The United States has the opportunity and the responsibility to make that decision come out right for our children and our grandchildren.

At the time, prosecutors said Mr. Curry was caught in the act of paying an undercover officer to plant fake E-mails in the Morgan Stanley computer system that would support his claim of racism and homophobia at the firm. **********But the prosecution dropped that case this week. In doing so, the prosecutors disclosed that Morgan Stanley had paid $10,000 to a police informer, Charles Joseph Luethke, who was involved in Mr. Curry's arrest. Prosecutors said Morgan Stanley executives, even as they provided evidence damaging to Mr. Curry in the weeks following his arrest, did not tell the police or prosecutors about their contacts or their financial arrangements with Mr. Luethke. **********Since then, Morgan Stanley executives have told prosecutors that the payment had nothing to do with Mr. Curry, lawyers involved in the matter said. They said that the firm had said that the payment was related to a business arrangement with Mr. Luethke that had no connection with Mr. Curry's arrest. But the lawyers said the District Attorney's office was skeptical of that explanation. **********The District Attorney's office has asked Morgan Stanley to provide invoices or tax documents required for business transactions, lawyers involved said, but added that to their knowledge Morgan Stanley had yet to provide the requested documents. **********The District Attorney's office declined to comment yesterday on the status of the investigation or the likelihood of any indictment against Morgan Stanley executives. **********Reaction to the Curry case filled on-line business chat rooms devoted to Morgan Stanley Wednesday and yesterday. One popular Web site for company gossip called VaultReports.com carried numerous messages from anonymous people who said they were Morgan Stanley employees or clients. Many of the comments were sympathetic to Mr. Curry and hostile to Morgan Stanley management. **********''This company is getting to feel a bit like the Nixon White House,'' one person who claimed to be an employee wrote. Another said: ''I knew Christian Curry. He was a quiet, really nice guy. I have to believe Morgan could have been a little less reactionary about all this.'' **********One message writer disagreed, speculating that Mr. Curry or his supporters had planted messages on the site to make it appear that Morgan Stanley employees doubted their own superiors. **********A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said that the firm had no comment on messages posted on the site. **********But she said that any employees who were contributing messages to the site must have been doing so from home, because the site was formally banned from Morgan Stanley's office Internet system a month ago. **********The firm routinely bans access to Web sites that employees have no business gaining access to while at work, she added."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/30/business/chicago-board-seat-is-sold.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-01-30", "snippet": "Chicago Board of Trade reports sale of seat for $545,000 (S)", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chicago Board Seat Is Sold", "print_headline": "Chicago Board Seat Is Sold", "body_text": " **********The Chicago Board of Trade said today that a full membership on the world's largest futures exchange sold this week for $545,000, the highest in seven months.

And in an industry where imitation is often the definition of creative strategy, the other networks have revved up their copying machines. A copycat show -- bluntly called ''Greed'' -- made its debut on the Fox network two weeks ago after being rushed through production with only about a month of preparation. And CBS, NBC and ABC itself all have game formats in various stages of preproduction. By February as many as five game shows may be on the network schedules. **********''It's a phenomenon like nothing else I've ever seen on television,'' Marvin Goldsmith, the president of sales for ABC, said. **********''Millionaire,'' which ABC has slotted into various time periods over 15 nights of the current rating-sweeps month, has managed to crush almost every show that has opposed it so far -- even NBC's venerable ''Frasier.'' In its first outing, against two highly promoted mini-series, ''Millionaire'' pulled in almost 26 million viewers, just a few million fewer than the top-rated program on television, ''E.R.'' That was about double the total number of viewers for each of the mini-series. **********For the broadcast networks, struggling to keep program costs down in the face of steadily eroding audiences, the show has an extra allure: like the news magazines that have proliferated on prime time, it is relatively cheap to produce. Even with the promised million-dollar giveaways, its costs come in well under $1 million an episode (no contestant has yet won more than $500,000). That is one-tenth to one-twentieth the cost of the two mini-series -- ''Shake, Rattle and Roll'' on CBS and ''Leprechauns'' on NBC -- it trounced a week ago. **********Just as important, from ABC's point of view, is that in a time of  ''narrowcasting,'' when almost all programming is targeting specific age groups, ''Millionaire'' is proving to be the kind of true mass-audience hit that network television used to manufacture regularly, but now rarely does. **********''This is a show that truly the whole family is watching,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''My advertising customers are ecstatic. The network is euphoric.'' **********There is no shortage of theories about why people have decided to go out of their way to find this show. Michael Dann, the one-time chief programmer for CBS, who was at the network through the years of the quiz-show scandals and who at one time was ordered by Frank Stanton, the CBS president, to cancel five quiz shows all at once, said the time had simply come for the format to rise above its tarnished past. ''It's well over 35 years later,'' Mr. Dann said. ''There a new generation that really doesn't care about the history of the game show. They just want good entertainment.'' **********Many television executives and other industry analysts say it is the simplicity of ''Millionaire'' that is crucial to its roaring success. **********''The key is the show has heart,'' said Michael Davies, the show's executive producer. ''You're rooting for the people on the show.'' **********That is true of almost every television game show, of course. But on ''Millionaire'' production elements are geared toward intensifying the drama and the pressure: pulsing music, harsh lighting, a solo chair with no desk, nothing between the contestant and the host, Regis Philbin. **********The questions, while occasionally difficult, are often merely tricky, like one last week that threw most viewers -- as well as the contestant: How many teaspoons are in a tablespoon? (Answer: three.) Beyond that, the show is probably the first ever to give contestants multiple choices, which means every viewer has a chance at getting the right answer: it's there somewhere on the screen. **********Robert Thompson, a professor of television and film at Syracuse University, takes a somewhat jaded view in comparing the new quiz show with the old shows. ''The difference between 'Millionaire' and the 50's game shows tells you where education is going in this country,'' he said. ''In the 50's game shows, you had to know the exact answer. Today we get multiple choice on a show whose title isn't even punctuated correctly.'' **********(What's missing: a) question mark b) exclamation point c) whom instead of who d) dollar sign. Final answer: a.) **********But what has most distinguished the game from the 50's shows and others that have preceded it is the opportunity for contestants to get help answering questions, either from the audience or friends, who can be called at home. **********Aside from Mr. Philbin, all of these elements are present in the British version of the game, which began two years ago. Mr. Davies is British and he was made aware of the show by relatives. When he brought it to ABC, his enthusiasm helped sell the idea to Stu Bloomberg, the chairman of ABC Entertainment. Mr. Bloomberg took a copy of the British show home and watched it with his family. ''We had never seen a game show like this,'' he said. ''The music, the lighting, the whole gestalt of it was perfect.'' **********Mr. Bloomberg noted, ''The show was doing a 73 share in England.'' The share is the percent of viewers watching television at a given hour who are watching a given show.  ''When you hear 73 share, your ears do perk up,''Mr. Bloomberg said. **********One other factor in the show's success, many executives said, has been  ABC's decision to schedule it mainly in spots between comedies. **********Comedies have, coincidentally, been in sharp decline this television season, with viewers showing evidence of what many television executives describe as fatigue with the format. ''Millionaire'' seems to be taking advantage of that fatigue. **********Placed at 8:30 on Tuesday and Wednesday nights last week, for example, the ratings for ''Millionaire'' spiked far above any other show on the night. It is rare for a show in the so-called hammock position between two established hits to totally dwarf them in the ratings. **********In another sign of success, ''Millionaire'' last week even managed to beat ''Frasier,'' the current occupant of the most formidable comedy spot on television, 9 p.m. Thursday on NBC. After years of domination by ''Cheers,'' ''Seinfeld'' and ''Frasier,'' it was the first time an ABC series had beaten an original episode of an NBC comedy on Thursday night at 9 since 1983. **********Indeed, the show's pull is so powerful that the research departments at the other networks are predicting that ABC, previously in the midst of a disappointing season, has a very good chance to win the ratings-sweep month. That would be the first time ABC would have won any sweep since 1994. **********Mr. Goldsmith said revenues being brought in by the show were so impressive that ''it is going to help the network's bottom line tremendously.'' He said he could not cite the specific financial benefit to ABC yet, because the show had so many more nights to run this month. **********ABC would not reveal any official prices for commercials in ''Millionaire,'' but one senior ABC executive said the average price for a 30-second commercial had reached $300,000 to $350,000. And advertisers who want to buy in at the last minute, like movie companies, may be asked to pay $500,000 to $600,000 for each commercial. **********That puts the show up near the highest-priced shows in television. NBC's ''E.R.'' gets about $545,000 for each commercial, according to annual survey published by the trade paper Advertising Age. Most significant for ABC is the difference in rates for ''Millionaire'' as opposed to the shows it has replaced on ABC this month. **********For example, the sitcom ''It's Like, You Know'' on Tuesday at 8:30 was priced at about $175,000 a commercial in the survey. The price for ''20/20'' on Monday at 8 was $119,000; for ''Snoops'' on Sunday at 9, it was $105,000. **********The spectacular ratings -- and those increased profits -- were certain to be noticed by the competition.  Even Fox's ''Greed'' is off to a hot start, improving Fox's ratings last Thursday by well over 100 percent and leading the network to its best Thursday over all in more than six months. **********NBC and CBS are actually resurrecting the games that were at the center of the scandals in the 1950's, ''21'' and ''The $64,000 Question.'' Naturally, they say they will steer clear of the rigged answers, but they also promise updated formats, which will likely owe a lot to ''Millionaire.'' **********The obvious question is how much attention the public will pay to a sudden glut of game shows. Preston Beckman, the executive vice president of NBC program planning, said, ''Collectively all of us could kill off the genre.'' He said that was not the purpose behind each network's effort to get its own game show mounted, but, he added, ''That might be the unintended consequence.'' **********Whatever happens, ABC is certain to try to get as much advantage as it can from its surprise hit. As Mr. Goldsmith put it, ''We're going to ride this puppy as long as we can.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/15/business/company-news-monarch-to-purchase-herr-voss-industries.html": {"writer_name": "Bridge News", "pub_date": "1999-05-15", "snippet": "Monarch Machine Tool Co will buy Herr-Voss Industries from group of investors led by Three Cities Research Inc for about $55 million in cash and 500,000 common shares; will assume $19 million in debt (S)", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONARCH TO PURCHASE HERR-VOSS INDUSTRIES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MONARCH TO PURCHASE HERR-VOSS INDUSTRIES", "body_text": " **********The Monarch Machine Tool Company, which specializes in making metal-shaping machinery, said yesterday that it would buy Herr-Voss Industries from a group of investors led by Three Cities Research Inc. for about $55 million in cash and 500,000 common shares, a total of about $59 million based on Thursday's closing price.

It has become usual for people who work in this western German city to live in Belgium and play a weekly tennis match in the Netherlands. The sweet whiff of prosperity seeps from Italian shoe stores, Spanish tapas bars, French croissanteries and English pottery shops that line the pedestrian shopping areas on all sides of the borders. **********''This used to be a border city, but no longer,'' said Hans Poth, a spokesman for the Aachen town council who lives in Belgium. ''And once we have the euro, the last barriers will disappear.'' **********But a few hundred miles to the east, in Gorlitz, crumbling facades testify to decades of Communist rule. The town is split into two halves, as it has been since 1945 when eastern districts fell into Poland as European borders were rearranged after World War II. A single bridge, clogged by long lines of traffic, links the German and Polish parts. **********While Aachen's melting borders symbolize the growing unity of Western Europe, Gorlitz underlines the continuing division of the continent. **********Rolf Karbaum, mayor of the German part of Gorlitz, gazed out over a disjointed vista of baroque homes built centuries ago by German burghers and apartment blocks left by Polish Communists. ''Now we want to be one city again,'' he said. ''But for that, we need Poland in the European Union and the euro as our currency on both sides of the river.'' **********Aided by the United States, postwar Europe has risen from the ruins of 1945 and overcome seemingly perennial rivalries through a bold vision of union that has brought prosperity and peace to regions plagued for centuries by instability and bloodshed. The euro, a single currency for 290 million people that may in time challenge the dollar, symbolizes a colossal achievement. **********Yet it falls short of the original vision of a federal Europe with a single currency at its heart. Through its 20-year gestation, the euro appears to have shifted from a political ideal to a more prosaic economic tool. **********Europe, for the foreseeable future, seems set to remain a hybrid beast, using English as its lingua franca, running its monetary policy through a federal institution -- the European Central Bank in Frankfurt -- while control of most other instruments of government, including budgets, remains at the national level. **********Whether such an arrangement -- a new experiment in historical terms -- is workable remains unclear. Projected slower European growth in 1999, dragged down by slumps in Asia and Latin America, will place added strain on the euro's inception. **********Beyond the economics loom larger questions. With the Cold War's glue now gone, will the trans-Atlantic bond that buttressed European growth remain firm as ''Euroland'' takes form? **********The 11 nations joining the euro have abandoned an important part of their sovereignty to the European Central Bank. That probably will dispose them toward finding multilateral solutions to world problems, while a wholly sovereign America may choose -- as recently in Iraq -- to take a unilateral view of its interests. **********And does Europe still have the vitality and drive to overcome the many remaining divisions between its capitalist and former Communist halves, to fulfill Mr. Karbaum's wish of making his wounded Gorlitz whole again? **********Voicing a sentiment common in France, which acutely feels an end-of-millennium intellectual malaise, Arnaud Jacomet, a French defense official, considers Europe ''a tired continent, in late middle age, looking only for a comfortable retirement, with the United States as its eternal protector.'' In this vision, Europe may be content to rest on its laurels, leaving the formerly Communist, still impoverished states in its east on the outside looking in. **********The 11 nations that have adopted the new currency carry formidable economic heft. They represent about 18 percent of the world's total output and account for about 20 percent of its exports. After the United States, Europe will be the world's second-largest trading area with a single currency. **********The euro, if it is successful, will provide enhanced European capital markets, easier comparison of prices, improved competitiveness, convenience and the kind of stability that resisted any European contagion from Asian or South American crises in 1998. **********Already, the tough fiscal and other criteria set for qualification for the euro have drawn countries like Spain, Italy and Portugal toward a low-inflation prosperity they have never previously known. The euro, and the 15-nation European Union in general, have amounted to a beneficent magnet. **********Some day, many economists believe, the euro may even rival the dollar as a reserve currency, obliging the United States to abandon a central assumption: that its deficits will always be financed because the world wants dollars. **********Norway, for example, is certain to take payment for oil exported to its European neighbors in euros rather than dollars, because it imports principally from European countries. Eastern European exporters may do the same. **********''Taking a three-year view, the euro will present a serious challenge to the dollar,'' said David Hale, chief economist for the Chicago-based Zurich Group. ''America may have to rethink its view of itself.'' **********But challenging America in the ether of world financial markets is far from creating the unified political entity imagined by the founding fathers of European Union and very far from any European emancipation from American military tutelage. **********The Dream **********From War's Ashes, A Single Future **********For generations, ever since Churchill spoke in 1946 of uniting Europe in ''the sharing of its common inheritance'' and Jean Monnet of France laid the first foundation stones of integration, many Europeans have dreamed of unity. Yet just as the euro is being introduced, the idea of Europe may have lost its galvanizing appeal. **********A difficult decade in Europe has taken a heavy toll on the European ideal. Slow growth and high unemployment -- more than 10 percent in Germany, more than 11 percent in France -- have been widely equated with the budgetary rigors imposed as preparation for the new currency. In many places, Brussels has become a dirty word. **********Although East Europeans still talk constantly of ''joining Europe,'' seeing in this mantra the age-old vision that European unity could banish the continent's demons and bring peace, ''Europe'' has little or no resonance for the millions of young West Europeans touched by unemployment. No new, forward-looking message has been found to take its place. **********Indeed the very words ''idea'' and ''Europe'' seem strangely paired because intellectual vitality appears to have migrated elsewhere, and with it the forces now changing the world. **********Yves Thibault de Silguy is the European Union's top monetary official and an ardent promoter of the euro. For this energetic Frenchman, a Paris-to-Potsdam, Berlin-to-Barcelona currency may eventually make the nations that have opted to join ''Euroland'' more stable and robust. **********But European patriotism -- hearts thumping, even stirring, before Europe's blue-and-gold flag? Forget it. A quick expansion eastward to embrace formerly communist Mitteleuropa? Not likely. **********''We can never be an American melting pot, even with a single currency,'' Mr. de Silguy said. ''People here are firmly attached to national ideas. They like to live in a big, open European market, but within their own language and culture. As for expansion eastward, we need to wait. You have to be a realist.'' **********Such realism, however, is new at European headquarters. A few years ago, the dismissal of a United States of Europe -- especially by a Frenchman -- would have been viewed as Thatcherite Europhobia. For decades, the 15-nation European Union progressed precisely by being unrealistic. It embraced far-fetched dreams, like a single currency, and somehow staggered toward them. **********But now, the boldness of a postwar European generation driven by the desire to banish bloodshed from the continent has given way to the pragmatism of a more pampered generation for whom America is at least as resonant as Europe. **********This shift of ambition suggests that Europe will long remain what Norbert Walter, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank, calls ''an economic giant and a political dwarf.'' While challenging American supremacy on the currency markets, the dwarf will still desire -- even require -- American military protection and, in times of crisis such as recent Balkan conflicts, strategic leadership. **********''Nobody buys the federalist model in Brussels any more,'' said Andrew Moravcsik of Harvard's Center for European Studies. ''As governments have started looking beyond the euro, at harmonizing foreign and defense policy, even at a common tax policy, they have seen that public opinion is just not with them.'' **********In this climate, Mr. de Silguy and other officials said, the euro will not propel Europe toward political unity -- a common foreign and defense policy, a European army, the federal European government long seen by France as the best escape from American domination of Europe and by Germany as a refuge from a troublesome national identity. **********''Right now, a shared defense, security and foreign policy looks unrealistic to me,'' Mr. de Silguy said. **********In its absence, America, through NATO, will continue to bear the chief burden of Europe's defense. But already, debates on the future of the Alliance have been marked by differences over how ''global'' NATO should become and whether, as Europeans now argue, the organization should be bound in its missions by the United Nations Security Council. **********Still, for now the alliance of interests binding Europe and the United States since the end of World War II has held. The success of this joint undertaking -- European integration under the umbrella of American security guarantees -- is evident in Aachen. **********The Reality **********A Hybrid Approach To Hard Problems **********Once home to Charlemagne, who governed much of Western Europe from here in the 9th century, including modern France and Germany, Aachen was long disadvantaged by the proximity of the Belgian and Dutch borders -- barriers to trade and economic development that were as cumbersome as today's German-Polish border at Gorlitz. **********But now, on the German-Dutch border, a unique project has begun. Called ''Avantis,'' it is a 100-acre trans-border industrial zone that literally straddles the frontier. Dutch and German mail boxes, red and yellow, have already been placed side by side in an act of playful symbolism. **********The project is complicated because Dutch and German taxes and regulations are different. But it is intended to feed off Aachen's renowned university of technology and engineering to create between 7,000 and 12,000 jobs in the high-tech sector. A brochure describes the project as a ''European Science and Business Park'' set in a ''win-win situation.'' **********That, in many ways, is a good summary of Europe today: A German-Dutch cross-border project with an English name and American jargon. Areas of prosperity in places long prone to instability abound. Alsace-Lorraine, and the French-Spanish border region between Perpignan and Barcelona are other examples. **********''Peace and freedom are now taken for granted,'' said Jurgen Linden, the mayor of Aachen. ''So we have to show our citizens that Europe has advantages by creating jobs in projects like these. With the euro, we can work on both sides of a border.'' **********Not everyone is convinced. In the streets of Maastricht, the Dutch town where European leaders decided in 1991 to tear down trade barriers and adopt a single currency, Elisabeth Lubbers, a housewife, said the people of Europe were still different, and its nations too diverse, to accept the euro. ''There will be trouble,'' she said, ''and with Germany you never know.'' **********That sentiment is not uncommon in Britain and has contributed to keeping the country out of the euro for now. Among the 18 million unemployed in Europe and the continent's ''new poor,'' resentment against Europe is often virulent. **********The Doubts **********Nagging Suspicions About Path to Take **********For most Europeans -- a clear majority, according to polls -- the euro is now seen as a logical extension of a successful experiment. What is not clear is whether the will exists to reach out from the relative comfort of today's western European society to take that experiment decisively further. **********Some ideas do exist: the nomination of a ''High Representative'' to coordinate European foreign and security policy; a passage to majority voting on more European issues, seen as essential if Europe is not to become too unwieldy; a possible integration of the Western European Union, Europe's largely dormant defense arm, into the formal structures of the European Union. **********But such steps -- known as ''deepening'' -- are controversial, because they may imply further compromises on national sovereignty. **********They may also prove difficult because Germany and France, long the motors of European integration, have discovered other priorities. Germany has been absorbed with its costly unification and, of late, with an attempt to step out from the shadow of its past. **********''Of course, we are all for a strengthening of Europe, but we no longer feel this is a historical obligation,'' said Bodo Hombach, minister of State at the Germany chancellery. ''We want Europe, but not because we have to.'' **********In practice, the new government of Social Democrats and Greens led by Gerhard Schroder has adopted almost Thatcherite tones in demanding a reduction in its huge contribution to the European budget. It has also suggested that candidates for European Union membership -- including Poland -- may have to wait a long time. **********Across the Rhine, French politicians have been made acutely aware of the enduring appeal of nationalist slogans by the success of the National Front, and disgruntlement over unemployment has made any ringing appeals for united European governance tantamount to political suicide. **********Until Europe works out these internal problems, it will not reach out to address the pressing needs of Gorlitz and all the once-Communist countries on its eastern flank. Already, with unemployment running at 21 percent in the area, many Germans complain about Poles coming to work illegally in Gorlitz. **********''It took generations to resolve the French-German problem, and here tensions with Poland have been compounded by almost 50 years of Communism,'' said Mr. Karbaum, the Gorlitz mayor. ''But this is an artificial border, and we have to overcome it, just as on Germany's western side.'' **********Jreneusz Aniszkiewicz, the deputy mayor of Zgorzelec, as the Polish side of the town is known, agreed: ''The economy can resolve everything today,'' he said. **********The two men have a project: to rebuild Gorlitz's old bridge, destroyed by Allied bombing in 1945. But six years of negotiation have so far failed to resolve various difficulties and the two banks of the River Neisse -- no more than 30 yards apart -- remain unbridged in the center of town. The one existing bridge is on the outskirts. **********''It is not easy,'' Mr. Karbaum said. ''Young Germans say to me, we have no work, no hope, nothing to do, and you want to spend millions of euros on a bridge.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/27/business/international-business-mexico-s-central-bank-is-optimistic-on-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Preston", "pub_date": "1999-01-27", "snippet": "Banco de Mexico officials say Mexico has already weathered worst blows of global economic crisis and is not likely to suffer severely from instability in Brazil; say economy grew by about 4.8 percent in 1998; will seek to bring inflation, which en...", "word_count": 653, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexico's Central Bank Is Optimistic on Economy", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Mexico's Central Bank Is Optimistic on Economy", "body_text": " **********Mexico has already weathered the worst blows of the global economic crisis and is not likely to suffer severe trauma from the instability in Brazil even if it deepens, top finance officials said today. **********The relatively sanguine prognosis for Mexico came from senior officials of the Banco de Mexico, the central bank, as they announced that they would take more aggressive action to rein in inflation in 1999. **********Despite dizzying fluctuations in many emerging markets last year and a drop in the price of crude oil, one of Mexico's main exports, by about 30 percent, the economy held its own over all, the officials said, growing by about 4.8 percent. **********Consumers continued to spend, although more cautiously toward the end of 1998, and official unemployment reached the lowest levels of the decade at 2.6 percent. Most economists believe these official figures do not reflect the large numbers of Mexicans who only have part-time jobs or have precarious income from street vending or other insecure work. But they remain an indicator of the creation of formal jobs. **********Mexico is better protected than other Latin American countries from the disarray in Brazil, the region's largest economy, the officials said. Less than 1 percent of Mexico's foreign trade is with Brazil, while more than 80 percent of its manufacturing exports are sold in the United States, where growth is projected to slow only mildly this year. **********''There just aren't many paths by which the crisis in Brazil can reach us,'' one senior central bank official said. **********''Our principal nexus is with the United States, and we hope that it will maintain its growth,'' another official said. ''As they say, you should hitch your wagon to a rising star.'' **********Other analysts said the Mexican officials were too optimistic but not completely off base. **********''No country in Latin America is as far removed from Brazil in terms of trade and investment flows as Mexico,'' said Gray Newman, senior Latin American economist at Merrill Lynch. ''There are really two Latin Americas, one with a hub in Brazil and another in Mexico. But it's a little too early to say they are decoupled. Mexico is still vulnerable to investor sentiment about all the emerging markets.'' **********Economists noted that the peso slipped only slightly, to 10.15 to the dollar in New York today from 10.23 on Monday, after the Brazil's currency -- the real -- was allowed to float earlier this month and lost 30 percent of its value. **********The view at the Banco de Mexico is that international conditions cannot get much more unsteady than they were in 1998, with Russia's default on part of its debt and the uncertainties in Asia. The central bank's estimates are based on an estimated average price for Mexican crude oil this year of only $9.25 a barrel, and the officials do not believe prices can go much lower than that. **********The officials said they were ''not happy'' that inflation ended the year at 18.6 percent, well above the original goal of 12 percent. They will try to bring it to 13 percent this year. Inflation was increased by some devaluation of the peso, by increases in prices of basic goods like gasoline and tortillas, and by erratic weather, which ruined many food crops. **********The central bank will stick to its policy of allowing the peso to float but will react faster and more aggressively to international shocks, which depress the currency and fuels inflation. The bank will continue to limit the amount of money in circulation on a daily basis as an anti-inflationary measure. The central bank also restricts bank lending by forcing the institutions to maintain the equivalent of $1.9 billion in deposits in the central bank. Although the policy raises interest rates in the short term, in the long term it reduces inflation by strengthening the peso and encouraging foreign investment. **********''We are going to have a very careful, very vigilant, fundamentally very restrictive policy,'' one top official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/world/arafat-says-he-supports-federation-with-jordan.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "1999-02-13", "snippet": "Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, in seeming reminder to new Jordanian King Abdullah of promises once made by late King Hussein, says he (Arafat) still favors confederation between future Palestinian state and Jordan, speech, Hebron; photo (M)", "word_count": 586, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arafat Says He Supports Federation With Jordan", "print_headline": "Arafat Says He Supports Federation With Jordan", "body_text": " **********In what seemed like a message to the new King of Jordan, the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, said today that he still favored the creation of a confederation between the future Palestinian state and Jordan. **********Speaking at a rally in the West Bank city of Hebron, Mr. Arafat revived the idea, which is more than 10 years old, of a Palestinian-Jordanian federation, as if to remind the new King, Abdullah, of promises that his father, the late King Hussein, once made. **********''We want him to know that the Palestinian National Council has agreed to a confederation with Jordan,'' Mr. Arafat said, referring to King Abdullah, who took over the throne after his father's death on Sunday. ''We are, after all, twin brothers, Palestine and Jordan.'' **********Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization have long fought over who should represent the Palestinians who live on the West Bank of the Jordan River. Israel captured the land from Jordan in the 1967 war.  But it took King Hussein 21 years to formally renounce his claim on the land and cede Jordan's rights to the P.L.O. With that concession, the King agreed to the idea of a confederation to retain a foothold in the West Bank. **********But after right-wing Israelis enthusiastically latched on to the idea, preferring the Jordanian monarchy to the Palestine Liberation Organization, Jordanian and Palestinian enthusiasm ebbed. Also, the Jordanians -- who had sketched plans for an federation based in Amman with two prime ministers, two parliaments and one currency, the Jordanian dinar -- began to fear the idea of  sharing a federal entity in which the Palestinians would outnumber them by a great majority. **********And after the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement was signed, King Hussein was keen on retaining an independent place at the table in the final status negotiations over borders, refugees and Jerusalem. **********In resuscitating the idea today, at the end of a week that began with Hussein's funeral, Mr. Arafat took the Jordanians, and some of his own advisers, by surprise. **********The Jordanian Government released a statement, broadcast on Israeli radio, saying the subject would have to await discussion ''until after the end of the occupation.'' **********''Once they are a sovereign country, we could sit down and have a conversation about unity,'' said Abdullah Hassanat, editor in chief of The Jordan Times, a publication controlled by the Government. ''A confederation in the future would be acceptable.'' **********A high-ranking official in Mr. Arafat's Fatah party agreed. ''It should come after independence,'' the official, Hani al-Hasan, said. ''It is the natural thing and the will of the people on both banks of the river.'' **********Some Palestinians said they believed that Mr. Arafat was aiming his remarks partly at the Hebronites in his audience. They are believed to identify keenly with the Jordanians. **********Some Jordanian analysts said they believed that Mr. Arafat was really aiming his remarks at Israel. They said they thought that he was looking to capitalize on the great feeling toward Jordan that Israelis showed over the last week, when they grieved for King Hussein. **********The experts said Mr. Arafat might have wanted to signal to the Israelis that the Jordanians whom they so trusted would be involved in the future Palestinian state that many so dread. **********If so, a spokesman for the Israeli Government, David Bar-Illan, did not sound assuaged. ''A confederation itself,'' Mr. Bar-Illan said, ''does not remove the danger of a Palestinian state declared unilaterally, which could raise a large army and forge alliances with countries like Iraq, Syria and Iran and control Israel's airspace and water resources.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/04/business/mutual-funds-report-closed-end-funds-could-provide-a-window-to-emerging-markets.html": {"writer_name": "Virginia Kahn", "pub_date": "1999-04-04", "snippet": "Assessment of first-quarter performance of emerging-markets closed-end funds, which have risen average of 10.7 percent through late March (M)", "word_count": 1008, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Closed-End Funds Could Provide a Window to Emerging Markets", "print_headline": "MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT; Closed-End Funds Could Provide a Window to Emerging Markets", "body_text": " **********INVESTORS looking to ride the resurgent, though risky, emerging markets might consider closed-end funds. Emerging-markets closed-end funds are up 10.7 percent on average through late March, and some funds like Templeton Russia, the India fund and Turkish Investment are up 30 percent or more. **********Closed-end funds can be an attractive way to invest in emerging markets because most are selling at discounts to their net asset value, averaging 5.8 percent. **********Unlike their open-end brethren, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares that trade the same way as stocks. As a result, they can be priced at a premium or discount to the value of their holdings. By contrast, open-end funds continually issue and redeem shares, which always trade at net asset value. **********The opportunities in closed-end funds extend beyond emerging markets to domestic equity and fixed-income funds. Now may be a good time, for example, to take advantage of seasonal trading patterns in fixed-income funds. All closed-end funds tend to sag in December because of year-end tax selling. And in April, fixed-income funds, especially tax-exempt funds, tend to trade at especially large discounts, as investors sell them to pay taxes. **********Discounts to net asset value make closed-end funds attractive because investors aren't paying full price for the underlying assets. The trick is to buy closed-end funds when they trade at deeper discounts than their historical average, said Gregg Wolper, closed-end fund editor at Morningstar, the fund publisher. **********While discounts to net asset value are generally not as steep as they were late last year, they are still relatively wide, he said. ''There are still really worthwhile opportunities in the closed-end fund universe, not only in terms of good funds but also good prices,'' he said. ''Funds are trading at good discounts.'' **********Of course, there is no guarantee that the discounts will ever narrow. **********Among domestic equity funds, for example, discounts average 11.29 percent of net asset value, almost as big as they were late last year. As a result, investors can pick up high-quality funds relatively cheaply. Central Securities, which has been managed by Wilmot Kidd for 25 years, ''is one of the best mid-cap funds of any kind,'' Mr. Wolper said; it has often traded at a premium, but is now available at a 19.8 percent discount. The fund has returned about 20 percent a year, on average, the last 10 years on a net asset basis. **********Similarly, investors can pick up the Salomon Brothers fund at an 8.7 percent discount. The fund, a large-company value portfolio, has outperformed 70 percent of its peers the last five years. **********MUCH of the recent action in closed-end funds has been in the international sector. Not only have emerging markets rebounded, but some activist shareholders, especially institutional investors, have been pushing funds to eliminate persistent discounts to net asset value. In the last two years, according to Merrill Lynch, more than a dozen closed-end single-country funds have decided to convert to open-end funds or to liquidate. **********In either case, the discount should be eliminated and investors should be able to sell at net asset value. But there can be tax consequences to creating an open-end fund because a surge in redemptions can force a manager to sell appreciated securities. Moreover, fund companies often impose fees on the sales of such funds, said Douglas Beck, an equity funds analyst at Merrill. **********Mr. Beck recommended that investors focus instead on fundamentals. Among his favorite picks is the Mexico fund, the oldest and largest closed-end fund investing in Mexican companies. The Mexican stock market is up 24.5 percent so far this year, and the fund is still selling at about a 25 percent discount to net asset value. ''We would expect that discount to narrow as people start to reassess emerging markets,'' he said. **********Michael Porter, the closed-end country fund analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, is also enthusiastic about some emerging-markets funds. ''My pick of the year is Templeton Vietnam and Southeast Asia,'' he said. The fund, managed by J. Mark Mobius, the prominent manager of several Templeton emerging-markets funds, broadened its mandate beyond Vietnam in April 1998 to include other Southeast Asian countries. Mr. Porter is expecting a rebound in Asian markets next year as the region moves to recover from its deep recession. **********The majority of the fund is invested in Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore. It is selling at a 20 percent discount. Mr. Porter expects the fund, which has been trading around $7 a share, to reach $9 to $9.50 the next 12 to 16 months. **********INVESTORS seeking income should also check closed-end funds, said Mr. Wolper of Morningstar. Their attraction over open-end funds is higher yields, but not necessarily more risk. Closed-end funds pay income based on net asset value, so when investors buy shares at a discount, they are getting a fatter yield. **********Peter Trefonas, 60, a food broker in Chicago, has been a longtime investor in Northeast Investors, an open-end junk bond fund. In September, he bought shares of a closed-end fund, Salomon Brothers High Income II. The fund yields about 11 percent. **********''The open-end fund yield was nowhere near this,'' he said. Northeast Investors, which Mr. Trefonas still owns, yields about 9 percent. The Salomon fund sells at a slight discount and its credit rating from Standard & Poor's is slightly lower than that of Northeast Investors. **********George Foot, managing partner at Newgate L.L.P., a money management firm, likes two high-yield closed-end funds: the Debt Strategies fund, yielding 12.3 percent, and Senior High Income, yielding 10.9 percent. Both funds now trade at  discounts to net asset value, versus premiums last year. Among conservative funds owned by Mr. Foot is  ACM Government Spectrum, which yields 9.7 percent, yet has an average credit rating of double A. **********Investors may also want to look at tax-exempt closed-end municipal bond funds. Thomas J. Herzfeld, president of the money management firm Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, includes MSDW Municipal Income II and III on his buy list. They are yielding about 5.6 percent and trading at discounts of 12 percent to 13 percent. For investors in the 28 percent bracket, the tax-equivalent yield is 7.8 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/30/world/greens-say-they-ll-quit-french-government-if-it-plans-new-a-plants.html": {"writer_name": "Marlise Simons", "pub_date": "1999-08-30", "snippet": "France's Green Party, emboldened by good showing in recent elections for European Parliament, threatens to pull out of Govt if Prime Min Lionel Jospin approves new generation of nuclear power stations to replace old ones; Greens, who joined Jospin...", "word_count": 695, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Greens Say They'll Quit French Government if It Plans New A-Plants", "print_headline": "Greens Say They'll Quit French Government if It Plans New A-Plants", "body_text": " **********France's Green Party, emboldened by a good showing in the recent elections for the European Parliament, has threatened to pull out of the Government coalition if Prime Minister Lionel Jospin approves a new generation of nuclear power stations to replace old ones. **********The Greens, who joined Mr. Jospin's Government in 1997, have always insisted that the nuclear energy issue is at the center of their policy concerns. But even though the Green leader, Dominique Voynet, serves as Environment Minister, the party says it is being ignored on vital questions inside the coalition. **********The issue at hand is the coming debate on energy policy. Its central question is whether France will reduce its dependence on nuclear energy and turn to other sources. France's 57 nuclear reactors provide 78 percent of the country's energy, one of the highest rates in the world. **********But as those plants become obsolete in the coming years, France will face the choice of phasing them out or replacing them with a new type, the so-called European Pressurized Reactors. Those reactors, developed in a French-German project, are expected to be ready to go into operation around 2010. **********The anti-nuclear campaign planned in France may cause some turbulence, but even if the Greens walk out, their departure is not likely to threaten the fate of the Government coalition, which thanks to its Communist allies would still retain a majority in Parliament. **********As Greens have elsewhere in Europe, those in France have strongly opposed nuclear energy, and they say a straight replacement plan is not acceptable. They insist that they cannot compromise on the point, which they see as a cornerstone of the agreement they reached with Mr. Jospin's Socialists before joining the coalition Government. **********''It's a very fundamental question for us,'' said Denis Baupin, the Green Party spokesman. ''Do we replace the decommissioned plants with new ones, or do we start to opt out of nuclear energy, like Belgium and Germany? If the decision is for new plants, we will pull out of the Government.'' **********The Greens have also renewed their demand that a national referendum be held on the country's energy strategy and the future of nuclear power. To make sure they will be heard, the Greens say they are planning a series of protests against nuclear power, matching the campaign of Germany's Greens, who have been pressing the Government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder to phase out nuclear energy use more quickly. **********The French environmentalists see the experience of their German counterparts as a warning sign. German Greens have become angry and frustrated as Mr. Schroder's promised effort to shut down nuclear power plants has stalled after pressure from business leaders. **********Officials say an informal consensus is forming that France will reduce, though not eliminate, its nuclear power plants. They say that if anti-nuclear pressure heats up, the Government can afford to postpone any key decisions until after the presidential election of 2002 -- for which the Socialists want to keep the Greens as allies. **********But the tension over the issue underscores the rising influence of the Green movement. After long seeming indifferent to environmental questions, France is now among the European countries where Greens have gained support and moved from the political fringes closer to the center of power. **********As their neighbors fared better, France's Greens long remained marginal in political life because of infighting and splits over ideology.  Their position improved after Mrs. Voynet took charge in 1993. Among other changes, she allied the Greens with the Socialists. **********But unexpected success came in the European parliamentary elections in June, when the vote for the Greens surged to close to 10 percent from less than 3 percent in the last European election, in 1994. In the Paris area alone, the Greens scored almost 20 percent. The increases have prompted them to fight for greater influence in future local elections. **********In the meantime, to their annoyance, their new popularity has not translated automatically into more political power. Mrs. Voynet and other party members have openly said that their 10 percent vote should have earned them more seats in the Cabinet than the one they now have. **********Party leaders also sound clearly frustrated that they have not gained greater say over policy decisions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/02/business/the-media-business-leading-tabloid-publisher-to-buy-a-big-competitor.html": {"writer_name": "Alex Kuczynski", "pub_date": "1999-11-02", "snippet": "American Media, company that owns The National Enquirer and Star, is expected to announce acquisition of Globe Communications Corp, publisher of Globe newspaper, for $100 million in cash; American Media is owned by Evercore Capital Partners, which...", "word_count": 779, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Leading Tabloid Publisher to Buy a Big Competitor", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Leading Tabloid Publisher to Buy a Big Competitor", "body_text": " **********In an era when Congress worries about multibillion-dollar megamergers and corporate chiefs with creased, sweaty brows testify before Congressional subcommittees about the threat of monopolization, one question has yet to rear its head: what happens if one media company starts to corner the market on tabloid gossip? **********Today, America may find out as The National Enquirer (this week's headline: ''Woody Allen's Bizarre Lust for Young Girls'') and Star magazine (''Hunky Prince William is Moving to U.S.: Look Out Girls'') are joined in tabloid bliss with The Globe (''Ravaged TV Beauty Beats Booze!'') under the same owners. **********American Media, the company that owns The National Enquirer and Star, is expected to announce today that it will acquire the Globe Communications Corporation for $100 million in cash, said executives close to the deal.

Altman, who is a close friend of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, arguably the first family not only of the country, but of the tabloid press. Mr. Altman had no comment about the deal yesterday. **********The deal will join The Globe, a 40-year-old weekly tabloid with a penchant for Elvis sightings and alien landings, and the approximately 30 other titles owned by Globe Communications, including Crack'd, and Horoscopes, with The National Enquirer, Star, Weekly World News and Country Weekly. **********When completed, the deal will not only annoy celebrities and pump up the nation's Elvis-memorabilia market, but will assure that almost half of the nation's supermarket check-out tabloids are under one corporate umbrella. The new company will, in short, dominate that most coveted of magazine real estate: the supermarket check-out rack. **********The Globe is best known for publishing more front-page articles about the Jon-Benet Ramsey murder case than any other tabloid, and scored a coup, of sorts, by publishing the crime-scene photographs of that murder. The editor, Tony Frost, was not available for comment. **********The deal has been on and off for years; Globe Communications has long been the apple of The National Enquirer's eye.

But Michael Rosenbloom, the Montreal businessman who owns The Globe, became concerned that the  Justice Department would investigate the potential for monopoly control -- as indeed the Justice Department did briefly when Mr. Callahan bought Star from Rupert Murdoch in 1990. That investigation was fruitless. **********The purchase comes at a time of growth and change for The Enquirer: the tabloid is trying to change its image under its new ownership. In February of this year, Evercore bought The Enquirer and Star for $294 million from its joint owners, Boston Ventures and MacFadden Holdings Inc., and hired David J. Pecker, the former president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines, to be the chief executive of American Media. **********At American Media, Mr. Pecker's goal, along with his partners at Evercore, has been to extend The National Enquirer brand to an array of new ventures that may include more television programming, new magazines -- including The Enquirer spinoffs for teenagers and Hispanic readers -- and online services. Mr. Pecker has overseen a redesign by the same designer who has redesigned The New Republic and has introduced an advertising campaign intended to portray The National Enquirer as a respected source of news on celebrities. **********There is a potential for conflict among the staffs of the tabloids, said an executive familiar with the personnel at both companies. Whenever staff members are dismissed at The National Enquirer or Star, the executive said, many of them would just ''go down the road'' and get a job at The Globe; all three newspapers are currently based in Lantana, Fla. **********Philip Murray, a vice president at Dirks Van Essen, a newspaper brokerage company in Santa Fe, N.M., said the deal would broaden American Media's demographic reach. **********''You are getting a spectrum of different readers so you can go to advertisers and offer them the range of demographics or a specific demographic,'' he said. The Enquirer, Star and The Globe ''were fighting in the same space. If you control the content of all three, you can tailor them so they reach different people,'' then sell advertisers either the combined audience or one segment of it. **********Leslee Dart, a public-relations executive at PMK, a firm that manages the images of celebrities like Tom Cruise, said that celebrities would just have to contend with the new gossip configuration. **********''And, by the way, I've always felt it was better to have all your enemies contained in one spot,'' Ms. Dart said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/09/business/markets-market-place-breakup-microsoft-possibly-but-investors-shrug-it-off.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1999-11-09", "snippet": "Investors shrug off possibility that Microsoft Corp may have to break up in light of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's finding that company is a monopoly; Microsoft's stock falls $1.625 a share, to close at $90, which is more than $87 a share reache...", "word_count": 1004, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: Market Place; A Breakup of Microsoft?

Indeed, the stock rose a bit on Oct. 20, 1997, when the department first said it thought Microsoft was acting illegally. Since then, the stock has risen 153 percent, and the company now has a market value of $464 billion. **********Still, Microsoft's shares had been somewhat stagnant in recent weeks as other technology stocks advanced. In a telephone interview yesterday, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said he thought the uncertainty about the judge's finding had been at least as damaging to the share price as the finding itself. **********Should the Justice Department prevail, there are numerous remedies it might seek, and it is not clear yet whether it would push for an extreme course of action like a breakup. But the two most prominent breakups on antitrust grounds -- those of the Standard Oil Company in 1911 and American Telephone & Telegraph at the end of 1983 -- offer reassurances for Microsoft holders. Both companies' shareholders profited greatly in the years following the breakups, as the parts turned out to be far more valuable than the wholes had been. **********Whether that would happen to Microsoft depends both on how the company would be broken up and on whether the extraordinary valuation investors now give it would extend to Microsoft's parts. **********Two types of breakups have been discussed. The first, and probably least likely, would create some number of companies to compete with each other, each with rights to develop and improve the Windows operating system for personal computers that has been the core of Microsoft's success. **********Such a move would immediately create competition in the market, and could lead to a rapid decline in prices for the system, with concomitant damage to the share prices of the companies involved. But as the various companies made their own changes to Windows, the benefits of standardization would be lost, and that remedy seems unlikely. **********The other type of breakup would be along product lines. One company would maintain responsibility for Windows. Another would develop and sell the application software such as Microsoft Office. The third could handle Internet applications. **********A section of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings of fact, to which relatively little attention was paid, may make that kind of breakup more likely. The judge cited evidence that Microsoft had charged I.B.M. more for Windows than it had charged other computer makers, and had offered to cut prices if I.B.M. stopped pushing Lotus SmartSuite, its rival to Microsoft Office. In the context of his finding that Microsoft had a monopoly in operating systems, that could justify a ruling against the company even without the judge's finding that Microsoft's incorporation of its Internet browser into its operating system was not made to benefit consumers. **********Such a breakup conceivably could be a boon to Microsoft shareholders. With two of the three new companies dominant in their areas, and the third perhaps getting an Internet stock valuation, it is easy to envision a combined value that could be sharply higher than current levels. **********Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, said, ''The feeling is that Microsoft will survive and that even if the worst came to pass, the parts would be worth more than the whole.'' **********Still, Mr. Goldman said, ''I think the market is being too optimistic, because this is a cloud that will hang over Microsoft for many months.'' **********The principal question of what the company might be worth is muddied by the extraordinary valuation Microsoft now commands. It trades at more than 50 times estimated profit for next year -- a figure presumably reflecting optimism that Microsoft will keep growing rapidly and that its profit margins will remain high. In its last fiscal year, its after-tax profit equaled 39.4 percent of revenue. **********While the stock market yesterday seemed hesitant to conclude that the judge's decision was particuarly bad for Microsoft, it was willing to bid up the prices of some Microsoft rivals that might fare better if a court order either broke up Microsoft or restrained what Judge Jackson called the company's use of its ''prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of Microsoft's core products.'' **********America Online, which has merged with Netscape, the maker of the Internet browser that competes with Microsoft's, rose $3.25 a share, to $149.75. Red Hat, a distributor of an operating system that competes with Windows, rose $16.375 a share, to $102.50, and Sun Microsystems, creator of the Java programming language, gained $2.25, to $111.8125. **********Microsoft's rebound after trading as low as $84.375 earlier in the day came on volume of 121.9 million shares, far higher than normal. David Readerman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, said the volume showed investors were reassessing, with some fleeing Microsoft and others seeing a buying opportunity. **********The most interesting variable, Mr. Readerman said, is to what degree Microsoft itself is buying its shares. ''Microsoft has $18 billion in cash and marketable securities -- it's like a nation's central bank defending its currency,'' he said. **********Mr. Maffei of Microsoft declined to say whether the company had bought back stock yesterday, saying it would stick to its practice of disclosing those figures quarterly. During the three months ended Sept. 30, it bought 12.1 million shares."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/27/business/company-news-sonoco-products-to-buy-packaging-business-from-acx.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-07-27", "snippet": "Sonoco Products Co to buy ACX Technologies Inc's flexible packaging business, part of ACX's Graphic Packaging Corp unit, for about $105 million in cash (S)", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SONOCO PRODUCTS TO BUY PACKAGING BUSINESS FROM ACX", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SONOCO PRODUCTS TO BUY PACKAGING BUSINESS FROM ACX", "body_text": " **********The Sonoco Products Company, a leading maker of industrial spools and tubes used in consumer goods, agreed to buy ACX Technologies Inc.'s flexible packaging business for about $105 million in cash, doubling the size of its flexible-packaging operations.

Like those exchanges, Island deals with brokerage firms, not individual investors, but its software offers a difference: automatically matching up orders from buyers and sellers without going through a dealer or trading floor. **********Island is a novice, though, in the regulatory labyrinth. ''We don't even know how much it will cost us to go through the S.E.C. process,'' said Edward J. Nicoll, chief operating officer of the Datek Online Holdings Corporation, which owns Island. ''We've guessed $10 million'' -- a figure that Island's 28-year-old president, Matthew Andresen, acknowledged making up out of the blue. **********As Americans gallop into the stock market seeking instant riches or retirement security, the basic trading machinery is also being made up on the fly. Driven by technology, upstarts like Island are luring trades away from Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange by offering nanosecond service and microscopic fees. Those older markets are fighting back, proposing longer trading hours, new rules and changes in their ownership structure aimed at making them more competitive. **********''This is not a revolution; it is an earthquake,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, a finance professor at Baruch College in New York. **********And the fault lines lead directly to the S.E.C., which is responsible for maintaining investor confidence in a marketplace that behind the scenes is changing almost beyond recognition. The agency must make sure that rapid change does not create new opportunities for fraud or conflicts of interest and that investors are not shortchanged amid the confusion. **********''This is a time of evolution and change,'' said Annette L. Nazareth, the agency's new director of market regulation. ''When you have those dynamics, you can't always predict what the next step will be.'' **********The scenarios range from a fragmented world of competing exchanges like Island, each catering to a different trading community, to a monolithic world where today's competitors have merged into a single network that trades foreign and domestic stocks around the clock. **********So far, regulators seem sure that whatever market model emerges will be cheaper, faster and fairer for all investors. But the agency's ad hoc approach to a changing marketplace has made it a lightning rod for Wall Street's frustration. **********''Regulators are having as tough a time as everybody else trying to figure out what their new priorities should be,'' said John Byrne, editor of The Trader, a Wall Street magazine. ''We all need to tread a little more carefully -- there's too much at stake, from the livelihood of market makers to the health of the nation's economy.'' **********Moreover, the same technology that has produced the market's structural earthquake has produced an explosion of Internet stock gossip and on-line investing, which themselves produce myriad opportunities for fraud. **********With Congress urging more attention to on-line abuses, Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, announced on May 4 that he was asking for enough new money to double his ''cyberforce,'' the 125-lawyer team devoted to policing the Internet. **********And the next day, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill requiring disclosure of on-line brokers' service records, raising the penalties for on-line fraud and increasing the five-year budget authorization for the S.E.C.'s Internet efforts. **********By contrast, little public attention has been paid to the agency's market regulation division -- though that ''is where the real changes are happening,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor. **********Island's application is just one of the novel issues pummeling the S.E.C. Others include proposals to extend trading hours on Nasdaq and the New York exchange and to convert the fractional stock quotes to dollars and cents. Nasdaq dealers want to collect fees for matching buyers and sellers, as Big Board floor specialists and computerized traders like Island do, and the Big Board is planning to acquire or build its own computerized system to compete with Nasdaq. **********Meantime, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, is wrestling over demands for trading halts in volatile Internet stocks. And the Big Board is looking for ways to enable traders to buy foreign stocks in Frankfurt in the morning and sell the same shares in New York in the afternoon. **********Some market participants trace the current tumult to two earlier S.E.C. initiatives. **********In mid-1996, the commission imposed new rules for handling customers' trading orders, after Nasdaq dealers were accused of fixing prices for over-the-counter stocks. Dealers were directed to display on Nasdaq's trading screens any superior prices they had posted on private trading networks like Island. **********Soon, the electronic communication networks' share of Nasdaq trading boomed. Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola & Thornton, a San Francisco investment bank, calculated that these networks handled nearly 29 percent of all Nasdaq trades the last three months of 1998. **********Then, in December, the S.E.C. adopted a new set of rules to govern electronic networks and other ''alternative trading systems.'' The rules allow the networks to apply to become exchanges, the marketplace equals of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. **********Island's application is the first test, and the commission is moving cautiously. After all, Ms. Nazareth said, approving a new exchange has not been done in 26 years. **********And Island is a controversial applicant, in part because a sister subsidiary, Datek Online, is an on-line broker catering to day traders -- individuals who speculate on short-term stock positions -- who have prompted so much regulatory concern. Mr. Nicoll said Island would be well insulated from Datek's brokerage business. **********A Police Force On the Lean Side **********A pending investment by Waterhouse Investor Services, a unit of  Toronto-Dominion Bank, will put $25 million in Island's coffers, adding to the fraction of a penny it gets for each trade. And as an exchange, Island would get a share of the millions of dollars investors pay for up-to-the-minute stock prices. But it would also take on the costly job of policing its members to prevent insider trading and other misbehavior. **********The N.A.S.D. has a 200-member staff and a $60 million budget devoted to market regulation, and the Big Board's internal police force accounts for roughly a third of its 1,500-member staff. **********Mr. Andresen said Island would do its duty by being innovative -- for example, it may hire outside accountants to audit its member brokerage firms, at the firms' expense. **********Without commenting on Island's status, Ms. Nazareth warned that some electronic networks might not fully grasp ''what it is going to entail when you get to the nitty-gritty of being an exchange.'' Her deputy, Robert L. D. Colby, added, ''Doing self-regulatory oversight on the cheap is not going to be sufficient.'' **********Many market experts say that in hindsight the S.E.C. should have envisioned the need for a single self-regulatory police force in a market composed of private, for-profit operations like Island. **********As it turned out, that issue is just now climbing up the agency's agenda: the N.A.S.D. is considering spinning off its regulatory arm into just such a free-standing entity -- but it proposes doing so in conjunction with a plan to become a for-profit corporation. That initiative, which could  essentially make the Nasdaq market into a Nasdaq stock, got an informal nod from Mr. Levitt last week, but its implementation is at best months away, given the deliberative pace of the agency's rule-making process. **********If the regulatory gait is measured, the pace of reinvention is accelerating so fast that market executives are starting to compare it to the convulsive changes that began on May 1, 1975, when fixed brokerage commissions were abolished -- an event Wall Street calls ''May Day.'' **********Venerable but bloated firms found they could not survive on the thin commissions that mutual funds and other big investors demanded. Funds flourished as trading costs shrank, but they had to develop direct-to-consumer sales methods because stockbrokers became less interested in marketing their wares. Individuals, meanwhile, became a rich market for Charles Schwab and the other discount brokers born in this era. **********Wall Street Labels It 'May Day II' **********Today, with computers like Island's replacing many human relationships, Wall Street magazines like Institutional Investor and The Trader are talking about ''May Day II.'' **********Calling today's changes as significant as any that have occurred since the early 1930's, William R. Johnston, president of the New York Stock Exchange, drew knowing nods at a recent Wall Street conference when he said, ''Your competitors today may be your partners tomorrow, and your competitors tomorrow may not even exist today.'' **********How individual investors fare as all this unfolds will depend, in part, on how well the S.E.C. enforces rules that require brokers to give customers ''the best execution'' of trades -- traditionally, the best price. **********But even the definition of ''best execution'' has been muddied by new technology and the emergence of new marketplaces, with newcomers like Mr. Andresen arguing that the term should encompass the speed and certainty of a trade, not just the price. **********Poor execution can cost small investors far more than they save on low commissions, and on-line brokers sending orders to electronic networks are already generating complaints. **********In a speech last week, Mr. Levitt warned Wall Street that his staff was finding numerous instances of poor execution. The best-possible execution was ''not just good business practice; it's a legal obligation,'' he said. **********But disciplinary cases have been rare, perhaps because regulators ''are overwhelmed by some of the best-execution issues that have arisen in this new trading environment,'' Professor Coffee said. **********A Big Test For the S.E.C. **********Academic studies support the S.E.C.'s pride in how its order-handling rules have narrowed the spread between the prices at which Nasdaq stocks can be bought and sold. But Douglas M. Atkin, chief executive of Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group P.L.C. and the dominant private trading service, argues that the resulting market turbulence has made life difficult for large institutional investors, including pension accounts and mutual funds, which are most Americans' foothold in the market. **********''The S.E.C. has done a lot of good things for the retail investor trading 400 or 500 shares,'' Mr. Atkin said. ''What they need to take more into account, as market structure evolves, is that retail investors need a market that will work for them when they give their money to their mutual fund managers, too.'' **********Mr. Colby disputes that institutional investors are discontented. ''We have not heard any complaints,'' he said. But industry executives point out that interest from institutions is one engine driving the proliferation of alternative trading systems. **********Some critics say the S.E.C. should focus on protecting investors and let the market evolve. Others argue that investors cannot be protected in a market that is not fairly structured. **********But with so much at stake, it is clear that Wall Street is watching the S.E.C. carefully, particularly as it evaluates Island's application. ''It is a bit premature to grade them yet,'' Professor Coffee said. ''But this is the big exam.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/15/business/economic-scene-the-tax-bite-comes-with-saw-teeth.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-04-15", "snippet": "Economic Scene column on how US Government has made tax code numbingly complex, wasteful and irrational; says marginal tax rate--what people pay on last dollars earned--is supposed to rise in step with income; but many families actually face tax r...", "word_count": 1213, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economic Scene; The Tax Bite Comes With Saw Teeth", "print_headline": "Economic Scene; The Tax Bite Comes With Saw Teeth", "body_text": " **********It's April 15, time to complain about how taxes have become too high. And the House will vote once again today on a constitutional amendment that would require a two-thirds majority to pass future tax increases. But the real problem with the income tax system, many economists say, is not that the typical family pays too much tax but rather that Washington has made the tax code numbingly complex, wasteful and irrational. **********There are plenty of ways to collect the same amount of money from the same groups of taxpayers but with a fraction as much damage to the economy. One alternative has been offered by Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, who proposed an overhaul yesterday that would knock out needless complexity. **********There are good arguments for a flat  code that sets the same tax rate for nearly everyone. There are good arguments for a progressive code that raises tax rates as family incomes rise. **********But there is hardly anyone who thinks the rate structure of the existing code makes good sense. By statute, there are five tax brackets, ranging from 15 percent to nearly 40 percent. The marginal rate -- the highest rate that families pay on the last dollars earned -- is supposed to rise with income. But the rates that families actually pay are anything but smooth and predictable. Marginal rates jump up and down in chaotic fashion, in a pattern that Kevin Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, calls a ''skyline.'' **********The saw-toothed tax rates are a product of credits and deductions added to the code primarily in the 1990's -- only a few years after Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to simplify the code. These tax cuts impose high marginal rates, a bizarre fact that follows from Congressional attempts to limit the lost revenues from its tax cuts by phasing out credits and deductions as family income rises. Phasing out a tax cut raises the tax payments of a family as its income rises, in effect raising its marginal tax rate. **********Marginal rates matter because it is the tax on additional earnings that affects decisions by workers, especially spouses, to find paying jobs, seek higher-paying jobs, work overtime and save. Studies show that women are especially sensitive to marginal rates when deciding how much they will work outside the home. **********Multiple tax credits and deductions -- each with their own phase-out schedule -- produce Mr. Hassett's jagged skyline. The marginal rate starts out at 21 percent for some low-income families, drops to zero for certain kinds of families earning about $30,000, shoots back to over 40 percent for some families earning about $80,000, falls to 28 percent for families earning about $100,000 and continues in this seesaw pattern for wealthy families. **********Start with the earned-income tax credit, the jewel of the country's antipoverty program, which adds up to about $3,800 to the paycheck of low-paid workers. It begins to phase out at a family income of about $12,000, reducing family income by 21 cents for every extra dollar it earns. The child tax credit, passed in 1997 and now set at $500 for each child, begins to phase out at a family income of about $110,000. The $1,500 credit for the first two years of college tuition and the $1,000 credit for job training and graduate study passed in 1997 begin to phase out at about $80,000.  Deductions for interest on student loans start phasing out at about $60,000. Deductions for individual retirement accounts begin to phase out at about $50,000. **********The phasing out of these credits and deductions adds enormous complexity to the code. With complexity comes, says Prof. Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley, ''deception.'' He says that ''few families know how much tax they will owe on the income of a second earner because few know how all these phase-outs combine.'' **********Some of the marginal rates become quite high. A two-earner family with a income of around $100,000 pays about 40 cents of each extra dollar it earns in Federal income taxes. Add in Social Security, Medicare and state and local taxes and the rate can climb above 60 percent. **********The fact that the code imposes high marginal rates does not mean that it imposes high tax payments. Recall, the saw-toothed pattern of marginal rates reflects tax cuts passed in 1997 and earlier. Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail point to different statistics to buttress their accusation that tax payments have grown too heavy under President Clinton. Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase, passed over their opposition, has driven tax collections, as a share of the national economy, to their highest level in history except for a brief interval in World War II. **********But the accusation, Mr. Auerbach says, is misleading. For starters, the share of Federal tax revenues in national income bounces around but almost always hovers close to 20 percent. At 20.5 percent today, it is only modestly above the historical record. The rise has been fueled by taxes on capital gains created by soaring values on Wall Street as well as a shift in the share of income accounted for by wealthy families in the highest tax brackets. Moreover, Congress raised taxes in 1990 and 1993 to balance the budget. Yet even after these tax increases, Americans pay less Federal tax than the citizens of nearly any other industrialized economy. **********Moreover, the conventional wisdom about the tax burden is wrong, says Iris Lav of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. With the single exception of 1983, taxes on typical middle-income families have fallen to their lowest level in more than two decades. For many families, it would be necessary to go back even further. Mr. Auerbach and William Gale of the Brookings Institution estimate that a family of four in the middle of the income distribution ($55,000 in 1999) will pay about 7.5 percent of its income in Federal income taxes. That is the lowest tax rate since 1966.  Families at half the median are paying the lowest taxes since 1955. Even families at twice the median are paying the lowest tax since 1972. Only the rich are paying more tax. **********Mr. Auerbach echoes another criticism that economists of all political stripes level at the 1997 tax breaks. ''They are gratuitous, serving no important economic function.'' Mr. Hassett points to studies that predict that the tuition and job training tax credits, for example, will go to families that would pay for higher education without the Government's help. The credits are likely to do little more than encourage colleges to raise tuition and cut financial aid because their applicants have more money courtesy of Congress. **********Mr. Auerbach offers a sensible correction, reflected in part by Mr. Neal's bill. Even if Congress insists on preserving the package of 1997 tax credits and deductions, Mr. Auerbach says, it could apply them equally to everyone. Eliminating the phase-outs would eliminate the hills and valleys of Mr. Hassett's skyline. To pay for this reform and yet preserve a progressive tax code, Mr. Auerbach would raise the statutory rate on wealthier families. **********Phase-outs will not disappear easily. Yesterday, President Clinton proposed tax-deductible retirement accounts for low-  and middle-income families -- a new credit that, no surprise, he would phase out. Add another jag to Mr. Hassett's skyline."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/16/business/white-house-used-auditors-against-a-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Labaton", "pub_date": "1999-09-16", "snippet": "Senate Banking Committee report says White House enlisted help of regulators from the Office of Comptroller of Currency who were auditing banks to find bank executives who would join Clinton Administration in opposition to Republican financial leg...", "word_count": 1315, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "White House Used Auditors Against a Bill", "print_headline": "White House Used Auditors Against a Bill", "body_text": " **********The White House enlisted the help earlier this year of Federal regulators who were auditing banks to find bank executives who would join the Clinton Administration in opposing Republican financial legislation. **********The episode, which involved 36 Federal examiners -- who are supposed to work independently of partisan considerations -- and an unknown number of banks, was described today in a Senate report and confirmed by Clinton Administration officials. **********The report was prepared by the staff of the Senate Banking Committee at the direction of its chairman, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. Mr. Gramm has sponsored legislation, adopted by the Senate in May, that overhauls the nation's financial services industry. **********The measure, which the White House has said President Clinton would veto if the full Congress approves it, would take regulatory authority away from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a unit of the Treasury, and vest it instead with the Federal Reserve. It would also relax key elements of a 22-year-old law, the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages lending to minorities, farmers, poor neighborhoods and others historically denied access to credit. **********Internal E-mail messages and memorandums by officials included in the report show that regulators at the Comptroller of the Currency, which supervises 2,400 nationally chartered banks, attended a White House political strategy session last Dec. 14 concerning the legislation. Soon after the meeting, White House aides sent E-mail to top Washington officials in the Comptroller's office to assign specific areas of research. The officials then instructed bank examiners in field offices to seek testimonials from bankers about the Community Reinvestment Act. **********More than a dozen banks were contacted by the examiners; one soon complained to the staff of the Senate Banking Committee that the solicitations for positive comments were inappropriate, particularly coming in the middle of routine bank examinations. The bank said the requests put them in a difficult position: whether the adoption of a public position over the legislation might be a factor in their regulatory evaluations. The report did not identify which bank registered the complaint. **********After committee aides confronted the Comptroller's Office about the episode, regulators in Washington reversed their instructions to the examiners and rewrote the agency's policies and procedures manual to require that all agency employees have ''no communications with national banks that could be perceived as suggesting that the examination process is in any way influenced by political issues or considerations.'' **********Robert M. Garsson Jr., the top spokesman at the Comptroller's office, said the agency had ''made a mistake, but one that was made for the best of intentions.'' **********''It was not appropriate,'' Mr. Garsson said. ''The basic principle is that the examination process just must be kept free from politics.'' **********While the report said that the Comptroller's office had, with the assistance of examiners, compiled a list of 18 ''pro-C.R.A.'' bankers from 11 institutions, Mr. Garsson said that the examiners ultimately did not find any executives to speak on behalf of the Community Reinvestment Act. **********Patrick Dorton, the White House spokesman for the National Economic Council, said the episode was the result of ''an interagency policy discussion on the functioning of the C.R.A.'' **********''There was no intent or instruction for any inappropriate contacts to be made,'' he said. ''However, we recognize that greater care must be taken to prevent even the possibility of such an impression.'' **********But Mr. Gramm said the incident had demonstrated ''an incredible misuse of power.'' **********''It shows once again that the Clinton Administration corrupts everything,'' Mr. Gramm said today. ''They're like a sewer leak in the main water line. They pollute and corrupt everything by making everything political.'' **********The episode marks the second known instance in recent years in which banking regulators at the Comptroller's office were drawn into a political controversy. Three years ago, Federal banking regulators acknowledged that they should not have attended a coffee klatch held at the White House with some of the nation's most prominent bankers during the 1996 campaign. **********Arranged by the Democratic National Committee, that meeting was attended by President Clinton, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Secretary and the top fund-raiser for the Democratic Party. That meeting was one of several heavily criticized by Republicans and campaign finance reform advocates, who said that the Democratic Party improperly traded access for campaign donations. **********At the center of the latest controversy is the Community Reinvestment Act, which Mr. Gramm has criticized as unduly burdensome on banks, though some civil rights groups have said that by forcing institutions to lend to the under-served, the act has served as a cornerstone of ending discrimination in the economy. **********The use of the examiners occurred a few weeks after the White House made a recess appointment of John D. Hawke Jr. to serve as Comptroller after the Senate had refused to act on his nomination. Mr. Hawke's recess appointment expires later this year, though he has been nominated to serve through the end of the Administration. His nomination has been delayed in large part because of the banking committee's investigation into the use of the examiners to find executives who favor the Community Reinvestment Act. **********Mr. Gramm and Senate aides said that there was little evidence to indicate Mr. Hawke was involved in the political use of the examiners and that he acted promptly to stop the practice as soon as he learned of it. Mr. Gramm said that Mr. Hawke would most likely be approved for confirmation by the Senate banking committee later this month, though Senate aides also noted that when he served as Treasury Undersecretary, Mr. Hawke had attended the 1996 White House coffee meeting with the Democratic fund-raisers, bankers and regulators. **********The internal communications at the Comptroller's office show that some officials were sensitive to the use of bank examiners to further a political fight. In one E-mail, for instance, a top official balked about attending political strategy sessions, and in another, an agency lawyer wrote to another official that ''we need to be careful to not be perceived to be in cahoots with WH political strategizing.'' **********During the third week in December, after a meeting at the White House, an official at the White House's National Economic Council sent E-mail to 22 top officials at the Treasury, the Comptroller's office and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans. Under the heading ''C.R.A. success stories,'' the E-mail said the comptroller's office would be taking the lead and should ''identify list of bankers willing to make statements in support of C.R.A.'' **********On Jan. 13, officials at the Comptroller's office instructed national bank examiners ''for a short list of bankers that would most likely say positive things'' about the act. **********Two days later, on Jan. 15, in response to a question about the request, Chris Lewis, a senior adviser to the Comptroller, wrote an E-mail to Dave Hammaker, a Deputy Comptroller for Compliance Operations, suggesting that the request for the examiners was being pressed by the Treasury Department **********''I am, personally, not wholly comfortable with the request,'' Mr. Lewis wrote. ''But the Comptroller would like us to be responsive to the Department request (within measure).'' **********Then on Jan. 29, executives from a large bank that the report did not identify contacted the Senate Banking committee to complain that while the bank was undergoing an examination, examiners had sought names of bank officers that the agency could cite publicly as supporters of the Community Reinvestment Act. After being contacted by the staff of the committee, the agency said the project was ''undoubtedly inappropriate,'' according to the report. **********On Feb. 5, the Comptroller issued a memorandum saying that ''contacts we may have with a national bank through the examination process concerning legislative or political issues might be misperceived as implying that the bank should take a particular position on such issues. **********''Accordingly,'' the memorandum continued, ''it is imperative that no communications be made with the banks we supervise that could be perceived as suggesting that the examination process is in any way colored by political considerations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/16/news/group-alleges-us-hid-enemies-use-of-slave-labor-55-years-on-pows-sue.html": {"writer_name": "Mitchell Martin", "pub_date": "1999-09-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1042, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Group Alleges U.S. Hid Enemies' Use of Slave Labor : 55 Years On, POWs Sue Japan", "print_headline": "Group Alleges U.S. Hid Enemies' Use of Slave Labor : 55 Years On, POWs Sue Japan", "body_text": " **********NEW YORK\u2014                     A group of Americans held captive in Japan during World War II are suing five companies they accuse of using them as slave laborers, citing declassified U.S. documents that they say were \"deliberately kept from public scrutiny\" for half a century. **********The class-action civil lawsuit, filed in the U.S. district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, names Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsui & Co., Mitsubishi International Corp., Nippon Steel Corp. and Showa Denko KK. It was brought by 11 U.S. veterans on behalf of themselves and other American citizens they said were compelled to perform slave labor. **********Representatives of the veterans said that up to 500 former prisoners had expressed interest in joining the action and that the suit could eventually cover thousands of former military and civilian prisoners of war and their survivors and run into tens of millions of dollars. The suit does not ask for a specific amount of payments but does say the compensation would be in excess of $75,000 per plaintiff. Several of the veterans said at a news conference Tuesday that they also sought apologies, and they detailed instances of torture and abuse that they said they had suffered. **********The action seeks payments on several grounds: for breaches of international law, including the Geneva Conventions and the International Labor Organization Treaty of 1930; for back wages for stolen labor and repayment of profits earned from it; and as compensation for injuries caused by such acts as beatings. **********The Japanese companies were unaware of the suit, which was filed Monday, until the veterans announced it Tuesday in New York. Spokesmen for Mitsui and Mitsubishi International, the American subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp., said they did not think the suit applied to them. A Mitsubishi representative said his organization was a trading company that had never had manufacturing operations, while a spokeswoman for Mitsui said the company had been formed after the war and was not a descendant of the prewar conglomerate of that name. **********Besides the issue of corporate identity, it is not clear if the veterans have standing to bring their suit. Treaties ending a war generally set the terms of reparations, but the class-action suit targets corporations rather than the government. Eli Warach, a lawyer in Hackensack, New Jersey, who represents the veterans, said the newly declassified documents made clear that the companies had asked the Japanese government for laborers who were used as slaves. **********Mr. Warach made a distinction between uncompensated and abusive slave labor and forced labor, which he said was covered under the ILO Treaty. He said the companies had specifically asked for Caucasians, who were thought to be highly skilled, and that prisoners from other Allied countries also suffered under similar conditions. Other companies also were involved, he said, but the five defendants were the most egregious examples the veterans could find. **********David Leebron, dean of the Columbia University Law School, said he thought the suit was crafted in a way that would allow it to be heard. **********\"It gets around some of the most basic problems such as whether the treaty ending the war prohibited these claims,\" he said, adding, \"Even if the claims are relatively weak from a legal point of view, they may be enough of concern both on the law and the public-relations aspect of them to suggest some settlement by the companies.\" **********Mr. Warach said the State Department was not consulted before the suit was filed. The U.S. government had discouraged the veterans from pursuing their claims since 1945, he said, forbidding them to discuss their captivity. **********Melvin Routt, 77, one of the veterans, said that after he was freed from captivity he was interrogated by Marine officers and ordered to sign a document forbidding him to disclose any information about what happened during his imprisonment unless he obtained government permission. **********On Monday, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed four class-action lawsuits filed against Degussa AG and Siemens AG over slave-labor issues, saying for a court to \"structure a reparations scheme would be to express the ultimate lack of respect\" for the U.S. government leaders who ratified postwar treaties that dealt with the issue."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/23/business/world-business-briefing-world-trade-brazil-on-line-banking.html": {"writer_name": "Simon Romero", "pub_date": "1999-07-23", "snippet": "Agreement is reached between Banco do Brasil and ZAZ, Internet provider owned by Spanish company Telefonica SA, to provide bank's clients with limited free Internet access to promote on-line banking; accord gives Banco do Brasil and ZAZ clients fi...", "word_count": 91, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRAZIL ON-LINE BANKING", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: WORLD TRADE; BRAZIL ON-LINE BANKING", "body_text": " **********An agreement was reached between Banco do Brasil and ZAZ, the Internet provider owned by the Spanish company Telefonica S.A., to provide the bank's clients with limited free Internet access to promote on-line banking.

And as the negotiators packed up and left New Zealand last night, Mr. Clinton's aides appeared mystified by China's strategy. **********''No one is quite certain what this is all about,'' one of Mr. Clinton's top economic aides said, wondering aloud whether the Chinese were posturing, delaying, or had decided that a quickly declining economy at home made this a bad time for Mr. Jiang to allow fierce foreign competition into China's markets. Most theories, however, center on the how China may be seeking to parlay the accidental American bombing of their embassy in Belgrade on May 7 into some valuable trade concessions from the White House. **********From the start, the negotiations over the conditions for China to enter the World Trade Organization have been about far more than trade. Its entry is one of the few areas where the United States and China can claim real progress in a relationship hurt by differences over Taiwan's future, charges of spying, and longstanding arguments over human rights. **********Mr. Clinton argues that further integrating China into the world economy will force it to operate under global rules, and that if the deal is good enough he can demonstrate the economic benefits for American farmers and workers. Thus, Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Jiang in Auckland was carefully stage-managed to allow both sides to announce a resumption of relations after the embassy bombing. **********Both Chinese and American officials described their meeting on Saturday as surprisingly free of rancor, and that China sought no further apologies for the embassy bombing that killed three people. **********Two weeks before the meeting, Mr. Clinton sent a letter to Mr. Jiang urging that the two men use the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting here to resume negotiations. The message was reinforced by Senator Diane Feinstein, the California Democrat, who saw Mr. Jiang on a visit to China and told him that if China wanted to get Congressional approval of the deal, he had to act quickly. **********''There's an assumption that if Congress can't get this passed before the Presidential election is in sight, it's pretty hopeless,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said earlier this week. Next year Mr. Clinton's aides are unlikely to engage in a divisive argument over trade that could once again split the Democratic Party, and further widen a rift between Vice President Al Gore and American labor unions, which are opposed to the deal. **********''The Chinese understand the calendar,'' Mr. Daley said. **********They may understand it, but they do not appear driven by it. A round of preliminary negotiations in China last week, and then a second round here between China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, and American Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, never engaged in the substance of the issues dividing the two countries. Those range from American quotas on Chinese textiles, to the rights of foreign auto makers to enter China's markets, to the rules that ban the ''dumping'' of Chinese goods in the United States. **********Even after Mr. Clinton implored Mr. Jiang at their Saturday meeting to start serious negotiations the next morning, the talks wandered in circles, participants say, drifting into differing understandings of what the two sides had already settled in April. In a private aside, Mr. Clinton raised the issue again with Mr. Jiang on Monday. **********Mr. Clinton's efforts to implore the Chinese back to the table is a sharp reversal from April, when he walked away from a deal offered during an official visit to Washington by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji. At the time he said it was insufficient, although American businesses said they were astounded at the breadth of concessions Mr. Zhu was willing to make at the time. When he returned to China Mr. Zhu was harshly criticized for giving away too much, particularly in telecommunications and agriculture. It is now unclear whether Mr. Zhu's concessions are still on the table, and many in the White House -- including Mr. Clinton himself, some officials say -- now regard the rejection of the deal in April as a mistake. **********The head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, sidestepped questions about the talks, telling reporters that ''we've decided there is little to be gained by negotiating in public.'' Other officials spent much of the day yesterday insisting that they never expected a deal would be signed here -- even though several top Administration officials had told reporters, just a few weeks ago, that the talks could be wrapped up in days. **********The turn of events has put Mr. Sperling, Ms. Barshefsky and Mr. Clinton in an extraordinarily difficult position. All week they appeared to be more eager for China to get into the World Trade Organization than the Chinese are. That is a reversal from April, when China was pressing for admission, and the United States appeared to be insisting on ever-greater concessions. **********American officials insist that they will not lower their demands for market openings simply because of the bombing. ''It's a strategy I would try as well,'' one top official involved in the negotiations said today, ''but in the end it won't work. And if it keeps us from getting a deal through Congress, it could backfire.'' **********Nonetheless some American officials concede that Mr. Clinton would probably take a deal that was only slightly better than what he walked away from in April.

The gains proved evanescent -- I.B.M. shares lost $5.7 billion of the gain on Friday and Starbucks' value fell about $216 million by the end of the week -- but wealth was created nevertheless. **********Investors can be forgiven for embracing the Internet, because it is, indeed, changing the way things work.

Buffett pointed this out on May 3 at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting.

But while they are wonderful businesses, Mr. Buffett said, they have proven to be lousy investments. **********Even as I.B.M. and Starbucks were enriching shareholders by laying claims to Internet status, news from the Web was not all upbeat.

It closed the day at $60, but fell off to $46.25 on Friday. **********Cooler heads prevailed in two Wednesday offerings. Careerbuilder Inc., an on-line job recruiter, went public at $13 and closed the week at $14.25, up 9.6 percent from the offering.

Regulators filed charges against 8 companies and 18 individuals, and warned that the S.E.C.'s ''cyberforce'' would bring more cases. Would-be Net fraudsters might want to reconsider their plans over a strong cup of Starbucks coffee. **********Back at the cafe, it is intriguing to note that even as Starbucks was planning its Internet foray, insiders at the company were busy selling shares. Through April, according to First Call, insiders sold 1.44 million shares; in all of 1998 they sold 2.4 million. **********A Starbucks spokesman said that diversification was behind the insider stampede, not skepticism about the Web strategy.

Yet such companies are sometimes shunned by short-term traders seeking a  quick buck; they buy companies that reduce their R. & D. budgets in favor of reporting  higher earnings immediately. **********While undervaluing research is worrisome at any time, it is particularly serious in today's technology-driven economy. In the computer software sector, for example, the average R. & D. outlay amounts to 17 percent of a company's total sales and two times its earnings. A failure to value R. & D. correctly can lead to a major mispricing of a company's stock. **********But perhaps that isn't happening. According to a new study by Louis K. C. Chan, Josef Lakonishok and Theodore Sougiannis, professors at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, there seems to be no evidence that the market penalizes companies that invest in R. & D. **********For each year from 1975 to 1995, the researchers divided stocks into two groups. The first group consisted of companies that reported R. & D. expenditures that year; the second was composed of those companies that did not. The professors then tracked the subsequent three-year performance of each group. **********Through mid-1998, on average, the three-year annualized return of the companies spending money on R. & D. was 19.65 percent, statistically indistinguishable from the  19.50 percent return for the others. **********So the professors think that investors, over all, neither overvalue nor undervalue research spending. Of course, some investors may be shunning companies that invest in research because of the stocks' higher price-to-earnings ratios. But the effect is evidently balanced by other investors who look below the surface and see the potential value of companies' research. **********Although the professors give the stock market a passing grade on this subject, they found one subset of companies whose R. & D. expenditures seemed to be systematically undervalued: those companies that trade at low price-to-book multiples -- and are therefore often considered value stocks. **********In this subset, the professors found that companies that invested heavily in R. & D. outperformed those that didn't by nearly 8 percentage points, annualized, through mid-1998. That is an impressive amount, given that value stocks in general have historically outperformed the market anyway. **********EVIDENTLY, the stock market fails to recognize that when the management of such companies spends big amounts on research, it is a bullish signal. After all, such managers are often under intense pressure to reduce their spending on research, thus increasing short-term earnings and helping to raise the stock price. To invest in R. & D. under those conditions speaks of extreme confidence on management's part. **********The professors have a hypothesis about why the market does such a poor job valuing such stocks: ''R. & D.-intensive firms who are past losers become 'orphaned' stocks with no natural underlying investor clientele,'' the study said. **********Growth investors, for example, tend to shun such market laggards. And because those stocks still look expensive according to the conventional valuation criteria, value-oriented investors aren't likely to buy them, either. **********Such stocks fall through the cracks -- the ideal condition for market mispricing. **********In short, R. & D. spending alone doesn't tell investors much about a stock's prospects. But examining that spending in conjunction with a stock's price-to-book multiple can yield a powerful indicator of future performance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/17/business/company-news-markel-to-buy-terra-nova-another-specialty-insurer.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-08-17", "snippet": "Markel Corp will acquire Terra Nova Holdings Ltd for cash and stock valued at $905 million; will assume $175 million in Terra Nova debt (S)", "word_count": 114, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MARKEL TO BUY TERRA NOVA, ANOTHER SPECIALTY INSURER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; MARKEL TO BUY TERRA NOVA, ANOTHER SPECIALTY INSURER", "body_text": " **********In a deal that would combine two big specialty insurance companies, the Markel Corporation said yesterday that it would acquire Terra Nova Holdings Ltd. for cash and stock valued at $905 million.

Together, Vodafone and Bell Atlantic -- along with GTE once it completes its merger with Bell Atlantic next year -- would have more than 20 million customers, compared with AT&T's 11 million. **********''Instantly what this means is that AT&T isn't the big kid on the block anymore,'' said David Berndt, an associate director of the wireless communications group at the Yankee Group, a research firm. ''They won't always be the one everyone is trying to follow.'' **********Working under the code names of ''Beta'' for Bell Atlantic, ''Alpha'' for Vodafone and ''Gamma'' for GTE, it took executives and advisers five weeks to come up with the type of transaction that Bell Atlantic sought when it tried to acquire Airtouch Communications earlier this year. Bell Atlantic lost Airtouch to Vodafone, which paid $60 billion for the San Francisco concern. For Vodafone, an agreement with Bell Atlantic helps cement its position as a truly global wireless player. **********More consumers these days depend on cellular phones both at home and abroad, and companies are hoping to capitalize on that trend. Cellular phone use is expected to be one of the fastest-growing segments in telecommunications, with use expected to grow fivefold over the next five years, according to the Yankee Group. It was tough to find anyone on Wall Street who did not like yesterday's news. But a few critics said Vodafone might have paid too much for Airtouch to end up walking away with only a minority share in the United States business. **********Still, Jeffrey Kagan, a telecommunications analyst based in Atlanta, said: ''We tend to look at these announcements individually; but if you pull the camera back, the way we communicate everything is changing. Wireless is at the heart of that.'' **********Already several telecommunications companies have either announced acquisitions or joint ventures to expand their networks. AT&T and British Telecommunications P.L.C. said last week that they would be partners in a venture to expand wireless service globally. The Voicestream Wireless Corporation, which has a presence in the Western United States, recently agreed to buy the Omnipoint Corporation and Aerial Communications, giving it a presence in the East. Further, MCI Worldcom had discussions earlier this year with Nextel Communications, but those talks fell apart over price. **********The scramble for wireless customers is one reason Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, called Bell Atlantic's chairman, Ivan Seidenberg, last April to propose teaming up in the United States, Mr. Gent said. The two met several times in July when Mr. Gent was in New York. But it was not until a dinner in early August that the two, along with GTE's chief executive, Charles Lee, proposed the framework for a joint venture. **********Mr. Gent was willing to concede on some issues, he said, including who would control the combined company: Bell Atlantic will own 55 percent of the entity, while Vodafone will own the rest. But Mr. Gent also brought his own set of expectations to the table, such as protecting job commitments he made to Airtouch executives during those merger talks. **********Once a basic framework was agreed to, they and their advisers worked out the details. The new company will be based in New York, with a seven-member board. Mr. Seidenberg, Mr. Gent and, if the GTE merger with Bell Atlantic is completed, Mr. Lee, will all be members. Bell Atlantic will nominate the chief executive of the combined company and Vodafone will nominate the chief financial officer. Vodafone too has an important out. It can sell its shares if the company decides to go public three years after the deal closes. The companies expect to complete the transaction in the next 6 to 12 months. **********And what did the two companies decide to name their new venture? Nothing -- as of yet. As the affable Mr. Gent candidly put it, ''I couldn't convince Ivan to take Vodafone Airtouch.'' **********More to the point, Mr. Seidenberg countered, a smile sliding across his face, ''It would have cost you a lot.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/12/business/m-r-shugrue-58-who-tried-to-save-airlines.html": {"writer_name": "Agis Salpukas", "pub_date": "1999-03-12", "snippet": "Martin R Shugrue Jr, airline executive who played pivotal and at times controversial role in unsuccessful attempts to keep Pan American World Airways and, later, Eastern Airlines from failing, dies at age 58; photo (M)", "word_count": 738, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Obituary; Biography", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "M.

Shugrue Jr., an airline executive who played a pivotal and at times controversial role in unsuccessful attempts to keep Pan American World Airways and, later, Eastern Airlines from failing, died on Sunday. He was 58 years old. **********Mr. Shugrue died at his home in Houston of a stroke, a spokesman for the family said. **********A gregarious executive who had a knack for getting along with union leaders and the rank and file, Mr. Shugrue was appointed trustee of the troubled Eastern Airlines in April 1990 by Judge Burton R. Lifland. The step was front-page news because Judge Lifland took control of the airline away from its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, who had tried to get the company out of bankruptcy but had racked up losses of $1.2 billion. **********The losses and Mr. Lorenzo's confrontational style with the unions cost Eastern the support of creditors, but the judge was determined to revive the airline. **********Mr. Shugrue, whom Mr. Lorenzo had discharged from his post as president of Continental Airlines, relished the chance he was given. With a big ego and a flair for dramatic moves, Mr. Shugrue followed the example of Lee A. Iacocca, who had used a splashy television campaign as part of his strategy for turning Chrysler around in the 1980's. **********That June, Mr. Shugrue, nervous, clutching two packs of Camels, shot a series of television commercials in which skeptical business travelers asked him why they should fly Eastern when continuing labor strife and huge losses made them unsure of its safety. Mr. Shugrue bravely asserted that despite three years of labor and financial turmoil the airline had not had one serious incident. ''Not one,'' the trim former Navy aircraft carrier pilot said firmly. **********For a time the national campaign increased bookings and persuaded some business travelers to give the airline another chance, particularly since they could get a first-class seat by paying full coach fare. But the airline could not stem its losses, and some unions continued to question its safety and maintenance procedures. **********Then the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990 sent jet fuel prices soaring, and the losses deepened. Still, Mr. Shugrue had the support of Judge Lifland, who continued to release tens of millions of dollars from an escrow fund to keep the airline flying. Mr. Shugrue even persuaded the court to increase his salary from $425,000 a year to $600,000, arguing that his pay should be more in line with executives of other major airlines -- a move for which he was widely criticized. **********By January 1991, even Judge Lifland acknowledged that there was no hope for the carrier. Mr. Shugrue began to sell off its assets. **********Even after liquidating Eastern, Mr. Shugrue could not give up his dream of building an airline. He put up some of his own money and with other investors raised more than $40 million to restart Pan Am, which he had tried to turn around in the 1980's before it was liquidated. The revived Pan Am flew two of the most heavily traveled and competitive routes in the nation -- New York-Los Angeles and New York-Miami. **********Mr. Shugrue's plan was to rely on the Pan Am name and to offer quality service at lower fares. The carrier attracted passengers, and at first its stock price soared. The fares were too low to make a profit, however, and Pan Am filed for bankruptcy in February 1998. The airline continues to operate as a charter. **********Mr. Shugrue was born in Providence, R.I., and graduated from Providence College. After serving in the Navy as a pilot, he joined Pan American World Airways in 1968 and rose through the ranks. But the airline itself was losing money. **********When Edward Acker was brought in in 1981 to help revive Pan Am, he hired outside executives but kept Mr. Shugrue, who was made vice chairman in 1984 and chief operating officer in 1985. The two had a falling-out late in 1987, however, when Mr. Acker tried to sell the airline. Mr. Shugrue opposed him and tried to keep it independent, winning further concessions from the unions. The board asked both executives to resign in January 1988. **********Mr. Shugrue is survived by his wife, Marianne, and their two children, Marika and Martine, of Houston, and by two children, Catherine, of Brooklyn, and Michael, of Roselle Park, N.J., from his marriage to Eleanor Dalton, who is deceased. He is also survived by his father, Martin R. Shugrue of Providence, three sisters and two brothers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/23/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-361607.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-04-23", "snippet": "Andy Fenning is named to new position of chief learning officer at J Walter Thompson Co; Nancy Rice is named to new post of co-deputy executive creative director at Ogilvy & Mather Chicago (S)", "word_count": 103, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; People", "body_text": " *********** Andy Fenning was named to the new position of chief learning officer at J.

''Then I said, 'Hey, I got a policy with those folks.' It was kind of a shock. I thought, 'This dude has gone and swindled off all the money and some of us are going to be left out in the cold.' '' **********Mr. Holmes, a former police officer in nearby Pearl, is one of the tens of thousands of policyholders in Mississippi and neighboring states wondering just how badly they are going to be hurt by a huge fraud that authorities say was pulled off by Martin R. Frankel, a reclusive money manager in Greenwich, Conn. Several hundred million dollars is missing from insurers controlled by Mr. Frankel, who Federal law enforcement officials say may have fled to Europe. **********For years, Mr. Holmes and most of the others have made small monthly payments on policies worth a few thousand dollars to cover their burial costs. Regulators have assured them that their benefits will eventually be paid. But with the looted companies out of money, many are concerned. **********''I prayed about it last night, and the church prayed for all the policyholders,'' said Kitty Ruth Lowry, a 62-year-old widow with two policies on herself and one on her son. **********Even George Dale, the Insurance Commissioner in Mississippi, whose staff first discovered irregularities at Mr. Frankel's three companies in the state -- the Franklin Protective Life Insurance Company, the Family Guaranty Life Insurance Company and the First National Life Insurance Company of America -- betrays some reservations, saying he is ''99 percent certain'' that policyholders will be made whole. **********Mr. Dale said he could think of nothing specific that might get in the way but that ''nothing in life is certain.'' **********Gordon Rusty Haydel, executive director of the Mississippi Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association, an industry group responsible for guaranteeing payment of insurance benefits, is preparing to put a levy on the more than 640 life insurers doing business in the state to make up the losses of the Frankel companies, which have been seized by regulators. **********As many as 300 policyholders may have died in Mississippi since the three companies were seized in early May and stopped paying claims, Mr. Haydel said. But he and Mr. Dale said they knew of no burials delayed for lack of insurance money. **********Most policies in Mississippi used to pay burial costs are sold through funeral homes, which have been honoring the policies. **********''I'm guaranteeing my people, they won't lose,'' said Steve Holland, owner of Lee Memorial Funeral Home in Tupelo. ''I know the state guaranty fund is ultimately going to pay. I'm trying to keep pandemonium and bedlam from breaking out with my customers. **********''In many cases, I placed their money with Franklin Protective. So I feel bad. My customers feel bad. But I'm reassuring them that I'm not going to let them lose.'' **********Sheila Gates, a former agent for Franklin Protective Life, said the funeral homes were usually better known than the insurers. Burial insurance salespeople, she said, often begin a pitch by saying, ''I'm representing so and so funeral home.'' **********Small policies intended to pay burial costs are sold in most states, including New York. But advocates for consumers generally advise against them, noting they can be up to 10 times as expensive as term insurance. They are popular with low-income people, featuring monthly payments often less than $20 for up to $5,000 of coverage. **********Insurance with better rates rarely comes in such small amounts, and the bigger, more economically efficient policies require larger premiums, often paid annually, which many people find beyond their reach. **********Companies specializing in burial insurance charge higher rates, experts say, because their costs are higher. Even though agents in Mississippi work out of funeral homes, they often sell policies door to door and some still personally make monthly collections. With few exceptions, like people who acknowledge they are infected with the AIDS virus, coverage is available to all comers. **********''If a man can fog a mirror -- if he's breathing -- he can usually buy this kind of insurance,'' said Harland Dyer, actuary for the Mississippi Insurance Department. **********In Mississippi and much of the South, burial insurance is a matter of culture, tradition and rock-bottom economics. People of modest means say they take special comfort in knowing that no matter how bad things get, they can always pay their final expenses. **********''I don't want my kids to have to put out anything to bury me,'' said Van Robinson Kersh, who is retired from a box factory and now works part time at a funeral home. **********For many, this is the only insurance they have, their ties to the insurers among the few constants in life. **********''I could call and ask them anything and they would give me an answer,'' said Frances Thornell, a 70-year-old widow with two policies on herself from a Frankel company and several on her children and grandchildren. ''I'm just speechless.'' **********Regulators have advised policyholders to keep making their monthly payments so their policies do not lapse. But many find that difficult to accept. **********''Would you want to pay on something if you didn't know for sure it was going to be there for you?'' Mrs. Lowry asked. **********Mary Phillips, a retired furniture factory worker, said that every month when she helps her 85-year-old mother send off her insurance check, her mother tells her: ''Well, I can be buried for another month. You won't have to put me in a ditch.'' **********Ms. Philips said she has kept the news of trouble at Franklin Protective from her mother. ''It would be very, very stressful for her,'' she said. **********James Jack Robinson, who has made a small fortune in the funeral home business and four and a half years ago sold the company now known as Franklin Protective to a trust that investigators say was controlled by Mr. Frankel, said customers are often not aware that they can get much more insurance for their money. **********''Agents for the better-priced insurance don't go out and knock on doors,'' he said. **********Yet many around here say they would never think of buying anything but burial insurance. **********Mr. Holmes and his wife, Faye, who drives a pickup for a courier service, both have $5,000 policies that cost them $23 a month. Even if they could save up to make one annual payment for more coverage, Mr. Holmes said, they probably would not. **********''I was raised on this kind of insurance,'' he said. ''My father bought it. His father bought it.'' **********''In a way,'' he said, ''you overpay. But these low premiums are enticing to a person who's only got a certain amount of money coming in.'' **********To people here, Martin Frankel, the man who apparently made a fortune by looting their companies, is a hard-to-imagine faraway demon. If he is ever caught, they say, life in prison would be too kind. **********''I didn't realize anyone could be so cruel,'' said Mrs. Thornell, who struggles with respiratory problems. ''He must not have any feelings at all. I'm sure there are a lot of people like me living on Social Security and just able to pay for the insurance. Then some idiot like this comes and destroys us. It just drains you.'' **********Mr. Holmes said he would like to see Mr. Frankel face to face. **********''A lot of people,'' he said, ''would love to get hold of the old boy and shake him a little bit to see what kind of change fell out. But I guess it's best for the law to handle that.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/23/business/international-business-europe-phone-deal-clearly-a-work-in-progress.html": {"writer_name": "John Tagliabue", "pub_date": "1999-04-23", "snippet": "Deutsche Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer and Telecom Italia chief executive Franco Bernabe outline their shared vision for global telecommunications giant, but cannot offer details of hastily arranged $82 billion merger of their companies, news...", "word_count": 861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Europe Phone Deal: Clearly, a Work in Progress", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Europe Phone Deal: Clearly, a Work in Progress", "body_text": " **********The chief executives of the former telephone monopolies in Germany and Italy outlined their shared vision for a global telecommunications giant today, but could not explain how they would increase efficiency, conquer cultural barriers, penetrate the United States market or share management in their $82 billion merger. **********As Ron Sommer, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, and Franco Bernabe, chief executive of Telecom Italia, held a news conference to provide details of the biggest merger in European history, the full range of challenges in the hastily arranged deal became clear. The executives said they did not even have a name for their new company. **********''It will be neither Deutsch nor Italian, and it will be written with a 'c,' '' Mr. Sommer said, mixing German with English. **********The telephone companies reached a deal Wednesday that amounts to a Deutsche Telekom takeover of Telecom Italia, which has been looking for ways to thwart an unwanted $65 billion takeover from its main domestic rival, Olivetti. Undaunted, Olivetti is proceeding with its takeover attempt and will try to convince Telecom Italia shareholders it is the better choice. **********Although Mr. Sommer and Mr. Bernabe depicted their merger as a smart strategic move that made long-term sense, it was not Telecom Italia's first choice. The Italian phone company had first tried to stop the Olivetti bid by taking other steps that would have made Telecom Italia too expensive to buy, but it failed to get enough shareholder support and began negotiating intensively with Deutsche Telekom only in the last few weeks. **********Neither executive could explain in detail where billions of dollars in savings from reduced costs could come from. The merger also faces suspicion from the Italian Government, which dislikes the idea that 40 percent of the merged company will be owned by the German state. **********The new company would have 100 million customers in 26 countries around the world, dwarfing AT&T and ranking second in revenue only to the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation. But the value of greater size did not impress the shareholders of either Telecom Italia or Deutsche Telekom today. **********The German company's share price fell 2.2 percent, to 35.30 euros, or $37.41, and Telecom Italia's shares dropped by seven-tenths of a euro, to 9.84. **********On paper, the deal gives both companies some advantages. The companies said they expected pretax savings of $636 million by 2000, growing to $1.06 billion by 2003. In fixed-line services, networks would be consolidated and purchasing and product development pooled. In wireless phone service, network planning and monitoring would be consolidated and handset prices reduced. **********The reality is more complicated. As joint chief executives, Mr. Bernabe, 50, and Mr. Sommer, 49, will share management responsibility, but about all Mr. Bernabe could say about the division of labor was, ''When Ron goes skiing, I'll work, and vice versa.'' **********Because the new company would be incorporated in Germany, labor would be represented on its supervisory board, and the job of chairman would rotate annually between Germans and Italians. The combined company would operate dual headquarters in Rome and Bonn. **********Mr. Sommer said mobile phones would be the ''big driver'' of growth for the combined company, which would have 21.6 million subscribers, making it by far Europe's largest provider. The companies gained a million new subscribers in 1998. **********Yet they were unable to say how the companies would deal with the remaining 40 percent of shares in Telecom Italia's mobile phone unit that the company does not own. **********Both companies have bloated work forces, holdovers from the days when they were, in effect, state bureaucracies. Yet both executives insisted their vision was not about cutting jobs, but creating new ones. **********''We are not a declining industry,'' Mr. Bernabe said. ''We are an industry full of opportunities. We have efficiency problems, but this is not a story about job rationalization.'' **********The mechanics of the merger, which the companies hope to make a tax-free stock swap, also face significant regulatory scrutiny. Yet both executives emphasized how little overlap the companies have -- only five countries. **********Stickier will be the issue of existing alliances, including Global One, a Deutsche Telekom venture to sell corporate telecommunications services together with France Telecom and the Sprint Corporation. France Telecom executives have publicly expressed anger at Deutsche Telecom over the Telecom Italia deal, and have already told Deutsche Telekom it must quit a fixed-line venture, Wind, that the French and German companies operate in Italy with the national energy utility, Enel. **********But Mr. Sommer said the new merger was ''not intended against existing partners,'' like France Telecom. Indeed, he said, it could be an ''enhancement'' of ties like Global One. Telecommunications industry analysts have said that the German-Italian merger probably means the end of Global One. **********The German and Italian companies also know that the biggest blank spot on their map is the United States, the world's leading telecommunications market. **********''The United States is our next area of expansion,'' Mr. Bernabe said. ''This merger is clearly designed to increase competition in the world, not to reduce competition.'' **********Mr. Sommer, asked whether he was talking with Sprint executives, because of reports that the companies might consider Sprint an attractive acquisition target, replied: ''I'm on the board of Sprint.

''I don't think there was anything that was startling, unexpected or particularly dramatic,'' Representative Rick A. Lazio, a New York Republican on the House Banking Committee, acknowledged in an interview. **********There were, of course, casualties from two days of testimony before the House Banking Committee and one afternoon's worth before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. **********The chairman of The Bank of New York, Thomas A. Renyi, admitted that bank supervisors committed embarrassing lapses in oversight over nine accounts at the core of the investigation. Federal investigators say at least $4.2 billion, and perhaps $10 billion, in Russian money flowed through accounts controlled by the husband of a highly regarded bank officer who has now been dismissed. **********And the inquiry's probe into Bank of New York accounts in the Cayman Islands held by the son-in-law of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia raised new questions about the Kremlin's possible involvement in illicit activity. **********Corruption in Russia is an old story to many lawmakers and Administration officials, but when the Federal inquiry into the Bank of New York became public last month, it ignited long-simmering Republican criticisms of President Clinton's Russia policy. **********Top House Republicans like Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, revved up a new barrage of ''Who Lost Russia?'' accusations. **********But two things hampered Republicans who were hoping to reap political hay from the scandal and from criticisms that the Administration turned a blind eye to Kremlin corruption. First, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, Representative James A. Leach, an Iowa Republican, is a thoughtful moderate who immediately rejected the premise of Mr. Armey and Mr. DeLay. His tone throughout the hearings was probing, but not confrontational. **********Indeed, the toughest questions for Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers at the banking committee came from Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican who is not on the committee but was invited because of his Russia expertise. Faced with Mr. Weldon's heated accusations that the Administration had all but ignored the Russian Parliament in favor of Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Summers did not deny the charge and promised closer attention would now be paid to the parliamentarians. **********Second, and even more surprising, was the demeanor of the Administration's sharpest foreign policy critic in the Senate, Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Instead of peppering Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott with tough questions, Mr. Helms quickly gave up, apparently in disgust, when Mr. Talbott sidestepped inquiries about American intelligence reports on Russian corruption and allegations of corruption against specific Russian officials. **********Senator Helms briefly took aim at Vice President Al Gore, and his relationship with the former Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. ''I confess deep concern that the policies pursued by President Clinton and Vice President Gore may have abetted corruption in Russia,'' Mr. Helms said. **********With round one of hearings behind them, Congress and the Administration are now backing rival legislation to combat money laundering and are offering tough rhetoric on restricting international aid to Russia. In fact,  the current requirements governing the release of $4.5 billion in aid from the International Monetary Fund allow installments to be disbursed only after several financial safeguards are met. Even then the money moves from one fund account to another and never actually enters the Russian banking system. **********''The debate now is over how to engage Russia more rationally,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. **********But is Congress engaged? Barely one-third of the members of the banking and international relations committees showed up for hearings that featured Mr. Summers, Mr. Talbott and Mr. Renyi, as well as former C.I.A. and K.G.B. spies, members of the Russian Parliament and a top United States law-enforcement official. **********One noted Russian expert told the Senate panel that official Washington has seized on the money-laundering investigation, but has largely ignored the larger issue of guiding Russia through its perilous transformation from Communist dictatorship to a free market democracy. **********''The point is not that we've misengaged Russia, but that we are disengaging from Russia,'' said Prof. Robert Legvold, a Russian specialist at Columbia University. **********If this trend continues unchecked, Professor Legvold warned, Russia could devolve into a ''failed state'' and ''a vortex of volatility and violence.'' **********In the coming weeks, lawmakers say they will be keenly watching the ongoing investigations by American, British, Swiss and Russian authorities. Some lawmakers expect dramatic developments. **********Other legislators reminded their colleagues that Russians are ultimately responsible for their own fate, and the United States and the West can only do so much. **********''What Russia needs is a Moses,'' said Representative Spencer T. Bachus 3d, an Alabama Republican on the banking panel.

The United States Embassy, several miles from the blast, was not involved. **********Nearly 20 hours after the 2 A.M. blast, officials said two deaths had been confirmed, but accounts circulating among diplomats put the toll  as high as nine. The officials said the two dead were Yemenis: a guard at the City Center supermarket, which appeared to have been the main target of the attack, and a guard at the offices of Canadian Occidental Petroleum, one of many foreign-owned companies in the area. **********Within hours, at least two other minor bombings were reported elsewhere in this nation of 16 million people, which is still struggling with the after-effects of a 1994 civil war and with other tensions, including sporadic violence by a radical Islamic group known as the Islamic Army. Earlier this month, an appeals court upheld a death sentence on the leader of the Islamic militants, Abu al-Hassan al-Mirdar, who has threatened reprisals by his followers if the sentence is carried out. **********In the southern port city of Aden, a blast that occurred before the Sana explosion slightly damaged the local headquarters of the state-owned National Bank, but apparently caused no injuries. And in Zinjibar, a town near Aden where Mr. Mirdar was tried, residents reported a blast in front of the prosecutor's office, again with no reported casualties. **********Officials in Sana, who claimed to have arrested several suspects in the blast there, said it was unclear whether there was any link between the explosions. **********A Cabinet minister, speaking privately, said the fact that the blasts were detonated at night -- and in the case of the Sana bombing, well after midnight -- suggested that they had been intended mainly as warnings, and not as means of causing large numbers of casualties. **********But officials acknowledged that the placing of the bomb outside a supermarket used by many diplomats and aid workers, including dozens of Americans, was probably not coincidental. Foreigners have been advised to increase security precautions in recent months in the wake of heightened tensions between the Government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and militant opponents. **********Much of the unrest has been among discontented tribal groups that have taken foreigners hostage to press demands for more Government spending. Usually, they release hostages unharmed, as they did this month after three French citizens, including two diplomats, were abducted in an area east of Sana. A spate of recent attacks has severely reduced tourism, which became one of the country's biggest income sources in the mid-1990's, as the chaos of the 1994 civil war receded. **********The most violent incident involving foreigners occurred in December, when the Islamic Army kidnapped 16 tourists on a desert highway, demanding that they be exchanged for a group of British and Algerian Muslims arrested in Aden on charges of planning a bombing campaign. In an ensuing shootout with Government forces, four tourists died, including two Britons, and Mr. Mirdar was captured."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/13/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-accounts-481807.html": {"writer_name": "Stuart Elliott", "pub_date": "1999-09-13", "snippet": "Recent advertising account changes noted (S)", "word_count": 227, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Accounts", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA;

'' campaign. But, said Mrs. Mercier, that might be because most Britons don't speak French. **********''I had English friends over for dinner and served English appetizers -- I can't remember what they were,'' said Mrs. Mercier, a Frenchwoman who moved to London several years ago with her family when her husband, a business executive, got a job here. ''And they started saying: 'Aren't you pleased to be able to have English food? French food is so terrible!' '' **********That was not particularly polite, but these are not polite times, even by the low historic standards of British-French relations. Since France recently defied the European Union  and announced that it would continue to ban imports of British beef because of health concerns related to mad-cow disease, the two countries have enthusiastically taken their on-again, off-again froideur to new lows. **********In Britain, emotions have been led, as usual, by the tabloid newspapers, always thrilled by the opportunity to dust off their anti-French headlines and to think of new ways to be rude. In printing a list of 21 reasons ''why oui hate 'em,'' The Daily Star used a headline that could only be described as impolite. **********And when a reporter from the antiforeign Daily Mail repeatedly interrupted a banana-related trade event in Guadeloupe to ask a spokesman for the French agriculture minister about the beef situation, the newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying,  ''Do not keep bothering us; eet ees very annoying.'' **********Through its ''Just Say 'Non!' '' campaign, The Mail has done its best to organize a nationwide boycott of French products, printing inspirational articles about, for instance, a woman in Lancashire who is feeding her children plain old British yogurt instead of fancy Petits Filous from France. **********But despite tiny pockets of support -- Tesco, a supermarket chain, for instance, recently canceled a $3.3 million order for French mistletoe -- there has not exactly been a universal stampede away from French products. This is probably a good thing for the economies of both countries: Britain exports goods worth about $26.4 billion to France each year, and takes in about $28 billion worth of French goods. **********At Somerfield, another supermarket chain, what anti-French sentiment there is has been limited, for some reason, to apples. In fact, customers are flatly refusing to buy French apples, said Pete Williams, a Somerfield spokesman, even as they merrily stock up on items like Champagne and Camembert. One store in Bristol could not get rid of its backlog of French apples, even when it slashed the prices, so it ended up donating them to Wendy, the non-British elephant at the local zoo, Mr. Williams said. **********Throughout the dispute, Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for calm and repeatedly denounced opposition calls for a full-scale trade war with France. But he could not stop his agriculture minister, Nick Brown, from announcing recently that he was personally boycotting French food and drink as ''an act of solidarity with the farmers.''. **********''I've been drinking Australian wine and some excellent New Zealand pinot, which I would recommend,'' he said. ''It's a symbolic thing.'' **********Why are Britain and France so snippy with each other? Their relationship is a result of hundreds of years of intertwined history, full of invasions, conquests, rivalries and sometime alliances. Now that the two countries are increasingly forced together as partners in the European Union as well as major partners in trade, there is the added strain of having to get along when, like rivalrous siblings, they would just as soon fight as play with each other. **********''This is a difficult relationship, perhaps because of the collective memory going back centuries,'' said Koukla Maclehose, a French literary who has lived in London for 14 years. She suspects, along with many of other French people, that it is no coincidence that food is the issue here. **********''One of the reasons why the French don't come here much on holiday is that they think the food is so terrible,'' Mrs. Maclehose said. ''Take the little bistro, the little cafe in France, and compare it to the pub food here. **********''It's disgusting -- the peas, which are the size of a prune, and this gravy, which they put on everything -- which is sort of gelatinous. It's so unappetizing, it's unbelievable. The only thing which is nice about pub food is, sometimes, the desserts.'' **********English people would disagree, of course. Jackie Archent, carrying her daily baguette as she stopped in at the French Bookshop in South Kensington one morning last week, said that she herself had rarely been harassed because of being French. But when her husband's colleagues at work criticize the French, she said, they always focus on the food. **********''They say our side, too, has beef that's unsafe,'' Mrs. Archent said, in a reference to recent British newspaper reports that the French feed sewage to their cows. ''They even talk about the bread. They think it's awful. They don't understand that you buy a baguette and throw away the part you don't eat. They think their loaves, which sit around for days and days, are much better.'' **********The British are just jealous, said Mrs. Mercier, the woman whose guests praised her English appetizers while condemning French cuisine.

When it made its debut in 1978 with surprising powers of discernment, military officials blocked release of satellite photos that showed deep, normally invisible wakes of speeding craft. **********Last year, the military had the Government set strict limits on the visual powers of proposed commercial radar satellites. And this year, the Pentagon is fighting a Canadian plan to loft a satellite that would break the new American rules. **********Now it turns out, according Federal officials, that an American scientist gave radar secrets to China in 1997, forcibly easing the Pentagon's grip. The implications of this disclosure are unclear, because the size of the breach is unknown publicly and because the secret method is reportedly difficult to put into practice, even after years of study. **********But at worst, experts say, American subs are now in danger of losing some of their cover. Among the vulnerable are missile subs, the most important part of the nation's nuclear arsenal because of their stealth. **********Publicly, the unanswered questions include how deep submarines must go to elude radar prying, how sea currents and temperatures can help restore invisibility and how technical advances with submarines, satellites and computers will most likely affect such probing in the future. Today the radar technique is believed to be able to uncloak submarines hundreds of feet beneath the waves, but not thousands. **********Experts say that recent trends have already hurt the Pentagon's game, and that China's espionage, at least in theory, has made things worse. **********A menacing trend is the advent of commercial radar satellites, which sell their images to anyone with a credit card. Canada has one in orbit and wants another, more powerful. An American company is building one, though the strict new Federal rules forced it to limit its original goals. **********As for China, it could use the stolen technology not only to hunt foreign subs but also to better cloak its own submarines, finding ways to reduce the deep wakes that produce subtle clues of stealthy movement. **********Angelo M. Codevilla, a professor of international relations at Boston University who has worked on the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the Chinese would most easily and plausibly use the secrets to change the depth and speed of their submarines. **********Secret knowledge of ''what we can and cannot do,'' he said, could help the Chinese dodge submarine spying. **********Since the start of the space age, most satellites have observed the Earth with cameras similar in principle to any tourist's. In 1978, however, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched a new kind of satellite that made images by bouncing radio waves off the planet. **********Known as Seasat, this radar craft saw land and sea in striking new ways, its images revealing narrow lines in the ocean -- tracings left by the passage of ships and subs. It somehow managed to distinguish signs of deep turbulence from the regular froth and heave of the sea. **********Seasat's feats came to an abrupt end in 1978 when the spacecraft failed unexpectedly after 100 days, with the Pentagon deeply ambivalent about its discoveries. **********''There was concern about what we had done,'' recalled Gene Giberson, the project manager for Seasat at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. **********Even though the Russians flew nuclear-powered radar satellites to spy on the oceans, the Pentagon -- the Navy in particular -- was loath to look closely at the phenomenon, experts say. **********''The Navy resisted,'' said Dave McCurdy, a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ''They didn't want questions raised. There is a certain orthodoxy they didn't want challenged.'' **********Eventually, in the early 1980's, Congress forced the issue, setting up a research program independent of the Navy that had the issue closely investigated. In 1988, inspired by Seasat, the nation's spy agencies launched their first radar satellite. **********Mr. McCurdy, now president of the Electronic Industries Association, in Arlington, Va., said the research program found deep-sub imaging ''an incredibly difficult challenge'' that, among other things, required ''a lot of computing power.'' **********However, progress was sufficient that Britain and the United States kept up the investigations in the 1990's in a joint program. Richard E. Twogood, the program's technical leader, based at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons lab in California, told Congress in 1994 of the discovery of phenomena that ''appear to be very important to the sensing of surface effects produced by undersea disturbances.'' **********Dr. Twogood also complained that the Defense Department was withholding funds for the research. **********It was he who told Federal investigators that the radar information given China by Peter Lee, an American scientist, was classified. **********A high-ranking Navy submariner said the force was ''not worried about'' the Chinese espionage because the detection technology is ''still of such limited practical use.'' **********Today, the Pentagon is facing not only Chinese spying but also the global debut of commercial radar satellites, raising knotty issues. **********RDL Space Corporation, in Culver City, Calif., wanted a Federal license for a satellite with one-meter resolution, or about three feet. **********But Washington, at the Pentagon's request, said the company could sell imagery with resolution no greater than 5 meters, or about 16 feet. Last June RDL won a Federal license for that sensitivity. It plans to launch its satellite in 2002. **********Canada, however, is planning to overstep that boundary with a radar satellite that has a resolution of 3 meters, or about 10 feet. Federal officials, at the Pentagon's request, are now trying to talk Canada into a less sensitive aim."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/25/business/the-markets-two-firms-plan-to-offer-late-trading.html": {"writer_name": "David Barboza", "pub_date": "1999-08-25", "snippet": "Discover Brokerage, on-line unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co, and Dreyfus Brokerage Services, division of Mellon Bank, plan to begin allowing small investors to trade in some of most active Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange issues on Aug 2...", "word_count": 647, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two Firms Plan to Offer Late Trading", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Two Firms Plan to Offer Late Trading", "body_text": " **********Two more on-line brokerage firms have struck an agreement to offer customers after-hours stock trades, beginning this evening. **********Discover Brokerage, the on-line unit of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, and Dreyfus Brokerage Services, a division of Mellon Bank, plan to begin allowing small investors to trade in some of the most active Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange issues tonight from 6 P.M. to 8 P.M.

E*Trade Group, the giant on-line brokerage firm, and Instinet, the electronic trading network owned by the Reuters Group, said days earlier that they would join forces in September to offer trading from 4 P.M. to 6:30 P.M.; Datek Online Holdings already offers trading in Nasdaq stocks from the close until 5:15 P.M. **********The brokerage firms say small investors are eager to trade cheaply and conveniently over the Internet. Some live on the West Coast -- where the New York markets close at 1 P.M. local time -- and others simply prefer the convenience of trading from home, after the markets close. **********So while the major stock exchanges -- the Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange -- are contemplating an evening session, a number of alliances are being formed among on-line brokerage firms and so-called electronic communications networks, or E.C.N.'s, which are low-cost computerized trading systems, which are fast winning acceptance as efficient ways to sort and match orders.

The butcher raised his meat cleaver in joy. The men hauled a lamb slaughtered in celebration: after 23 days in the hospital, the butcher's younger brother was about to be released. **********Bashar Abu Salhieh, although he cannot yet walk, survived a shootout that stunned this northern Palestinian city. It began as a petty dispute, with two youths harassing women from the Abu Salhieh family during a wedding march. But it escalated into a full-fledged battle between the largest, most radical refugee camp in the West Bank and city folk in this commercial town. **********''It was like Chicago,'' said the butcher, Mohammed Abu Salhieh, 43. **********What most shook not only Nablus but the Palestinian Authority was the vast number of automatic weapons that poured into the streets. At the climax, after Mr. Abu Salhieh was gunned down in the butcher shop, the usually tranquil town square filled with 1,000 men, many firing wantonly in a brazen exhibition of illegal arms. **********In a limited sense, the violent episode in Nablus accomplished what the latest peace agreement had not. It propelled Palestinian officials into starting to hunt down thousands, if not tens of thousands, of illegal weapons whose seizure has been required by every peace accord since 1995. **********But the crackdown, focused on the Balata refugee camp and its thriving black market, did not go smoothly and ultimately went only so far. After an ugly showdown with the camp's youth that evoked scenes from the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israel several years ago, the Palestinian officers arrested 17 men they said were arms dealers. **********They did succeed in putting out the word, which seeped through rutted streets where weapons had been worn as freely as cell phones, that the guns must be locked away; the authorities, for the meantime, mean business. **********Those authorities did not, however, actually confiscate many weapons. **********It is Israel that has traditionally seen the accumulation of weapons in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a threat. But this crackdown, in response to an internal crisis, made clear that the Palestinians, too, recognized the proliferation of weapons as a threat to security -- their own. **********Addressing the problem represents a true challenge for Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who risks a backlash if he comes down too hard on his own people. Complicating the picture, it is not just civilians, but also Mr. Arafat's outsized security forces, who have been amassing and abusing illegal guns. **********Increasingly concerned about what they see as the militarization of Palestinian society, several Palestinian officials and human rights groups have been sounding alarms. **********''We cannot close our eyes and pretend this phenomenon does not exist,'' said Hasem Khader, a Palestinian legislator from the Balata camp. ''It is frightening and dangerous, and if it is not too late, something must be done.'' **********Tellingly, in Nablus it was not the quest to meet their obligations under the latest peace deal that pushed the security officials into action. Instead, they moved to calm the anxieties of ordinary Palestinians, and since they succeeded -- somewhat -- they proclaimed their crackdown a success. **********''You know, if you come to Nablus now, you will not see a single weapon on a citizen,'' said a senior Palestinian security official. **********But Israeli security experts and some Palestinians said the incident showed that the Palestinian Authority had limited ability and limited desire to confiscate weapons. **********''In this case, they were not pushed by us, but faced by internal problems they had to solve,'' said Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the coordinator of Israeli Government activities in the West Bank and Gaza. ''And even in this case, they were not willing to go to the end.'' **********One action taken recently by the West Bank Palestinian governors cut deeply into the local way of life. They decreed that guns may not be shot off at weddings, as is the tradition. **********''I cannot find any excuse for the shooting of a weapon at a party,'' said Tayer Naserala, an assistant to the Nablus governor. **********Only several hundred weapons are held legally in the West Bank and Gaza. The far larger illegal cache, the Israelis guess, numbers 30,000 to 40,000 weapons. Pistols, grenades and M-16 and Kalashnikov assault rifles are smuggled into Gaza and the West Bank from Jordan and Egypt, stolen from Israeli soldiers or purchased from Israeli criminals. **********Prices average $500 to $2,000 a gun, and dealers are easily found. Nablus residents said they used to wander into the Balata camp and see M-16's openly displayed on kaffiyehs as if in a produce market. **********Last month, Muhammad Daraghmeh, a Palestinian reporter, discovered a clothing store in the heart of Nablus that sold submachine guns as well as blue jeans. A dealer there offered M-16's for about $2,000 apiece and said he had bought the weapons in Ramallah, moving about 20 a month for some $3,000 profit. **********Many arms dealers are former intifada fighters. Schooled at a young age in violence, they spent their early adult years in jail and emerged, totally unprepared, into a limited job market. They are hungry for quick cash, and some of their best customers belong to Mr. Arafat's power base -- to members of his political party, Al Fatah, and to agents of his seven security forces. **********''Every Palestinian needs a weapon to continue our struggle,'' said Jihad Izzat, a Fatah leader in the Balata camp. ''The authorities promised that the weapons of Fatah will be considered the weapons of the movements, nationalist weapons. They will never be confiscated.'' **********When they do attempt confiscations, as the showdown at Balata taught them, Palestinian officers have to be careful to avoid tactics that recall those of Israel. **********''We do not go to make searches in every house like in the occupation,'' the senior Palestinian security official said. ''We are dealing with our people. We have to wait to see weapons at demonstrations or to get information from intelligence.'' **********Some Palestinians find that insufficient. LAW, a Palestinian human rights group in Ramallah, has documented 20 deaths due to firearms abuses since the arrival of the Palestinian Authority in 1994. Its report also notes a marked increase in weapons abuses in the last few months, by security officers and ''by the public in displays of power and bravado.'' **********The Palestinian authorities themselves are unnerved by the spread of weapons. **********Some 19,000 Palestinians live in Balata, a squalid long-term transient home for people who still aspire, increasingly despairingly, to return to their houses in Israel. In his office in the camp, Mr. Khader, the legislator, said that ''the Palestinian revolution started with a revolver.'' **********''Weapons became a part of our character,'' he said. ''Now they are so much more freely available and so much cheaper. So everyone, as they can afford a house, can afford a weapon.'' **********Refugees, he said, are growing certain that Palestinian leaders will sell out their aspirations during the final negotiations with the Israelis. Some buy weapons for personal security, some with criminal intent and some for nationalist reasons and to keep pace with Jewish settlers, many of whom are armed, he said. **********But in the camp, he added ominously, some are accumulating weapons out of concern that they will have to stand up against the government. **********The feud in Nablus began on Sept. 16 when two camp youths drove into a nice neighborhood in town during a wedding march by the Abu Salhieh family. The youths plowed their car through the procession and ''looked the wrong way at our women,'' said Mahyoub Abu Salhieh, an engineer and member of the preventive security forces. **********Chased off, the youths returned later with friends from the security forces. ''We wanted to apologize,'' said Mohammed Dandan, a camp resident and intelligence agent. The family invited the men to take hot coffee laced with cardamom. **********But the pleasantries broke down. Mr. Dandan, whose eyes are still bloodshot and his face bruised, ended up severely beaten by an Abu Salhieh cousin. In the middle of the night, 40 masked men from the camp returned to shoot up the butcher's home. **********''This annoyed us,'' the butcher said. ''We have weapons too.'' Palestinian officials mediated a cease-fire, so Bashar Abu Salhieh went to open the butcher shop the next morning.  He was chopping lamb on a large tree stump when nine masked men stormed the casbah, waving M-16's. They left 17 bullet holes in the store. Several dum-dum bullets exploded in Bashar's body, according to medical reports. **********He was taken away by ambulance. Rumor spread that he had been killed. Merchants closed their stores and began to hunt the presumed killers. Within a half-hour, they were joined by about 1,000 men at the fountain in the center of town. **********''We lost our control, really,'' Mahyoub Al Salhieh said. ''We were ready to shoot and kill. Lots of weapons were being fired. But then we found out from the governor that Bashar had survived. We tried to calm the crowd, but it was beyond us. The authorities had to intervene.'' **********The Abu Salhieh family turned their eight weapons over to the security forces. Mr. Arafat ordered forces into the streets to calm things down. **********In Balata, rumors spread that the forces would go house to house. Within an hour, the youths had gathered, hurling stones and burning tires as they used to do against the Israeli soldiers. The showdown lasted several days as refugee camp leaders from the rest of the West Bank showed up in solidarity. **********Many of those eventually arrested were Fatah members in the security apparatus, which was apparently meant as a signal: no one is immune."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/11/business/world-business-briefing-asia-steps-taken-to-nationalize-trusts.html": {"writer_name": "Samuel Len", "pub_date": "1999-12-11", "snippet": "South Korea's financial watchdog agency designates Korea Investment Trust and Daehan Investment Trust as nonviable as part of previously announced plan to nationalize them (S)", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STEPS TAKEN TO NATIONALIZE TRUSTS", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; STEPS TAKEN TO NATIONALIZE TRUSTS", "body_text": " **********South Korea's financial watchdog agency, the Financial Supervisory Commission, designated two heavily indebted trust companies as nonviable as part of a previously announced plan to nationalize them.

But its fate is likely to hinge on what happened earlier this month in a conference room at a Marriott hotel in Torrance, Calif. **********REIT's lost their stock market glitz in late 1997 and nearly became a boneyard last fall when investors shunned their risks after the Russian debt crisis. Since then, it has become fashionable to insist that the field offers rich pickings for individual investors looking for bargains. **********But when H. Wayne Snavely, chairman of Imperial Credit Commercial Mortgage Investment, called a shareholder meeting to order at the Torrance Marriott on June 18, value-happy individual investors were scarce. Instead, he faced about a dozen financially muscular portfolio managers, or their lawyers. Many were there to protest the proposed acquisition of the trust by its publicly traded management company, which is also run by Mr. Snavely. **********The management company, Imperial Credit Industries, has offered to buy the trust for $11.50 a share, about 25 cents more than its current trading price and $2.50 less than book value. The institutional investors contend that the trust's assets could fetch at least $13 share in a liquidation or in an auction that was not tilted in favor of the management company. **********Mr. Snavely says the trust and its management company will cooperate fully with any competing bidder -- as a shareholder, he said, he too wants the best price for his shares -- but he disagrees that a liquidation will produce anything like the bonus that his institutional investors predict. **********The dispute shows the challenge for small investors these days in the REIT market, where the best motto might be: REIT's are for professionals. Don't try this at home. **********While the market is filled with trust shares that look cheap by historical standards, those that are also safe are much harder for even professionals to find. By law, such trusts must pay out virtually all their income to shareholders, even when it is more prudent to retain capital. The challenge is to find a trust whose portfolio can withstand that steady outflow of cash without collapsing into debt or excessively diluting the stakes of existing investors. **********And even if you find one, the industry is so beset by conflicts of interest that you may need to speak up to protect your interests -- and it is far easier to be heard when you own a million shares or so. **********That is about the number of the Imperial trust's 28.5 million outstanding shares that are owned by Third Avenue Funds, which is run by Martin J. Whitman, a value investor who has never been shy about speaking out. **********In late May, the trust's independent directors got a polite letter from Michael H. Winer, co-manager of the Third Avenue Real Estate Value fund. He urged the independent directors overseeing the auction to reject the management company's bid and consider instead ''an orderly liquidation'' of the trust's assets, arguing that bidders are more likely to pay top dollar if they are bidding only for assets they really want. And he questioned the size of the termination fee the management company will get as part of the deal, which some analysts estimated could be as much as $50 million. **********Then he made his plans to spend June 18 in Torrance. **********About the same time, Gary Frohman was packing his briefcase, too. Mr. Frohman is a portfolio manager for the Alan J. Steinberg L.P. in Coral Gables, Fla., a small investment partnership with about 300,000 of the trust's shares under management. **********''We are concerned that the management company is trying to buy the trust at a below-market price,'' Mr. Frohman said. **********Mr. Snavely, wearing his hat as trust chairman, said in an interview that he ''appreciates the input of our investors'' but disagrees that a liquidation is better than selling the trust intact. **********Then he donned his hat as the management company's chairman and explained that the termination fee, which will be set by an independent appraisal, has been capped voluntarily at $35 million. **********That is about five times the annual management fee and 10 percent of the market capitalization of the trust, an arrangement Mr. Winer thought ''ludicrous''; Mr. Frohman considered it merely ''ridiculous.'' **********In any case, the termination fee should be nailed down quickly, Mr. Frohman said, because ''it will be difficult or impossible for a third party to make their best bid without knowing what this obligation will be.'' **********The fee dispute shows how the management company's insider status could discourage other bidders, several big shareholders said. But Mr. Snavely said he was confident that adequate due diligence by an outside bidder would keep the field level. **********The management company and its officers own about 12 percent of the trust's shares, he pointed out, so ''if somebody wants to pay more, we will appreciate it.''

Prices were mostly steady as the expansion headed toward a record for longevity early next year. **********''Consumer spending picked up over the Thanksgiving weekend after being hampered by warm weather in November,'' the Fed reported. ''Manufacturing activity continued to advance in most districts.'' While home sales slowed, ''commercial real estate markets remained strong in most parts of the country,'' the Fed said. **********Companies reported paying more to attract and retain workers. ''Wage increases were described as persistent in most districts,'' the Fed said. Wage and salary increases did not appear to be accelerating generally, though some industries and regions had salary increases of 3 percent to 10 percent, the report said. The use of signing bonuses has spread, the Fed said. **********But higher wages -- necessary as the pool of available qualified labor shrinks -- have not translated into accelerating inflation. ''Prices at the retail level have been nearly steady in most districts,'' the Fed said. The same is generally true for industrial goods, though prices of some ''have been on the rise,'' according to the report. **********Manufacturing rose in November in most districts. Boston reported strong demand for pharmaceuticals and instruments, Cleveland noted rising output of steel and St. Louis saw increased demand for plastics and auto parts. **********Warm weather slowed retail sales in most of the country before Thanksgiving. Sales picked up significantly over the next weekend ''and retailers expressed confidence that the brisker pace of sales will continue throughout the holiday shopping period,'' the Fed said. **********The report will help form the basis for discussion at the Dec. 21 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest-rate policy. The Fed panel has raised the target interest rate on overnight loans between banks three times this year to slow the economy and keep inflation in check, most recently on Nov. 16. **********In November, the central bankers also adopted a neutral stance toward future interest rate changes, suggesting they were just as likely to cut rates as raise them. **********Inflation has remained tame, with the Consumer Price Index up two-tenths of 1 percent in October and 2.6 percent in the last 12 months. The core rate, which excludes food and a doubling of oil prices since February, was up 2.1 percent in 12 months. **********The beige book did not mention what may be the key factor in the Fed's interest rate deliberations: productivity gains that should allow the economy to keep growing with low inflation. Productivity has risen at an average annual rate of more than 2.7 percent since mid-1998, faster than the 1 percent average of the previous two decades. **********Productivity rose at a 4.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. The third-quarter productivity increase was the biggest since 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 1992. **********The Fed's regional outlook is based on reports from the Fed's 12 district banks and is published eight times each year before meetings of the open market committee.

The mathematicians, who have dominated the realm recently, have offered to keep E-mail, credit card numbers and other Internet traffic safe with a set of elaborate equations that are just too complicated for anyone to ever break. **********The physicists, on the other hand, have looked for physical ways to hide information, using microdots (very tiny bits of microfilm), for instance, or fiddling with obscure parts of the radio spectrum. **********In recent years, the traffic on the Internet has largely been protected by the mathematicians because computers do a great job with arithmetic. Now International Business Machines is getting ready to try to commercialize the work of some I.B.M. physicists who have found clever ways of using quantum mechanics to hide information. **********This is no simple decoder ring, and it will probably not be of much use to the average E-mail user who wants privacy. But for corporations or government agencies that can link offices with fiber optic cables, the method could provide a new kind of security. **********In the simplest terms, the method involves sending, photon by photon, a message that can serve as a mathematical key after it is decoded. Such a key can then be used to encode and decode E-mail messages. **********In other words, the new encryption system is not for the poor or the technologically faint-hearted. **********The technique is called quantum cryptography. It got its start in 1989 when a team of I.B.M. researchers, led by Charles Bennett, announced that it had succeeded in building a contraption that transmitted a secure message a few feet by flashing a laser on and off. **********Dr. Bennett said the system was based on exploiting certain aspects of quantum physics that govern the realm of the very small. **********A quantum system, he said, ''has properties that can't be measured without disturbing other properties.'' What happens is that the act of observing affects the photons. So if a spy or eavesdropper interrupted the message, or even decoded it, that action would destroy the message itself. **********When no message arrived, the intended recipient would know that something was up. **********Of course, the eavesdropper could generate and send a copy of the message, using new photons. But the system developed by I.B.M. has several steps that would make it almost impossible to do that in a convincing way. **********I.B.M. has now expanded the system to a scale that could be of use to companies or government agencies. The company says the system can be used to send an encrypted message over miles of fiber optic cable. **********The I.B.M. scientists encode the information that is sent by making use of the properties of polarized light -- light waves that are oriented in only one plane, like the vertical or horizontal plane. **********The polarity of regular light is easy to measure because the light is made up of so many photons (light behaves as both particles, or photons, and as waves). Polarizing sunglasses, for example, let through only vertically polarized light. The glare (horizontally polarized light) is excluded. **********The prototype of quantum cryptography developed by I.B.M. uses a fast pulse laser that is filtered to produce one photon per pulse. Each proton can be in one of four polarizations: vertical, horizontal or one of two diagonals. Which polarization a proton will have is determined randomly. **********The meaning of the polarization is set by the sender. A 1 might be represented by a single photon that is polarized vertically,  while a 0 would be rendered by one polarized horizontally. **********The principles of quantum physics guarantee that the receiver has only one chance to measure the polarization. **********The recipient can set the receiver in one of two configurations, so it can distinguish between vertical and horizontal polarizations, or between one of two diagonal polarizations. **********If the receiver is set correctly, the right answer comes out. If it is set incorrectly, the receiver cannot determine the polarization of the proton -- and it gets no second chance because just trying to determine the polarization destroys it. The way the receiver is set varies randomly from photon to photon. **********The two sides then communicate without any special security -- by E-mail, for instance -- to screen out the bad answers. As Dr. Bennett described it: ''Alice sends a random sequence of these four to Bob. He measures them randomly and gets half correct and spoils half. Now Alice and Bob use their ability to communicate publicly to weed out the spoiled one. He tells her how he measured.'' **********For example, Bob says the receiver was set the first and second times to determine horizontal or vertical polarization, and the third time was set to distinguish between the two diagonals. Alice tells Bob which times the receiver was set correctly -- without telling him the correct answer, which he now knows. **********When correctly decoded, the information sent by the series of photons will generate a  a key, known to the sender and receiver, that can be used for conventional encryption. **********Is the system truly secure? Dr. Bennett said that quantum mechanics practically guaranteed it. Measuring a photon's polarization correctly will destroy the photon. Any eavesdropper who tries to snag information will end up blurring the message by destroying photons. **********Nabil Amer is one of the I.B.M. scientists who has just built a version of this system using off-the-shelf parts. **********''The prototype sits on a bench.'' he said. ''My immediate goal is to turn all of this into a typical card you put in your PC. All of this stuff that sits in a rack will end up being a card.'' **********Others wonder if all of the electronics are worth the work. **********Bruce Schneier, the author of ''Applied Cryptography'' (John Wiley & Sons, 1996), said: ''It's always nice to have new crypto-primitives, but there's nothing that quantum crypto does that math can't do. The nice thing about math is that it works on all computers. Quantum crypto requires quantum crypto hardware.'' **********Dr. Bennett predicted that quantum cryptographic devices might find a niche in corporate suites. **********''It will likely be a vanity item,'' he said. ''The boss has a fancy computer -- even if he doesn't know how to operate it. If you think your conversations are very important and it only costs $500 to put it there, then you might do it. People would come in and think he must be very important because he needs quantum cryptography on his desk.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/11/business/international-business-nigerian-fraud-syndicates-set-up-shop-in-south-africa.html": {"writer_name": "Henri Cauvin", "pub_date": "1999-11-11", "snippet": "Unsolved killing of foreign businessman Jean Pierre Tin Nok Il Shing Tat in Johannesburg, South Africa, and mysterious disappearance of Norwegian industrialist Kjetil Moe has local and international law enforcement agents warning overseas executiv...", "word_count": 962, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nigerian Fraud Syndicates Set Up Shop in South Africa", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Nigerian Fraud Syndicates Set Up Shop in South Africa", "body_text": " **********The unsolved killing of one foreign businessman here and the mysterious disappearance of another has local and international law enforcement agents warning overseas executives and entrepreneurs to be wary of West African criminal syndicates that in recent years have made this, the continent's financial capital, their second home. **********''Don't Be Fooled!

The ad describes one of the most common variations of a ''4-1-9'' fraud, so called for its statute number in the penal code of Nigeria, the birthplace of the scam. **********Purporting to be Nigerian civil servants conspiring to inflate a government contract and pocket the difference, the schemers send letters to thousands of foreign businesspeople, seeking access to a clean, overseas bank account where embezzled money can be transferred. **********Prospective accomplices are promised a cut of the multimillion-dollar sum. Once lured to Africa, they are often shown the supposed money, most or all of it actually fake. **********Entangled in the ruse, the accomplices are duped into handing over money, usually when the scheme is said to encounter unforeseen problems that can be resolved only with five- or six-figure fees. Desperate to exploit what they perceive as a fleeting opportunity, the victims usually pay. By the time they realize the deception, they are out many thousands of dollars. In one case to come to light this year, a syndicate bilked a Japanese businessman of $7 million, according to South African police. **********Simple as the scheme is, it results in tens of millions of dollars in losses each year, according to the United States Secret Service, which opened an office in South Africa several weeks ago to coordinate the agency's fight against commercial fraud in Africa. **********''It continues to be a problem here in the United States and around the world,'' John Tomlinson, a spokesman for the Secret Service, said in a phone interview from Washington. **********Indeed, even after a decade or so, the ruse continues to be a reliable moneymaker for the maturing network of organized crime that emanates from Nigeria. **********The rise of Nigerian syndicates dates to the late 1970's and early 1980's when the West African country was hit hard by the global collapse in oil prices. Thousands of enterprising and well-educated Nigerian oil industry employees were left to look for jobs. Some took their acquired skills in trade and communications into organized crime, said Peter Gastrow, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in South Africa. **********In the last two decades, the criminal networks have grown in number and sophistication. From their beginnings in credit card scams, they have widened their repertory of frauds. **********It is no surprise, then, that the F.B.I. and the Secret Service have been in Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, for years. The Secret Service has a crime-monitoring initiative known as Operation 4-1-9. With the West Africans' move into South Africa, it became clear to the Secret Service that it should be here, too, alongside the F.B.I., which already has an office in Pretoria. **********''We recognized there was a need for a presence here,'' said Mitch Price, the special agent who heads the new office. ''The bad guys know this is the economic hub of the region, and they have come here to operate.'' **********Fighting this sort of fraud is made more difficult by the fact that victims are often too embarrassed or too scared to approach authorities; when they do come forward, what little information they have about their contacts is usually bogus. **********Jean Pierre Tin Nok Il Shing Tat, a 42-year-old businessman from Mauritius, never had the chance to come forward. On June 4, he was kidnapped from an area hotel. Twelve days later, his body was found near an old mine along a highway in Heidelberg, southeast of here. He had been shot in the head. **********Investigators are certain he was caught in a 4-1-9 scam. They now believe Kjetil Moe, an industrialist from Norway who was ensnared in a similar scam, is dead, too, Lawrence van der Westhuizen, a South African police superintendent, said. **********Mr. Moe, a 65-year-old mechanical engineer, arrived here Sept. 24 and disappeared three days later, after contacting Nigerians who instructed him to hand over $5,000 to what turned out to be a fictitious company, said Mr. van der Westhuizen, who leads the Johannesburg commercial crimes unit. **********Even before Mr. Moe disappeared, the unit had amassed considerable evidence of the criminal network's expanding influence in South Africa. At least three other foreign businessmen involved in the syndicate scams have been kidnapped this year. Unlike Mr. Tat, and apparently Mr. Moe, each escaped or was rescued. **********''A year ago, this wasn't a big problem here,'' Mr. van der Westhuizen said. ''Now it's an enormous problem.'' **********Since the end of apartheid eased restrictions on immigration to South Africa, criminal operatives from Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, have migrated to Johannesburg, and the impact has begun to be felt, law enforcement agents here say. **********With increasing frequency, the letters about 4-1-9 bear Johannesburg postmarks when they arrive in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, the United States and other nations. **********Home to Africa's biggest stock exchange, its biggest banks and many of its biggest companies, Johannesburg offers confidence men what Lagos cannot: a cloak of respectability and credibility. A businessman scared off by a letter from Nigeria and fearful of traveling there might not be as wary of a solicitation sent from South Africa. **********But authorities here worry that South Africa's image will not remain untainted for long. **********''If you receive a letter or a contract from South Africa, you will think twice about it,'' Mr. van der Westhuizen said.

Armed with fast computers and sophisticated software, they see themselves not only at the market's epicenter but also on the same plain as professional traders. For extra enticement, there are low commissions, sometimes less than $10 a trade. **********What many investors may not realize is that their trades -- particularly in the sizzling Internet stocks with which on-line traders are infatuated -- are not finding their way to the market through traditional channels. **********Instead, much of that trading is being piped through new types of electronic networks -- systems that, in theory, are ideal marketplaces, where buyers and sellers can trade stocks without paying a markup to the professional traders who have long served as middlemen in the Nasdaq market. **********The new trading systems, called electronic communications networks, or E.C.N.'s, are pitched as a way for investors to gain instant access to the markets and to compete head to head with professional traders. **********Yet for all their promise, the E.C.N.'s have distinct downsides. They and the investors who use them -- including the growing numbers of rapid-fire day traders -- are contributing to the wild ricocheting of prices in Internet stocks. **********Moreover, although commissions to trade on line are indeed rock bottom, there are hidden costs in using the networks. Prices on these networks are inferior on 8 out of 10 stocks they trade, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers. In large part, that is because investors are trading only with other investors who are using the same network, rather than ''meeting'' all other investors in the broader Nasdaq marketplace. **********Frustrations over poor prices or trades that were not executed at all have led some experienced investors to wonder whether something is amiss between the time orders are placed and the time they show up on an E.C.N. **********''The upside is that investors are getting that meeting possibility,'' said Richard G. Ketchum, president of the N.A.S.D. ''The downside is that they are not getting any execution guarantee.'' **********The networks now account for about 20 percent of trading in Nasdaq stocks -- more than the volume on the American Stock Exchange and all the nation's regional stock exchanges combined. But even investors who are not using the networks have reason to be concerned, as volatility jumps and total trading costs increase. **********''We're in a period of disequilibrium right now,'' said Bruce Weber, assistant professor of information systems at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''Anybody that's trading a Nasdaq stock these days has to work harder to find the best price and ideal counterparties than they did maybe three or four years ago.'' **********With the Nasdaq composite index up 10 percent so far this year, the problems have been largely papered over by investor profits. Not until a full-fledged market dive will investors find out whether the fragmented marketplace created by the rise of the E.C.N.'s will make it harder to sell -- or harder to sell at a good price. Such difficulties could make jittery investors panic, turning a trickle of selling into a flood and pulling down more established stocks, too. **********Regulators opened the door wide to the new networks after they found in the mid-1990's that traders in Nasdaq stocks were profiting from artificially wide spreads -- the difference between the price at which traders buy shares from sellers and the price at which they will resell them to buyers. In the most important change, regulators forced Nasdaq traders to display customers' orders that fell at prices within the spread. They also encouraged the creation of new networks that would allow investors to meet. Rather than taking a markup on trades, the networks profit by charging a small fee for each transaction. **********Most of the electronic networks operate  today for institutional investors. The oldest is Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group P.L.C. But two fast-growing services cater to individual investors: Island, a two-year-old network owned by Datek Holdings, a discount brokerage firm in Iselin, N.J., and Archipelago, a Chicago company whose owners include Goldman, Sachs and E*Trade Group. The 200,000 customers of Datek Online have trades funneled to Island. **********''E.C.N.'s are one of the most dramatic forces reshaping the equity markets,'' said David Cushing, director of research at ITG Inc., a research and trading company that runs a trade-matching service for institutional investors called ITG Posit. ''I think E.C.N.'s have a very valuable role in improving the efficiency of the market. The downside is, many of the benefits of E.C.N.'s have been co-opted by the professional day trader. Some of the ways they are being used right now are not in the market's best interest.'' **********Wide and Wild Swings **********E.C.N.'s play a significant role in the increasing volatility in many Nasdaq stocks. A growing number of day traders, who buy and sell furiously all day long, hoping to capture tiny per-share profits on large trades, execute their orders on the networks. Their lemming-like behavior in stocks that are already moving has made 15-point single-day swings common. **********Even the occasional trader who uses an E.C.N. can add to volatility. If a customer offers to buy shares at a price well above the market -- something that happens increasingly, with so many on-line traders eager to buy hot stocks at any price -- the offer is flashed on other investors' screens, helping push the market higher. At a brokerage firm, that order would probably be executed at the lower price. **********The day traders and the price-is-no-object investors are creating wild price swings in Internet stocks, which trade widely on E.C.N.'s. According to ITG, daily swings in an index of Internet stocks have been running at more than twice the rate of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Such volatility increases investors' anxieties and raises their costs by making it more difficult to get in and out of positions. **********''People take pride in the fact that spreads in stocks have narrowed, but intraday price changes are bigger than they've ever been,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. ''I don't think we've ever had an environment like that.'' **********More Fragments, Fewer Matches **********The biggest problem posed by E.C.N.'s is the fragmentation of the market for Nasdaq stocks. The Nasdaq has always been fragmented because it has no central trading floor. The E.C.N.'s split up the market even more. When fewer trades are posted in one place, it is less likely that orders to buy and sell at the same price will find each other. **********Robert Colby, deputy director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's division of market regulation, said that although the changes after the Nasdaq investigation have helped investors, ''it's still a dispersed market.'' **********''If the volume is going on in one place, and you are at another, you won't get executed,'' he said. **********An investor can also wind up with an inferior price. Say a stock is quoted on E.C.N. ''A'' at $10.25 (the ''bid'' price) and  at $10.3825 (the ''offered'' price), while E.C.N. ''B'' has prices of $10.25 bid, $10.3125 offered. An investor interested in buying the shares at the prevailing price would pay more to trade on ''A.'' **********Or say an investor has placed a limit order -- an order to buy stock at a set price -- on an E.C.N. If there is no seller willing to take the other side of the trade at that price, his order remains unfilled. **********After it becomes evident that the trade cannot be matched at the E.C.N., the investor, if he understands how Nasdaq trading works, can cancel his order and route it to another system, or to a big market maker like Merrill Lynch or Knight Securities. **********Even then, this time lapse -- maybe just a few seconds -- can be costly. The price the investor wanted to pay may be vastly different from the new one. If the market price is much higher, the order is not executed. If the market price has fallen significantly, the order is executed -- but the investor pays more for the stock. **********If E.C.N.'s were all linked into a central order book, that problem would disappear. The N.A.S.D. wants to knit the marketplace together but has encountered resistance from some members. Until it does, the greater the volume on an E.C.N., the more likely that a customer's order will be matched quickly. For that reason, clients of Island, which traded 813 million shares for customers in January, are more apt to get their trades matched in-house than are customers of Archipelago, whose volume for the month was 90.5 million shares. **********But even on a populous E.C.N. like Island, it is unlikely that an investor will get the best price for his trade. According to a study last year by the N.A.S.D., in 81 percent of all Nasdaq stocks actively quoted, traditional market makers had better prices than any E.C.N. In only 11 percent of the stocks did E.C.N.'s have superior prices. In the remainder, both E.C.N.'s and traditional market makers offered the best prices. **********The Cost Catches **********When it comes to costs, most investors focus only on their brokerage commissions. But explicit costs like commissions make up only 10 percent of an investor's total costs, according to Salomon Smith Barney. Implicit costs -- such as what an investor pays for a volatile stock or when trades are badly executed -- make up the rest. **********Eugene Noser of the Abel/Noser Corporation in New York, who tracks trading costs, says that implicit factors -- including those driven by the rise of E.C.N.'s -- are very high for popular Internet stocks. **********''If you take the trading costs of a Yahoo or Ebay or Excite, they are astronomical,'' he said. ''It is very difficult and expensive to try to execute orders in these stocks.'' According to Abel/Noser, while the average cost of trading New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stocks is about 0.16 percent of the transaction amount, the average cost to trade Ebay in the last six months of 1998 was roughly 0.4 percent; for Yahoo, it was 0.22 percent. **********E.C.N.'s, unlike market makers, charge other dealers to execute on their networks, increasing costs. **********And these stocks may be costly to trade because the size of the typical trade is small: 1,000 shares or less. When smaller orders dominate trading, it is more likely that a single order will move the price of the stock, increasing investors' costs. **********In February, more than three out of four trades in both Amazon.com and Yahoo were for 1,000 shares or less. Almost 80 percent of Ebay's trades fell into this category. Dell, which has been trading far longer than these young Internet enterprises, had 67 percent of its trades move in small orders last year, up from 31 percent in 1994. **********Expense and Execution **********There may be other reasons it is so costly to trade these stocks on line. **********A few experienced traders who say they have received bad executions on stock trades at both Datek Online and Terra Nova Trading, the brokerage firm affiliated with Archipelago, are wondering whether people who work for these firms have been jumping in to take better prices for themselves. **********Gerald D. Putnam, owner of Terra Nova and part-owner of Archipelago, says none of his employees trade against customers' orders. The practice, which is against securities regulations, was rampant on the Nasdaq stock market before the S.E.C.'s crackdown in 1996. **********Matt Andresen, president of Island ECN, did not respond to a reporter's questions. **********The potential for such improper trading at E.C.N.'s affiliated with a brokerage firm -- like both Island and Archipelago -- remains a concern of regulators. In a statement last fall, the S.E.C. instructed E.C.N.'s and their affiliates to set up procedures to prevent employees from using confidential information in trading. **********The temptation to trade ahead of a customer is greatest when investors place market orders, meaning that they will buy or sell at the prevailing price. **********A brokerage employee who receives a market order for 1,000 shares of Yahoo is supposed to complete the trade at the market price within 30 seconds. But given the rapid price changes in these stocks, the trader could easily complete the customer's trade at a price fractionally higher than the market and take the lower price for himself. **********As long as the investor's price is in the range, the brokerage firm can argue that it gave its customer the ''market'' at the time. Only a study of each transaction, second by second, would reveal the truth. **********Furthermore, the N.A.S.D. has stated that during fast or exceedingly volatile markets, traders can be excused from this 30-second rule, giving them even more flexibility. **********Troubled by Some Trades **********Among the experienced investors to raise questions about the quality of executions on some E.C.N.'s is Greg F. Mazzeo, who traded over-the-counter stocks professionally for 15 years and now trades for himself. In documents he has compiled meticulously, Mr. Mazzeo points to numerous examples of market orders that he placed with Datek Online and Island ECN that were not executed for minutes at a time, or were executed at prices that to him were suspiciously off the prevailing market levels. **********''I'm not accusing them of front-running orders or holding orders for their own benefit,'' he said. ''But the time it takes to execute and the price of execution on market orders at times are highly suspect.'' **********Over the seven months that he was trading through Datek, until March, Mr. Mazzeo made numerous complaints to the firm. Datek's policy is to rescind commission charges if a customer's ''marketable'' order is not executed within 90 seconds. Mr. Mazzeo said he paid no commission on roughly a third of his orders. **********Using sophisticated software, Mr. Mazzeo can watch all the action in a stock. And what he saw on one trade early this year troubled him. On Jan. 15, Mr. Mazzeo put in an order to sell 500 shares of Network Event Theatre, a small Nasdaq stock that rarely trades. The bid price on the stock was $13.8125 when he placed his market order on Datek Online. For minutes, no offers to buy were posted on the network. Then a 500-share lot traded, and the bid price began to fall. Still, Mr. Mazzeo's shares were not sold until the bid fell to $13.4375. **********A computer glitch? An old order suddenly processed? Perhaps, but with Mr. Mazzeo's market order in hand, the firm's traders could have sold 500 shares that they did not yet own at $13.8125. Such a ''short'' sale in a thinly traded stock could easily have lowered the bid price to $13.4375, at which time a trader could have bought Mr. Mazzeo's 500 shares and covered his short position at a profit of $187.50. **********Datek did not respond to written questions about these trades. **********Fair-Weather Friends? **********While E.C.N.'s have contributed to rising stock prices, no one knows for sure what their role will be in a market crash. **********Unlike the Nasdaq market makers they hope to replace, E.C.N.'s do not commit any capital to maintain orderly markets in the stocks they trade. While most large, reputable market makers stand ready to buy or sell 1,000 shares of the stocks they trade -- they are required to handle 100-share trades -- E.C.N.'s do not. **********Moreover, according to Nasdaq, the average block of stock available at the best bid or offer on an electronic network last year was only 340 shares. So an investor with more than 340 shares to sell or buy may well have his offer only partly filled. By comparison, the average block available from a market maker was 1,741 shares. **********What does all this mean? If the on-line traders' favorite stocks start to fall from the sky, the people who trade on E.C.N.'s may not be able to get out. **********''You get to a point of uncertainty and no one is going to sit out there and say they are a buyer during a market break,'' said Mr. Ketchum of the N.A.S.D. ''If markets drop, E.C.N.'s have a harder time providing liquidity.'' **********In other words, for E.C.N.'s, the resulting stampede for the exits could make the 1987 crash look like a day at the beach. **********Minding Your Trading P's and Q's **********AS more investors flock to trade stocks on line, the frustrations are likely to increase. While commissions are lower than ever, poor executions of trades can make on-line investing expensive indeed. **********Here are some do's and don'ts for on-line trade: **********Under only one circumstance should you place a market order for a Nasdaq stock on line -- when you absolutely must get out. **********In wildly fluctuating Nasdaq stocks, such orders to buy or sell the stock in question regardless of price are a good way to overpay for a stock or receive too little when selling. Indeed, Kenneth D. Pasternak, president of Knight/Trimark Group, parent of Knight Securities, one of the nation's largest market-making firms, wants to outlaw market orders. He thinks that too many investors buy stocks with no regard to price. **********Instead, investors should use limit orders, which specify a certain price to buy or sell shares. **********But what price? Market insiders say that you are unlikely to have either buy or sell orders filled at the price on your trading screen at any moment; the market simply moves too fast. **********Gene L. Finn, former economist at both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers, advises traders to place limit orders at prices that are between the currently quoted bid and the offered prices. That enhances the odds that your order will be filled. **********If you think that you did not get the best price on a trade, ask your broker for a record of trades that were executed at the time you placed your order. This is called a ''time and sales,'' and it should reveal whether other orders were given priority over yours. Or it could show that your trade was far afield of prices at the time you placed it. **********Some brokers may not be willing to provide this information or walk an investor through it. The NASD Regulation's Web site, www.nasdr.com, has a complaint form you can fill out. **********Or you may want to pay for help. **********Greg F. Mazzeo, a former professional trader, has set up the Electronic Traders Assistance Association, a for-profit organization that will research five disputed trades for $200. The association's Web site is www.etaa.com.

Frankel, has emerged only in the last few days. **********The two companies' troubles underscore what may be one of the most significant aspects of the scandal: the fundamental structure of the insurance business means that companies across the industry -- and not just those directly linked to Mr. Frankel -- are potentially at risk. **********Government investigators think Mr. Frankel, a reclusive Greenwich, Conn., money manager who vanished in early May, orchestrated a fraud over almost a decade in which he embezzled huge sums of money from insurance companies that he controlled. **********But neither Capital Re nor Settlers Life was controlled by Mr. Frankel. Rather, they did business with his companies. As the scandal unfolded, both companies found themselves liable for huge sums of money as a result of their transactions with the Frankel empire. **********Insurance experts said such damage could continue to spread through the industry as other transactions with companies controlled by Mr. Frankel were uncovered. Even insurers that had no dealings with the companies under Mr. Frankel's control are likely to suffer financially. They will be required to contribute to funds designed to make sure policyholders do not suffer losses. Potentially, the contributions to the fund could lead to increased premium costs for other policyholders. **********Regulators estimate losses to Capital Re of about $67 million. They put the Virginia company's losses at about $44 million. Most of the tens of thousands of policies in seven companies controlled by Mr. Frankel provided benefits of less than $5,000 each and were designed to pay for funeral costs, regulators said. **********Repeated calls to the offices of Capital Re and to executives' homes on Friday afternoon were not returned. Settlers Life referred calls to state regulators. **********Both companies were involved in reinsurance, insurance that backs up the coverage of other insurers and is widely used in the industry to spread risk. In Capital Re's case, a subsidiary acted as an intermediary between one of Mr. Frankel's companies and other insurers. **********Steve Divine, the chief financial examiner for the Missouri Department of Insurance, said the Capital Re subsidiary received a commission for passing $67 million in policies to Mr. Frankel's companies. According to Virginia and Mississippi regulators, Settlers Life dealt directly with the First National Life Insurance Company of America, a Mississippi company under Mr. Frankel's control, transferring its own assets and deducting a portion as a fee for itself. Under insurance law, Capital Re and Settlers Life remained liable for the policies. **********Because of the lingering liability, it is vital for insurers to accurately assess the financial strength of companies to which they pass on or cede business. The Frankel-controlled companies that Capital Re and Settlers Life dealt with, like most of Mr. Frankel's companies, had low financial ratings. Most were equivalent to junk bonds. Regulators said that, just as with issuers of junk bonds, it is likely that Mr. Frankel paid higher-than-usual fees to entice companies to transfer assets to him. **********Insurers that seek assets from other companies calculate that they will be able to trim administrative costs and raise profits through economies of scale. Many also think that their investing skills will enable them to increase earnings on the assets. **********Mr. Frankel portrayed himself as an investing wizard. But regulators say it now appears that his real objective was to amass money in his insurance companies that he could siphon off through his investment company, Liberty National Securities. **********The effects of his dealings with Settlers Life were devastating. The company began the year with a comfortable $23 million in capital and surplus. But with the loss in Mr. Frankel's company, Settlers suddenly found itself more than $25 million short of the minimum of $4 million in capital and surplus that Virginia requires of insurers, and the regulators stepped in. **********The losses with Mr. Frankel's companies were the latest in a series of blows to Capital Re, which specializes in reinsuring relatively low-risk bond insurance. It was forced to set aside $44.1 million to cover claims on securities sold by Commercial Financial Services, a credit-card debt company that sought bankruptcy protection last December. It also reported potential losses of as much as $10 million in the insolvency of a Pittsburgh hospital system. In December, Michael E. Satz, who had been chief executive since helping to found Capital Re in 1988, was replaced by Jerome F. Jurschak, another founder. **********In February, Ace Ltd., one of the world's leaders in high-stakes commercial insurance, agreed to provide Capital Re with $75 million in exchange for a 12 percent stake in the company. **********In March, Moody's Investors Service cut Capital Re's financial rating by two notches from Moody's highest level, and the insurer's stock value dropped 16 percent. Ace then negotiated more favorable terms on its investment. **********An insurance trade publication, the National Underwriter, reported in April that Ace was offering to buy Capital Re. But, the trade paper said, Capital Re executives were unwilling; the company's stock would have to rebound before they agreed. The stock was then trading at $19.25. **********But over the Memorial Day weekend, with its stock several dollars lower, Capital Re simultaneously disclosed $67 million in losses and its decision to accept a merger offer from Ace for about $600 million in stock. That worked out to about book value. Analysts said similar companies would be expected to sell for one and a half to two times that. **********When Capital Re disclosed the losses, Mr. Frankel's connection with the failed companies was not known. Initially, the regulators' seizure of Settlers Life also appeared to be an isolated case. **********Several analysts said the latest losses would have increased pressure for another reduction in financial ratings, which might have been disastrous for Capital Re. But by joining with Ace, which has an estimated $31 billion in assets, Capital Re's finances were immediately shored up. **********''They didn't have much of a choice,'' Ira Zuckerman, an analyst at Nutmeg Securities, said. ''They pretty much had to take Ace's offer.'' **********Matthew L. Vetto, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that in Capital Re's area of specialization, backing up bonds, high financial ratings are essential. ''Contracts are signed on the basis of credit quality,'' he said. ''If that changes, the business can leave.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/03/technology/news-watch-engineered-for-the-aquarium-but-will-they-take-the-bait.html": {"writer_name": "Lisa Guernsey", "pub_date": "1999-06-03", "snippet": "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan is developing robotic fish that can swim in fish tank, wiggling its tail fin and two pectoral fins; company is considering making replicas of rare fish species for aquarium and museum exhibits; photo (S)", "word_count": 197, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Engineered for the Aquarium, But Will They Take the Bait?", "print_headline": "NEWS WATCH; Engineered for the Aquarium, But Will They Take the Bait?", "body_text": " **********Engineers in Japan appear to be getting into the robot business these days: first, Sony announced the arrival of Aibo, the robotic dog.

But it had rejected requests for contracts based on the transportation and utility averages by arguing that those averages were too narrow and possibly subject to manipulation and did not accurately reflect the industry segments. **********The court's decision leaves approval of the proposed contracts up to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which filed a brief in the case supporting part of the Chicago Board of Trade's position. **********Expanding the number and type of futures contracts it offers could give the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest financial futures and options exchange, an important lift at a crucial time. Like many exchanges where trading is conducted on a central floor, rather than over computer networks, the Board of Trade has been wrestling with how to compete with cheaper, more efficient rivals. **********Futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell a particular commodity at a fixed date in the future, are used by investors to hedge portfolios or to cheaply and quickly gain exposure to a commodity or market segment. **********For example, a futures contract based on a stock market average, like the Standard & Poor's 500, can be used by an investor to bet on the direction of the overall stock market at a fraction of the cost of buying each of the stocks in the index. **********In its ruling, the court rejected the S.E.C.'s arguments that the indexes were not ''broad based'' enough to satisfy securities laws. Specifically, an index that is the subject of a futures contract must reflect ''the market for all publicly traded equity or debt securities or a substantial segment thereof,'' or must be comparable to such a measure. **********The court decided that the law, as written, included indexes of single industries, and it noted that the long-term correlation of each of the Dow Jones averages and the industries they track exceeded 92 percent. **********In addition, the court rejected the S.E.C.'s arguments that futures contracts based on such narrow market measures could be used to manipulate securities prices. **********''If someone were determined to drive the price of transportation stocks up or down, buying and selling thousands of futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade would be like pouring a Dixie cup of water into Lake Michigan: there would be an effect, but it would not be detectable,'' Judge Frank H. Easterbrook wrote in the court's opinion. **********A spokesman for the S.E.C. said the commission was ''reviewing the decision and considering our alternatives,'' which include an appeal to the Supreme Court. A spokesman for the C.F.T.C. declined to comment on whether the commodity commission would approve the new contracts. **********Thomas R. Donovan, president and chief executive of the Chicago Board of Trade, said that he expected approval and that the exchange would be ready to trade the contracts. The exchange will consider other industry contracts as well, he said, while declining to elaborate.  But it is not far-fetched to imagine an Internet or other technology-stock index. **********''I could see futures contracts being created based on value or growth styles, or springing up along all kinds of industries,'' said Michael J. Brennan, a professor of finance at the Anderson School at UCLA. **********Some stock indexes might be too narrow or untested to fit the statutory requirements for a futures contract. But the appeals court specifically cited the age and history of the Dow Jones transportation and utility averages as lending weight to the position of the Board of Trade. **********The Dow Jones transportation average was started in 1884 by Charles Dow, a founder of Dow Jones & Company, to track nine railroads, a steamship company and Western Union. Now comprising 20 stocks, it is the oldest United States stock index, 12 years older than the Dow Jones industrial average. The utility average was started in 1929 with 20 stocks and now has 15. **********Since Dow Jones decided in 1997 to license its indexes for use in financial products like futures and options, the amount of money tracking those indexes -- and the fees that Dow Jones earns -- have grown sharply. At the end of June, $58 billion in assets were invested in financial products linked to the Dow Jones averages, up from $13.6 billion a year earlier. **********Specialized futures contracts would be of great value to mutual fund managers and other investment professionals, Mr. Brennan said. ''A mutual fund manager who has to manage cash flows in and out of a fund often holds cash in the bank,'' he said. ''But that means that he is under-invested, causing his performance to lag. A futures contract is a way to allow a manager to be fully invested at all times.'' **********Currently, an investment manager can bet on a specific industry using options on stock indexes, which are contracts that convey the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific security or basket of securities at a set price by a certain date. **********But such bets are more complicated using options than futures. Options contracts are written at specific prices, and therefore can expire worthless if the security's price does not move beyond the contract price. Futures contracts, by contrast, are open-ended bets on the market moving in a certain direction over a certain period of time. **********And because for any given stock or index many options with different exercise prices exist simultaneously, the volume of trading in each is relatively small. Trading in futures contracts, however, is usually concentrated in the contract that will expire the soonest. **********Statutes currently outlaw futures contracts based on single stocks, but such contracts on United States stocks are available in some overseas markets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/business/seniority-cashing-in-and-staying-put.html": {"writer_name": "Fred Brock", "pub_date": "1999-01-03", "snippet": "Advice for senior citizens on reverse mortgages (S)", "word_count": 916, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Cashing In, and Staying Put", "print_headline": "SENIORITY; Cashing In, and Staying Put", "body_text": " **********MORE than a decade ago, Cynthia Brown, a retiree in Monroe, La., was having trouble making ends meet with her monthly Social Security check. So she trekked to the local welfare office and signed up for food stamps. **********''I had to swallow my pride,'' she recalled. **********Then, in 1995, she heard about reverse home mortgages and got one through the Unity Mortgage Corporation. Her home, valued at $76,300, had been nearly paid for, and the reverse mortgage, which taps its value, allowed her to pay the remaining $4,000 she owed on the home and to establish a line of credit -- in her case, $27,300 -- to use as she wished. **********But this is no ordinary line of credit: She will never have to repay a penny as long as she lives in her house -- and she can live there as long as she wants. **********The extra money has enabled Ms. Brown, 79, to make repairs on her house and, after an intruder broke in and threatened her with a gun, to buy a burglar-alarm system. **********She is no longer on food stamps and can live on the money she gets from Social Security -- about $700 a month -- without having to worry that an unexpected expense could force her to sell her house. ''It was the best thing I ever did,'' she said. **********CASES like Ms. Brown's explain the growing popularity of reverse mortgages. They have been around since the 1960's, but 80 percent of them have been written in the last five years, according to the National Center for Home Equity Conversion in Apple Valley, Minn. **********The concept of a reverse mortgage is simple: You borrow against your home's value, but you are not required to make any repayments as long as you stay put. If you move or die, you or your heirs will pay back the loan by selling the house. In the meantime, no one can kick you out. **********And here's a really good part: If you live long enough for the accumulating interest to push the total debt above your home's value, the difference is paid by insurance that is built into the loan. That means the mortgage company can't touch anything else in your estate. **********However, these mortgages have many variations, and the details are complex. This has led some borrowers to turn unnecessarily to outside agents, who have charged fees of up to 10 percent of a loan for ''referral'' services or other information that is available free from the Government and other sources. **********That's one reason that the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the primary insurer of reverse mortgages, requires consumers to meet with H.U.D.-approved counselors before getting these loans. The only fees you should ever pay are regular loan application and origination fees -- directly to the lender. **********To qualify, homeowners must be at least 62. Mobile homes and co-ops (sorry, New Yorkers) are not eligible. The mortgages are not yet available in Texas. The amount you can borrow is limited, regardless of your home's value, and varies from state to state and even county to county. **********Of course, if you want to leave your home to your children, a reverse mortgage probably isn't for you. Ditto if you plan to sell your house anytime soon. **********You can receive the money in several ways: *********** As a credit line, either with a fixed limit, like Ms. Brown's, or one that increases each year. *********** In a lump-sum cash payment. *********** In monthly payments for a specified number of years or as long as you live in your home. **********Of course, if you take the cash payment, you can invest the proceeds in an annuity that will provide monthly payments to you for the rest of your life, no matter where you live. **********But a number of factors, including loan costs, should be considered in deciding which option is best. **********A good source of information is the National Center for Home Equity Conversion's Internet site (www.reverse.org). It contains an on-line calculator: You enter your birth date, the location of your home and its value to see how much money you might get from a reverse mortgage. The center, a nonprofit organization, also publishes a book, ''Reverse Mortgages for Beginners,'' which can be ordered by calling (800) 247-6553. It costs $14.95, plus $4.50 for shipping and handling. **********The payment options for reverse mortgages can be blended or even changed later. Martha York Clements, 76, a widow in Port St. Lucie, Fla., wanted to supplement her monthly income of $1,146 from Social Security and an annuity. Last year she took out a reverse mortgage on her $80,000 home, electing to take a combination of a $5,000 lump-sum payment and a monthly payment of $300 for life. **********''It's a terrific thing,'' she said. I intend to live long enough to use up all the value in my house and then some.'' **********And you don't have to be pressed for cash to get a reverse mortgage. Aleck and Sheila Townsley, both 65, live in Foster City, Calif., in a $555,000 house that overlooks San Francisco Bay. They have a comfortable retirement income from her years as a teacher and his as a lawyer. Through GMAC Mortgage, they chose a $65,000 line of credit that will eventually grow to $170,000 so they can afford ''extras'' like travel. **********''We have no children,'' Mr. Townsley said.

R. Baron, a brokerage concern that failed in July 1996. Most likely, the allegations would be aiding and abetting securities fraud, along with record-keeping violations, which allowed Baron to operate outside of net capital rules. **********According to a person close to the investigation, a settlement would probably require Bear Stearns to make a payment of substantially more than the $10 million it recently offered. Earlier in the negotiations, the firm had floated the possibility of a $1 million settlement. With securities regulators preparing to file suit, Bear Stearns has raised the offer in an attempt to avoid litigation. The payment would probably consist of both a penalty and a restitution fund for investors who lost money with Baron. **********The settlement would not necessarily end separate criminal investigations nor would a restitution fund automatically cover all claims against Bear Stearns that have been privately brought in the Baron matter. **********The settlement may also not address the future of Richard Harriton, the man who has run the Bear Stearns Clearing Corporation since 1979. Mr. Harriton, 64, is represented by his own lawyer and his settlement talks with the S.E.C. are being conducted separately. Mr. Harriton's lawyer, Howard Wilson of Rosenman & Colin, did not return a phone call seeking comment. **********A senior managing director of the firm, Mr. Harriton turned the clearing business into a giant moneymaker for Bear Stearns, accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the company's profits in recent years. Along the way, Bear Stearns provided clearing services to a number of small brokerage firms that came under intense scrutiny by securities regulators for their hard-sell tactics peddling obscure stocks to unsuspecting individual investors. This in turn brought regulatory scrutiny to Bear Stearns. **********The S.E.C. began its investigation into Bear Stearns in 1997 after the failure of Baron, a brokerage firm that prosecutors say stole $75 million from investors. As clearing firm for Baron, Bear Stearns processed the trades for Baron's customers and supplied the small firm with the capital needed to underwrite stock offerings and conduct other securities operations. After Baron failed, investors who had lost money with the firm filed suit against Bear Stearns, charging that the larger firm had ignored signs of malfeasance and fraud at Baron and that without the backing of Bear Stearns, Baron would never have been able to persuade investors to entrust the firm with their funds. **********Bear Stearns executives have maintained that their firm did nothing wrong and that as a clearing firm, it had no responsibility to the customers of Baron or other firms. **********Bear Stearns provided clearing services for many of the small brokerage firms that sprang up in the late 1980's and early 1990's that ran afoul of regulators. The clearing customers of Bear Stearns have included Stratton Oakmont. a firm closed by regulators in 1996 and Sterling Foster, which was indicted by a grand jury for securities fraud in a case brought by the United States Attorney for Manhattan last year. Bear Stearns also cleared trades for Rooney Pace, a brokerage firm that was shut down by regulators in 1987. Randolph Pace, a principal of Rooney Pace, who has also been indicted in the Sterling Foster case, is a close friend of Mr. Harriton, according to people who know them. **********If a deal is struck with regulators, Bear Stearns would neither admit nor deny culpability in the Baron case. The commission would likely say in the settlement papers that Bear Stearns committed securities fraud by aiding Baron in its fraud. The settlement may also charge that Bear Stearns enabled the firm to continue operating even when Baron's capital fell below regulatory requirements. Moreover, Bear Stearns may not have maintained proper records in connection with its clearing of Baron's trades. **********As part of the settlement, Bear Stearns would likely agree to hire an outside consultant to help it improve its clearing procedures and to supervise changes made to its operations. **********While Bear Stearns refused to comment on the settlement talks, the company has steadfastly maintained that Mr. Harriton has done nothing wrong as the head of clearing and that his job at the brokerage firm remains secure. In recent days, however, that staunch support appears to be fading, according to a person close to the firm. **********If Bear Stearns reaches a settlement with the S.E.C., the firm will not be out of the woods completely. It is the subject of several criminal investigations for its clearing operations for various defunct brokerage firms. Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, is investigating Bear Stearns in connection with the Baron mess. According to a person close to that investigation, Mr. Morgenthau has not yet decided whether to end his office's investigation of the firm as part of an S.E.C. settlement. Mr. Morgenthau won 13 convictions of Baron executives and brokers last year. **********The United States Attorney for Manhattan is also investigating Bear Stearns in its capacity as the clearing firm for Sterling Foster. Prosecutors in that case say that Sterling Foster manipulated six small stocks that it underwrote and that it was secretly controlled by Mr. Pace, who had been barred from the securities industry. An S.E.C. settlement would not affect this investigation. A spokesman for the United States Attorney declined to comment."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/08/business/nike-identifies-plants-abroad-making-goods-for-universities.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1999-10-08", "snippet": "Nike Inc, in significant concession to anti-sweatshop movement on college campuses, becomes first large apparel company to disclose names and sites of dozens of its overseas factories; student groups praise Nike for its disclosures about factories...", "word_count": 767, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Nike Identifies Plants Abroad Making Goods For Universities", "print_headline": "Nike Identifies Plants Abroad Making Goods For Universities", "body_text": " **********In a significant concession to the anti-sweatshop movement on college campuses, Nike Inc. became the first large apparel company yesterday to disclose the names and sites of dozens of its overseas factories -- a move that the college groups said was vital to uncover unsatisfactory working conditions. **********Student groups praised Nike for its disclosures about factories in Bangladesh, China, Guatemala, Thailand and other countries, saying that having the names and addresses would make it far easier to verify whether Nike had made good on its promises to improve working conditions. **********Last spring, students held demonstrations at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and dozens of other colleges and universities, demanding that universities force companies making apparel with school logos to disclose the names and addresses of their factories. All told, manufacturers like Nike, Champion, Adidas and Gear for Sports produce $2.5 billion worth of goods each year bearing the names of hundreds of colleges. **********Nike, the giant footwear manufacturer, which has been a prime target of labor rights groups, disclosed the names of the 41 overseas factories it uses to make athletic gear for Duke, Georgetown, the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina and the University of Arizona. The 41 factories are in 11 countries and make sweatshirts, T-shirts, shorts and other apparel carrying school names. **********Several student leaders said that Nike's move would improve the image of a company that has been battered by a wave of criticism that it used overseas sweatshops. Nike officials insist that they maintain satisfactory conditions at the 545 factories the company uses worldwide. They say every plant Nike uses is inspected annually by an independent auditing firm. **********Until Nike's move yesterday, apparel companies refused to disclose the names and addresses of their factories, asserting that such information was a valuable secret. Many companies said they feared that if their competitors learned where their factories were, those competitors might try to supplant them at those factories in an effort to expand. **********Nike's disclosures are expected to place considerable pressure on other apparel makers to follow suit, especially because several universities have threatened to drop their licensees unless they make similar disclosures. **********''What Nike did is important,'' said Eric Brakken, an organizer for United Students Against Sweatshops, a coalition of campus groups. ''It blows open the whole notion that other companies are putting forward that they can't make such disclosures.'' **********Mr. Brakken added, ''Disclosure is important because it allows us to talk to people in these overseas communities -- religious leaders, human rights leaders -- who are then able to go and examine and verify working conditions.'' **********In demonstrations last year, students demanded not only that apparel companies disclose factory names but also that factories pay a living wage and take strong action to prevent harassment and discrimination against female workers. **********Nike announced its disclosure by running advertisements in newspapers at the five universities. It also posted the names and addresses of the 41 factories on its Web site (www.nikebiz.com). **********''We decided that it was the right way to go as a company,'' said Simon Pestridge, Nike's manager for labor practices. ''If a university decides that disclosure is the way to go, then that university has an absolute right to know where that product is produced. We've never disagreed with the philosophy that students and universities have a right to know that.'' **********University officials welcomed Nike's move. Rutledge Tufts, an administrator at the University of North Carolina, who is co-chairman of that school's licensing labor code advisory committee, said that Nike was setting a great example and that the school was asking other licensees to do the same thing. **********Mr. Tufts said having factories inspected every few months might not be enough to insure fair working conditions. ''What we're hoping is that with these disclosures, groups in the communities around the factories will be able to support these efforts to insure satisfactory conditions,'' he said. ''That way, we'll be able to get a picture of conditions across the entire year rather than at moments in time.'' **********Bruce Siegal, general counsel of the Collegiate Licensing Corporation, which represents 180 colleges and universities in negotiations with manufacturers, said: ''Many universities will certainly view Nike's action as a step in the right direction. Will other license manufacturers follow suit? I don't know. But Nike has certainly raised the stakes.'' **********Nike's announcement was one of the biggest victories thus far by the campus anti-sweatshop movement. **********Jo-Ann Mort, communications director for the nation's largest apparel workers' union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said: ''This is a small, but significant victory gained by the student movement.

While Microsoft the gorilla wrestles the Justice Department in a landmark antitrust suit, Microsoft the upstart is asking the same agency to investigate possible antitrust violations by the nation's airlines. **********The company's MSN Expedia is among a group of Web-based travel agencies that are furious over the airlines' own aggressive on-line ticket sales and the slim commissions they pay on-line agencies. The group contends that the airlines' practices are keeping most travel agents off the Web and making business untenable for those who do venture on line. **********That, in turn, could eventually drive up fares for consumers by limiting choice, Microsoft contends. **********''We're concerned things are happening in the marketplace that are disadvantageous to the on-line travel agent,'' said Simon Breakwell, the general manager of Microsoft's travel business unit. ''There are implications for consumer choice, and that would have implications on price.'' **********Three travel agency associations representing Microsoft and other on-line agents will jointly file an antitrust complaint with the Justice Department by the end of this month, said Reid Detchon, executive director of one of the three, the Interactive Travel Services Association. Microsoft's Mr. Breakwell sits on the association's board and was instrumental in the decision to file. **********Joining the association in the complaint will be the American Society of Travel Agents, of which Microsoft is also a member, and the Coalition for Travel Industry Parity. **********The American Society of Travel Agents' senior vice president for legal affairs, Paul Ruden, said through a spokeswoman that the Justice Department filing was ''imminent.'' The society filed its own complaint in December contending that airlines were attempting to control Internet sales. **********Microsoft apparently sees no contradiction in crossing swords with the Government to protect its monopoly in one industry while pointing an antitrust finger at a group of heavyweight companies in another industry. In fact, the group's complaint will be addressed to Joel I. Klein, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and the man who masterminded the lawsuit against Microsoft. **********''The two are entirely unrelated,'' Mr. Breakwell said. Suzi LeVine, Expedia's product manager, added, ''It's just a matter of us being a part of what is right for consumers and the industry.'' **********And while Microsoft's general counsel, William Neukom, declined requests for an interview, a spokesman said the company's continuing battle with the Government ''does not prevent us from moving forward with our business strategies.'' **********The travel agency filing is not a suit but a complaint asking that the Government investigate the airlines. At stake is the $29.4 billion that Forrester Research says on-line consumers will be paying for airline tickets and other travel products in 2003. **********While travel agents sell 80 percent of all airline tickets in the physical world, they sell only 50 percent of all tickets on line, said a Forrester analyst, Seema Williams. And even that share is falling fast. Forrester predicts that on-line agents' portion of the Web market will plummet to 25 percent by 2003 as the airlines step up efforts to sell directly through their own Web sites. **********Airlines have been cutting commissions since 1995, forcing many agents to start charging customers for their services and to increase their mix of vacation and cruise packages, which earn higher commission rates. The knife has been particularly sharp for on-line agents. Many airlines limit on-line commissions to $10 for domestic flights, well below the $50 cap on bookings by agents in the physical world. **********This has added to on-line travel agencies' red ink. Preview Travel, the largest publicly held on-line agency, reported a 1998 loss of $27 million, including a $4.2 million write-down of a travel-video business, on revenue of $14 million. **********Microsoft's Ms. LeVine would not disclose Expedia's operating losses, but she described commissions as ''the carrot that gets pushed further and further away.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/30/business/goldman-sachs-to-take-stake-in-wit-capital.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Wyatt", "pub_date": "1999-03-30", "snippet": "Goldman Sachs Group to buy 22 percent of Wit Capital Group, pioneer in using Internet to sell stocks to individual investors; investment joins together two of Wall Street's more disparate institutions and shows how Internet has changed almost ever...", "word_count": 817, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Goldman Sachs To Take Stake In Wit Capital", "print_headline": "Goldman Sachs To Take Stake In Wit Capital", "body_text": " **********Goldman Sachs Group, the venerable investment partnership that is planning an initial offering of its shares to the public, said yesterday that it would buy 22 percent of Wit Capital Group, a pioneer in using the Internet to sell stocks to individual investors. **********The investment, which comes as Wit Capital is preparing its own initial public offering, joins two of Wall Street's more disparate institutions and illustrates how the Internet has changed almost everything about the way the securities industry does business. **********Goldman is the 130-year-old partnership that made its reputation in large part by avoiding Wall Street fads; if it completes its public offering as expected this spring, it will be the last of the big Wall Street investment partnerships to go public. **********Wit Capital, in contrast, recently sprang from one of Wall Street's more ill-fated and short-lived crazes, the fever for publicly traded microbreweries. In 1996, Andrew D. Klein, a former associate at the law firm of Cravath, Swain & Moore, founded Wit Capital to underwrite shares of the Spring Street Brewing Company, producer of Wit beer, a wheat-brewed spiced ale. Wit offered shares of Spring Street directly to investors over the Internet and gave them an electronic forum to trade the shares, presaging today's frenzy for anything that can be sold over or linked to the Internet. **********In the three years since, Wit Capital has greatly expanded its securities business, participating as a member of the underwriting group in dozens of public stock offerings. In addition, its on-line brokerage operation has about 20,000 customers, and it recently hired a high-profile financial analyst from Merrill Lynch & Company to head an equity research department to offer them research. Wit Capital is also planning to start an after-hours, Internet-based market for stock trading. **********People close to the transaction between Goldman and Wit said yesterday, however, that Goldman's interest was primarily in Wit Capital's ability to include individual investors in initial public offerings, an ability that is particularly attractive to the many Internet-related companies that in recent months have rushed to sell shares to the public. **********As such, Goldman is not likely to try to exploit the link with Wit for entree into the on-line stock brokerage business, these people said. While on-line brokerage has grown rapidly in popularity among individual investors, Goldman's client base is almost exclusively made up of institutions, like pension and mutual funds, and very wealthy individuals. **********Goldman will buy shares and equivalents representing about 22 percent of Wit's shares before the offering. Goldman would not disclose how much it agreed to pay for the stake, which includes warrants to buy shares at a price which has yet to be determined. But a person close to the investment said that Goldman was likely to own a stake that is similar in size to that of Capital Z Partners, a venture capital firm that recently invested $25 million in Wit Capital. **********Technology companies that operate Web sites catering to consumers have shifted the balance of power among underwriters and companies seeking to go public. Traditionally, the underwriters placed shares of the hottest offerings almost exclusively in the hands of their biggest institutional clients; any individuals who wanted to invest in a newly public company had to wait until the shares started trading, often at sharply higher prices. **********Now, however, many Internet companies are requiring underwriters who want their business to include an Internet company's most loyal customers in the public offering. That has led to links between traditional investment banks like Salomon Smith Barney and BancBoston Robertson Stephens and electronic or discount brokers like Fidelity Investments or E*Trade. **********Wit Capital's link with Goldman Sachs is therefore likely to immeasurably raise its stature by giving it a part in Goldman's generally high-profile deals. While Wit is only one of several electronic brokerage firms that have linked with investment banks to help place shares of initial public offerings in the hands of individual investors, Goldman generally attracts more sought-after clients. **********Wit Capital has recently served as the ''e-manager'' of several high-profile public offerings, coordinating the distribution of shares among individual investors of offerings by, among others, Earthweb and Marketwatch.com. **********Goldman Sachs recently set up a committee to sort out the firm's Internet strategy, which includes investments in Archipelago and Optimark, electronic trading networks, and in a handful of Internet start-up companies. While its negotiations with Wit gained speed since that committee began its work, the talks have stretched over a year, people involved in the transaction said. **********Wit Capital will soon reveal details about Goldman's investment in a revised version of its initial offering statement, which it is required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission before it completes its sale of shares to the public. While Goldman and Capital Z are expected to own stakes of roughly equal size, Capital Z also received the right to elect two members to the board of  Wit Capital. Goldman is not expected to nominate any directors for Wit's board."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/11/business/3com-microsoft-venture-to-develop-pc-products.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Schiesel", "pub_date": "1999-03-11", "snippet": "Microsoft Corp and 3Com Corp plan to jointly develop in-home computer networking products to let consumers use same computer peripherals for every computer (M)", "word_count": 299, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "3Com-Microsoft Venture to Develop PC Products", "print_headline": "3Com-Microsoft Venture to Develop PC Products", "body_text": " **********The Microsoft Corporation and the 3Com Corporation today intend to announce an alliance to jointly develop products to connect personal computers and computer peripherals within homes, executives from the two companies said yesterday. **********One of the concepts behind the venture is that consumers could save money by sharing modems, printers, scanners and removable storage devices like zip disks by linking PC's into in-home networks rather than buy multiple peripherals to cover each computer in a home.

In the meantime, Amazon has expanded its book-return policy as a way to demonstrate its faith in its recommendations; in a company statement, Amazon's chief executive and founder, Jeff Bezos, said that it will accept a title from a dissatisfied customer ''no matter how dogeared or worn it is.'' **********On Monday, The New York Times reported that Amazon had fashioned an ''E-merchandising'' program for book publishers; in exchange for advertising fees of as much as $12,500, the program provides featured treatment of titles in categories that range from ''What We're Reading'' to ''Destined for Greatness.'' **********Amazon, which did not disclose the advertising fees to its customers, contended that its sites were not for sale because its staff editors screened and vetted books worthy of highlighting. **********Yesterday's change in policy signaled a recognition that with its reviews, recommendations and friendly interaction with customers, Amazon is a hybrid -- both electronic bookseller and adviser, somehow different from bookstore chains or supermarkets that commonly sell shelf space for products. **********''We're always listening to our customers and it was clear that our customers had a higher expectation for us than the physical bookselling world,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman for the company, which is based in Seattle. **********Mr. Curry said that customers had sent Amazon electronic mail expressing surprise at its advertising program. **********Mr. Curry said that Amazon would continue to offer the advertising program to publishers, but that it would create a system indicating which features are paid for. **********Amazon started the program last June and then expanded its scope and prices in January, attracting money called ''cooperative advertising allowances'' from many major publishers including Random House, Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins, Warner Books and Penguin Putnam. **********About 20 to 50 publishers were offered the program, and Amazon planned to extend the same opportunities to more publishers later this year. The program drew a mixed response from publishers: some smaller presses feared they would not be able to afford to participate, while larger publishers considered the promotions equivalent to the front table space or shelf-end caps offered for co-op advertising dollars by bookstore chains. **********For instance, Random House, now owned by Bertelsmann A.G., paid Amazon for featured treatment of Peter Jennings's best seller, ''The Century.''

That leaves the current expansion on track to set a record for longevity early next year. **********At the same time, the Fed said most regions of the country reported more jobs than workers to fill them. ''Despite the labor shortages, none of the districts report evidence of any broad-based acceleration in wages,'' the report said. ''There is no evidence of any broad-based pickup in consumer price inflation.'' **********Tight labor markets were reported in most districts, the Fed said. ''There are severe shortages of skilled construction workers in most districts,'' the report said. **********Still, with little wage pressure, ''consumer prices remain relatively stable despite some apparent intensification in input price pressures,'' the report said. Prices for construction materials, transportation and energy have been rising, it said. **********''Retail sales, which had been robust in the second quarter, decelerated somewhat in July, in some cases due to low inventories of clearance merchandise,'' the report said. ''Manufacturing activity continues to expand in most parts of the country, though a few districts indicate some softening.'' **********The report, known as the beige book, will help form the basis for discussion on interest rate policy at the Aug. 24 meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee. Still, the anecdotal details of the report will not do a great deal to enlighten committee members, who will have already seen detailed statistics on employment and prices for July as well as internal Fed analyses of economic conditions. **********''People have been saying a Fed tightening is a slam-dunk on Aug. 24, but it's not,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago. **********The latest beige book underscores other reports that the economy is not slowing as much as the Fed had expected earlier this year. **********The July employment report showed that the economy added 310,000 workers, after an increase of 273,000 in June, while hourly wages rose at the fastest pace in half a year. Unemployment stayed just a tenth of a point above the three-decade low of 4.2 percent earlier in the year. **********That is just the mixture that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned about last month in his twice-yearly message to Congress. **********''If new data suggest it is likely that the pace of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve will have to act promptly and forcefully'' to raise interest rates, he told the House Banking Committee on July 22. **********Inflation, however, has remained in check. The Consumer Price Index was unchanged in May and June after jumping seven-tenths of a percent in April. The core rate of the index, which excludes food and energy costs, rose just one-tenth of a percent the previous two months. **********And that is a conundrum for the Fed.

It was the first time in memory that Hong Kong's authorities had demanded to search a newspaper's editorial offices. **********After a stunned pause, the paper reverted to form. **********As the agents from Hong Kong's anticorruption agency brandished a search warrant, the Apple photographers mobbed them, snapping furiously. Four hours later, the agents left with boxes of paper from a crime reporter's desk. On Wednesday, the reporter and two police officers were charged with conspiracy in a plan to bribe the police for tips on investigations. **********The scandal has riveted Hong Kong -- and not just because it allowed other papers to gloat over a rival brought low. It also dramatizes how the press has become both a bully and a potential victim in this former British colony. Publishers will stop at little to sell papers these days, it is widely agreed. But that has emboldened Hong Kong's leaders to crack down on what they view as an unprincipled, sleaze-mongering media. **********''The tabloids are disgusting,'' said Albert Cheng, a popular radio-show host. ''They have no respect for anybody. And we're not talking about celebrities; we're talking about ordinary people. If a woman gets raped, they'll report it with all kinds of personal details.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Cheng said he was concerned that the government had obtained a sweeping search warrant for a newsroom. And he is strongly against a new proposal to create a government-linked panel that would handle complaints against the news media. The panel, which would operate independently of the courts, would be able to impose fines of up to $125,000 for what it judged as overly intrusive coverage. **********Critics say that in the politically charged atmosphere of Hong Kong -- where the real sensitivities are about Beijing, not people's bedrooms -- such a panel would be used to stifle dissenting voices. **********''The government wants to control the press,'' said Mak Yin-ting, the chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. ''This is going to be an everlasting battle. Even if we defeat this proposal, they will use other legislation to limit the ability of the press to report the news.'' **********Defenders of China often point to Hong Kong's rambunctious news media as proof that Beijing has not meddled in this enclave. And it is true that despite occasional grousing about government pressure or self-censorship, Hong Kong remains a vibrant newspaper town. There are 23 Chinese-language and two English-language papers here, ranging from the high-minded Ming Pao to the downmarket Sun. **********''There's no place in the world that goes to such lengths to stayed informed,'' said Michael DeGolyer, the director of an academic project that surveys attitudes about Hong Kong's return to China. ''As refugees, Hong Kong people have learned that what you don't know can run you over.'' **********But in the two years since the handover, Hong Kong's papers have changed, focusing less on politics and Hong Kong's relationship with China and more on sex and crime. Part of this is linked to broader trends in the news media. But part of it, experts say, is also linked to Hong Kong's evolution from a colony with an uncertain future to a Chinese city that is being absorbed gradually into the motherland. **********''When the British were here, their fights with China were on the front page every day,'' said Liu Kin-ming, the opinion-page editor of The Apple Daily. ''But after the handover, people got bored. As people have gotten tired of substantial news, sensational news has become more popular.'' **********The Apple epitomizes that progression. Founded in 1995 by Jimmy Lai, an apparel magnate turned media baron, the paper made its name with its fierce defense of Hong Kong's independence. Mr. Lai became a bete noire in Beijing when he referred to Li Peng, the former Chinese prime minister and the man who ordered the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, as ''the son of a turtle's egg.'' **********Today, The Apple is best known for its brazen coverage of philandering husbands, despondent wives and scantily clad mistresses. **********In a notorious case last year, The Apple gave front-page coverage to a Hong Kong man who visited prostitutes in mainland China shortly after his wife pushed their two young children out of the family's high-rise apartment and jumped after them to her death. The backlash against the coverage was so severe that Mr. Lai later published a front-page apology. **********Mr. Lai acknowledged that The Apple Daily had sometimes crossed the line. He attributed it to the paper's fierce competition with The Oriental Daily News, which also wrote about the faithless husband. But he noted that readers retaliate against offensive coverage by boycotting the newspaper. After last year's incident, the Apple's circulation of about 400,000 fell by 10 percent for a few weeks. **********''Public opinion is a powerful lever in regulating the media,'' Mr. Lai said. ''We don't want to offend our readers. You can go overboard being a popular newspaper.'' **********Mr. Lai declined to discuss the raid on his newsroom. But journalists at The Apple and other Hong Kong papers said payoffs to officials were a common way of ferreting out information. **********The anticorruption commission said a police investigation found that the Apple reporter had offered two police spokesmen monthly payments of $500 and $1,000, respectively, for scoops on investigations. **********Given the prevalence of checkbook journalism here, some people question whether The Apple Daily was being singled out because of Mr. Lai's maverick style. In addition to The Apple, he owns a news magazine, Next, and a grocery and electronics home-delivery service, known as Admart, which has raised hackles among Hong Kong's corporate elite because it is taking on powerful local merchants. **********''This is the first time in Hong Kong's history that the police entered a newsroom and took things,'' said Yeung Wai-hong, the publisher of Next. ''I'm afraid it's only the opening gambit.'' **********Some journalists worry that the Apple affair could fortify those in the government who argue that Hong Kong's press is incapable of policing itself. Since it was floated in August, the idea of a press council has drawn sharp criticism from journalists, lawyers, and Hong Kong's legislators, who voted it down in a nonbinding ballot. But Raymond Wacks, a member of the panel that drafted the proposal, said the panel could still plow ahead with the proposal or suggest other measures, like tightening Hong Kong's privacy laws. **********''People have interpreted this as some sort of ultimatum,'' Mr. Wacks said. ''Our exclusive concern is individuals whose privacy has been invaded by the media.'' **********For Mr. Cheng, the radio commentator, the biggest danger is that the newspapers will persist in their blood-and-cheesecake style, which could give the authorities an excuse to clamp down later. ''The public is still behind a free press,'' he said, ''but that could change. I'm very worried.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/08/business/advisory-firm-s-chairman-pleads-not-guilty.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-10-08", "snippet": "Martin Armstrong, chairman of Princeton Economics International Inc, pleads not guilty to charges he defrauded Japanese clients of almost $1 billion; prosecutors contend Armstrong, with complicity of Republic New York Corp executive William H Roge...", "word_count": 281, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advisory Firm's Chairman Pleads Not Guilty", "print_headline": "Advisory Firm's Chairman Pleads Not Guilty", "body_text": " **********Martin Armstrong, chairman of the investment advisory firm Princeton Economics International Inc., pleaded not guilty yesterday to charges he had defrauded Japanese clients of almost $1 billion. **********Mr. Armstrong entered his plea at a hearing in New York before a Federal magistrate judge, who allowed him to remain free on a $5 million bond until trial. **********Mr. Armstrong was charged on Sept. 13 with bilking Japanese investors of $950 million by concealing more than $367 million in trading losses and illegally using some investors' money to pay returns to earlier investors in a Ponzi scheme. **********The 49-year-old Mr. Armstrong, who made a name for himself by using computer models to forecast market trends, said that the case was more complicated than people realized.

''Call several times, or ask for a supervisor if you have an important question you want answered, or need to make a decision about buying a ticket.'' ***********Using the programs' automated systems and Web sites as much as possible, as these can save time. **********Mr. Petersen also recommended being courteous to representatives, who might be helpful in the long term. He said frequent fliers with elite status often could cultivate ''angels'' who can bend rules in the elite programs' call centers, which differ from the regular call centers. **********Hotel Update **********Leading Hotels of the World, the global marketer of luxury hotels, has established a new sales organization, Leading Small Hotels of the World, for luxury boutique hotels with 100 or fewer guest rooms. Like participants in Leading Hotels, hotels in the new group will be regularly inspected; officials said they would also feature innovative or classical design and be expected to offer customized, personal service. Members of the new group include One Aldwych in London, the Lancaster and the Hotel Raphael in Paris, the Carlton Hotel Baglioni in Milan, the Clarence in Dublin and the Lowell in New York. **********A report from Merrill Lynch on hotel loyalty programs operated by Marriott International, Hilton Hotels and Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide rated Marriott No. 1. According to the report by two securities analysts, Denise Wilder Warren and Kirk Materne, to earn one free night at a New York hotel managed by any of these three companies requires that a traveler spend $3,000 with Marriott, $3,500 with Hilton and $5,000 with Starwood, which owns Sheraton and Westin hotels. Over all, the report called Marriott's program the best because it is the oldest and has a membership of more than 11 million, as well as having the largest selection of locations and the largest number of brands. **********Electronic Tickets **********Continental Airlines and America West, which have a code-sharing agreement, now issue so-called electronic interline tickets for each other. This means that travelers whose itinerary involves both airlines may use an electronic ticket for their entire trip; it also means that if their plans change, the electronic ticket issued by one airline will be good on the other. Continenal has a minority stake in America West. **********AMR's American Airlines and Canadian Airlines, which also have a code-sharing accord and are part of the One World Alliance, began offering electronic interline tickets last June. Officials at American said they expected to offer such ticketing to travelers flying on other One World carriers next year, as well as to passengers on United Airlines. AMR owns 25 percent of Canadian Airlines. **********United said it and Air Canada, both part of the Star Alliance, would offer electronic interline tickets next March. A spokesman for United said it would also offer these tickets to travelers on six other airlines -- including some United States carriers and others in the Star Alliance -- by the end of 2000."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/12/business/market-insight-media-deals-written-larger.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1999-09-12", "snippet": "Kenneth Gilpin interviews Sanford C Bernstein & Co senior media analyst Tom Wolzien, who comments on proposed merger between Viacom and CBS and other developments in entertainment industry; photo (M)", "word_count": 798, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Media Deals, Written Larger", "print_headline": "MARKET INSIGHT; Media Deals, Written Larger", "body_text": " **********IN what is supposedly a business that fosters and rewards creativity, the people who run big entertainment companies certainly look like a bunch of copycats. **********Time was, network television, radio and the movies more or less operated in their own orbits. Cable and then the Web shook up that structure, helped to break down the barriers and strengthened the argument for what is now a vertically integrated industry. **********The need for size and control over all facets of the production and distribution process was a driving force behind last week's announcement of a $37 billion merger of  Viacom and CBS. **********Trying to keep up with its peers, NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric, seems on the verge of buying a stake in Paxson Communications, which not only has a big stable of television stations but also a sizable cable presence. Of course, just because everybody has the same idea doesn't necessarily make it a good idea. Tom Wolzien, a senior media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, took some time last week to talk about the Viacom/CBS combination and other developments in the entertainment business. Here are excerpts from the conversation. **********Q. What were the most important considerations driving this merger? **********A. The first thing was a perceived need for parity with the other big players, the Time Warners, Disneys and News Corps of the world. The ability to sell more advertising within all these interrelated businesses that are part of Viacom/CBS was probably the second reason. And there may have been some cost benefits. **********This is now the fourth company that is vertically integrated. Once the laws, regulations and consent decrees that prevented networks from owning studios or vice versa, went away in the early 1990's, it was inevitable that this sort of a deal would happen. **********What is refreshing about this deal is that no one is saying we are getting huge immediate synergies out of this. They seem to be saying this is a good thing for the long term. **********Q. That said, has the concept of owning and operating television and movie production studios proved successful? **********A. What it does provide is negotiating parity with the other players who have the same thing -- production and distribution. **********If you don't have that, you find yourself in a situation like NBC had with hit shows like ''E.R.'' and ''Friends,'' where they would end up spending record amounts to re-sign those programs that they didn't own. **********It may be that if NBC had been selling product to Time Warner, which owned those shows, they would not have been taken to the cleaners, because Time Warner would want to make sure that if the tables were turned, it would get a fair deal from NBC. **********In terms of corporate structure, that is the argument for parity: Once you get the A-bomb, I have to have an A-bomb. **********The problem with this is costs. As you create additional product for your outlets, it costs you money. **********Q. Before cable, network television was a cozy, controlled oligopoly. Isn't the consolidation we are seeing now creating a bigger, broader version of the same thing? **********A. In the end, this is a world of five or six big guys, versus three in the previous period. Those five or six players -- Disney, Time Warner, News Corp, Viacom, NBC -- will control the bulk of the business through multiple distribution pathways. **********It's a bit like Coca-Cola at the supermarket. Twenty or 30 years ago, Coke didn't have as much shelf space as it has today. But it occupied one-third of the space that was there. Today, the soft-drink aisle at the supermarket is much longer, but Coke's percentage of it is about the same. **********Q. Is there much left for the big guys to gobble up? **********A. NBC is the only thing left on the network television side. On the studio side there is Barry Diller's USA Networks' studios. Sony has a television studio, but no network. And there are MGM and Dreamworks, which does some television work. **********The combination you can't rule out is one between Time Warner and NBC. **********Q. What happens in the next recession? **********A. Everyone would suffer in a recession. But a downturn would be ugly for Viacom, because it is now almost entirely based on advertising revenue. **********Disney would suffer differently. Their broadcasting operations would get whacked first, but the impact on their theme parks would be delayed. The impact of a recession at Disney would not be as sharp as at Viacom, but it would last longer. **********Time Warner has the buffer of the cable systems, which have proven to be more resistant to recessions. **********Q. Which of the stocks do you like? **********A. With the CBS deal, I think there is upside potential for Viacom. Time Warner has tremendous potential on the Internet. And Disney, despite its big near-term problems, is a tremendous value play."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/27/business/company-news-canfor-agrees-to-buy-joint-venture-of-mead-and-nexfor.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-08-27", "snippet": "Canfor Corp agrees to acquire Northwood Inc, pulp and lumber operation jointly owned by Mead Corp and Nexfor Inc, for $635 million (Canadian), or about $425 million (US); Canfor will assume $113 million of Northwood debt (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CANFOR AGREES TO BUY JOINT VENTURE OF MEAD AND NEXFOR", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CANFOR AGREES TO BUY JOINT VENTURE OF MEAD AND NEXFOR", "body_text": " **********The Canfor Corporation agreed yesterday to acquire Northwood Inc., a pulp and lumber operation jointly owned by the Mead Corporation and Nexfor Inc., for $635 million (Canadian), or about $425 million (United States).

It also said it had information concerning the possible involvement of Iranian officials in the attack. **********The deportation of Hani el-Sayegh, a Saudi Arabian dissident who once lived in Iran, came after the Administration disclosed last week that President Clinton had sent a letter to President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, asking for help in finding those responsible for the bombing. **********''We do have information about the involvement of Iranian officials but have not reached the conclusion that this was directed by the Government of Iran,'' a senior State Department official said today. **********The Administration has ''made it clear to Iran we want and expect its cooperation,'' the official said, referring to Mr. Clinton's message to Mr. Khatami. **********Until now, according to officials, the Administration has been reluctant to acknowledge possible Iranian involvement in the attack, in part because shortly after the bombing at the Khobar Towers apartments, the Administration threatened to retaliate with a military attack against any foreign government found to be responsible. **********A retaliatory attack against Iran, the officials said, would not be in the interests of neighboring Saudi Arabia, which is Washington's closest ally in the region and has markedly improved its relations with Iran. Such retaliation is not in the interests of the Clinton Administration, either, officials said, since Washington has been exploring ways of trying to improve relations with Iran and the relatively moderate Mr. Khatami. **********The one-page letter from Mr. Clinton, delivered through an Omani intermediary in August, appeared to be an effort to solve the Khobar Towers case, a move that could then help clear the way for warmer relations with Teheran, officials said. **********The Iranian Government responded to Mr. Clinton with a letter in which it denied any involvement in the Khobar bombing, an Administration official said. In their letter, the Iranians noted that the American Government had never brought to justice the captain of the Vincennes, the American warship that shot down an Iranian passenger airliner by mistake in the 1980's, the Administration official said. **********Law enforcement officers have long known that several Saudi men, believed to have been trained and possibly financed by the Iranians, fled to Iran after the bombing. The suspects in Iran are believed to have been members of the Saudi branch of Hezbollah, or Party of God, a terrorist group with strong ties to Iran. **********The investigation into the Khobar Towers bombing on June 25, 1996, which involved a fuel truck packed with tons of explosives detonated outside an apartment building housing American military personnel, ran into difficulties from the outset. **********Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation publicly complained about lack of cooperation from the Saudi Government. But in the last eight months or so, cooperation from the Saudis in the investigation had improved, officials said. The Administration is now satisfied with the level of Saudi cooperation, they said. **********An Administration official said F.B.I. agents had been allowed to sit in on questioning in Saudi Arabia of a Saudi suspect as Saudi law enforcement officials posed questions offered by the bureau. **********In the decision to deport Mr. Sayegh back to Saudi Arabia, Administration officials said that they did not have sufficient evidence to prosecute him in the American court system for the attack but that the Saudi Government believed that it had the basis for proceeding against him. **********Early on, Saudi intelligence officials identified Mr. Sayegh as the driver of a car that signaled the driver of the explosive-laden truck to the site of the blast. **********The Justice Department said Mr. Sayegh, who fled to Canada after the bombing and was arrested there, had failed to abide by an initial plea agreement with the Justice Department. The department then terminated his parole in October 1997 and placed him in removal proceedings. **********After initially suggesting that he was involved in the case, Mr. Sayegh -- who has been described by officials as being an opponent of the Saudi royal family -- changed his testimony. He then insisted that he had no information on the bombing, officials said. **********Mr. Sayegh has been fighting the proceedings to send him back to Saudi Arabia on the grounds that he is in severe danger for his life if he returns to his homeland. An Administration official said Washington had received assurances from the Saudi Government that Mr. Sayegh would not be tortured on his return. But there were no assurances about what would happen if he was convicted, the official said. **********In its announcement of the deportation of Mr. Sayegh, the Justice Department said the Saudi Government had several individuals awaiting trial in the case and has ''in the past demonstrated resolve in the prosecution of terrorists.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/23/business/company-briefs-006327.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********EXEL LTD., Hamilton, Bermuda, a liability insurer, said its board had authorized the repurchase of as much as $500 million of its own stock. **********SKY WEST INC., St. George, Utah, a provider of passenger and air freight services, placed an order with Bombardier Inc. for 25 aircraft, valued at $560 million, and may exercise options on 25 additional aircraft. **********PEPSICO INC. said its Tropicana Products Inc. unit had acquired Alimentos del Valle S.A., of Murcia, Spain, a maker of chilled juice and soup.

And on Monday, Microsoft will announce that it has begun retail shipments of a new version of its office productivity ''suite,'' Office 2000, that all but eliminates the distinctions between a PC document and Internet data. **********Office 2000, which includes word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, data base, E-mail, scheduling and other software functions, has a long list of new features -- almost all of which are intended to give PC users a set of software tools that deeply integrate Internet capabilities. **********At the heart of the integration strategy is Microsoft's adoption of the World Wide Web's basic document structure -- known as HTML, for hypertext markup language --  intended to make it easy to publish documents on the Web and perform what is known as ''round tripping,'' or translating documents back and forth between Web and traditional Microsoft Office formats. **********''You're looking at the standard in the corporate world,'' Amy Wohl, president of Wohl Associates, a computer industry consulting firm, said. ''The program has an enormous number of improvements in terms of features and integration with Windows and the Internet.'' **********And, depending on one's perspective, the business strategy and product capabilities of Office 2000 either underscore the urgency of the Federal antitrust trial that continues this week -- or make that trial even more irrelevant. One issue in the trial is whether Microsoft's hegemony in personal computer software has enabled the company to dominate other parts of the software industry to the point of exercising illegal monopoly power. Certainly, Office 2000 represents Microsoft's clearest example yet of subsuming Internet capabilities into one of the company's dominant desktop products. **********In any case, the arrival of Office 2000 on store shelves and in corporate offices this week will very likely unleash a tidal wave of revenue for the giant software publisher. Microsoft had already begun to receive income as part of a commercial test of Office 2000, including $400 million in the last quarter, which the company has said it will report as revenue once the product starts shipping in volume. **********Company executives said on Friday that they would not make any  public statements about preshipment sales. But Ms. Wohl said she had been told that Microsoft had already received orders for 15 million copies of Office 2000. **********Traditionally, each new major product generation represents a  crossroads for the software publisher, and industry analysts have repeatedly questioned whether computer users will continue to have an appetite for Microsoft's barrage of new features. **********With Office 2000, though, Microsoft executives said, they are confident they have addressed such concerns by insuring that Office 2000 documents will be compatible with documents created using the previous version of Office and by simplifying the program's control panel, or so-called user interface. **********''The best way to address the compatibility issue is by not having to change anything,'' Steve Sinofsky, vice president of Microsoft's office business, said. **********Mr. Sinofsky said the company had not tampered with Microsoft's existing file formats except in its Access data base program. And in the case of Access, he said, the company had tried to make the translation of data seamless to computer users. **********Despite such efforts, some industry analysts said computer users would be forced toward a new dimension of complexity by the shift to Internet-compatible documents. **********''This is very sophisticated code,  and that's a troubling direction when you think of the history of PC's as tools that empower individuals,'' Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of the computer industry newsletter Softletter, said. ''I'm not sure you're empowering people when you turn a simple word processing document into five pages of programming code.'' **********The code, which controls the appearance of a document like a Web page, is hidden from the user. The potential for problems arises if a user wants to manipulate the document in a way not anticipated by Microsoft's programmers. **********But Mr. Sinofsky said adding computer code to documents was not actually a new approach. He pointed to the popular Adobe Postscript format, which has long incorporated similar hidden complexity to give computer users control over the appearance of their documents. **********Microsoft executives also took issue with the widespread opinion among industry analysts that it would be corporate users, rather than people who use PC's at home or in small offices, who would find compelling reasons to upgrade to the new program. **********''I think the individual user will find Office 2000 useful because you can do things you just couldn't do before,'' Mr. Sinofsky said. **********He pointed to the ability to take pictures of one's children and publish them on a Web site for viewing by  grandparents as an example of the kind of feature that would drive noncorporate users to the new product. **********This newest product rollout continues a process of integrating application programs that Microsoft began in 1990, when it introduced the first version of Office, bundling together its Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Mail applications. By 1993, with the introduction of Office 4.0, the integrated program had become the primary product, as opposed to the individual application programs. **********That integration strategy proved to be the key competitive edge in the battle to wrest the corporate market from companies like Lotus and, at the time, Wordperfect. **********Although the Justice Department has largely ignored the company's virtual office-suite monopoly in the current antitrust suit, the issue has come up in trial testimony given by  Avi Tevanian, the Apple Computer Corporation's top software executive. **********In a deposition last year, Mr. Tevanian testified that Microsoft executives had threatened to cancel development of Office 98, the Apple Macintosh version of the Office suite, if Apple did not adopt Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its primary Web browser software. **********Microsoft executives responded that the Government was twisting the significance of its business negotiations with Apple. **********Still, even with its control of more than 90 percent of the retail market for office productivity software, Microsoft could find itself under increasing pricing pressure from the Corel Corporation, the feisty Canadian software publisher. Corel, which acquired the Wordperfect brand several years ago, began shipping a new product in April known as Wordperfect Office 2000. The program has received strongly positive reviews. **********Corel contends that it has 22 million users worldwide and said it was focusing on its current customer base by simplifying and adding Internet features to its new version. **********''We still have a massive installed base,'' Jimi Smith, director of brand management for Wordperfect Office, said. ''These people have stuck with us for a reason. **********The entry-level version of Wordperfect Office has been selling for as little as $79 in major chains like Comp USA, Mr. Smith said. In contrast, the standard version of Microsoft's Office 2000 has a street price of $229."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/02/business/worldbusiness/IHT-thinking-ahead-commentary-americans-should-note.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Dale", "pub_date": "1999-11-02", "snippet": "Europeans are often puzzled by how little most Americans seem to be interested in, let alone understand, their Herculean efforts to unite their continent.

Even many otherwise internationally minded Americans have a big blind spot when it comes to European unification. **********Americans, of course, are hardly alone in being baffled by the intricacies of the European integration process \u2014 so are many Europeans. But devotees of the European cause have always hoped that Americans, more than anyone else, might comprehend its momentous historic significance. **********Here, after all, are democratic peoples attempting to create a continental-scale union, facing many of the same intellectual and political challenges that Americans did two centuries ago, and to some extent still do now. **********When the Europeans of today argue over how much power should be transferred to Brussels and how much kept by national governments, they are echoing almost exactly the great debates between American Federalists and anti-Federalists in the late 18th century. **********The founding fathers of the United States would easily understand the objections of Britain to a \"federal superstate\" and the insistence of Denmark on minute national scrutiny of decisions taken in Brussels \u2014 as well as the counterarguments by other small countries, such as the Netherlands, that want more power at the center to protect them from domination by the bigger states. **********Some of these issues so redolent of U.S. history, including the relative voting weights of large and small states, will come into even clearer focus next year. That is when the 15 member states of the European Union are due to start another constitutional conference to adapt their institutions to a mass intake of members from Central and Eastern Europe in the early years of the new century. **********Of course the parallel should not be taken too far. Few Europeans of today want their region as politically integrated as the United States. The venerable nation-states of Europe are not young colonies with the same language and culture rebelling against the motherland. But they still have huge ambitions. **********Anyone who dismisses those ambitions as purely economic fails to understand the dynamics of the European drive to unity. If what is emerging is not the United States of Europe, it is still far more than a glorified free-trade area, as some Americans still think. **********Those were precisely the kind of misconceptions that Romano Prodi, the new president of the European Commission, chose to address in his first public speaking engagement in Washington last week. **********As he has in Europe, Mr. Prodi stressed the historic nature of the attempt to create a united continent by peaceful means. The kind of unification that had taken place in Western Europe over the past half-century had never happened before in history, he pointed out. **********But Mr. Prodi put his biggest emphasis on what lies ahead \u2014 the enlargement of the EU to take in 12 or more new members. In U.S. terms, he said, the EU's admission of new states on its eastern borders would be like the United States expanding into Mexico and Central America. **********Americans who believe it won't happen should reflect on what the EU has already achieved, including a common legal system, common institutions, common trade policies, a single market and a single currency. The next planned steps are common judicial, immigration, foreign and security policies. **********All this is obviously of vital interest to the United States. In the next few years, the EU will stretch further than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into former Warsaw Pact territory. **********Soon it will set itself the long-term aim of absorbing the troubled Balkan states of former Yugoslavia and extending its sphere of influence, though not full EU membership, as far as Russia and North Africa. It will be much bigger than the Roman Empire, its only remotely comparable predecessor. **********Mr. Prodi said he did not know where Europe ends. But it is clear to most people that the aim of the EU over the next 20 years or so is to include every country from the Atlantic to the western borders of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova. Turkey, too, as Washington has long wanted, will ultimately be offered membership if it can meet the economic and political criteria. **********Americans who remember how \"manifest destiny\" drove their own westward expansion should be able to recognize a similar phenomenon as it pushes the EU's frontiers eastward. **********E-mail address: **********thinkahead@iht.com"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/11/world/trickiest-divides-are-among-big-powers-at-kosovo-talks.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1999-02-11", "snippet": "Hosts of Kosovo peace talks, Rambouillet, France, focus on their divisions; France and United States agree to compromise under which United Nations Security Council will be asked to 'endorse,' not 'authorize' deployment of NATO peacekeepers; more ...", "word_count": 827, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trickiest Divides Are Among Big Powers at Kosovo Talks", "print_headline": "Trickiest Divides Are Among Big Powers at Kosovo Talks", "body_text": " **********So far, the arguments in the early days of the Kosovo peace conference have not been among the Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegates, who are being kept busy by the negotiators on  subjects like a new constitution and elections. **********The more tricky divisions have been among the hosts -- the United States, four European nations and Russia -- as they have tried to resolve their differences on vital issues like disarming the two sides and deploying a peacekeeping mission in the event of a settlement. **********One of the most important documents of the conference, a paper known as the military annex, was sent to NATO tonight, officials said, after last-minute debates on how the United Nations should bless it and how quickly the two sides in the conflict should be expected to demobilize. **********The military aspect is critical because in the end the outcome of the  peace effort here is likely to come down to one major factor: will the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, accept foreign troops on Serbian soil and allow them to turn Kosovo into a quasi protectorate? **********A string of statements from Belgrade in the last two days have indicated that the Government is rejecting the idea. **********To better gauge the temperature of the peace effort, Mr. Milosevic, who has remained in Belgrade, is sending the Prime Minister of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, to the talks on Thursday. **********Before the Prime Minister's arrival, the United States and the Europeans settled their differences on some of the military questions. **********This morning, French officials said the deployment of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo needed to be backed by a United Nations Security Council resolution, a proposition that the Clinton Administration opposed. Washington, according to State Department officials, was sticking to its stand that NATO should be able to act independently of the United Nations. **********The debate played out in Paris, Rambouillet, London and Washington with a compromise worked out this afternoon by the British. Instead of the United Nations being asked to ''authorize'' the deployment, the Security Council will be asked to ''endorse'' it, a British diplomat said. **********In this way, all sides could claim victory. For the French, the United Nations still got a nod. For the Americans the ''neuralgic word 'authorize,' '' was avoided, the diplomat said. **********A senior French official described today why the United Nations involvement was so important . **********''When NATO is out of area, the question is can NATO act on its own?'' he said, referring to the fact that NATO would be deploying troops beyond the territory of the 16 member nations in a mission not intended to defend those members. The official said the French position was that a Security Council resolution was needed when NATO deployed troops outside alliance territory. **********A more practical debate that affects the two sides in the conflict on the ground in Kosovo was over how quickly the Kosovo Liberation Army, the guerrilla group of ethnic Albanians who have been fighting Serbian forces, should be required to demobilize. So far, the guerrillas have not been formally asked whether they will disband. Five of the 16 ethnic Albanian delegates at the conference here are members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. **********There seemed some doubt about whether the insurgents would accept such a deal but Western officials said they were pressing ahead with plans for the Kosovo Liberation Army to give up its arms. **********An official familiar with the thinking of the guerrillas said, ''They know they have to be reconstituted, the question is how.'' **********But a Western diplomat involved in drafting the demobilization plans said that the guerrillas would be required to give up their heavy weapons by a certain time and that there would be a prohibition on carrying light weapons. **********At the request of Washington, the diplomat said, some adjustments were made in the military annex that would allow the Kosovo Liberation Army to demobilize a little more slowly than was originally envisioned. Because the Serbian forces and the Yugoslav Army would be allowed to keep a permanent, though  minimized, presence in Kosovo, the guerrillas were being offered the concession of slower demobilization, the diplomat said. **********The Serbian security police, who according to NATO military planners now number 11,000 in Kosovo, would be required to reduce their forces to 2,500 over three to six months, the diplomat said. The Yugoslav Army, which now has about 15,000 soldiers in Kosovo, is being called on to reduce its forces to 1,500 for border patrols by the end of the year. **********The insurgents' overriding concern, according to participants in the talks, has been their security and the security of the ethnic Albanian population who last summer and fall were attacked in their villages with  scorched-earth tactics by the Serbs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/30/business/technology-putting-new-flaws-in-cleaned-systems.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1999-08-30", "snippet": "Managers continue to test computer systems that have been declared ready for Year 2000, seeking out buried flaws; previously unknown Year 2000 defects keep popping up in commercial software; normal activities like adding equipment or software carr...", "word_count": 1059, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Putting New Flaws in Cleaned Systems", "print_headline": "TECHNOLOGY; Putting New Flaws in Cleaned Systems", "body_text": " **********A growing number of companies and Government agencies are claiming that their vital systems are ready for any and all Year 2000 dates, but life seems as hectic as ever for many Year 2000 technical workers in that advance guard. **********Managers continue testing on the assumption that at least minor flaws lie buried in some ''ready'' systems. Previously unknown Year 2000 defects keep popping up in commercial software. And normal activities like adding equipment or software carry the risk of inadvertently introducing bugs into systems that had been cleaned up and tested. **********''Everyone is testing and retesting,'' said Steven Kutnick, the Year 2000 project leader at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. **********How many crucial mistakes are being caught by testing -- or missed -- has become a great Year 2000 mystery. **********Consultants and companies selling Year 2000 software-testing tools contend that repairs typically miss many date problems and introduce bugs that may or may not be related to dates. Some authorities, like Capers Jones, chief scientist at Software Productivity Research, a consulting company in Burlington, Mass., warn that testing fails to catch many defects. **********The Gartner Group, a technology consultant in Stamford, Conn., says that it is common for independent tests to find errors lurking in 5 percent of computer code that has been altered during Year 2000 work and 15 percent in poorly run projects. Nearly two-thirds of those errors are serious enough to create faulty data or cause programs to crash. **********There have been a number of reports highlighting the consequences of failing to screen out defects. Northwest Metrology, an electronic test equipment company in Bakersfield, Calif., recently disclosed that an office computer it had tested last year had nevertheless crashed and destroyed data in January after encountering Year 2000 dates. The company, already out $80,000 as a result, is still struggling to restore the lost data eight months later. **********Year 2000 project managers agree that such perils make rigorous testing worthwhile. But many say they doubt that hidden defects are anywhere near the levels projected by Mr. Jones and influential consultants like Gartner. **********''We had to change less than 1 percent of our programs after testing,'' said Mary Stewart, who heads Year 2000 work at Total System Services Inc. of Columbus, Ga., which handles 195 million credit-  and debit-card accounts for major banks and retailers. **********The Chase Manhattan Corporation and its outside consultants found just 300 errors after the bank altered three million lines of computer code. ''They tended to be extremely easy to fix,'' Brian Robbins, a Chase senior vice president, said. **********Still, testing strikes Year 2000 managers whose repairs are completed as a good bet to minimize risks, if only by increasing confidence. Chase, in fact, went so far as to pay for independent testing of the repairs at the Alltel Corporation, a telecommunications supplier. **********No testing program can cover everything a program does, so managers like Ms. Stewart have allotted time to other forms of Year 2000 double-checking too, including assigning some programmers to a process called desk checking. That is technospeak for reading through critical code line by line for possible errors missed during earlier repairs or testing. **********Between elaborate testing and the drudgery of desk checking lie a range of other tasks for Year 2000 technical workers finished with critical repairs. Some are repairing systems that had been on the back burner because businesses regard them as useful but not vital. **********CSX Technology Inc., a unit of the Richmond-based CSX Corporation that has handled Year 2000 work for the CSX railway, its sister company, is about to repair some desktop programs it could do without, according to Charles Wodehouse, president of CSX Technology. But it can be a battle to persuade managers to let the old programs die, he said. **********At some big companies, retiring programs has become a time-consuming late-stage Year 2000 activity in its own right. Household International, a consumer credit company in Prospect Heights, Ill., is halfway through a two-month drive to shelve more than 10,000 programs it replaced with new software rather than fixing, according to Thomas Wilkie, head of the company's Year 2000 program. But the shelved programs will be archived for a year before they are discarded. **********''You don't want to eliminate anything that might be used,'' Mr. Wilkie said. **********Mr. Wilkie and others are also busy repatching systems that they had classified as ready as major software vendors like Microsoft report previously unknown Year 2000 defects. Microsoft recently released supplementary code, known as a  patch, that represented its sixth attempt to make its NT operating system fully compliant with Year 2000 needs. **********If a patch released by a vendor is deemed to be crucial, a company might have to undergo a new round of testing and training. Microsoft has been criticized because scarcely a month goes by without announcements of newly discovered flaws in popular programs like Windows, the NT operating system or the Excel spreadsheet, but it has plenty of company. Software vendors have posted nearly 480 warnings of previously unreported Year 2000 flaws since early May, according to the Infoliant Corporation, a Pittsburgh firm that tracks such data. **********A related concern -- benignly called  ''clean management'' -- is preventing the software and systems the company has worked so hard to fix from being infected with Year 2000 problems by new, untested software or links to the outside. **********The dangers are substantial for companies like Public Service Enterprise Group, parent of New Jersey's largest power company. Public Service finished Year 2000 work on its giant customer information system in January. This year, though, Year 2000 experts hovered anxiously as it rewrote 60 percent of the programs in the system to prepare for utility industry deregulation. The activities ranged from essentials like billing to helpful refinements like the data on past contacts that telephone agents see as they greet customers. **********Fears of corrupting clean code -- along with the need for final testing -- are two key reasons computer users are almost universally talking about freezing all changes in their computers at some point this fall. **********''No programmers here are working on Year 2000 right now but nearly everyone is rushing to complete other projects before the freeze,'' said Ron Kerr, senior manager of information services at Home Depot Inc., which plans to halt changes on Oct. 11. Until sometime next year at the earliest, it may be hard to find a computer worker immune from the gravitational pull of Y2K."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/09/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-01-09", "snippet": "Copper prices rise 1 percent from 12-year lows on optimism that strong economic growth will increase demand for copper wire and pipes in construction; March contract rises 0.65 cent, to 65.90 cents a pound; graph; chart", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********COPPER RALLIES.

Frankel, a 44-year-old Connecticut money manager, had siphoned several hundred million dollars from Franklin and fled the United States. Mr. Frankel, Federal prosecutors say, used fake bond-trading records to entice a string of Southern insurance companies to invest their money with him. Then he stole it, the authorities say. **********Tennessee's insurance commissioner, Douglas Sizemore, has acknowledged no failings by his agency in the case. Indeed, he has argued that his regulators should be credited for cracking the case. **********But the fact that the fraud continued for almost eight years despite regulators' misgivings has become an acute embarrassment for many state insurance regulators. It has also become a rallying point for people who favor at least some Federal involvement in regulating insurers. **********Examiners in Tennessee's Commerce and Insurance Department made note of irregularities in Franklin's investments, including excessive bond-trading volume and reports of abnormally high profits, in nearly every quarterly financial review from 1993 until Mr. Frankel's organization unraveled in May, state records show. **********Yet, Mr. Sizemore and the state's other top insurance officials repeatedly declined to act on their own examiners' recommendations for a full investigation, the records show. What is more, until at least late last year, Tennessee regulators did not communicate concerns about Franklin to other states where the company operated. **********And state investigators were apparently befuddled by Franklin's claims that it used specialized trading techniques requiring it to turn over its assets to a tiny brokerage house called Liberty National Securities. **********Tennessee's insurance department has declined to make officials available for interviews, only letting them give written answers to written questions. **********When state officials pressed for an explanation of Franklin's trading practices in 1997, the company submitted a professional-looking quarterly report that seemed to show day trading, or rapid-fire buying and selling, of Government bonds. Liberty National, the report indicated, made a single buy or sell order for bonds valued at roughly $50 million each weekday from April to June 1997. **********Had they investigated, the Tennessee regulators might have discovered that Liberty was a Michigan-based company with revenue in the tens of thousands of dollars that could not possibly handle the volume of trading Franklin claimed. But they did not; a full investigation was forestalled for two more years. **********When leading bond-trading experts were shown the same report recently, they said the fraud should have been easily detected. **********''The pattern is totally fabricated,'' said Stan Jonas, a government bond trader at Fimat USA in New York. ''It's pretty obvious that the gentlemen at Liberty National are just printing tickets. These trades probably were never executed.'' **********Alone in the financial world, insurers are regulated exclusively by the states, with Federal authorities barred by acts of Congress from interfering. The industry's unique standing is a result of the view that insurance is a geographically specific issue best left to local agencies to police -- as well as its status as a lucrative revenue source jealously guarded by the states. **********But the Frankel case has added momentum to those who argue that state autonomy in insurance regulation is outdated. At a minimum, the fraud and intense coverage it has received seem likely to add pressure on states to improve oversight or risk losing some authority, government and industry leaders said. **********''If the states can't rise to the occasion, we could wind up with Federal control,'' said Neil D. Levin, New York's superintendent of insurance. ''Better supervision will have to come one way or the other.'' **********Of particular concern to some industry experts is how Mr. Frankel skirted states known for tight regulation: Texas, California, Florida, New York and Connecticut, which together employ more than half of the nation's insurance regulators. **********Franklin American, which authorities say was controlled behind the scenes by Mr. Frankel, bought troubled insurers in Oklahoma, Mississippi and Missouri as well as in Tennessee -- all states with relatively small insurance regulatory teams. **********One reason the fraud could occur, experts say, is that most insurance regulators know about revenues from policies but relatively little about the investment world. **********''There's lots of easy pickings out there if you want to run a scam,'' said Robert Hunter, a former Texas insurance commissioner who now runs the insurance arm of the Consumer Federation of America. ''Most state regulators really do not understand or pay attention to investments.'' **********The regulation of insurers is a looming issue as Congress overhauls supervision of financial companies. The House of Representatives voted on Thursday night to end Depression-era restrictions that have largely kept banks, securities firms and insurers out of each other's businesses. Lawmakers will try later this summer to reconcile the House legislation with a different version adopted by the Senate. **********With companies from those three industries already melding into conglomerates like the new Citigroup, many analysts predict even faster consolidation in the financial industry as traditional barriers fall. **********And as different kinds of financial companies merge, the authorities that regulate them -- including Federal agencies like the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as state insurance commissions -- will face pressure to coordinate their activities, many in the industry argue. **********Some state officials contend that the record of state insurance regulators compares favorably to Federal oversight of the securities and banking industries. But many also acknowledge that it took Tennessee longer to expose Mr. Frankel's fraud than they would have liked. **********Mr. Frankel's fraudulent behavior began even before he bought the nearly bankrupt Franklin in late 1991. At the time, he was under investigation by the S.E.C. for securities fraud in Ohio and would soon accept a settlement that barred him from the securities business. **********He circumvented that prohibition by setting up Thunor Trust in the name of three acquaintances -- at least two of whom say they had no involvement in the matter -- to acquire Franklin and manage its money. **********There is no indication Tennessee authorities knew that Mr. Frankel, who used many aliases, was involved in Thunor. The trust was run by John Hackney, a Nashville-area businessman and former banker who now says he was duped by Mr. Frankel. **********But regulators did not seek to verify sworn statements from the people who put up nearly $4 million to back Thunor, an inquiry that might have exposed Mr. Frankel's fraud early on. Tennessee insurance officials said last week that the affidavits satisfied legal requirements for background checks. **********Under Mr. Frankel's control, Franklin reported strong earnings, but the bulk came from investing insurance assets rather than from writing new policies. In 1998, the company said total assets had grown to $141 million from $31 million in 1991. That amounted to an annual compound rate of return of more than 17 percent, extraordinary for a company claiming to invest only in safe, high-grade Government bonds. **********Tennessee authorities clearly wondered about those claims all along. Mr. Hosea's notation on the 1993 statement was followed by warnings from colleagues. In 1994, for example, regulators asked Mr. Hackney to discuss his trading strategy, internal records show, though they do not reveal what was discussed. **********By 1996, regulators began pressuring Franklin, which was reporting only lump-sum results, to detail trading practices. A short time later, Kathy Fussell and Robert J. Ribe, two Tennessee insurance analysts, wrote a series of memos calling for a special examination of Franklin. **********''I recommend that we find someone who is a specialist in investment activities and settle this once and for all,'' Ms. Fussell wrote in August 1997. **********When Tennessee authorities got their first look at Franklin's detailed trading records, concern grew. The purported day-trading strategy meant that in three months, Franklin's portfolio of bonds -- worth more than $50 million -- had been bought and sold nearly 100 times. **********But the insurance department delayed an examination until a regularly scheduled five-year audit of Franklin in late 1998, more than a year later. The delay angered some state examiners, people close to the regulators said. Department officials deny that there was any difference of opinion on the matter. **********When the investigation was finally conducted, an outside specialist discovered serious problems. For one, Liberty National in Michigan had assets of less than $60,000 -- making it ill-equipped to handle the billions of dollars in reported trades. **********The review also found, apparently for the first time, that Franklin was placing nearly all its assets under Liberty National's control. That was an apparent violation of state rules requiring insurers to store their bonds in banks or trust companies. In late 1998, Tennessee officials ordered Franklin to retrieve its investment assets from Liberty and put them in a bank. **********The order was not immediately enforced. Franklin hired Harlan Mathews, a former United States senator and now a partner in the Tennessee law firm of Farris Mathews Branan & Hellen, to fight for Franklin's right to keep investing with Liberty. In February, records show, Mr. Mathews helped win a temporary waiver of the order. That gave Franklin until early April before it would have to move its assets to a bank. **********Tennessee officials said that Mr. Mathews' political influence did not affect the department's handling of the case. Mr. Mathews did not return a phone call seeking comment. **********Even when examiners focused their full attention on Franklin's problems, they did not conduct what Wall Street firms would consider rudimentary due diligence. **********There is no indication, for example, that any Tennessee official phoned or visited the Michigan offices of Liberty National. If they had,  Robert J. Guyer, the president of the tiny brokerage house, would have denied any dealings with Franklin American. They would have learned that Mr. Frankel, an old acquaintance of Mr. Guyer, had usurped Liberty's name for his own purposes, according to Mr. Guyer's lawyer. **********Nor did investigators seek the advice of bond traders to analyze Franklin's purported trading technique. If they had, they might have quickly spotted a fraud. Even after a short examination, Mr. Jonas of Fimat said it was obvious to him that the purported trades had been ''just clearly manufactured.'' **********In fact, Federal authorities say they suspect that Mr. Frankel may have used the cover of an active trading strategy by Liberty as an excuse to gain total control over Franklin's investment portfolio. Many doubt that the trades, at least in anything approaching the volume claimed, were ever made. **********Tennessee officials defend their investigation. ''It's not normal practice to consult Wall Street experts,'' they said in written comments. **********That practice could change, however, if New York's example catches on. The state's insurance commission recently became the first in the nation to hire longtime Wall Street traders to scrutinize insurance company investment practices. **********George Dale, the insurance commissioner of Mississippi whose state was also affected by the collapse of Frankel-controlled companies, said outsiders should not rush to judgment on how state regulators did their jobs. Insurance examiners are usually on guard for losses that might lead to insolvency, he said, not for exaggerated profits. But he acknowledged that all the states involved could have paid more attention to red flags. **********''I have never seen a fraud like this in my experience,'' Mr. Dale said. ''But when something bad like this happens, we can learn from it.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/03/business/the-media-business-advertising-dewars-pushes-image-of-free-spirits.html": {"writer_name": "Westray Battle", "pub_date": "1999-09-03", "snippet": "Bacardi-Martini USA to introduce two campaigns this fall aimed at reversing decline in sales for Dewar's Scotch whiskey; one campaign is aimed at attracting younger drinkers and other to update Highlander, its more than 150-year-old icon; ads were...", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Dewar's pushes image of free spirits to lure young drinkers and revive sagging Scotch sales.", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; Dewar's pushes image of free spirits to lure young drinkers and revive sagging Scotch sales.", "body_text": " **********SEEKING to reverse a decline in sales for Dewar's Scotch whisky, Bacardi-Martini USA plans to introduce two campaigns this fall, one to attract younger drinkers and another to update the Highlander, its more than 150-year-old icon. **********The new ads, with a budget of more than $20 million in the first year, were created by Avrett, Free & Ginsberg in New York, part of the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North Communications. Print and outdoor promotions will emphasize the willingness of Dewar's drinkers to follow their passions and take risks. They present profiles of hip Dewar's drinkers like the makers of the hit film ''The Blair Witch Project.'' Other ads show the Highlander with accessories like a surfboard and an iron. **********Bacardi-Martini is looking for a lift for Dewar's because shipments to retailers declined 5.8 percent last year, to 1.4 million cases, according to the Impact Databank annual distilled spirits survey, published by M. Shanken Communications in New York. Total Scotch shipments have  declined 31.3 percent, to 8.3 million cases since 1990. **********''The marketing of Scotch is an uphill climb because it will always be an acquired taste,'' said Bob Keane, editorial director at Adams Business Media in New York, which tracks the performance of the liquor industry. ''But it is important for Dewar's and the rest of the industry to become more relevant for younger adults.'' **********''If you wait long enough, everything becomes hip again,'' Mr. Keane added. ''Young people have already begun to reach into the past, drinking more martinis and manhattans,'' suggesting that Scotch could make a comeback, too. **********Each of Averett, Free's campaigns updates a previously successful marketing tactic and tries to revitalize the Dewar's brand while maintaining its 19th-century heritage and tradition. **********Avrett, Free created two campaigns. The first offers five profiles of young people who have ''taken the road less traveled,'' said Frank Ginsberg, chairman and chief executive at Avrett, Free. It is a revival of the ''Dewar's Profiles'' campaign, created by the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago in 1969, which ran until 1993. The profiles will appear in publications like ESPN magazine, GQ, Men's Journal, Playboy and Rolling Stone. **********One ad features the film makers and star of ''The Blair Witch Project.'' The actor Heather Donahue and directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrich appear as if they are about to be burned at the stake. Below the picture, the caption reads, ''They staked it all . . . They're Dewars.'' **********''They're smart and adventurous,'' says Marshall Dawson, marketing manager at Bacardi-Martini in Miami, which bought the rights to the Dewar's brand from Diageo P.L.C. last year. ''They want to take risks and follow their dreams.'' **********The new campaign will align itself in other ways with the film by celebrating the start of the campaign on Halloween at the spooky Renwick Ruins on Roosevelt Island with the people featured in all the ads, including the movie's other two stars, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams. **********Other profiles include three upstarts who started their own snow ski company, Igneous Skis, which has the tagline, ''They're fighting an uphill battle . . . They're Dewars,'' and the two creators of the board game Cranium, who left a potential fortune at Microsoft, with the tagline, ''They're out of their minds . . . They're Dewars.'' **********The second campaign, which will run at the same time, focuses on Dewar's white label Scotch and its heritage by changing the image of the brand's icon since 1846, the Highlander. **********The Highlander had always been depicted as a traditional kilt-clad Scotsman. The new ads draw the Highlander in funny poses, shedding his traditional garb for more modern pursuits. He is shown ''Perfectly Balanced,'' in a martial arts pose, ''Smooth,'' ironing his kilt and ''Just add water,'' shirtless, wearing sunglasses and holding a surfboard. **********''We wanted to say, 'You, too, can be a part of this spirit if you drink Dewar's,'' said Toby Dunn, group director at Avrett, Free."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/19/business/the-markets-key-rates.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/business/world-business-briefing-europe-british-group-buys-hotels.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-09-08", "snippet": "Millennium & Copthorne Hotels PLC to buy 11 North American hotels from Regal Hotels International Holdings Ltd, take control of management company and take 50 percent state in Regal's 18 other North American hotels through joint venture for total ...", "word_count": 137, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITISH GROUP BUYS HOTELS", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; BRITISH GROUP BUYS HOTELS", "body_text": " **********Millennium & Copthorne Hotels P.L.C. of Britain said it would buy 29 North American hotels from Regal Hotels International Holdings Ltd. for $725 million.

The tax privileges being lost by Thai exporters were originally extended to assist developing nations by reducing European duties for certain products, such as canned shrimp and fruit. **********When those products reach a certain market share in Europe, the tax privileges expire and higher import duties are charged; this happened on Jan. 1 to Thai shrimp, which now face an import duty of 12 percent, instead of the developing-nation rate of 9 percent. Canned fruit producers face steeper changes, with import duties on their product doubling to 30 percent from 15 percent over a period of four years. **********To Mr. Seri, and many in Thailand, the removal of the tariff privileges in the middle of a national economic crisis smacks of European selfishness, and there is a growing backlash of anti-European sentiment. **********Thailand's economy wrenched from boom to bust after Bangkok's de facto devaluation of the baht set off the Asian financial crisis in July 1997. The currency turmoil has sent forth from Asia a flood of exports to Europe and the United States, increasing trade tensions, while slowing economic growth has come to dominate domestic politics throughout the region. **********For their part, French and other European diplomats say the European Union has helped Asia generously.

Products undergoing tariff changes held or even increased their market share in Europe, the diplomats said. **********European banks, the diplomats added, cut their loan exposure to Thailand just 22 percent over the period June 1997 to June 1998, compared with 30 percent by Japanese banks and 64 percent by U.S. banks. **********Europe's share in the flow of foreign direct investment to Thailand tripled to 21 percent in the three years up to 1998 and European investors are the only foreign partners for whom the value of individual investment applications has increased over the same period, according to documents issued by the European Commission."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/17/business/company-news-lvmh-buys-33-share-in-the-michael-kors-fashion-house.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-02-17", "snippet": "LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA acquires 33 percent of American fashion house Michael Kors LLC; remaining ownership will be shared in equal parts with co-presidents Michael Kors and John Orchulli (S)", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LVMH BUYS 33% SHARE IN THE MICHAEL KORS FASHION HOUSE", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; LVMH BUYS 33% SHARE IN THE MICHAEL KORS FASHION HOUSE", "body_text": " **********The Paris-based LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., the world's largest luxury goods company, said yesterday that it had bought 33 percent of the American fashion house Michael Kors L.L.C., but did not disclose the terms of the transaction.

And the guests -- feted as architects of ''the new Europe'' -- were denied no luxury. At the Wallace Collection, a museum in London's West End, and later at Claridge's, Europe's elite executives supped and sipped tea alongside emissaries from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company; the Blackstone Group; Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, and other well-known American buyout firms. **********But despite the veneer of British gentility, the gathering had all the subtlety of Mr. Milken's now-famous Predators' Balls, the glitzy soirees where vulture investors prowled for takeover prey during the last merger craze. And that similarity was not lost on James Bainbridge Lee Jr., the group head of Chase's global investment banking department, who issued the invitations. **********''The feeling in Europe is these people are the 'Barbarians at the Gate,' '' he said, echoing the title of the book that chronicled Kohlberg Kravis's 1988 takeover of RJR Nabisco. ''That was one of the big myths I wanted to pop. Europeans think they are corporate raiders. They were surprised to find out that some of them were nice.'' **********Barbarians or not, American buyout firms have been flocking to Europe in recent months, chasing the wave of corporate divestitures swelling as bloated companies begin to streamline. Already, several of the best-known buyout firms -- so called because they buy troubled companies with the hope of selling them later for a profit -- have opened their doors: Clayton, Dubilier & Rice is planning an office in Germany; both Kohlberg, Kravis and Hicks, Muse have set up shop in London. And with American firms having more than $90 billion in their coffers -- 25 percent of that intended for Europe alone -- more are sure to follow. **********But it will take more than biscuits and a cup of Earl Grey to soften their aggressive image. For all the talk of globalization, executives at buyout firms are learning just how ''foreign'' foreign countries can be. And if recent experiences are any indication, they are in for some tumultuous times. **********Some American firms have offended potential partners by backing out of deals. Simple misunderstandings are turning into deal killers. And even when a buyout firm does find a company to take over, business practices taken for granted in the United States -- like dismissing employees or otherwise cutting costs sharply -- are frowned upon or illegal in Europe. **********''The reality is the degree of brashness coming from the United States is not appreciated,'' said Michael Stevens, head of leveraged buyout services in Britain for KPMG Corporate Finance, a division of the accounting firm. **********Franci J. Blassberg, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton in New York, recently told a group of lawyers and academics about one incident in which a client was accused of pirating information after lawyers and accountants conducted a routine examination of a German business. ''The German seller misunderstood the process and concluded that our client's real motive was to obtain competitively sensitive information,'' Ms. Blassberg said. As a result, the seller terminated negotiations. **********Europe is still lacking, too, in some of the deal-making tools necessary for complex transactions. Junk bonds are an accepted American form of financing, but in Europe, demand for them is relatively small. Stock option programs were illegal in Germany until 1998 and are still rare. And the market for initial public offerings in Europe is immature. **********''We all know the big names have made a lot of fuss about setting up their operations,'' said Raymond Svider, a partner at BC Partners, a buyout firm with offices in London, Paris, Hamburg and Milan that is expected to compete with the newer entrants. ''But their experience is limited. And only time will tell if they will be successful.'' **********Signs of the American 80's **********A leveraged buyout fund is a pool of money run by a buyout firm with assets culled from insurance companies, banks, pension plans and other institutional investors. The funds range in size from $100 million to $6 billion and are used to buy stakes in private and publicly traded companies. A fund's executives use its capital and borrow money -- hence the term ''leverage'' -- to buy two or three companies a year. **********The goal is to cut costs, increase profits and then sell out. In the United States, that was easier in the 1980's, when corporations weren't yet so attentive to shareholder value. Companies like RJR Nabisco Holdings, Trans World Airlines and Safeway were taken over in an orgy of financial wizardry. Thousands of people lost jobs even as companies gained new strength, and legendary corporate raiders and financiers like Mr. Milken, Henry Kravis and T. Boone Pickens were either demonized or lionized, depending on the observer's politics or personal stake in the transactions. **********But years of corporate downsizing and other measures have made it harder today to squeeze new savings out of already-lean American companies. That is one of the main reasons that buyout firms are turning their attention across the Atlantic: European companies resemble the fat American conglomerates of the early 1980's. As a result, they are expected to sell assets over the next few years to focus on core businesses. And family-owned concerns with no successors are likely to put their businesses on the block. **********''Europe is an important marketplace,'' said John Muse, chief operating officer of the Dallas-based Hicks, Muse, who recently moved to London to pursue deal-making there. ''From our point of view, you can create pan-European strategies in sectors with more ease. I personally think the pie is going to get so big there is going to be a lot for everyone.'' **********But Europe isn't anything like the open field the United States was a decade ago. British firms like Doughty Hanson & Company, Cinven Ltd. and Electra Investment Trust (which itself recently rejected a takeover bid) already have longstanding corporate friendships. And they are better versed in Continental ways. **********''It's a softer style,'' Mr. Muse acknowledged. ''People want to get to know you better.'' **********Some Rough Crossings **********After 21 years in business, and investments in 30 companies, executives at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice might be expected to have seen everything. And last year, it seemed that they anticipated almost every obstacle when they made their first European investment, buying a majority stake in Thyssen Schulte Bautechnik, a division of Germany's Thyssen A.G. that sells heating equipment and bathroom supplies. **********First, they offered equity stakes to executives as an incentive to improve profits. Next, they agreed to lay off workers over the course of a year instead of all at once and to pay handsomely -- almost a year's salary -- those who would lose their jobs. Finally, some employees received bonuses despite failing to reach initial performance targets. **********Still, nothing prepared the Clayton team for the reception they received at a regional sales meeting last fall. Forty sales managers had gathered at Thyssen headquarters to discuss 1999 performance goals. When one was asked to discuss his projections, he warned that a downturn in sales would make it impossible for him to meet his quota. **********''It shouldn't matter, though,'' Clayton executives remember him saying. ''My department has been profitable the last two years. We don't need to be profitable the next two.'' **********The Clayton team was aghast. ''All the Americans thought, 'We can't let this go on,' '' said Charles Ames, a Clayton partner who is serving as chairman of Thyssen Schulte's supervisory board. ''This would never happen in the United States.'' **********But the manager's comments might have been more bluster than truth. ''The next morning the guy went into his boss's office and said he rechecked his numbers and agreed he could indeed increase profitability,'' Mr. Ames said. ''What I think he was doing was playing a game to see how we'd react.'' **********Mr. Ames's experience is not atypical. Strict performance requirements are unfamiliar terrain for many European managers. Most corporations have their roots in strong family ownership, and corporate executives often view themselves as stewards of their communities. **********Executives ''kind of know the factory has too many people, but you don't want to lay people off because you will be the most unpopular guy in town,'' said one financial investor with experience buying companies  in Germany. ''You still have to go to restaurants and see people's kids at school. You will be ostracized socially, with no upside.'' **********In the American Rust Belt of the 1980's, buyout firms were often able to bulldoze resistance to layoffs. But in Europe today, political realities and social customs require the firms to be more sensitive to public perceptions -- or risk being snubbed. ''You basically have to change from being transaction-oriented to being relationship-oriented,'' said Muneer Satter, a Goldman Sachs partner who was co-head of private investing in Germany for six years. **********But it is the cool calculus of deal-making that comes naturally to Americans, as was apparent in several episodes last year. **********In October, for example, Kohlberg Kravis scuttled a potential $1.79 billion offer to buy the Herberts paint division of Hoechst, the German conglomerate. And in November, Hicks, Muse backed out of an agreement to buy the American reference and business publishing divisions of Simon & Schuster from Pearson, the British media company, for $860 million. **********Hoechst had favored a transaction with Kohlberg Kravis because layoffs would be a less important issue with a sale to a buyout firm than with one to a competitor, people close to the negotiations said. But Hoechst's announcement in August was premature; Kohlberg had agreed only in principle, subject to substantial details being worked out later. **********When world markets tumbled late that month, stock prices of comparable companies fell and high-yield financing dried up. Kohlberg would have had to borrow more money than expected at higher rates or put up more of its own capital to get a deal done. As a result, the Americans tried to trim the price by about 15 percent, the people close to the deal said. Hoechst balked, and within days signed an agreement to sell Herberts to the DuPont Company for a higher price -- $1.9 billion. **********Representatives of Hoechst and executives at Kohlberg Kravis would not comment for this article. But industry specialists in Europe say such high-profile backtracking has damaged Americans' reputations. **********''There was a thought that they were pushing too hard,'' said Mr. Stevens at KPMG. ''There was a general feeling that maybe Hoechst got one over on Henry Kravis when it walked away,'' he added, referring to the buyout firm's best-known partner. **********While Kohlberg faced snickers from the business community, Hicks, Muse was castigated in the British press. Mr. Muse said his firm backed out of the Simon & Schuster deal after closer review prompted it to reduce estimates of the reference and publishing units' earnings on six separate occasions. Pearson was willing to renegotiate, he said, but the companies could not agree on price, and the agreement was terminated. **********Some industry observers, though, speculated that Hicks, Muse was unable to get financing. Mr. Muse denied that, but an impression had already been made. ''Hicks is guilty of thorough bad faith in this affair,'' Neil Bennett, a columnist for The Sunday Telegraph of London, wrote last November. ''After its recent performance, however, is this really the sort of firm that Europe's investment banks and companies want to do business with?'' **********Apparently not, according to a lawsuit filed by Pearson last month in New York State Supreme Court. Pearson accused Hicks, Muse of breach of contract, saying that its backing away from the publishing deal was part of a pattern of bargaining in bad faith. The suit cites the termination of Hicks's offer last year to buy Grupo Radio Centro, a Mexican company, for $237 million. **********Mr. Muse attributed the failure of the Grupo Radio deal to a significant earnings shortfall at the Mexican company. He said  the lawsuit had no merit and expressed satisfaction with the cancellation of the Pearson deal. ''At the end of the day, the responsibility is to our investors, and they are relaxed with this decision,'' he said. **********Acquiring an Accent **********Such stumbles haven't thwarted the desire of most firms to adapt to Europe's ways. Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, said his firm holds regular lunches for the ''the great and the good'' -- that is, the upper echelons of British society, including royalty, government officials and socialites. At a recent gathering, top executives from the London Stock Exchange, Christie's and Britain's National Gallery of Art joined Mr. Schwarzman and his colleagues at Claridge's. **********''We do this to get to know people and be an accepted member of the community,'' he said. **********Buyout executives are also ingratiating themselves by hiring Europeans who speak the local languages and understand regional customs. And American investment banks are gearing up their overseas operations to help buyout firms acquire companies abroad. **********Still, deals continue to get lost in the translation. **********Frank D. Yeary, head of the telecommunications team at the New York offices of the buyout firm Carlyle Group, said he was approached last November about taking a 60 percent stake in a European company. But when Mr. Yeary asked for the company's offering document, he got more than 1,000 pages of financial data and contracts. ''It was written like a Swedish Nobel Prize entry,'' he said. **********Mr. Yeary passed on the deal, explaining that Carlyle didn't have the staff necessary to analyze the volumes of information. ''If they hired an American-style investment bank to lead this process, the information would have been easier to understand,'' Mr. Yeary said. ''We speak the same language.'' **********American buyout firms are likely to find allies in the next generation of Europeans headed for corporate suites -- executives who were educated in the United States and are willing to apply the knowledge they gained. Those cosmopolitan managers ''are the agents who are the biggest beneficiaries of the changes going on in Europe,'' said Peter Gonye, a partner who runs the United States financial services practice for Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm in New York. **********In the short term, though, the road to credibility remains challenging. Joseph Rice, the chairman of Clayton, spends as much as a week a month in Germany, not only visiting the management of Thyssen, but also lunching with government and business leaders. **********''Our efforts are at getting the European community to know us and understand that when we say we are going to do a deal, we'll do it,'' he said. ''It is our first investment, and it needs to be a success for us and the current management so they can proselytize the next level of managers.'' **********Still, his voice was weary at the task ahead: ''It's all marketing now,'' he sighed. ''I'm selling all the time.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/04/business/outlook-1999-media-technology-surge-popularity-software-that-unlocks-code.html": {"writer_name": "Amy Harmon", "pub_date": "1999-01-04", "snippet": "Unforeseen computing trend in 1998 was surging popularity of open-source software, which provides every computer user with free access to software's source code, actual lines of commands that programmers write to create software (M)", "word_count": 799, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Surge in Popularity of Software That Unlocks the Code", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK 1999: MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY; A Surge in Popularity of Software That Unlocks the Code", "body_text": " **********The seers of 1997 had the computing trends of 1998 pretty much nailed down -- the Justice Department's antitrust challenge to the Microsoft Corporation, panic over the Year 2000 bug and Wall Street's infatuation with Internet stocks. **********Unforeseen, however, was one of the year's most striking developments: the surging popularity of what has been called open-source software -- probably because it had long been regarded by the industry's most powerful players as more of a political ideology than a way to make money. **********Open-source software provides every computer user with free access to the software's source code, the actual lines of commands that the programmers wrote to create the software. Publishing this code offers users who are programmers the chance to examine it, to fix bugs or inefficiencies or to suggest improvements. **********Once widely denigrated by commercial developers as chaotic programming by committee, open source is now expected to come into its own this year as a business model, with potentially far-reaching consequences for developers and consumers of computer software. **********Some analysts predict that the growing availability of open-source software will push industry prices down. Others forecast higher quality by both proprietary and open-source products, driven by a new competition. **********''At the start of 1998, the question was would there be an economic model that would sustain the success of this open-software movement, and I think that question has been answered,'' said Robert F. Young, chief executive of Red Hat Software, which provides services and support for a free computer operating system called Linux. ''The question for this year is how rapidly is this going to deploy?'' **********Open software programs like Linux, (rhymes with ''cynics'') a variant of the Unix operating system, are not owned by any company or individual. Instead, a global network of programmers and users manage and upgrade them, typically without being paid directly to do so. **********Their motivations vary. Many have built formidable reputations with their contributions to open-source programs, and those reputations can translate into lucrative job offers. Others profess an almost moral commitment, arguing that open-source development simply works better than the traditional closed, proprietary environment of commercial programming. **********Linux, the star of the open-source movement, is seen as a competitor to Windows NT, Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system. Indeed, perhaps the most persuasive evidence of the potential of open source to rattle the balance of power in the computer industry came recently from Microsoft itself. In two internal memorandums that found their way to the Internet, a Microsoft engineer described Linux as a ''mind-share threat'' and suggested ways to compete with and co-opt open-source development. **********Open-source has its roots in venerable programs like Sendmail Inc.'s software that Internet servers around the world use to relay E-mail to its intended destination, and Perl, the programming language that was used to fashion many of the the World Wide Web's interactive features. **********The growth of the Internet has fostered such projects, broadening the universe of potential contributors and allowing for nearly instant distribution of constant upgrades. **********Open source began to gain support last year from blue-chip technology companies. I.B.M., for instance, became a major contributor to Apache, an open-source program for creating Web pages used by the vast majority of Internet service providers. In a new commercial twist on the theme, Sun Microsystems Inc. agreed to make its popular Java source code available to developers who license it. Sun is also retaining PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit the process of who determines which new functions can be added to the language. **********Perhaps the most widely publicized move in this trend was when the Netscape Communications Corporation released the source code to its Navigator Web browser. America Online Inc., which plans to acquire Netscape, has pledged to support its open-source initiatives. **********The moves are driven in part by a common interest in supporting alternatives to Microsoft. But they also reflect the emergence of a new emphasis on making money through software services and support rather than from the software itself. **********Mr. Young of Red Hat Software, which last year received investments from Intel and Netscape, predicts that the top 10 manufacturers of personal computers will offer Linux by the end of this year. Although I.B.M. and Compaq Computer's Digital division sell operating systems, each has announced plans to make some of their software work with Linux. The idea is that they will make money on hardware sales and consulting fees. **********''The real challenge for open-source software is not whether it will replace Microsoft in dominating the desktop, but rather, whether it can craft a business model that will help it to become the Intel Inside of the next generation of computer applications,'' wrote Tim O'Reilly, whose company publishes dozens of books about open-source programs, in the November issue of the industry newsletter Release 1.0. **********''Otherwise,'' Mr. O'Reilly warned, ''the open-source pioneers will be shouldered aside by someone who understands precisely where the current opportunity lies.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/business/media-mit-and-harvard-give-boston-a-niche.html": {"writer_name": "Julie Flaherty", "pub_date": "1999-07-19", "snippet": "Boston, fueled by talent pool from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has become center for publications about technology and business; MIT's Technology Review, which switched to more upbeat coverage of innovation in tec...", "word_count": 788, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "M.I.T. and Harvard Give Boston a Niche", "print_headline": "MEDIA; M.I.T. and Harvard Give Boston a Niche", "body_text": " **********To meet Boston's technology elite, first finagle an invitation to one of Robert M. Metcalfe's parties. His salons, as Mr. Metcalfe -- co-inventor of the computer technology named Ethernet -- calls them, are high-technology schmooze sessions, with perhaps a string of investors chatting up a chief executive in the hallway or two entrepreneurs courting a partnership at dinner. **********But who invited the journalists? On a given night at Mr. Metcalfe's Back Bay home, it is not surprising to find a representative from the publications of International Data Group in one corner, an editor of Fast Company in another and staff members from M.I.T.'s Technology Review mingling among the suits. **********Boston is lousy with editors these days, now that the city has become something of a center for publications about technology and business. There are the old-timers like I.D.G., which started Computer World magazine here 35 years ago and now produces over 300 publications, and Inc. magazine, which has called Boston home for two decades and recently added another publication: Inc. Technology. Sprinkled around the city are Fast Company, Technology Review, Harvard Business Review, PC Week, Electronic Business, Software Magazine and Web Guide. **********Why Boston? Some point to the city's rich publishing history and the historical importance of the loop of high-technology companies on Route 128, which rings the city. But the real reason can be summed up in two names: Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. **********Explaining why I.D.G. began in Boston, its chief executive, Kelly Conlin, said, ''The founder went to M.I.T., and so that was where he was.'' Mr. Conlin himself came to Boston via the Harvard Business School. **********The two universities do supply a pool of talent, says Alan M. Webber, a founding editor of the three-year-old Fast Company, a business magazine aimed at young professionals. **********''It's kind of the same phenomenon as 128 in its heyday, only applied to information and writing,'' Mr. Webber said. ''We've got a lot of smart people, well-educated people, a lot of people who take business ideas very seriously.'' **********Eastern Massachusetts does have its fill of biotechnology companies, software start-ups and teaching hospitals, which lends some weight when publishers here say they have a broader economic base to work with than Wired, Red Herring and their other chip-focused counterparts out West. **********Is it just superciliousness from a coast that lost the battle for computer supremacy? The Boston magazines cover the goings-on out West as well, but being away from the ''froth'' of personalities and issues in Silicon Valley has its advantages, Mr. Webber said. **********''It gives us a little bit of distance from the personalities, the issues, the ideas, so we're able to write to an international business audience without coming directly from Silicon Valley, as if we were only interested in the goings-on in Silicon Valley,'' he said. ''You get a little bit better line of sight into the business and technology if you're not in the belly of the beast.'' **********One magazine that is reveling in the local mix of academia and industry is M.I.T.'s Technology Review. A 100-year-old magazine, it metamorphosed last year when R. Bruce Journey, the new publisher, had the idea of replacing the editor, laying off all but a few members of the old staff and changing the focus from sometimes Luddite reviews to more upbeat coverage of innovation in technology, science and business. After doing everything short of taking a wrecking ball to the publication, Mr. Journey, a former Fortune executive, then boasted that he could double the number of readers and triple the ad base. **********Surprisingly, it worked. With the dust still settling from the demolition, the renewed Technology Review is posting a number better than its own prediction: circulation has jumped to 205,000 from 92,000. **********''We don't fit everywhere,'' Mr. Journey said, trying to describe the niche the magazine is creating. ''We're not business, we're not I.T., we're not a policy whip magazine.'' **********The magazine is gambling in its attempt to mix science and the marketplace, two sectors that traditionally keep each other at arm's length. But the economy is good, the ad team aggressive, and the staff confident that Technology Review will survive, even after the $2.5 million the M.I.T. alumni association pumped into its renewal is used up. **********In a city the size of Boston, there is bound to be some publishing incest. Both Mr. Webber and William C. Taylor were editors at Harvard Business Review before leaving to found Fast Company. Mr. Metcalfe is a pundit for I.D.G. as well as a board member for Technology Review. With all the sharing of leadership, the big question is whether there is enough readership to go around. Mr. Metcalfe is optimistic. **********''This is a time when technology is being both celebrated and analyzed,'' he said.

Turner, who pushed Eastern Air Lines to create its shuttle between Boston and New York in 1961, died on Saturday in Columbus, N.C. He was 89. **********He had suffered a series of strokes in recent months, according to his son. **********Mr. Turner had a lifelong fascination with flying that included stints as a pilot, airport owner and airline executive. A native of Torquay, England, he moved to North Carolina as a teen-ager and by his mid-20's was operating Turner Flying Services, a hangar and a runway in Asheville, N.C., that constituted the first airport in that mountainous resort area. In his spare time, he could be found in the cockpit of his Waco biplane, barnstorming the countryside. **********When the Depression arrived, Mr. Turner had to give up flying. He took a job in 1934 with Eastern, working as a ticket agent on the night shift in Atlanta. He joined the Air Transport Command during World War II, helping to coordinate transportation for troops and world leaders in the Middle East and Europe. **********In 1950, he joined Northeast Airlines, rising to vice president. In 1957, he left to become an executive with the Air Transport Association, where he battled on behalf of airlines, favoring a $3 fine for people who were ''no shows'' and eventually was named president. **********He rejoined Eastern in 1959, said his son, Robert L. Turner Jr. of Milton, Mass. Two years later, Eastern introduced its shuttle service, which was radical in several ways. Passengers were guaranteed seats, and no reservations were required. Anyone who showed up for a flight was to be given one, even if it meant wheeling out an extra plane. **********''He was fascinated with that route because it was so heavily traveled, and he kept saying, 'Let's see what's best for the customer,' '' his son said. **********Another aspect of the shuttle was its low fare, which Mr. Turner and Eastern's president, Malcolm A. MacIntyre, hoped would encourage more people to fly to expand the market for air travel, his son said. ''In those days, there was a great portion of the population who had never flown at all,'' he said, ''and his feeling was that if you run a service like this and get a lot of people flying on short hops, then they'll fly to Los Angeles or Miami.'' Within a year, the shuttle was considered a success. **********Mr. Turner retired from Eastern in 1969 but was soon busy leasing jets in an arrangement he conceived, his son said. ''He knew that Eastern had this tremendous crush of demand in the wintertime because of the Florida routes, and not so much demand in the summertime,'' his son said. ''He thought it was silly for airlines to spend all this money on airplanes they weren't using all the time. So he and this financial partner got two insurance companies to put up the money, and they bought two Lockheed L-1011's. They were used by Eastern in the winter and Air Canada in the summer. For 15 years, these two airplanes got a new paint job every six months and went to work for the other airline.'' Such arrangements subsequently became commonplace in the industry. **********Mr. Turner, a former resident of Darien, Conn., moved to Tryon, N.C., several years ago and spent winters on Sanibel Island, Fla. In Sanibel, an area famous for beachcombing, he listened to old-timers complaining that many of the best seashells were gone for good, and came up with another idea that has yet to be realized, his son said. ''He said: 'Why not have the Chamber of Commerce put up a few bucks and grow some junonias and some lemon pectins and some Chinese alphabet cones? You could grow them in a colony in captivity and toss them out into the gulf and it'd be great for tourism.'

Speaking in Prague at a new conference with President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, Mr. Djukanovic said: ''I'm afraid it's just another attempt to manipulate the public. For Milosevic and Yugoslavia, it's just another attempt to gain more time and to prolong his days in power.'' **********Mr. Djukanovic, who broke with Mr. Milosevic two years ago, said it was self-evident that the Montenegrins would decide their own fate. The issues for him were ''democracy and decentralization,'' he said, and whether they were possible for Montenegro in a Yugoslav Federation run by the autocratic Mr. Milosevic. In 1992, Montenegro chose to remain inside Yugoslavia. **********Western diplomats believe that neither Mr. Milosevic nor Mr. Djukanovic want a confrontation now, but they fear that the situation in Montenegro is unstable and potentially explosive. Mr. Djukanovic has spoken recently of creating a separate Montenegrin currency within days of any formal Yugoslav devaluation of the dinar. **********Today, Mr. Milosevic's party spokesman, Ivica Dacic, said, ''The Serbian people certainly will never be an obstacle for the Montenegrins to have their own country.'' **********But at least 40 percent of Montenegro's population of 650,000 people support Mr. Milosevic and his allies and are sharply opposed to any break in ties with Serbia. Western diplomats believe that a declaration of independence could provoke civil war in Montenegro, with or without Mr. Milosevic's meddling. **********The Yugoslav military has about 12,000 men stationed in Montenegro, while Mr. Djukanovic has built up a militarized police force that is roughly the same size. **********On Aug. 5, Mr. Djukanovic made proposals to Belgrade for a sharply restructured Yugoslavia that would become a more equal confederation, with Montenegro responsible for its own currency and army. After a long silence from Belgrade, Mr. Milosevic proposed party-to-party talks on the future scheduled to begin on Oct. 26. **********If the talks do not succeed, Mr. Djukanovic has spoken of a referendum on independence, which his officials now say could take place as soon as February."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/19/business/the-markets-bonds-30-year-yield-slips-below-6-for-first-time-in-a-month.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-08-19", "snippet": "Treasury bonds rise for fourth day, driving yields below 6 percent for first time in a month; 30-year bond rises 5/32, to price of 101 25/32, pushing yield down to 6 percent; yields on two-year notes, most widely traded Treasuries, falls 5 basic p...", "word_count": 451, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "30-Year Yield Slips Below 6% For First Time In a Month", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: BONDS; 30-Year Yield Slips Below 6% For First Time In a Month", "body_text": " **********Treasury bonds rose for a fourth day yesterday, driving yields below 6 percent for the first time in a month, on expectations that the Federal Reserve will not need to raise interest rates more than once to try to stem inflation. **********Mark Sauvigne, a bond trader at Chase Securities Inc., said, ''People are getting more comfortable with the idea the Fed is going to raise just 25 basis points.'' A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. **********That optimism helped the 30-year bond in late trading, after it had languished for much of the day as a 2-yen decline in the dollar sapped demand for Treasuries. **********David Hoffman, who helps manage $1 billion at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del., predicted yields would continue to come down.

It shows him on the beach with his family, trying to relax within a tight circle of secret service agents, their backs to him, their guns pointed outward. **********This morning, in the newspaper Haaretz, a cartoon mimicked the photo, but depicted Mr. Netanyahu and family encircled by new bodyguards: ultra-Orthodox men in black hats with Uzis. **********As Mr. Netanyahu fights for his political survival in elections on Monday, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community stands nearly unanimously by his side, with rabbis and religious parties issuing enthusiastic last-minute endorsements of his ailing candidacy. **********But Mr. Netanyahu's struggling candidacy is bleeding support from other core constituencies: Sephardic Jews, secular right-wingers and Russian immigrants. And many believe that his behavior is panicky, as though he is on the ropes. In recent appearances, he has lashed out defensively at the left, the elite, the media, and the polls. **********At a rally in Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, Mr. Netanyahu explained to the crowd why he thought his opponents were ''mobilizing'' against him ''beyond all bounds'' of reason. He started a slow chant that the crowd picked up, their voices filling the hall: ''They are a-fraid, they are a-fraid, they are a-fraid.'' **********Mr. Netanyahu is trailing his main opponent, Ehud Barak, by a solid 8 points in the latest polls. For the first time, some conservative analysts are suggesting that Mr. Barak, the Labor Party leader, could win a clear majority in the Monday vote, obviating the need for an anticipated runoff on June 1. **********Politicians like Natan Sharanksy, the Trade Minister under Mr. Netanyahu, are already talking end-game coalition politics, under the implicit assumption that the Prime Minister will be defeated. As Election Day nears, Mr. Netanyahu has lost not only voters but also some Likud Party mayors and workers who feel neglected. A leading party official said in an interview that there was no money to pay party activists now, and that some have threatened a walkout if the elections proceed to a runoff without financing. **********''Netanyahu sacrificed the party and its ideology to his own political interests,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a conservative political scientist at Bar-Ilan University. ''The party is going to take a terrible drubbing in these elections.'' **********Likud leaders, many of whom have feuded with Mr. Netanyahu privately about the campaign, are reported to be planning a post-election putsch even as they ostensibly work for Mr. Netanyahu's re-election. **********From the start, this election has been a referendum on Mr. Netanyahu's character, not his policies: ''To Bibi or not to Bibi,'' pollster Hanoch Smith called it today, using the Prime Minister's nickname. **********On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu turned that around, attacking his critics. ''Almost all of the media, though not everyone, is mobilizing now,'' Mr. Netanyahu said on the radio. ''They are setting aside all professional ethics -- a simple absolute mobilization for the victory of Barak and the left. The things reported about me are usually the opposite of the truth. The things reported about Barak are generally slick and flattering.'' **********A tape of the rally's call-and-response of ''They're a-fraid'' was played on Israel Radio all day today. Asked to comment, Ehud Olmert, the Mayor of Jerusalem and the top contender for the Likud Party leadership, distanced himself from Mr. Netanyahu's remarks. **********''I don't think the media are afraid of anybody,'' he said. **********If not afraid, though, the media are almost unanimously hostile to Mr. Netanyahu. **********Mr. Netanyahu, who like many Israelis is skeptical of election predictions, says the polls will prove to be inaccurate. He says immigrants and the ultra-Orthodox lie to the polls, so the polls cannot be trusted. He also reminds his supporters that Shimon Peres, who lost to him by 30,000 votes in 1996, was forecast as the winner even on election night. **********But during the last race, unlike now, Mr. Netanyahu's popularity had been steadily rising in the weeks before the ballots were cast. **********Likud strategists say now that their goal is to survive the first round, assuming that Mr. Netanyahu will fare better in a one-on-one runoff. If a solid center-left majority wins control of the Parliament on Monday, it could galvanize swing voters to return to Mr. Netanyahu. And the Prime Minister is presumed to be the master of focused political combat. **********Yet thus far many of his punches have been off. **********Analysts say his biggest misstep was in trying to force a confrontation with the Palestinians over Orient House -- the Palestine Liberation Organization's headquarters in Jerusalem -- against the advice first of his Security Minister and then of Mayor Olmert. **********Orient House is not supposed to house any offices of the Palestinian government, under international agreement. Asserting that Palestinian government work was being conducted there, Mr. Netanyahu moved to close it down last week. **********While he said it was government business, a simple clampdown on an illegality, critics even within his party saw it as blatant theatrics. They said he wanted to generate photographs of Israeli police storming a Palestinian stronghold in Jerusalem on the eve of elections. His Security Minister said there would be bloodshed. It took a High Court injunction to told back the police. **********Dan Margalit, a columnist for Haaretz, today urged Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party candidate, to pull out of the race -- as did the paper's editorial. Polls suggest that would give Mr. Barak a full majority and victory on Monday, eliminating the need for a runoff on June 1. However, should the election go to a second round, no one expects Mr. Netanyahu to go down without a fierce fight. **********''Another 14 days with a Prime Minister who is fighting for his political life like an injured lion?'' Mr. Margalit said, adding ''who knows'' what Mr. Netanyahu will be tempted to do so secure a victory. **********Relying on the themes that worked in 1996, Mr. Netanyahu's campaign, under the guidance of Arthur Finkelstein, a Republican political consultant from New York, has tried to push the same buttons: the left will divide Jerusalem, the left will allow terrorism, the left is elite and does not represent the people. **********But it is difficult for a sitting Prime Minister to represent himself as an outsider. And it is hard to portray Mr. Barak, a highly decorated former general, as a softie. On the issue of Jerusalem, for instance, Mr. Barak's campaign was able to respond quickly with a film clip of Likud's Mr. Olmert saying that Mr. Barak would not consider dividing the city. **********To remind voters that terrorism raged under the previous Labor Government, Mr. Netanyahu used commercials showing old footage of terrorist bus bombings, just as he did last time. After the use of those ads provoked criticism within Likud and from the relatives of victims of terror, they were re-evaluated -- and then repeated. **********During the last election, Rabbi Joseph Gutnik, a wealthy and ultra-Orthodox Australian, initiated a wildly successful ''Bibi is good for the Jews'' campaign days before the elections. On Friday, he, too, is expected to try to work his magic again, but on a limited scale. **********He is expected to publish large ads in religious newspapers, calling on readers to support Mr. Netanyahu. **********''This is a matter of the soul,'' the ads say, according to Israeli newspapers. ''We are facing, heaven forbid, the grave and awful peril of the establishment of a leftist government. It is clear to everyone that such a government will wreak catastrophic havoc on the most fundamental Jewish issues, on our holy land, and on the security of all the Jews living in the land of Israel.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/23/news/expatriates-take-over-in-west-shifting-scene-in-chinese-art.html": {"writer_name": "Souren Melikian", "pub_date": "1999-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2029, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Expatriates Take Over in West : Shifting Scene In Chinese Art", "print_headline": "Expatriates Take Over in West : Shifting Scene In Chinese Art", "body_text": " **********NEW YORK\u2014                     Slowly, irresistibly, the Chinese art scene in the West, from auction houses to museums, is passing into the hands of the multifaceted expatriate Chinese elite. **********Last month, during Asia Week, the Chinese presence was felt as seldom before at New York auctions. At Sotheby's, the biggest scores on Sept. 15 were made courtesy of the Chinese whose weight grows fast in the market for imperial porcelain identified as such by underglaze reign marks. The ultimate symbol was a set of 12 \"month\" cups exquisitely decorated during the Kangxi reign (1662-1722) with blossoms and rock patterns on one side and a poem in blue characters on the other. **********It first surfaced at auction at Sotheby's Hong Kong on Nov. 15, 1988, when the Hong Kong business tycoon T.T. Tsui bought it for the equivalent of $465,000. Having \"improved\" the set by replacing a flawed cup with another piece in mint condition, the businessman consigned it to Christie's Hong Kong, where it rose to $717,600 in November 1996. As it reappeared at Sotheby's in September, some speculated that Tsui might have retained a personal interest in it. **********That was enough to inhibit most buyers, and one lone telephone bidder got the desirable set for $607,500. It is back in Hong Kong in the home of a businessman who began collecting 10 years ago. **********The lot that followed illustrates the change in the Chinese approach to porcelain collecting. The Yongzheng period (1723-1735) dish is decorated with a prunus tree and a bamboo in the imperial taste \u2014 a variant is preserved in the Palace Museum inBeijing, which made it immensely attractive in Chinese eyes. The dish suffered a crack, which a decade ago would have doomed it. The combination of Western influence and rarity \u2014 only one other such dish (intact) is in private hands, those of the great Hong Kong collector Au Bak Ling \u2014 has changed that. A Hong Kong businessman who has been buying porcelain for about five years gladly paid $156,500, twice the middle estimate. **********The Chinese missed out on the third important porcelain piece but helped to send it soaring. The imperial vase of the Qianlong period (1736-1795) decorated with rows of lotus blossoms is a match to one in the Imperial Collection in Beijing. A crack at the top had kept its price down to $14,300 when it was seen at Sotheby's on Dec. 4, 1984. Last month, it made $398,500 courtesy of a Western buyer who was underbid by MeeSeen Loong of Sotheby's on behalf of a Chinese client. **********- **********THE greatest novelty is the role that Chinese connoisseurs play in sculpture. On Sept. 16, Christie's was selling \"Masterpieces of Chinese sculpture from a private collection.\" The 31 lots actually came from a vast collection built up by a Taiwan businessman in the last four or five years. His choice is itself highly revealing of another cultural change in the Chinese communities. New collectors are willing to go after sculpture recovered from funerary caches or broken off from Buddhist cave temples that were traditionally held to be taboo, the tombs or the temples having been desecrated. **********On Sept. 16, several lots were hotly disputed between Chinese and Western contenders. A fragmentary stele of the sixth century with the standing figures of a Buddha and a bodhisattva went to an American collector who paid $497,500, outbidding a Chinese rival, and a gray earthenware Tang horse from the same collection was acquired by a French dealer. But it was a Hong Kong collector who successfully bid on a temple figure of Guanyin (Avalokiteshvara) carved in the 12th century and retaining most of its polychromy. The price: $464,500. **********In some fields, Chinese collectors have come to enjoy a quasi-monopoly. Painting has long been dominated by them. A more recent preserve is archaic jades from the third millennium B.C. to the end of the Han dynasty, in 220 A.D. **********- **********ANTHONY LIN, deputy chairman of Christie's Asia, says that he is aware of at least eight major collections of archaic jades formed in Taiwan during the last decade. **********Some, such as the \"Lan Tien Shan Fang\" collection, which numbers more than 500 pieces, have been published in book form. **********Others remain shrouded in secrecy. The market is handled by dealers who bring the jades out of China and offer them straight away to connoisseurs in Taiwan, Hong Kong or Singapore. **********This is in marked contrast to later jades bought for decorative purposes, often ostensibly, with Chinese collectors leading. **********The Chinese specialists, whose importance in Western auction houses grows constantly, probably contributed to the development of Chinese collecting. Their presence has certainly had a considerable impact on the way of conducting business in the Far East. **********The Singapore-born international director of Christie's Chinese art department is Theow Huang Tow, who joined the company in 1980. Educated in English-speaking Singapore, Tow took a degree in Asian art history at Columbia University and was among the first to build bridges between the Western marketing system and the Chinese collecting world. He played a significant part in attracting collectors from the Chinese overseas communities to the New York auction house. **********Lin, who was also born in Singapore, graduated in economics and philosophy at University College in London before getting a masters degree in Chinese art and archaeology from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. He set up Christie's office in Taipei in 1993 and is now based in Hong Kong. **********In Taipei, his patrician manner worked wonders. In Hong Kong, Lin hired Edmund Chin, the Christie's Oxford-educated Chinese jewelry wizard who, in just two years, secured for Christie's two-thirds of the market share in the Far East. When Chin joined the company in October 1993, jade sales in the autumn auction totaled $2.2 million. In 1996, they hit $10 million, more than 90 percent of it going to Chinese buyers. **********The growing presence of Chinese academics on the American scene indirectly encouraged Chinese collecting. Its roots go far back in time. Wen Fong, a Princeton University professor, for years ran the Chinese art department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. **********A scholar in Chinese painting, he was a linchpin between some expatriate collectors and the Western museum world. At the Met, the Brooke Russell Astor senior research curator of Chinese art goes by the name of James Watt. His real name is Qu Zhiren, and he is the scion of a mandarin family that emigrated to Hong Kong. Watt left for America in 1982. **********He is one of many bicultural Asians who played a role behind the scenes in the development of Chinese art collecting. **********The Chinese takeover of the Chinese art scene in the Western world is likely to accelerate. Lin points out that when Chinese entrepreneurs develop an interest in art, generally when they are in their 40s, they learn quickly. In Taiwan, particularly, they go at it with a determination that makes them build up impressive holdings in just a few years. **********The latest field into which the Chinese have plunged is Chinese furniture. A connoisseur at the crossroads of the Chinese and the English-speaking worlds, Grace Wu Bruce of Hong Kong, played a key role in the last decade. A collector for 10 years, Wu Bruce turned into a dealer and kindled interest in her field among the overseas Chinese. With the likes of her and Chin in the collecting arena and Wen Fong or Qu Zhiren in academe, the Chinese art scene in the Western world will have changed beyond recognition in a decade or two. **********- **********SOUREN MELIKIAN is art editor of the International Herald Tribune."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/18/business/the-markets-bonds-treasuries-rally-on-moderate-rise-in-consumer-prices.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Hurtado", "pub_date": "1999-08-18", "snippet": "US bond prices rally sharply; 30-year Treasury bond gains 1 2/32, to price of 101 20/32; yield drops to 6.01 percent from 6.08 percent; graph on yields of selected Treasury securities; chart on US key interest rates (M)", "word_count": 592, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasuries Rally on Moderate Rise in Consumer Prices", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: BONDS; Treasuries Rally on Moderate Rise in Consumer Prices", "body_text": " **********Bonds rallied sharply yesterday after a Labor Department report showed that consumer prices rose in July at the level that Wall Street had expected.

The company sold $1 billion of a floating-rate issue due in 2002 and priced to yield 27 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered rate. Another $1.5 billion of five-year notes were priced to yield 6.935 percent, or 115 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security. And $2 billion of 10-year notes were priced to yield 134 basis points more than a comparable Treasury.

We each defend our interests, certainly.\" **********Other leaders said the mood at the talks had not been as apocalyptic as some reports had suggested. Still, no one minimized the scale of the problems facing the EU, which is seeking to reform its budget looking to the period between 2001 and 2006. **********Only by bringing tough measures to control spending, including the runaway cost of farm subsidies, can the EU hope to create the conditions to accept new members from Eastern and Central Europe. But this entailed what Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France called a global solution, in which all countries shared sacrifices. **********And that was not proving easy. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, for example, said he was not prepared to abandon the multi-billion euro rebate that his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, won 15 years ago. He said it was a matter of justice, not obstinacy, on Britain's part. **********Mr. Chirac said most participants at the summit meeting felt that Britain must agree to re-examine the rebate \u2014 a demand that Mr. Blair would find difficult to sell politically at home. But the French president said he had no doubt that Mr. Blair would agree to such a re-examination. **********Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain said Europe had changed much since Mrs. Thatcher had won the rebate with a cry of \"I want my money back.\" **********But at the same time, Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin said France would make no concession on its demand that agricultural price support must continue to be funded by the EU rather than partly by governments, as Germany has suggested. For the French, the biggest beneficiaries of subsidies, the question concerns not only money but also the very character of the EU and its acquired laws and benefits. **********Mr. Schroeder said Mr. Chirac had made it clear that as far as France was concerned, it would not even discuss the matter. **********Nevertheless, the leaders did decide what they described as a strong message to agriculture ministers to get back to the negotiating table in Brussels next week, following their failure to reach any agreement this week. **********Mr. Schroeder said he had serious concerns that failure to reach agreement on the EU reforms in March in Berlin could lead to complications concerning the European single currency, the euro. **********But other leaders said they did share that concern. **********In European affairs, Mr. Schroeder is under heavy pressure to show results at the Berlin summit meeting after a series of political setbacks at home \u2014 otherwise, he risks getting a black eye in the European Parliament elections in June. The election already has shaped up in Bonn as a referendum on Mr. Schroeder's handling of EU issues. **********Brushing aside reports of French touchiness over Germany's pressure for action, Mr. Chirac praised the \"agreeable and efficient\" way that the summit had been arranged. If differences persisted, he added, they had helped the countries better understand those differences. **********He insisted that France was as interested as anyone in bringing the budget and agricultural spending under control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/business/world-business-briefing-europe-merger-possibility-denied.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1999-10-27", "snippet": "Allied Domecq PLC denies reports that it has been approached by Pernod-Ricard SA of France about a merger (S)", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MERGER POSSIBILITY DENIED", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; MERGER POSSIBILITY DENIED", "body_text": " **********The world's second-largest liquor company, Allied Domecq P.L.C., denied persistent news reports that it had been approached by Pernod-Ricard S.A. of France about a merger.

Summers gives a speech these days, he softens up the audience by facetiously suggesting that he sought advice about what to say from the two men who have served as his mentors the last six years. **********''Rubin said to be cautious,'' Mr. Summers says, referring to the legendary self-control of Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, whom he was nominated to succeed today. ''And Alan Greenspan,'' he adds, invoking the name of the Fed chairman who is Mr. Summers's frequent opponent on the tennis courts, ''said to be opaque.'' **********When he came to Washington six years ago, Lawrence Henry Summers was neither cautious nor opaque. **********He arrived with a reputation for brilliance -- the youngest scholar ever to be granted tenure at Harvard, at 28 -- and an equal reputation for intolerance of those he considered slow to grasp the dynamics of an unforgiving global economy. **********It was a category into which Mr. Summers placed many Washington politicians, most Japanese and European finance ministers and more than a few of his colleagues in the Clinton Administration. And it regularly got him in trouble, whether the issue was saving Mexico, stabilizing Russia or rewriting the laws governing inheritance taxes. **********But the last year or two, a new Larry Summers has emerged -- one who has tamed his sharp-edged wit, who regularly solicits key members of Congress for their advice, who now occasionally acknowledges errors of political judgment. **********As he entered the home stretch of his training for the most visible and vital job in managing the world economy, he has become, one close associate at the Treasury said recently, ''more Rubin-esqe.'' A few weeks ago, during a particularly contentious argument at the White House over how to handle the politically explosive issue of China's efforts to join the World Trade Organization, Mr. Summers surprised several Administration officials by prefacing his arguments with a version of Mr. Rubin's oft-used, self-effacing phrase, ''It's just one man's opinion, but . . .'' **********Mr. Summers still has plenty of critics in Washington -- environmentalists who remain suspicious of him after a bitter clash when he was chief economist of the World Bank, bruised State Department hands who clashed with him on how to deal with Japan and Russia, Asian leaders who have termed him a bully and economists who argue that he helped promote the free flow of capital in markets around the world -- and then blamed the countries that couldn't handle the consequences. **********But even his harshest critics say the scope and depth of his economic understanding are astounding, to the point that he once pleaded with a reporter that he would like to be described in the newspapers as anything except the ''the brilliant but acerbic Larry Summers.'' And now, at 44, the man who grew up in a family of renowned economists will have roughly 18 months to demonstrate his talents at the helm of the most successful American economy in a generation. **********If he succeeds, he will go down in history as the relief pitcher who helped save the one legacy a scandal-ridden President is likely to boast about in his memoirs. If markets crash and economies collapse, both Mr. Summers's grasp of the new forces of the global economy and his newly developed diplomatic skills will face their greatest test. **********''A few years ago, people would have questioned whether Larry had the gravitas to match his incredible talents, whether he could be less of an academic and more of a Washington player,'' one of Mr. Summers's close friends, Daniel Tarullo, who left the White House last year, said today. ''You don't hear that kind of thing anymore. He has learned Bob's greatest capacity: to be sure about some things, and to be aware of what he is not sure of, too.'' **********As he sipped a cup of coffee in his private dining room at the Treasury late this afternoon, Mr. Rubin was asked whether Mr. Summers could calm the markets on a calamitous day, as Mr. Rubin himself did from the steps of the Treasury after a 500-point drop in the Dow in October 1997, the early days of the Asian crisis. He thought about the question for a moment and then said that ''in the last year or so -- maybe the last couple of years -- Larry has developed a great deal of credibility.'' The markets, he said, ''are now comfortable with him.'' **********But Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers are clearly not comfortable about the markets. Mr. Summers cringes these days when he hears the confident-sounding tone of Wall Street executives as they talk about a Dow that could reach 15,000 or more and refer to the problems of Japan and the emerging markets in the past tense. ''We have nothing to fear,'' Mr. Summers warns these days, with no apologies to Franklin D. Roosevelt, ''except the lack of fear itself.'' **********Managing excess fear and excess optimism was not part of Mr. Summers's academic preparation, but it has become very much a part of his life for the last six years -- years of applying what he called ''battlefield medicine'' for a world financial system that is undergoing wrenching change. **********He has come to advocate something he often calls the ''financial Powell doctrine,'' a derivative of former Gen. Colin Powell's argument that if the United States commits forces, it must do so to win. Similarly, Mr. Summers argues after the experiences of Mexico and the Asian crisis, if the choice is made to pour money into a country to save it from default and restore the confidence of investors, it must be done decisively. The middle ground, he often argues, is treacherous and results in propping up an economy only long enough for the rich to get their capital out of the country. **********But he also recognizes that saving a country with cash often takes the pressure off policy makers to reform. And so Mr. Summers has often been the Treasury's heavy hand, arriving in foreign capitals to deliver the news that they must take unpleasant steps -- closing banks, ending crony capitalism, curbing corruption -- in return for aid from the International Monetary Fund, in which the United States is the leading voice. **********He has angered many along the way -- Asians who wanted more money and fewer conditions, Europeans who wanted to apply more conditions and less money. ''What's easy to miss is that a lot of innovations in the financial system that we've adopted in recent years come from Larry and the Treasury,'' said Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the I.M.F., who counted Mr. Summers among his students at M.I.T. **********It was while he was finishing his doctorate that Mr. Summers, perpetually the disheveled-looking graduate student as he roamed around Cambridge, Mass., was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He went through a year of intense chemotherapy and has been in remission ever since, though the experience seemed to drive him to live life a bit harder, to stack up his accomplishments even faster. **********He was snapped up by the Harvard economics department and garnered awards for his work at a startling pace. He moved on to the World Bank in 1991, where he succeeded Mr. Fischer as chief economist and oversaw a long study -- one that would be written very differently now -- about the causes of the East Asian economic miracle. **********It was also there that he ran into trouble, publishing a paper that included the observation that ''the economic logic of dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest-wage country is impeccable.'' It raised a firestorm with enviromentalists, including Al Gore, and Mr. Summers has worked hard -- and apparently successfully -- to work his way back into the Vice President's confidence. **********The toxic-waste incident also, it later became clear, showed a different side of Mr. Summers. The paper was written by an aide, who volunteered to take responsibility for it. Mr. Summers refused, the aide later recalled, insisting that since he had signed off on it, he had to take responsibility for it. **********Mr. Summers returned briefly to academia before he and his wife, Victoria, now a tax lawyer at the I.M.F., returned to Washington so that he could become Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. He was often juggling cellular phone calls to finance ministers around the world with the tasks of entertaining three young children: twin girls, Pam and Ruth, now 8, and a son, Harry, who is 5. All three were playing late this afternoon in Mr. Summers's Treasury office as reporters and well-wishers stopped by. **********Mr. Summers's first real conflicts with Congress came over the Mexico crisis, when he often jousted with former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York and frequently angered members of Congress with what they viewed as a significant lack of deference. He once referred to Republican efforts to sharply cut inheritance taxes for the rich as ''greed,'' starting a small firestorm. **********He was put in charge of solving the problems at the Internal Revenue Service, but his critics say he began serious reforms only after bruising Congressional hearings into I.R.S. mismanagement and abuses. He is co-chairman of the Administration's working group on Social Security, and the inventor of the Treasury's inflation-indexed bonds, bought by cautious investors who want a return adjusted for inflation. **********Mr. Rubin often enjoyed tweaking Mr. Summers for his absent-minded ways, missing airplanes, or his focus on his cell phone instead of what was happening in front of him. Once, on the way to a mission to Indonesia last year to persuade President Suharto to accept financial reforms, Mr. Summers was pleasantly surprised when a passenger came up to him and said, ''Excuse me, are you Lawrence Summers?'' **********The Deputy Treasury Secretary straightened himself, happy to be recognized. ''Yes I am,'' he said. ''I thought so,'' said the passenger, handing him something. ''I just found your passport.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/22/world/report-warns-of-big-gains-to-chinese-from-spying.html": {"writer_name": "Jeff Gerth", "pub_date": "1999-04-22", "snippet": "Study by US intelligence officials concludes that China is likely to use stolen advanced US nuclear weapons secrets to upgrade its weapons within years, not decades; study was coordinated by Robert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for Strate...", "word_count": 677, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Report Warns Of Big Gains To Chinese From Spying", "print_headline": "Report Warns Of Big Gains To Chinese From Spying", "body_text": " **********China is likely to use stolen advanced American nuclear weapons secrets  to upgrade its weapons within years, not decades, a senior intelligence official said today. **********So far Beijing has not deployed nuclear weapons using stolen American technology, United States officials say. But the official, discussing a new intelligence assessment, told reporters that stolen nuclear secrets probably accelerated China's future weapons programs. **********The study, done by intelligence officials throughout the Government, was coordinated by Robert Walpole, the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear Programs for the Government's National Intelligence Council. **********It examined the evidence that China has acquired American nuclear weapons information and it estimated what that has meant for the development of China's weapons programs. An outside panel reviewed and concurred with the assessment. **********China is developing a lighter, more mobile nuclear force but does not have anywhere near the same number of nuclear weapons as the United States or Russia. Chinese officials have consistently denied that China stole American nuclear secrets. **********A one-page unclassified version of the assessment was released at the briefing. It made these points: **********''China obtained by espionage classified U.S. nuclear weapons information that probably accelerated its program to develop future nuclear weapons,'' by enabling Beijing to focus on more productive avenues and ''avoid less promising approaches.'' **********''China obtained at least basic design information on several modern U.S. nuclear re-entry vehicles, including the Trident II (W-88),'' as well as information on ''a variety of U.S. weapon design concepts and weaponization features, including those of the neutron bomb.'' **********The unclassified assessment lacks  details and is filled with conditional phrases and generalities. A more detailed, secret version of the report was presented today to Congressional and executive branch officials by George J. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, and Mr. Walpole. **********The public assessment does not address whether China's legal and illegal acquisition of American nuclear-weapons information affected American national security. **********The study was done at the request of a select Congressional committee  that found last year that national security had been harmed as a result of China's 20-year pattern of acquiring American technology, including  nuclear design secrets stolen from American weapons laboratories. **********The lengthy secret report made use of earlier assessments by the C.I.A. and the Energy Department that came to similar conclusions that China had stolen W-88 design secrets, which enable nuclear weapons to be miniaturized, officials said. But in 1997, on the eve of a Washington summit meeting at which Chinese-American relations were elevated to  a ''strategic partnership,'' White House officials magnified the differences between the C.I.A. and the Energy Department reports to cast doubt on the Energy Department's troubling conclusions, officials said. **********According to the latest assessment, China's quest for smaller nuclear weapons probably reflects its desire for a more mobile force that can survive and retaliate against a nuclear attack by the United States or Russia, or a ''second-strike capability.'' **********China's aggressive and successful efforts to acquire United States secrets, both through espionage and open methods like scientific exchanges, as well as China's indigenous development, have ''made an important contribution to the Chinese objective to maintain a second-strike capability and provided useful information for future designs,'' the assessment said. The assessment did not calculate the relative importance of each Chinese acquisition method. **********China's weapons program is still deficient in significant ways and the Chinese are ''almost certainly'' now using spying and other methods ''to address deficiencies,'' the assessment said. **********The assessment also suggested that China might be more inclined to share older nuclear technology with countries like Iran or Pakistan -- a source of continuing concern for the United States -- as a result of its theft of more modern American technology. **********But, the assessment said, ''we do not know if U.S. classified nuclear information acquired by the Chinese has been passed to other countries.'' **********President Clinton was briefed on the assessment this afternoon and then issued a statement saying he had asked the National Counterintelligence Board to assess the potential vulnerabilities at other nuclear weapons facilities besides the national laboratories. He also asked the board for recommendations to strengthen protections against the loss of nuclear secrets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/02/business/international-business-second-largest-bank-in-france-buying-a-rival.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1999-02-02", "snippet": "Societe Generale SA, France's second-largest commercial bank, says it will pay about $18 billion in stock to acquire Paribas SA, nation's fifth-largest bank, quickly arousing speculation about new wave of takeovers in France and across Europe; SG ...", "word_count": 961, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Second-Largest Bank in France Buying a Rival", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Second-Largest Bank in France Buying a Rival", "body_text": " **********Societe Generale S.A., France's second-biggest commercial bank, said today that it it would pay about $18 billion in stock to acquire Paribas S.A., the nation's fifth-largest bank, quickly arousing speculation about a new wave of takeovers in France and across the Continent. **********If the deal is completed, the new SG Paribas would probably rank as Europe's third-largest financial institution behind UBS of Switzerland and Deutsche Bank. **********Societe Generale will exchange five of its shares for every eight of Paribas, for a total value around 16 billion euros and a 17 percent premium based on Friday's closing stock prices. **********As with most bank deals, plans for the combined SG Paribas call for significant cost-cutting and reductions in the work force. Executives at the two banks predicted that they could save about 800 million euros a year, or a little more than $900 million, starting in 2001. **********Analysts said there were advantages and disadvantages to the fit between the two financial institutions. On the one hand, they have somewhat complementary businesses because Paribas is much stronger as an investment bank while Societe Generale is stronger as a bank for retail customers. On the other hand, there are not as many easy areas for cutting costs because the two banks do not have extensive overlapping branch networks. As a result, some analysts said the acquisition does little to resolve one of the biggest problems for European banks -- too many branches. **********The move marks the latest in a series of giant combinations in the European banking and insurance industries as financial institutions struggle for position in a European market with a single currency. But analysts and industry executives said it could also open France's insular banking market by putting pressure on the nation's other big institutions to search for cross-border mergers. **********Investors quickly focused on Banque Nationale de Paris, the country's biggest, as well as on Credit Lyonnais, the Government-owned bank that has lost billions and is being groomed for privatization this spring. **********In some ways, the agreement between Societe Generale and Paribas reinforces a persistent trend toward ever-bigger banking combinations between institutions in the same country. Even though the new European single currency is hastening the development of a single financial market, banks are shoring up their positions by merging within national boundaries. **********Two weeks ago, Banco Santander solidified its position as Spain's biggest bank by acquiring Banco Central Hispano for $11.3 billion in stock. But huge mergers within national boundaries have also taken place over the last year in Germany, Italy and Belgium. **********Yet some analysts and industry executives suggested that today's deal might unlock the French banking industry by driving institutions like Banque Nationale de Paris into the arms of foreign partners. ''I think we are just at the start of this consolidation process in banking,'' said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, Deutsche Bank's chairman, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ''Someone's really started to get things moving, and that will open the doors for many other developments in the French financial market.'' **********Deutsche Bank badly wants to buy a big French bank, but has been repeatedly rebuffed by French political leaders who recoil at the idea of a foreign takeover. And Commerzbank, Germany's fourth largest, has recently said that it would like to make a French acquisition. **********John Leonard, a banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in London, said that the deal announced today could provide the chance that the German banks had been waiting for. ''We see specific positive implications for the remaining French shares and for the major German names, especially Dresdner and Commerzbank,'' he said. **********Some experts said the union between Societe Generale and Paribas was in many ways a shotgun marriage arranged by Claude Bebear, chairman of the insurance conglomerate AXA and one of France's most powerful financial figures. **********AXA is Paribas's biggest shareholder, owning about 7 percent of the stock, and Mr. Bebear publicly criticized the bank in October for its disappointing performance. **********''Bebear made it clear he was not very happy with the bank,'' said Jean-Baptiste Bellon, a banking analyst at Deutsche Bank. Since Paribas was privatized by the French Government in 1987, its stock has missed out on much of the bull market and has lagged far behind that of Societe Generale. **********In Paris today, Paribas shares rose 8.15 euros, or 9.7 percent, to 92.15 euros. Shares of Societe Generale fell 5 euros, or 3.16 percent, to 153. Its American depository receipts lost $1.625, closing at $34 in Nasdaq trading. **********AXA was on its own acquisition drive today as it reached an agreement to take over Royal Guardian Exchange, a British insurer, for $5.68 billion. **********''In our minds, to be profitable it is essential to be the leader or one of the leaders in the market,'' Mr. Bebear said in Paris today. And, he added, AXA still has an appetite for more acquisitions in the United States and Asia. **********In contrast to AXA, which has emerged as one of Europe's most formidable insurance carriers, French banks have been increasingly overshadowed by their big German neighbors and by the big Wall Street investment banks that have helped engineer many of Europe's biggest deals. **********French banks, though they are big, are not particularly strong in other European countries, and many have been burdened by bad loans in Asian countries and other emerging markets. **********As soon as Societe Generale and Paribas announced their plans to combine, attention turned to the possible effect on Credit Lyonnais, which has required billions of francs in Government bailouts because of a catastrophic bet on real estate financing in the 1980's. **********Thanks to that Government help and to new management, Credit Lyonnais recently became profitable again, and the Government now wants to give control to a group of friendly shareholders that might easily include Banque Nationale de Paris, Societe Generale, AXA and even the German insurance conglomerate Allianz A.G."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/05/business/company-briefs-549207.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-05-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 118, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********SONOCO PRODUCTS CO., Hartsville, S.C., a maker of industrial and consumer packing products, agreed to acquire the composite can assets of Crown Cork and Seal Co., Philadelphia, the packaging producer, for an undisclosed amount of cash. **********IMATION CORP., Oakdale, Minn., a technology company spun off by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. in 1996, said it had laid off 150 employees, or 2.3 percent of its work force, in the first quarter. **********MIDAMERICAN ENERGY HOLDINGS CO., Des Moines, said an arbitration panel in Jakarta had awarded it $572 million because Indonesia's Government-owned utility had refused to honor contracts to buy electricity. **********GEORGIA-PACIFIC GROUP, Atlanta, a maker of building products and paper, announced that it would split its stock two shares for one."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/30/world/crisis-balkans-serbian-strategy-milosevic-goal-serb-enclave-nato-declares.html": {"writer_name": "Craig Whitney", "pub_date": "1999-03-30", "snippet": "NATO officials say Yugoslav Pres Slobodan Milosevic's goal in Kosovo is to carve out Serb-only enclave in province that he can keep after fighting ends; say campaign is under way to ethnically re-engineer Kosovo to achieve solution more acceptable...", "word_count": 923, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Milosevic Goal Is Serb Enclave, NATO Declares", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE SERBIAN STRATEGY; Milosevic Goal Is Serb Enclave, NATO Declares", "body_text": " **********NATO officials said today that Slobodan Milosevic's goal in Kosovo was to carve out a Serb-only enclave in the province that he could hold onto after the fighting had ended. **********''We have the impression that there is a campaign under way to ethnically re-engineer the inside of Kosovo, to achieve a solution more acceptable to him,'' said the chief spokesman for NATO, Jamie P. Shea. **********Although the immediate allied concern is the bombing campaign, officials are looking beyond it and trying to predict Mr. Milosevic's long-term aims. For eight years, he has proven adept at creating what diplomats call ''facts on the ground,'' territorial conquests that end in cease-fires and are presented to the West for ratification through a peace deal. **********Those concerns were heightened today with the announcement that Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov and the Foreign and Defense Ministers of Russia had been dispatched on a mission to Belgrade. NATO officials feared that the Russians would try to broker an agreement that could be well short of the allies' stated goal of an autonomous Kosovo protected by NATO troops. **********American officials said Mr. Primakov's mission could be part of an effort to split NATO, because some members have become uneasy over the prospect of unlimited attacks without results. There have already been some tensions among the 19-member alliance, with the Italians and Greeks' expressing doubts about the wisdom of an extended bombing campaign. **********NATO officials today denied that the bombing had set off the Serbian military offensive in Kosovo and was causing additional civilian casualties instead of preventing them. Military and civilian officials here said the Serbs had carefully built up the forces to launch the offensive over six months. **********Serbian military and police units began driving Albanian civilians out of towns and villages the day that the peace talks in France were suspended in late February, the officials  said, and began attacking over large areas of the province in force two weeks ago, when the talks were called off in failure. **********''This is not a spontaneous outbreak following NATO's actions,'' Mr. Shea said. **********A European diplomat said the geographical pattern of the attacks in Kosovo suggested that Mr. Milosevic's Interior Ministry police officers and troops were trying to drive out the ethnic Albanians from lands once  inhabited by Serbs in the north and center of the province. **********''There are ancient Serb monasteries in the center of the province  and industrial development in the north that the Serbs apparently want to stake permanent claim to,'' the diplomat said. **********He speculated that if Mr. Milosevic ever did bow to allied demands, stop the fighting and agree to resume peace talks on a plan for autonomy for the Albanians, he could claim that the ''ethnically cleansed'' territory should stay Serbian, no matter what. **********The tactic is similar to the one  used in Bosnia in the war that ended in 1995.

His Foreign Minister, Hor Nam Hong, said today in  Parliament that the Government would reject such a provision. **********The documents, prepared by Ralph Zacklin, Assistant Secretary General for Legal Affairs, call for a single joint trial of all the Khmer Rouge leaders who remain in Cambodia, a prosecutorial strategy that is ''the one likely to have the most profound moral and educational effect on the Cambodian society.'' **********The plan for a joint tribunal is expected to be presented to Mr. Hun Sen when United Nations lawyers visit there, possibly late this week. **********Mr. Hun Sen, a former low-level Khmer Rouge soldier who defected from the organization in 1977, has suggested in recent months that he would accept the idea of Cambodian and foreign judges' sharing responsibility for the trial. **********United Nations officials said they were not worried by his objections today, suggesting they were an effort to stake out Mr. Hun Sen's early -- but not final -- position in negotiations with the United Nations lawyers. **********If Mr. Hun Sen does accept the plan in some form, United Nations officials say, some of the century's worst mass murderers could be brought to justice in a Cambodian courtroom as early as next year, with foreign prosecutors and judges having at least a large degree of control over the proceedings. **********More than a million Cambodians died -- from execution, torture, disease or hunger -- under the Khmer Rouge Government that controlled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. **********Clinton Administration officials say they have been presented with the outline of the plan and are weighing whether the United States would support the joint tribunal by providing money and staff. **********''At first glance, this has some promise,'' an Administration official said. ''But we'd want lots of safeguards built into this process to prevent Hun Sen from trying to turn this into show trials or some other sort of sham.'' **********Human rights groups also expressed caution. ''A so-called mixed tribunal in Cambodia is an idea worth pursuing, but only with adequate guarantees built in,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch Asia. ''A tribunal that would in any way be controlled by the Cambodian Government would not have legitimacy.'' **********United Nations documents say that the court would be established under Cambodian law, not international law. The documents were made available on condition that their source not be identified. **********''It would be a Nuremberg-type trial in which the Khmer Rouge political and military leadership is tried jointly,'' according to a memo prepared last month by the United Nations legal office. ''A joint trial would be legally sound, politically effective, administratively and financially cost-effective and of high moral and educative value.'' **********Mr. Zacklin's memo said that the United Nations should demand that the Cambodian Government provide ''viable guarantees'' that ''all Khmer Rouge leaders presently on Cambodian territory are arrested by the Cambodian Government and surrendered to the tribunal.'' **********Pot Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, died last year, an event that effectively signaled the collapse of the Khmer Rouge as a guerrilla threat. **********But many of his senior deputies and military commanders are still alive, including Ta Mok, a one-legged general known as the Butcher, who was captured earlier this year. **********Cambodian prosecutors had faced a Sept. 9 deadline for the start of his trial, but the Cambodian Parliament voted today to allow a delay of up three years in the trials of former Khmer Rouge leaders and others charged with genocide or crimes against humanity. **********Human rights groups have warned that unless there is quick action to create a tribunal, Cambodia could lose its chance to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice, especially given the advanced age and poor health of many suspects. **********A group of legal experts working for the United Nations recommended earlier this year that senior Khmer Rouge leaders be tried at an independent international tribunal, outside the control of the Cambodian Government.

''The Serbian leadership has failed to divide us and will not outlast us. The combined military might and moral determination of Europe and North America will endure.'' **********But hours later, the House dealt the White House a sharp rebuke, voting not only to ban use of ground troops without Congressional approval but rejecting a symbolic resolution supporting the air campaign. **********The President said that additional air power was arriving in the region and allied pilots were beginning to fly round the clock on missions to destroy Serbian troops who are terrorizing the ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia. The Serbs have already driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovo's people out of the province. **********Mr. Clinton said that the air campaign, today ending its fifth week, had been hampered by rain and clouds and said the pace would now pick up as the skies clear. **********''Historically, the weather is better in May than in April, better in June than in May, better in July than in June,'' Mr. Clinton said in a clear sign that he intends to prosecute the air war for months. ''And I feel very strongly that we should stay with and be very strong in determination to pursue our strategy, as well as the very important decisions we made at the NATO conference to intensify the economic pressure.'' **********Mr. Clinton also said that signs of dissension were beginning to appear in Belgrade, including public criticism by senior officials of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President. **********Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said that Mr. Clinton pleaded for forbearance from lawmakers during their meeting, saying they had to give air power time to work to undermine Mr. Milosevic. **********But she said that the Administration's ''gradualism and incrementalism'' were frustrating many in Congress, who want quicker consideration of the use of ground troops to end the war. **********Ms. Snowe and other members of Congress who attended today's session with the President said he repeated his determination not to dispatch ground troops to Kosovo. **********''On the contrary,'' said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ''He indicated that he intended a stepped-up prosecution of the air war and the blockade of oil supplies.'' **********But other members said that Mr. Clinton's aims -- the removal of Serbian forces from Kosovo and the return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees -- could not be achieved with air power alone. **********Representative Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican, said the Administration had been sending confusing signals about the goals of the war, its costs and the Administration's plans for relocating refugees. **********''The messages coming out of the White House have a great deal of ambiguity,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''But it's very obvious to me that this is going to be a prolonged and costly endeavor.'' **********Mr. Clinton urged the lawmakers to move quickly on his funding request, which would provide money to replace munitions already used and to build weapons stockpiles for a lengthy air campaign. The Administration's $6 billion package also includes about $1 billion for food and shelter for refugees displaced by the fighting in Kosovo. **********The President said that Congress should resist the temptation to attach to the legislation money for unrelated activities, no matter how worthy, because it would slow the bill's progress. **********''We must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk now,'' the President said. **********Draft proposals in the Senate and the House would add $6 billion to $7 billion in Pentagon programs, bringing the emergency spending bill requested by Mr. Clinton to roughly $12 billion to $13 billion. **********The Congressional add-ons include projects arguably unconnected to NATO's operations in the Balkans. For example, the House bill would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on construction programs sought by the military to increase soldiers' morale and efficiency, such as refurbishing 50-year-old barracks, building car washes and garages, and paving parking lots at bases in Germany. **********Many Republicans are eager to approve them as a show of support for the military, and to bolster their argument that Mr. Clinton has starved the Pentagon. But the emergency money must come from surplus Social Security revenues, which both parties have pledged to keep their hands off. **********At least five Republican senators, loath to break their vows of fiscal abstinence, are ready to break with their colleagues instead of supporting a $12 billion emergency bill, according to senior aides. They want the spending limited to what the President has requested. Others want to see even more money added to the bill. **********Given the intensity of the internal debate, it will be at least two weeks before any money is approved. **********In his White House remarks, Mr. Clinton said that the terror in Kosovo was the product of a ''meticulously planned'' campaign by Mr. Milosevic's Serbian troops to drive the ethnic Albanian majority out of the province. ''A campaign organized by the Government of Belgrade for a specific political purpose -- to maintain its grip over Kosovo by ridding the land of its people,'' Mr. Clinton said. **********Before the expulsions began, ethnic Albanians made up about 90 percent of Kosovo's population of two  million. **********Mr. Clinton cited continuing reports of atrocities, including one unconfirmed report brought to him by Brian Atwood, the Administration's humanitarian coordinator for the region.

After a brief fad of investing in them, big investors began to shun these companies. **********Most big early deals went sour. The 100-year-old mining house JCI Ltd. was broken up after its black chairman, Mzilikazi Khumalo, was ousted in an insider-trading scandal; its best gold mine passed to the white Kebble family that had backed him. Another conglomerate, Johnnies Industrial, is still headed by Cyril Ramaphosa, a former General Secretary of the African National Congress, but it is really just a holding company with a large portfolio of shares in other companies. **********Commenting today on the passing of this brief era, Business Day, a financial newspaper here, reacted with both regret over the failure of an ideal and pleasure that financial standards had prevailed. Referring to New Africa Investments Ltd. by its acronym, it said, ''As the cases of NAIL and the likes of JCI have shown, being an owner means little if the owner himself is not on a sturdy financial footing.'' Defining empowerment only as control, the editorial went on, ignores the value of managing a division or starting a small business. **********Dikgang Moseneke, the executive director of New Africa Investments, who introduced the revamping plan, said the company would now concentrate on empowering blacks by employing more of them, training them as executives, and helping the disadvantaged. **********The company's structure is to be more like any American or European counterpart: major shareholders will get seats on the board and the company will concentrate on profits. ''If we don't add value, we will be prepared to walk the plank,'' Mr. Moseneke promised shareholders. **********The company will split into two divisions, one with interests in insurance and banking, the other in newspapers and radio stations. Then, ''like Siamese twins,'' Mr. Moseneke said, they will be separated into two companies. **********New Africa Investments was founded in 1993 when the South African National Life Insurance Company decided to spin off 30 percent of Metropolitan Life, its subsidiary that wrote policies for blacks, and turn it over to black control. As chairman, it chose Dr. Nthato Motlana, an old friend and personal physician of Nelson Mandela. **********The insurer, widely known as Sanlam Ltd., is an Afrikaner-dominated conglomerate whose directors thought it wise to lift blacks rapidly into positions of economic power, both to compensate for the damage of apartheid and to curry favor with the African National Congress Government about to be elected. (Sanlam itself was an empowerment vehicle for Afrikaners -- it was founded 50 years ago when the National Party took office, and Government contracts that formerly went to English-speaking insurance companies were steered to it.) **********Under the revamping, New Africa Investments will undo the pyramid of holding companies that kept control in the hands of its founders. Pyramid-style ownership is frowned upon in the United States and Britain, but common in South Africa. **********For example, despite directly owning only 8 percent of the shares, the Oppenheimer family controls the De Beers diamond-mining company and its sister conglomerate, Anglo American P.L.C., which together once accounted for a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. The Rembrandt Group and Liberty Life, two other big conglomerates, are controlled by the Rupert and Gordon families the same way. **********When New Africa Investments was created, there were two classes of stock: 83 million common shares controlled by the directors, and two billion nonvoting N shares sold to outside investors. The common shares were controlled by four family trusts for the benefit of Dr. Motlana; Zwelakhe Sisulu, a member of Parliament and son of the A.N.C. stalwart Walter Sisulu; Mr. Moseneke, who also has A.N.C. connections and is chairman of the national telephone company, and Jonty Sandler, a white businessman who had made and lost a fortune building an amusement park near the black township of Soweto and was considered a wizard at creative financing. The four trusts owned Phaphama Holdings, which owned 96 percent of Corporate Af rica, which owned 55 percent of New Africa Investments. **********In April, shareholders revolted. The big banks and insurers who held the bulk of New Africa Investments' stock were outraged at plans by board members to award themselves options worth $20 million and to increase the number of nonvoting shares by 50 percent, particularly since the company's stock had lost half its value since early 1998. **********In a humiliating retreat, the board scrapped the compensation plan a day before the annual meeting.

In the traditional Arab style, they bestowed a kiss on one cheek and then on the other. **********Crown Prince Abdullah, wearing a blue business suit and standing near a gold-rimmed throne, assured the dignitaries one by one that his father, the King, was still in good shape. **********A letter from the King has expressed ''categorical confidence and trust'' in his eldest son. **********But in private, and sometimes even in public, Jordanians are saying that what is taking place strikes them as not just drama but perhaps even tragedy in the kingdom. **********''Now it seems that the King is very sick, and the present and the future seem less defined than in the past,'' said Radwan Abdullah, a political scientist and consultant. ''This is bound to lead to insecurity and apprehension.'' **********The most gnawing concern voiced by Jordanians today was for the 63-year-old King, who has ruled this kingdom since he was 17. Most Jordanians have known no other King, and many say they cannot imagine how anyone could replace him. **********The new worries over how much longer the King might reign have also sharpened what many Jordanians still describe as bafflement and disbelief over his abrupt change of  successors. Some say they find it hard to understand his decision, carried out in the space of a week, apparently with the knowledge that he was still ill, to wrest the title of Crown Prince from an experienced statesman and hand it to a 36-year-old career soldier who has never had a political role. **********''We lost the only Hashemite with experience, knowledge, maturity, intelligence, connections and seriousness,'' said a member of a prominent Jordanian family in reference to the ouster of Prince Hassan, 51. ''And we replaced him with a zero as far as most people are concerned. Prince Abdullah might be a nice guy, but he has no experience, no education, no seriousness.'' **********Like most people critical of the King's decision, he agreed to be quoted only on the condition that his name not be used. But he and the others said they were speaking frankly because of real unease, and a feeling that Prince Abdullah might not be well suited to guide Jordan in an unsettled region. **********The King, on his return last week from six months of cancer treatment in the United States, said he was determined ''to make people more confident and more comfortable about their future'' after years clouded by economic problems and troubles across the Israeli and Iraqi borders. **********But what he set in motion in his week at home has only compounded insecurities. The steps included his abrupt removal of Prince Hassan, to whom he had referred for years as ''the apple of my eye,'' then the bitter letter that all but accused his brother of treachery, and finally his own sudden departure. **********''This has all been very strange, but we have to hope that somehow all of this will lead to a change for the better,'' said Samr Khayat, 27, a cook who was grilling lamb on an outdoor stove. **********For some people, the King's success at steering Jordan through nearly five decades of turbulence in the Middle East has forged a faith that even if what he is doing seems hard to understand, it might well be right. **********As Joumana Nuqul, 35, a travel agent, put it in a conversation today, ''In a phrase, I think the King knows what he is doing.'' **********Fahd Fanek, a Jordanian columnist, argued in the newspaper Al Rai on Tuesday that such sentiments meant that any discontent over Prince Hassan's ouster would ultimately fade away. **********''Nobody can cast any doubt on Prince Hassan, his ability and his experience during 34 years in office,'' Mr. Fanek wrote. But he added, ''Popular trust in King Hussein is considerable, and the Jordanian people happily accept any decision he takes.'' **********Other Jordanians, however, say they wonder whether illness might have robbed the King of some of his judgment. As possible evidence, they have pointed with some amazement to the King's letter to Prince Hassan, dated Jan. 25 and made public early Tuesday. In translation from the Arabic, it runs to six single-spaced pages, and in a departure from the King's usual eloquence, it is rambling and barely coherent in some sections. **********From its main point -- the reasons for his brother's ouster -- the letter veers into soliloquies on germ warfare and the ozone layer. Elsewhere it abandons its tone of royal reserve, even suggesting that the King and his family ''were hurt by the gossip and lies about my wife and children'' that he said had been spread by Prince Hassan's supporters."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/04/business/outlook-1999-media-technology-television-broadcast-network-executives-struggle.html": {"writer_name": "Bill Carter", "pub_date": "1999-01-04", "snippet": "Network television business enters 1999 groping to find strategy that will insure its future profitability, and even viability; cable networks with fractions of ratings are making much more money than braodcast networks, which have several times a...", "word_count": 1177, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Broadcast Network Executives Struggle to Reinvigorate Their Business", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK 1999: MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY -- TELEVISION; Broadcast Network Executives Struggle to Reinvigorate Their Business", "body_text": " **********The network television business will enter the last year of the century groping to find a strategy that will insure its future profitability, and even viability. **********But discovering such a strategy is becoming increasingly difficult, because the paradoxes about the networks almost outnumber the hit programs: ***********There has never been more revenue in the network industry -- an estimated $15 billion plus. Yet there have never been bigger losses. Only one network, NBC is truly profitable, and even its profits are in decline. ***********Cable networks with fractions of ratings, like MTV and Nickelodeon, are making much more money than broadcast networks, which have several times as many viewers. ***********Advertisers continue to pay increased rates for diminishing audiences, because they want to reach large groups of viewers at the same time. But they refuse to pay networks for all the viewers they have, paying them only for certain viewers, mainly young adults. ***********To accommodate the desires of advertisers, broadcast networks are increasingly trying to brand themselves -- the young adult urban network (NBC and ABC), the young male network (Fox), the teen-age girl network (WB) -- even though that brings them closer in identity to cable networks, thus erasing the distinction that makes them more appealing to many advertisers. ***********The kind of programming that still attracts reliably large audiences, sports events and hits like ''E.R.,'' has become so expensive that it often makes sense only as a loss leader. But without it, viewers seem to drift away in even bigger numbers, meaning that the networks face a choice of either losing money to gain viewers or losing viewers, which eventually means losing money. **********Contemplating the implications of these challenges, many broadcast network executives now envision the need for nothing short of a reinvention of their business. The new model is centered on greater ownership of shows, much tighter cost controls on programming, new sources of programming that move the networks away from reliance on the big Hollywood studios and less (or no) money going to affiliated stations for carrying network shows. **********But accomplishing these goals can merely be started in the next year, even while the networks are in the midst of the same old ratings competition that has driven their decision-making for the last half of the century. **********''How bold do you think any of these executives can be when they know their jobs are on the line if they don't produce results in the next sweep month?'' asked one former network president. **********Indeed, late last year two networks, NBC and Fox, removed their head programmers, replacing them with executives who built their careers at cable channels. Those moves were widely interpreted as the first sign that the broadcast networks have to adopt a ''can't-beat-'em-join-'em'' strategy. **********At Fox at least, where the new president of entertainment, Doug Herzog, is arriving with one cable program, the outrageous animated series ''South Park'' as the most prominent entry on his resume, the goal seems to be to play even more aggressively to the network's core audience, the young men who watch little television but love ''The X-Files,'' ''The Simpsons'' and specials featuring elephants stomping their trainers and drivers crashing into abutments. **********Mr. Herzog said he would try to finesse the distance between risky ideas and broadly appealing programs. **********He also underscored his confidence that Fox was the place to be for the future of network television because of the carefully assembled assets of its parent, the News Corporation. It has brought all the production functions inside the company, achieving what is called vertical integration, which Mr. Herzog said is the only route to success. That means Fox will get a heavy quotient of its programs from the 20th Century Fox television studio. It will get movies from Fox's movie studio; news from the Fox News Channel, and sports from News Corporation's ever-expanding sports empire. **********The other network already set up for this asset alignment is ABC, which, thanks to its corporate parent the Walt Disney Company, enjoys similar access to movies and sports. The Disney television studio is openly committed to producing shows that will specifically help ABC. **********The two fledgling networks, WB, and UPN, which spent this year going in opposite directions (up and down, respectively), exist specifically to establish a distribution system for their corporate family's studios (Time Warner's Warner Brothers and Viacom's Paramount), presaging a move by the networks to own most or all of their programs. **********''I think we and ABC just have advantages because of our vertical integration,'' Mr. Herzog said. ''I'm sure it gives CBS and NBC something to think about.'' **********A lot of thinking is certain to go on at both CBS and NBC over the next year about whether to make an alliance, through a merger, sale or takeover, with a Hollywood studio or a cable network. Talks have already gone on between NBC and the USA Network, CBS and the Sony Corporation, CNN and just about everybody. The issues can be complicated because foreign companies like Sony are not allowed to own more than 25 percent of a network, and companies like Time Warner that have cable systems are not permitted to own broadcast stations. **********Executives at NBC and CBS have stated publicly that they have no intention of relinquishing control of their companies. But the pressures of intensifying competition for shrinking audiences and profits could force a recalculation of the value of owning and operating a network in this environment at almost any time. **********More than ever, the real value of the network business resides in owning stations. The networks want to own more, and they will continue to press the Federal Communications Commission to change the current limits so they can buy more. **********Failing that, the networks are likely to press all the more for some other revenue stream, trying to match the advantage of cable channels, which receive revenue from both advertising and subscription fees. That may mean more direct sales appeals to viewers for videos of shows. **********And the networks will continue to look for ways to ''repurpose'' their programs, like sending off repeats to cable channels, as NBC has done, putting reruns from its ''Dateline NBC'' series on its MSNBC and CNBC cable channels. They may also begin moving more toward the idea of trying to sell accumulated audiences for shows repeated several times in a month, as cable has often done. Some of that is happening already. Fox ran the movie ''The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' twice in three weeks in November; NBC ran a wrestling special twice in the same month. **********But none of these tactics will diminish the ever-constant hunger for the next big hit. With the competition closer than it has ever been before, the difference between the top and bottom among the network competitors, between profits and no profits, may be determined by a single new hit show. **********The program makers say they are desperate for new ideas, new formats, something that will either excite the public or at least alter the program-cost formula. **********As the head of one major Hollywood television studio put it, ''If my garbage man gives me a good idea, I'll take it; and I'll give him a 'created by' credit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/02/business/18-governments-postpone-8.1-billion-in-russian-debt.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-08-02", "snippet": "Russia and 18 governments agree to delay payment for 15 to 20 years on $8.1 billion of Soviet-era debt that falls due this year and next; group of creditor nations, so-called Paris Club, must still determine rest of $40 billion Russia owes; Intern...", "word_count": 329, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "18 Governments Postpone $8.1 Billion in Russian Debt", "print_headline": "18 Governments Postpone $8.1 Billion in Russian Debt", "body_text": " **********Russia and 18 governments agreed today to delay payment for 15 to 20 years on $8.1 billion of Soviet-era debt that falls due this year and next. **********Mikhail Kasyanov, the Russian Finance Minister, and Francis Mayer, chairman of the group of creditor nations known as the Paris Club, said the agreement had been reached after four days of negotiations.

Is Set to Spin Off Parts Division", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation is pushing Delphi, its auto parts maker, out of the nest and into its shareholders' portfolios on Friday. **********For G.M. the spinoff ends a 90-year tradition of vertical integration -- a strategy of making most of the parts as well as the final product. It began the transformation in February, when it sold 100 million Delphi shares, or 17.7 percent of the company, to the public. **********The auto maker plans to spin off the remaining 82.3 percent to those who are G.M. shareholders of record as of Tuesday, creating the nation's 36th-largest company in terms of revenue. The shareholders will get 70 shares of the Delphi Automotive Systems Corporation for every 100 G.M. shares they own. **********The divestiture is a milestone in the auto maker's continuing struggle this decade to transform itself from a complacent and noncompetitive company into a streamlined, more agile organization. Instead of relying on its in-house auto-parts maker, G.M. wants to farm out the business to leaner, cheaper parts makers worldwide, as other auto makers have done for years. **********Of course, that poses a problem for Delphi because G.M. has been its only customer for decades. In anticipation of the spinoff, Delphi has been furiously slimming down by cutting costs. It also has been expanding its customer base. Now, for example, it supplies the power sliding doors not only on G.M.'s Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Chevrolet minivans, but also on a number of 1999 models of G.M.'s competitors: the Ford Windstar, the Toyota Sienna and the Volkswagen Caravelle, which is sold only in Europe. **********Still, the challenge is huge. Last year, 78 percent of Delphi's $28.5 billion in sales were to G.M. Just $6.2 billion, or 22 percent, came from other companies. **********But J. T. Battenberg 3d, Delphi's chairman and chief executive, says the company's independence presents an opportunity to win contracts other auto makers have been reluctant to award to a subsidiary of a competitor. ''The 30 car companies in the world are knocking on our door more and more,'' he said in an interview earlier this month at the company's headquarters in Troy, Mich. **********Analysts point out that such freedom works both ways: the more than $22 billion in parts Delphi now sells to G.M. will soon be up for grabs. ''The independent parts makers say, 'Now there's an opportunity to go sell stuff to General Motors,' '' said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst in the New York office of ING Baring, an international investment bank. ''The big question is: Can Delphi get business from other auto companies in volumes to offset the loss of business from General Motors?'' **********Delphi says it expects to keep G.M. as a customer and plans to increase non-G.M. business by 10 percent a year. ''All of our General Motors business is competitively priced today,'' Mr. Battenberg said. **********G.M. has agreed to keep all current supplier contracts with Delphi -- typically they run 2 to 10 years. It has also agreed to give Delphi a chance to match any competitors' bid on a new G.M. contract until 2002. After that, it is tough love: Delphi is not assured any preferences over other suppliers. **********In the short term, Delphi will face another challenge: getting through the year without a costly strike. The three-year contract between G.M. and its largest union, the United Automobile Workers, expires in September, and union leaders have signaled that they are angered by the Delphi spinoff and plan to make it an issue. **********But there is good news for the company, as well: Last week, Delphi got a boost when Standard & Poor's announced that it planned to add the company to its S.& P. 500-stock index, increasing demand for the stock from index mutual funds. **********Today, Delphi closed at $20.9375, off 37.5 cents. With an estimated price-to-earnings ration at 11.43, many analysts think it is a bargain. **********It is ''one of the cheapest stocks in the stock market,'' said Scott F. Merlis, a managing director and head of the automotive practice at Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc., who rates the stock a ''buy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/28/business/home-resales-set-record-pace-consumer-confidence-up-again.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-28", "snippet": "National Association of Realtors reports sales of existing homes unexpectedly rose 0.6 percent, March, to record annual pace of 5.05 million; reports prices rose 2.5 percent; Conference Board reports consumer confidence index rose to 134.9 in Apri...", "word_count": 412, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Home Resales Set Record Pace; Consumer Confidence Up Again", "print_headline": "Home Resales Set Record Pace; Consumer Confidence Up Again", "body_text": " **********Sales of existing homes unexpectedly rose to a record pace in March, industry figures showed today, and consumer confidence in the economy increased in April for the sixth consecutive month, suggesting economic growth could accelerate in coming months. **********''Consumers continue to remain optimistic, jobs remain plentiful and wages continue to rise,'' said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson in Chicago.

The nation's biggest communications company takes executive development seriously, and this was the directors' chance to learn about some of the company's possible future leaders. **********A series of senior executives made presentations about up-and-comers in their departments, assessing the young managers' chances to one day join the company's highest ranks. **********The other side of the incubator sat in two of the board room chairs at AT&T's Manhattan headquarters. There among the directors were George M. C. Fisher, chairman of the Eastman Kodak Company, and John C. Malone, formerly chairman of Tele-Communications Inc. **********Mr. Fisher and Mr. Malone each began their careers at AT&T, and in the 1960's and '70's their names might well have been floating around a similar board meeting. But eventually each made his mark on the business world by leaving the company -- Mr. Malone in 1968 and Mr. Fisher in 1976. **********One of AT&T's greatest strengths is also perhaps its least avoidable weakness: It creates many outstanding executives but holds on to few of them. **********The AT&T that Mr. Malone and Mr. Fisher left decades ago bears little resemblance to the AT&T of today, but the tradition has held up and has even been passed down to old Ma Bell's progeny. In the most recent example, the Hewlett-Packard Company on Monday named as chief executive Carleton S. Fiorina, a top executive at Lucent Technologies Inc., which spun out of AT&T in 1996. And it seems likely that many of the young executives the board heard about on Wednesday will have left by the time their numbers come up. **********Other big companies, like the General Electric Company, are also known as wellsprings of executive talent. But with the communications industry's breakneck expansion, AT&T executives have scattered across the digital frontier like so many honeybees, pollinating both start-ups and established giants. **********''Just three or four years ago we were talking about Pat Russo, Carly Fiorina, Joe Nacchio,'' said Harold W. Burlingame, now AT&T's executive vice president for mergers, who for years was in charge of human resources. Of the three, only Patricia F. Russo is still in the extended AT&T family, as Lucent's executive vice president for strategy. **********After spending his entire career with AT&T, Mr. Nacchio left his job running the consumer long-distance operation in 1996 to become chief executive of Qwest Communications International Inc., the long-distance upstart. **********In leaving AT&T, Mr. Nacchio was hardly alone. In addition to Hewlett-Packard and Qwest, the roster of companies that have recent AT&T alumni among their most senior executives includes Teligent, Priceline.com, Global Crossing, Fidelity Investments, Gateway and Zilog. And that does not even include Netscape, Teledesic and Nextlink, which are currently or have recently been run by executives who spent relatively short stints with AT&T. **********Of the senior AT&T executives who have recently departed, Mr. Nacchio offers perhaps the most pointed comments about the campaign of attrition. **********''In some of our cases a lot of it had to do with whether the company recognized our own talent,'' he said. ''When I was there, the grass was always greener, and they always believed the people outside were better than the people they had already.'' **********AT&T's young executives did not always harbor that suspicion. For many decades, the company has followed a similar regimen in the training of its executives, focusing on rotations among different assignments every 18 to 24 months in the interest of broadening their experience. **********''I spent time in product management, engineering, sales, marketing, financial management and manufacturing,'' said Curtis Crawford, who was president of Lucent's microelectronics unit before becoming chief executive of Zilog, the semiconductor company, last year. ''Having had the responsibilities, I'm much better qualified than someone who had been in a vertical assignment.'' **********But AT&T's traditional method of grooming executives had at least a few flaws. Perhaps the most glaring was a reliance on credentials rather than talent. **********The most obvious internal victim was Robert Annunziata, now chief executive of Global Crossing, the fast-growing undersea cable company. Mr. Annunziata joined AT&T in 1966 straight out of high school as an 18-year-old technician. He never went back to school, though by 1983 he was managing AT&T's national Merrill Lynch account. **********''They told me that because I didn't have the college credential I would never go further, and I had other guys that said they needed me because I knew how to run the business,'' he said, adding that he got a great education at AT&T. ''That's when I decided to leave.'' **********Merrill Lynch hired Mr. Annunziata and made him chief executive of the operation that became Teleport Communications, which he built and then sold back to AT&T last year for $11.3 billion. **********By the early 1990's AT&T's own senior executives had doubts about the farm team they had created. The communications industry, which AT&T had dominated for so long, was being radically changed by new competition and new technology, and top AT&T executives like Robert E. Allen, the chairman, were concerned that new ideas were needed. **********So the company hired high-profile outsiders, including Alex J. Mandl, who joined the company as chief financial officer and became chief operating officer, and Jerre Stead, who became an executive vice president and is now chairman of Ingram Micro Inc., the computer distributor. **********''There was a period where they had an incredible need to go outside and to some extent it was something of a fad,'' said Jeffrey Weitzen, who last year left AT&T after 17 years to become president of Gateway Inc. **********The hiring of the outsiders disturbed lifers like Mr. Nacchio, while Mr. Allen's mixed signals in the mid- 1990's about his own departure disturbed some of the new hires. Mr. Mandl left in 1996 to become chairman of Teligent Inc., the wireless communications carrier. Mr. Nacchio left soon after Mr. Allen went outside the company yet again in picking John Walter, a relatively unknown publishing executive, as president and sucessor. (After Mr. Walter failed, the board hired C. Michael Armstrong as chairman from Hughes Electronics.) **********''If you develop a lot of good people you're not going to be able to keep all of them,'' Mr. Mandl said. **********AT&T still has a lot of home-grown talent in executives like Frank Ianna, the chief quality officer, and John Petrillo, the executive vice president for strategy.

Carey, vice chairman of Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm. Referring to James L. Barksdale, who left his job as chief executive of AT&T's wireless unit in 1995 to become chief executive of Netscape, he added, ''The Barksdales, the Annunziatas, the Curt Crawfords -- whether they were home-grown or not, the point is that they were there when they were recruited out.'' **********And for most of the senior executives who have left AT&T over the last few years, there has probably been no stronger motivation than the simple desire for more autonomy. **********''I used to watch Mike Armstrong, and he would say things, and I ended up being the person who said, 'We tried that and it didn't work,' '' said Gail McGovern, a 24-year AT&T veteran who resigned last year as president of the company's consumer division to become Fidelity's president for distribution and services.

Now, he said, ''the situation is changed.'' **********What has changed, Western diplomats here say, is that Macedonia has become embroiled in China's dispute with Taiwan. Last month the Macedonians granted diplomatic recognition to Taiwan in return for a substantial aid package, estimated here at between $1 billion and $1.6 billion. **********In recent days Chinese diplomats told other Security Council members that they ''cannot be responsible for the consequences'' of Macedonia's decision to recognize Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, and they repeated their argument that the Macedonia force was no longer justified. **********Today, Mr. Qin said, the 1,100-member force -- consisting mainly of 360 American soldiers, 640 Scandinavians and 51 Indonesians -- completed its mandate and ''should be concluded.'' Consequently, he said, China will exercise its veto for only the fifth time and kill a resolution that would have extended the mission for six months. **********Diplomats said a veto would mean that the peacekeepers would be forced to return to their barracks and could no longer continue their assigned task of monitoring Macedonia's borders with Albania and the troubled southern Serbian province of Kosovo to prevent the unrest in those areas from spreading. **********It also would mean that the force would be unable to play its role as a confidence-builder between the various ethnic factions within Macedonia, which broke away from Yugoslavia in 1992.

In a country dominated by the Ashkenazi, or European, elite, he would be the first Sephardic immigrant to seek the top job in the Government. **********The two declared center candidates -- Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the former army Chief of Staff, and Dan Meridor, the former Finance Minister -- are reportedly ready to step aside and unite behind Mr. Mordechai, with whom they publicly joined forces today. **********''I think it is less important who wins than that we all win,'' said Mr. Shahak, who entered the race just weeks ago as a wild card and was at that time the favored winner against Mr. Netanyahu. **********In his final Cabinet meeting this morning, Mr. Mordechai, a political moderate and ardent advocate of the peace effort with the Palestinians, donned a yarmulke and used a Bible to thump Mr. Netanyahu. **********''Deliver my soul, Oh Lord, from lying lips and a deceitful tongue,'' Mr. Mordechai read from the Book of Psalms. **********''My soul hath dwelt with him who hateth,'' he continued. ''I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.'' **********After that, he walked out, resigned from the Likud party, linked up with the centrist party and visited the Western Wall, where, he said, he starts ''every new chapter of my life.'' **********Israeli journalists today labeled Mr. Netanyahu's blistering dismissal of his Defense Minister, which he carried out on live television at the top of the Saturday evening news, as a political blunder that could easily backfire against the Prime Minister. Mr. Mordechai was considered the most cautious, pragmatic and bipartisan member of the Cabinet. **********''The Prime Minister is going to learn that one eats Yitzhak Mordechai's vengeance off a cold plate, very slowly,'' Sima Kadmon, a political expert, wrote in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. **********One poll today indicated that Mr. Mordechai was eating into Mr. Netanyahu's electorate, stealing as many as a third of his voters. Another poll indicated that, as of now, Mr. Mordechai would trounce the Prime Minister -- 48 percent to 33 percent -- in a second-round runoff election. The challenge will be to rise above the Labor Party candidate, Ehud Barak, to get into the second round. Polls indicate that Mr. Barak is ahead of all center party candidates at this time for the first round  of voting. **********But election results here have often been at odds with the polls, which failed to predict Mr. Netanyahu's victory in 1996. **********Speaking on the Israeli radio, Mr. Netanyahu, who labeled his Defense Minister ''immoral'' for consorting with the centrists, said he considered it no loss and continued his brutal attack on Mr. Mordechai. **********''He's not an electoral asset,'' Mr. Netanyahu said. ''He's an opportunistic asset.'' **********Referring to the center party leaders, he said, ''Every one of them is a loser.'' **********Many political experts disagreed. Nahum Barnea, a senior political observer, called Mr. Mordechai a ''stereotype-breaking politician,'' who is at once a former army general, a populist and an admirer of the rigorously Orthodox Sephardic Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, whom Mr. Mordechai visited today. **********''The candidacy of Mordechai for prime minister makes history,'' Mr. Barnea wrote in Maariv. ''For the first time in the history of the country, a Sephardi is competing, and he is doing so as an equal.'' **********A decorated war hero, Mr. Mordechai quit the army when Mr. Shahak, then the Chief of Staff, chose Matan Vilnai over Mr. Mordechai to be his deputy. But Mr. Mordechai proceeded to leap straight to the political top, joining Likud to serve as Defense Minister under Mr. Netanyahu. **********After dismissing Mr. Mordechai, Mr. Netanyahu first asked Ariel Sharon to fill the post in the months before the elections. Mr. Sharon said tonight that he had declined.

''You can feel it.'' **********Indeed, something special is happening to Gerald P. Hirshberg, 59, chief designer for the Nissan design studio and television spokesman for the  company's sales push. He has become the symbol of Nissan's struggle to remake its image -- a campaign buttressed by a fresh lineup of vehicles and $5.4 billion from Renault, which got a 37 percent stake in return. **********The loquacious Mr. Hirshberg, who suffered in relative silence as Nissan drifted into the role of manufacturer of exceptionally reliable cars for nobody in particular, is making up for lost time. ''It was a loss of confidence, a loss of vision, a loss of heart,'' he recalled, referring to a decade in which Nissan abandoned every sporty model it made but failed to build a bread-and-butter family sedan to compete directly with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. **********''We pushed hard, but they pushed harder,'' he added -- ''they'' being the Nissan executives in Tokyo who largely ignored the American market in favor of conservative Japanese customers and insisted on ever-blander sheet metal. **********Mr. Hirshberg has been around this block before. Born in Cleveland, he got a dose of liberal arts and engineering at Ohio State University before studying at the Cleveland Institute of Art. After securing a traveling fellowship (his winning project: a heliport for the Cleveland lakefront), he was wooed by the General Motors design shop. **********''Detroit stood for everything I loathed in design,'' he recalled. But Mr. Hirshberg's initial brush-off only made the company more ardent. ''G.M. hired me as a renegade,'' he said. **********Mr. Hirshberg rose quickly through the vast bureaucracy, working for, among others, John Z. DeLorean. In 1970, he became the chief designer for the Pontiac division, and, in 1974, for Buick. His credits included some sexy Pontiac GTO's and Firebirds, as well as the stylish Buick Riviera of the late 70's -- ''but only,'' he explained, ''to the degree that anyone can claim credit in G.M.'s committee-driven design system.'' **********The openness to change that led the company to hire Mr. Hirshberg in 1963 evaporated with the gasoline shortages of 1973 and an onslaught of well-made, fuel-efficient cars from Japan. ''Something was dying at G.M.,'' he said. **********So in 1979, when Nissan offered him a free hand in putting together an American design studio, the Japanese auto maker was pushing on an open door. His design team made its mark early with a face lift for the venerable ''Z''-series sports car, plus significant design suggestions for the first, immensely successful Pathfinder sport utility. **********Part of the deal Mr. Hirshberg struck with Nissan was discretion to create products other than cars. And the sheer variety of stuff that has reached the market from Nissan Design International is dazzling: children's furniture, a desktop PC, golf clubs, even an ultra-fast motor yacht. **********Nissan Design has no sales force, and profits -- surely modest, though they are not disclosed -- are generally invested in staff education and morale-boosting perks, like trips to art exhibits. Perhaps it is no coincidence that not a single professional has been recruited away. **********It has not all been triumph. The rounded Infiniti J30 mid-size luxury sedan, which many view as the studio's most significant design, was a failure in the Japanese market. So in the early 1990's, the design pendulum swung decisively back to Tokyo, as Nissan focused on Japanese customers. **********But in the last few years, with Nissan losing market share across the board, the company again looked to the design studio in San Diego. It probably did not hurt that Mr. Hirshberg had been studying Japanese. ''I can now ask where to find the toilet,'' he said. **********The outspoken designer is bursting with enthusiasm for the Xterra, a versatile and relatively inexpensive sport utility that was introduced last week and is aimed at surfer dudes. And he has transformed the Frontier compact truck by adding a second row of seats with their own doors. Soon to come is a hybrid sport utility pickup, a chunkier Pathfinder, a new Z-car in the $20,000 range and perhaps a sedan-like hybrid with lots of cargo room. **********All this, plus a well-received business memoir -- ''The Creative Priority'' (Harper Business, 1998) -- has left Mr. Hirshberg in an expansive mood. Life is good in sunny Southern California with his wife, Linda, a psychologist.

Eastern time), and praised the courage of the negotiators who represent the Albanian Kosovars at the talks in Rambouillet, France. **********Mr. Clinton set no clear timetable for military action but offered a clear message to Mr. Milosevic, who refused to even meet the American Ambassador, Christopher R. Hill. Mr. Clinton said allowing an agreement and letting NATO peacekeepers into Serbia was the best way to guarantee that Kosovo remained part of Serbia. **********With President Jacques Chirac of France at his side at a news conference at the White House, Mr. Clinton emphasized that an agreement, which the Albanian Kosovar delegates have endorsed in broad outline, would compel the Kosovars to give up their demands for independence for at least three years. **********Mr. Clinton said the two NATO allies stood ''united in our determination to use force, if Serbia fails to meet its previous commitment to withdraw forces from Kosovo and if it fails to accept the peace agreement.'' **********''I don't think there is an option'' other than NATO air strikes, Mr. Clinton added.

He refused to meet Mr. Hill, saying he would not surrender Kosovo, ''even at the price of bombing.'' [Page A6.] **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton telephoned Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. The two agreed that Mr. Milosevic ''should be under no illusion about our resolve should he prevent a deal'' on Kosovo, a spokesman for the White House said. **********At his news conference, Mr. Clinton emphasized that the NATO allies would not allow Mr. Milosevic to talk his way out of a troop withdrawal, as he did in October. **********Four months ago, NATO also threatened air strikes if Serbia did not pull back its forces after a summer offensive that had led to the killing of more than 1,000 Kosovo civilians, the destruction of 200 villages and the flood of 400,000 refugees driven from their homes. **********After nine straight days of negotiations in Belgrade between the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, and Mr. Milosevic, NATO ended up settling for an unarmed monitoring mission rather than a full withdrawal to the agreed-on level of 15,000 Serbian troops and police. **********The French and British withdrew their nonessential embassy staff workers from Belgrade today.

Late last month, NATO authorized strikes against Serbian military targets in Kosovo and Serbia. **********On Thursday night, the Pentagon ordered additional B-52's to join NATO forces in Europe to prepare for possible bombing against Serbia. **********The United States also sent F-117 stealth fighters and refueling aircraft to join fighter jets based on land, as well as on the carrier Enterprise. **********The planning for a bombing campaign has been drawn around two phases, Pentagon officials said. **********The first would be an attack by cruise missiles launched from battleships in the Adriatic Sea. **********If Mr. Milosevic continues to resist a settlement, that would be followed by concerted allied air attacks on the Serbian air-defense system. **********Some critics of the Administration's Kosovo policy said NATO seemed to be serious about striking Serbia this time, although it has threatened strikes before only to extend deadlines to persuade Mr. Milosevic to end the violence. **********''Now NATO's credibility is truly on the line, especially with the 50th anniversary only two months away,'' said Ivo Daalder, a Balkan specialist formerly at the National Security Council. ''Not to follow through on a serious threat tied to a serious deadline would fundamentally undermine the alliance.'' **********Allied diplomats and Administration officials said Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Ministers Hubert Vedrine of France and Robin Cook of Britain might go to Belgrade over the weekend if it appeared that such a high-level delegation could persuade Mr. Milosevic to accept a peace accord. **********Although allied leaders were threatening Mr. Milosevic, their military forces were moving closer to Kosovo to take part in a peacekeeping mission in case of an agreement. **********Last weekend the United States joined the British and French in making formal troop commitments for the initial force that could arrive in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, as early as next week. **********Nearly 2,000 marines are sailing toward Thessaloniki, Greece, where British ships are also generally expected to land and unload heavy equipment for their troops. **********British soldiers would be flown to the airport in Macedonia and driven to Kosovo. **********Mr. Clinton was asked what he had learned from the last year of investigation and impeachment.

On July 2, 1997, Thailand devalued its baht, touching off an economic crisis that engulfed the world. After a decade of breakneck growth, the Thai devaluation exposed a flaw in what had been perceived as an Asian economic miracle: too much of the region's growth had been the result of overenthusiastic investment into factories and real estate projects that did not make economic sense. **********Addicted to foreign capital, Thailand was unable assure investors they could continue to expect double-digit annual rates of return with scant currency risk. As investment flows into the country began to cool, speculators sensed Bangkok did not have enough foreign exchange to defend its currency, and they put pressure on the baht that led to its devaluation. **********Thailand was not alone in its profligacy, but it was egregious. Two years after the crisis, most other Asian countries are showing signs of renewed economic growth, their currencies are gaining strength, and their stock markets are advancing. **********In Thailand, the question for investors is whether the country has done enough to reform its economy and, if it has, do the current level of stock prices justify renewed investment? **********The answer to the second part appears to be no. It is already too late to catch the first wave of postcrisis optimism. **********The Stock Exchange of Thailand index has more than doubled since September, to recently close above 500 , in an upward rally that few analysts expect to continue at the current pace. In dollar terms, the rise is even sharper: the index has more than tripled. **********\"In the short term, Thai stocks probably don't have much more upside,\" said Daniel Fineman, a Hong Kong-based regional strategist for Jardine Fleming Holdings. \"The pace of change brought by reforms will make the market look attractive based on fundamentals on a medium- or longer-term basis.\" **********Unlike Korea, where the government has a history of bossing around the private sector, Thailand's debt restructuring is being undertaken at a pace determined by reluctant family-controlled companies. **********While Parliament passed a series of bankruptcy and foreclosure laws, the first central bankruptcy court has been open for just over a week. **********On the macroeconomic side, Thai consumers have not regained confidence to drive forward domestic consumption, export growth has been minimal, and, while interest rates have fallen, the country's heavily damaged banks and finance companies are reluctant to extend new loans. **********\"Just about the only thing I've seen shooting up in Thailand lately is the stock-market index,\" said the Hong Kong-based head of institutional sales at one major European brokerage, who requested anonymity. \"What scares me about this Thai-style restructuring is that for the first time in known banking history, institutions admitting nonperforming loans of near 50 percent remain in private hands without changing ownership or management.\" **********In Malaysia and Singapore, increased electronics demand has helped the economies and given some broader rational sense to rising stock prices, said Sin Beng Ong a Singapore-based regional economist for J.P. Morgan & Co. **********\"In Thailand, equity prices have also lifted over the last few months, but the economic fundamentals have not really followed,\" Mr. Ong said. \"Equity markets always tend to lead, but you have to watch they don't run ahead of themselves.\" **********The depth of Thailand's troubles and the fundamental changes still needed should not be underestimated, he added. **********\"This simplistic view of 'first into crisis, first out of crisis' does not apply, especially when major economic adjustments must be undertaken,\" Mr. Ong said. \"On the other hand, Thailand will be forced to bite the bullet to make deep changes, while a country like Malaysia can probably get away with fewer changes by riding a cyclical electronics recovery.\" **********The forced fundamental changes could make Thai companies a worthy investment in the long run, Mr. Ong and other analysts said. **********\"If you take a longer view, Thailand offers political stability greater than many other countries in the region,\" said Peter Redhead, head of Thai equities research at ING Barings Securities in Bangkok. **********Nonetheless, retail investors determined to play the Thai market would do well to adopt a gambler's mentality, said Eugene Davis, managing director of the Finansa, a venture-capital firm. **********\"Thailand tends to be a momentum market, with little relation between stock prices and underlying value,\" Mr. Davis said. \"Once a stock starts to move, everyone dives in to chase it higher, casino-style.\" Following the fast-paced run-up of stock prices early this year, picking the next set of big winners will prove more difficult, he added. **********\"The first round winners were obvious, the same dozen blue chips as ever,\" Mr. Davis said. \"The key for the next round will be to find smaller companies that will move onto the radar screen of institutional investors over the next six months.\" **********Taking a three-year view, there is a fair selection of small, listed Thai companies that will become interesting to foreign institutional investors, said Sriyan Pietersz, head of research and chief strategist at SG Asia Credit Public Co. in Bangkok. **********\"These smaller companies are quietly unwinding their debt and will be able to pick up the pace of production surprisingly quickly,\" Mr. Pietersz said. \"Low demand has many of them utilizing only a portion of their production lines. When things pick up they won't need to make additional capital investment to ramp up output.\" **********Mr. Pietersz and other analysts mentioned companies such as the Isuzu vehicle assember Thai Rung Union Car PCL, the motorcycle assembler SP Suzuki PCL and Thai Stanley Electric PCL as stocks that could move onto the radar screen institutional investors in coming months. **********\"This strategy is not sector-specific strategy,\" Mr. Pietersz said. \"In rising waters all boats go up, and as Asia's depression lifts, the companies that were sold down below their intrinsic value will be re-rated. If you pick the right penny stock before it is re-rated \u2014 such a Sahavirya Steel a few months ago \u2014 the price can multiply many times over.\" **********Sahavirya Steel PCL, a heavily indebted maker of hot-rolled coiled steel, is still below grade for institutional investors, according to many analysts, but the company's stock has shot up in value from less than 2 baht a share in April to 9.5 baht a share on Friday. **********For those who prefer to leave stock picking to professionals, there are several funds that allow investment plays on Thailand and Southeast Asia's recovery. **********To catch an updraft in value of companies that may not yet have been snapped up by institutional investors, Schroders has an Asian Smaller Companies Fund. While about one-third of the Schroders fund is invested in Hong Kong, almost 20 percent is in Thai companies. **********There are several funds focused directly on Thailand, including Barclay's Asian Selection Funds Thailand, Dresdner RCM New Tiger Thailand, Fidelity Funds Thailand, HSBC Thai Equity, Jardine Fleming Thailand Trust and Templeton Thailand. **********The closed-end Thai Fund trades on the New York Stock Exchange, but its its current price of $10 .3125 is nearly twice the value of its assets."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/24/business/investing-diary-why-companies-were-stingy-with-payouts.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Teitelbaum", "pub_date": "1999-01-24", "snippet": "Dividends paid on S&P 500 index of large-capitalization stocks rise only 4.5 percent in 1998, up from 4.1 percent in 1997 but far below average increase of 5.3 percent in postwar period; one reason is that companies realize that shareholders are n...", "word_count": 332, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Why Companies Were Stingy with Payouts", "print_headline": "INVESTING: DIARY; Why Companies Were Stingy with Payouts", "body_text": " **********Many investors who live off their dividend checks didn't have a heck of a lot to cheer about in 1998. Despite the overall upbeat performance of United States stocks, the total number of dividend increases actually fell in 1998, to 2,047, from 2,139 the year before, according to Standard & Poor's. Moreover, the total number of unfavorable payout actions -- either reductions in dividends or outright omissions -- increased to 145 in 1998 from 98 in 1997. That is the highest number of such negative dividend actions since 1993. **********''There hasn't been a very generous dividend environment for quite awhile,'' said Arnold Kaufman, editor of The Outlook, a Standard & Poor's newsletter. **********On one count, dividend-minded investors did make out a mite better: The actual total amount of dividends paid on the S.& P. 500 index of large-capitalization stocks rose 4.5 percent in 1998, compared with a 4.1 percent rise the year before. Still, that's far below the average increase of 5.3 percent in the postwar period. **********So why the corporate stinginess when it comes to payouts? One reason is that companies know many investors simply aren't interested in dividends, because they are well aware of the income taxes they will owe on such payouts. Generally speaking, such investors would rather see companies reinvest excess cash in their businesses or use it to repurchase shares. **********Worries that the corporate earnings picture would darken in 1999 probably also played a part. Economists are expecting earnings growth of just 5 percent or less in 1999, Mr. Kaufman said, so it made plenty of sense for companies to hoard their cash instead of showering it on shareholders. **********All this could change. If the markets turn in a tame performance this year, investors may begin to clamor for higher dividends to compensate. ''We see the market gains as being very much more moderate than in the past four years, perhaps even single digits,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''If investors see that, they may put more pressure on companies to raise dividends.'' **********RICHARD TEITELBAUM"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/business/world-business-briefing-asia-yahoo-site-in-china.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-09-25", "snippet": "World Business Briefing: Yahoo Site In Chj", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "YAHOO SITE IN CHINA", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; YAHOO SITE IN CHINA", "body_text": " **********Yahoo Inc., the top Internet search service, said it would create an Internet directory site tailored for Web users in China, expanding its presence on the mainland even as the country moves to restrict foreign investment in its information technology.

As long as stocks were rising, option holders hesitated to exercise them, waiting for even further gains. Now, with many stocks -- especially Nasdaq stocks -- well off their highs, transforming paper profits into real gains is mighty tempting. **********How big is the overhang? Bob Gabele, director of insider research at First Call/ Thomson Financial, calculated all the option grants made by companies in the Nasdaq 100 stock index from 1994 to 1998. A staggering 4 billion shares were granted, worth $220 billion at recent prices. That amounts to roughly 9 percent of the market value of the entire Nasdaq 100 index. **********''This is an avalanche-in-waiting,'' said Baruch Lev, professor of accounting and finance at New York University's Stern School of Business. ''And this avalanche may fall at the worst time of all.'' **********If the market slows or a recession hits, expectations for these shares will fall, Mr. Lev said. Employees who can exercise their options and sell shares will do so, thereby depressing an already declining market. **********An option grant is exercisable only if its so-called strike price is lower than the prevailing market price. But given the hefty gains registered by Nasdaq every year since 1994 -- the index is up almost sixfold -- most option grants are exercisable now. **********Cisco Systems said in its 1998 annual report that the average strike price of its option grants -- 1.562 billion shares -- was $25.23. Cisco stock closed Friday at $63.5625. **********Companies report their option grants in the footnotes to their financial statements. To calculate the overhang, take the number of shares provided for in those grants and divide it into the total shares the company has outstanding. **********It doesn't take much of a fall in stock prices to make option holders itchy, said Steven E. Hall, managing director at Pearl Meyer & Partners, a compensation consulting firm. When stocks plunged last fall, Mr. Hall said, ''everybody got stomachaches looking at their stocks. All of a sudden people started saying, 'Maybe I don't want as much of my pay in stock.' '' **********Studying the effect of declining stock prices on option grants at 60 companies, Mr. Hall found that a 15 percent drop in stock price translated to a 25 percent decrease in the value of options held by chief executives. **********Corporate America's love affair with options worked well as stocks rose. Giving options in lieu of cash keeps employee costs down and helps financially strapped start-ups. But when stock prices no longer rise, companies will be forced to pay more in cash to workers, driving up costs. **********Mr. Lev points to another concern about an options avalanche. ''Firms in the last four to five years increased debt significantly, mainly to repurchase stock so they can provide it to managers and employees,'' he said. ''So debt is very high, the market slows down, people are dumping their shares. There is a significant risk here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/21/business/coca-cola-enterprises-reports-lackluster-sales.html": {"writer_name": "Constance Hays", "pub_date": "1999-04-21", "snippet": "Coca-Cola Enterprises says first-quarter volume rose 1 percent; fountain volume grew 2 percent; cash flow rose 11 percent, to $417 million; net losses widened to $61 million; revenues per case increased 3 percent (M)", "word_count": 304, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Coca-Cola Enterprises Reports Lackluster Sales", "print_headline": "Coca-Cola Enterprises Reports Lackluster Sales", "body_text": " **********Reporting sales that were weaker than expected, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Coca-Cola Company's largest soft-drink bottler, said yesterday that first-quarter volume rose just 1 percent, one of the smallest increases in years. **********Fountain volume -- the soft drinks sold in restaurants, movie theaters, sports arenas and other public places -- grew just 2 percent in the quarter.

One day, when he heard his family name called over a bullhorn by an aid worker searching for a specific refugee, he scrambled expectantly out of his tent hoping that he might find his mother or father. Every day he tries to call home to Pristina, even though the line has been dead for days. **********''I think they are trapped in Pristina,'' Kosovo's capital, said Murat, a drawn and distracted look on his youthful face. ''I think they can't get out now.'' **********In the chaotic hours when ethnic Albanians were forced from their Kosovo homes, hundreds of parents and children lost track of one another. Some of the children, who range from toddlers to teen-agers,  crossed the border here alone or with relatives. Others were separated when Macedonian police officers forced 50,000 Kosovo Albanians out of a makeshift refugee camp near the border three weeks ago. **********Murat last saw his father when he told him and his sister to leave home and take a train to Macedonia as word spread in Pristina that Serbian forces were ordering people to leave. His parents said they would soon follow, but never arrived. **********Lost children have been a tragic by-product of many refugee crises.  But the chaotic nature of the exodus from Kosovo, the actions of the Macedonian government, and a complicated international evacuation program have made efforts to reunite families particularly daunting. Adding to the potential problem, 70 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million ethnic Albanians were under 30. **********Unlike Albania, Macedonia has been urging refugees to move on, and calling for more to be evacuated to other countries. And when the Macedonian police rousted the 50,000 Kosovo refugees from the camp in the town of Blace, it further scattered families. Macedonian officials flew 2,000 refugees to Turkey, bused 15,000 to Albania and divided the rest among six camps here. **********When the sun came up, Jehona  Aliu, a 5-year-old girl, was found wandering alone in the remains of the camp. Aid workers have posted her photograph in the larger refugee camps in Macedonia and are trying to determine if her parents were sent to Turkey or Albania. **********Three weeks have passed, but Jehona's parents have not emerged.  British NATO soldiers at first cared for her, but she is now living with a refugee family in Macedonia. They  are missing children of their own. **********By one count, Murat and Jehona are two of 253 ethnic Albanian children in Macedonia refugee camps separated from their parents, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. But there are other children unaccounted for because 776 parents have reported that their children are missing and are not on the Red Cross lists. **********Of lost children aid workers know about, few have been completely abandoned and most are being cared for by relatives. The Red Cross is posting the names of children it has located on bulletin boards in the camps here, hoping parents or relatives will come forward. But with refugees here being evacuated to a dozen countries in Europe, it could prove difficult to find them quickly. **********So far though only 54 children have been reunited with their parents through the Red Cross and Save the Children. Aid workers predict that parents and children are not likely to be reunited for weeks, possibly months, and countless other relatives -- siblings, aunts, uncles and grandparents -- are also missing. **********''I would say we are just dealing now with the tip of the iceberg,'' said Francois Zen-Ruffinin, a Red Cross spokesman. ''We're starting with children. They are the priority. But just about every single family is missing a relative.'' **********Families started scattering even before the NATO air strikes. Many parents hustled their children out of larger towns and cities to the rural homes of relatives for safekeeping. But when Yugoslav forces launched a major offensive after the bombing began, hundreds of parents were kept from retrieving their children . **********Even families that began the flight from Kosovo together were sometimes separated. Panicked crowds swarmed onto trains headed for the border, and the Serbian police cut off convoys of cars, ordering some to the border, and others back into Kosovo. **********Murat, who lives in a tent with his 25-year-old sister and her husband in this sprawling refugee camp of 27,000, went to the train station in Pristina after his aunt burst into his home in tears a week after the bombing began. Serbs had just expelled her from her nearby home, she said, and Murat and his sister were told to go to the train station immediately. **********''My father said, 'You go, we'll catch up with you,' '' Murat said. ''We waited for three hours. They never came.'' He reached his parents at a neighbor's house a week ago, but has heard nothing since. **********Other parents said they were forcibly separated from their children. Hyzri Gaytani, 24, and his wife, Imrani, 20, said the Serbian police expelled them from their home in Pristina and then blocked them from going to the hospital where their premature baby was still in an incubator. **********''It's been 17 days,'' Mr. Gaytani said, holding his first, and only, child's birth certificate. ''We don't know where he is.'' Phone calls to the doctor in Pristina have not been answered. They have asked the Red Cross to see if they can send someone to the hospital to find their infant. **********Families that had already been split up in Kosovo have been divided yet again. Fatmira Mehmeti, 15, said she, her sister and two brothers were separated from their parents after being taken to their uncle's home in Pristina for safekeeping. After the NATO bombing began, the children fled with their uncle to Macedonia. **********When Macedonian police officers cleared out the Blace camp, the two girls and one of their brothers managed to stay with their uncle. Their other brother, aunt, grandmother and three cousins disappeared. ''Somebody told us they went to Turkey,'' Fatmira said. ''But nothing is confirmed. We don't know anything.'' **********In addition to children, elderly and mentally ill people have been found  wandering alone here. A dozen people in their 60's, 70's and 80's and two mentally retarded teen-age boys are being cared for in a tent here run by the International Catholic Migration Committee. **********Neither of the boys can offer a hint as to who they are, their home or who cared for them. When strangers appear in their tent, one offers a warm smile, waves his hand in the air and blurts out garbled words. The other stares blankly at a wall of the tent, seemingly traumatized by the tragedies that brought them here. **********''It's quite likely we're not ever going to find their families,'' said Albert Ramirez, a social worker from Austin, Tex., who has been caring for the boys. ''They can't communicate with us at all.'' **********In another tent here, Benin Kukiqi and his college-age friends represent  one more group, teen-agers and young adults separated from their parents. Mr. Kukiqi, 20, is the oldest of five students sharing a tent here. None know where their parents are. **********All five are childhood friends from the town of Glogovac in central Kosovo. Taking classes at Pristina University, they were dozens of miles from their families when the NATO air strikes began a month ago. Mr. Kukiqi, who is studying mechanical engineering, said the last time he spoke to his parents was from a phone booth in the main post office in Pristina the day the raids began. **********His mother, he said, lectured him for taking the risk of walking through the center of town to make the call. Since then, phone lines to Glogovac have been dead and no refugees from the town have emerged. He has no idea where his parents and 17-year-old sister are. ''There has been nothing at all,'' he said, ''just rumors.'' **********He and his tent-mates keep busy working with relief organizations in the camp, a seeming distraction from thinking incessantly about the missing. Mr. Kukiqi, steeling himself from what could be weeks of doubt and worry, said the best thing he can do is stay in one place and wait. **********''I am staying here to wait for some kind of contact,'' he said resolutely. ''If my parents are alive, and I hope they are, they will find me here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/18/business/c-correction-711217.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-03-18", "snippet": "Correction of chart in Tuesday, March 16, Business Day section summarizing approaches of Internet stock trading companies; chart showed an erroneous screen to illustrate E*Trade; chart shown in corrected version", "word_count": 72, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Correction", "print_headline": "Correction", "body_text": " **********A chart in Business Day on Tuesday, summarizing the approches of Internet stock trading companies, showed an erroneous screen to illustrate E*Trade.

Shares of Amazon.com rose nearly 8 percent yesterday, closing at $149.625, up $10.5625 in Nasdaq trading, following the company's announcement of the plan late Sunday. **********Amazon has been expanding quickly from its book-selling base into a wide range of other offerings. It now sells music, videos and gifts directly and offers a ''shop the Web'' search engine to help consumers find products at other on-line stores. **********It has also invested in other on-line sites, like Drugstore.com. Indeed, Amazon also disclosed yesterday that it owns a controlling interest in Pets.com, which sells dog biscuits, cat toys and other pet supplies. **********But the stakes are especially high in the auction field; Amazon's main rival will be Ebay, an on-line auction house with a market value of nearly $20 billion. **********Investors have been infatuated with Ebay because the company, which is based in San Jose, Calif., has the potential to take a small percentage of millions of transactions at a very low cost. In essence, Ebay lets individuals auction the contents of their attics in an electronic garage sale. Its site, www.ebay.com, has also given international exposure to proprietors of flea-market booths and specialty shops. **********Investors have also regarded Ebay as a natural monopoly, because sellers want to display their wares where there are the most potential customers, while buyers tend to choose the site with the most goods for sale. This self-reinforcing effect is why Ebay has continued to grow, even though Yahoo, one of the most visited of the so-called Internet portals, offers auctions with no fees. **********Amazon hopes to break through this chicken-and-egg problem on the strength of its established customer base. It already has eight million customers who have made at least one purchase on line. **********''We will use our existing customers to provide a ready audience for sellers,'' said Jeffrey Bezos, the chairman of Amazon.com, which is based in Seattle. **********Analysts praised Amazon's move. **********''Auctions could ultimately be very important for Amazon because they are a much higher-margin business than selling books,'' said Henry Blodget, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company. ''And it allows them to diversify their offerings very quickly. Suddenly, they are a place to go when you're looking for all sorts of things.'' **********Amazon promises a number of improvements over Ebay's approach. For any purchase less than $250, the company says, it will reimburse the buyer if the seller does not deliver the goods as advertised. **********Second, Amazon will promote auctions on the other parts of its retailing site. Thus, an Amazon user looking up golf books will also see a listing for golf clubs for sale in its auctions area. **********And the company intends to make it very easy for its customers to bid in these auctions, extending its ''one click'' instant buying service to an similarly instant bidding capability, with no additional sign-in needed. **********The $250 anti-fraud guarantee could end up being a largely symbolic gesture. Ebay, for example, contends that only three of every 10,000 transactions on its site turn out to be fraudulent. Ebay has already introduced an insurance program to cover the first $200 of fraud losses, with a $25 deductible. **********''Amazon.com is a savvy Internet competitor and has done a very good job in the area of business-to-consumer Internet commerce,'' said Kevin Purgslove, a spokesman for Ebay. But, he continued, ''over the past three and a half years Ebay has focused on person-to-person trading, and has developed significant competitive advantages.'' **********Mr. Purgslove said he could not comment further, because Ebay has registered to sell nearly $1 billion in stock and is in the so-called quiet period mandated by the Security and Exchange Commission, when a company is about to issue new shares. **********In any case, investors seemed to give the early edge to Amazon yesterday. As Amazon's stock rose, Ebay's shares fell $6.71875, to $147.78125. **********''What Amazon brings to the table is eight million loyal customers,'' said Alan Braverman, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities ''But I don't think this is a zero-sum game. Amazon will be successful and Ebay will be successful.'' **********The Amazon.com will promote its new service today by holding an auction to benefit the World Wildlife Fund.

It moved from offices on lower Broadway to more spacious digs on Park Avenue South earlier this year. Mr. Getson has hired additional staff members.

''There have been some late bills and some writers have understandably been upset,'' he said. ''You hope your writers understand that this is not Hearst or Conde Nast.'' Mr. Getson added that he had big expectations for his magazine: ''In five years, we'll be the market leader in men's magazines.

B. King, Blink 182 and Terrence Trent D'Arby as performers from that era. Also in the cast are James Coburn, Kathy Baker, Dana Delaney and Gerald McRaney. **********The promotional campaign, CBS's largest ever, coincides with the important November sweeps, which began yesterday. CBS has involved practically its entire television family as well as the resources of its numerous radio stations for extensive promotions. **********And in hopes of further generating awareness, CBS has forged alliances with other marketers to sponsor events like a sweepstakes and to sell a soundtrack tied to the movie. **********The magnitude of the campaign underscores the intensifying concern among marketers that as consumer interest wanes in traditional media like television and print, they must constantly devise new ways to deliver their messages. As a result, movie tie-ins and other promotions have become marketing staples for such events. **********''Our job is to get the most people we can to watch our programming,'' said George Schweitzer, executive vice president for marketing at CBS Television in New York. CBS is hoping the show generates blockbuster ratings and maybe even brings in millions of younger viewers, which the network has had trouble reaching regularly. **********Spending for the campaign, which was created in-house, was not disclosed. **********Aside from typical television commercials and print and outdoor ads spotlighting ''Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' the stars of CBS programs and the disc jockeys of CBS-owned oldies radio stations like WCBS-FM in New York have been deployed to help promote the mini-series. Earlier this week, the TV stars began appearing in promotional spots reflecting on rock 'n' roll and how it has influenced their lives. In one spot, Kevin James, the star of the CBS show ''King of Queens,'' talks about how he was influenced by Elvis Presley. **********Another spot features Brad Garrett, from ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' selecting Little Richard as his favorite rock star. An announcer at the end of the spots refers to the mini-series. **********One of the largest components of the campaign is playing off the music connection by marketing a compact disc tied to the movie. The concept of a music-oriented mini-series accompanied by a CD has become a favored marketing tool of networks, especially since last season, when NBC, which is owned by General Electric, scored big in both ratings and record sales with two music-oriented mini-series, ''The Temptations'' and ''The 60's.'' **********''This is just tailor-made for this kind of tie-in,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. The CD sales have become secondary profit centers for the networks. In fact, NBC has other music-oriented mini-series in development, including a follow-up to ''The 60's,'' naturally called ''The 70's.'' **********To introduce the CD, CBS teamed with Seagram's MCA Records to create the movie soundtrack featuring songs from artists including Dicky Barrett, B. B. King and the Platters. The CD will be sold at retailers nationwide and advertised on the CBS network and CBS-owned radio stations when the mini-series begins. Commercials will be broadcast after each night of the show, and a Web site has been set up to help generate sales. **********Anne O'Grady, senior vice president for marketing and events at CBS, who was instrumental in creating the promotions, said, ''We have this wonderful property that kind of screams out to all these different areas because of the music connection.'' **********Another part of the music factor will be viewing parties for the movie premiere at Hard Rock Cafes in 12 cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and New York. The parties will be held by local disc jockeys from CBS radio stations, which will distribute tickets in each market through trivia contests. **********Samsung, which is the official sponsor of the mini-series, will provide high-definition television sets for each party in addition to offering sneak previews of the mini-series shown on its televisions at participating dealers before its broadcast. **********Three other promotions include a dance contest held today on ''The Early Show'' on CBS, the awarding of a trip to Hard Rock Live in Orlando, Fla., on ''The Howard Stern Show'' and a sweepstakes contest to select the ultimate rock band. Voters can cast their ballots at the Hard Rock restaurants and the Web site within CBS.com that was set up for the mini-series. **********As the premiere date nears, the advertising and promotions will also intensify. ''You really pour it on,'' Mr. Schweitzer said, because ''many people are making their viewing decisions much closer to the time of broadcast.'' **********This weekend, efforts are being stepped up to promote the mini-series online. The show will be highlighted in a banner ad on America Online's main screen in addition to the television, entertainment and news screens throughout the promotion. Also over the weekend, VH-1, part of the MTV Networks unit of Viacom, which has acquired the off-network rights to ''Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' will broadcast features and promotional vignettes. **********''I think that Sunday night is going to be one of the busiest nights of television,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. For the first weekend of the November sweeps, the networks are introducing programming extravaganzas on Sunday, from mini-series on CBS and NBC, which is introducing ''Leprechauns,'' to the return of the hit game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC to the season premiere of ''The X-Files'' on Fox. The sweep months are important for the television stations because they set the advertising rates. **********''Anyone can buy a TV Guide ad; anyone can buy a radio spot,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. ''But to be in some of these exclusive venues like the Hard Rock and America Online gives us an competitive advantage.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/business/company-news-500-workers-to-be-dismissed-as-agco-closes-2-factories.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-12-09", "snippet": "AGCO Corp to dismiss 500 workers as it closes two factories, Coldwater, Ohio, and Lockney, Texas, because of reduced sales (S)", "word_count": 98, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "500 WORKERS TO BE DISMISSED AS AGCO CLOSES 2 FACTORIES", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; 500 WORKERS TO BE DISMISSED AS AGCO CLOSES 2 FACTORIES", "body_text": " **********The AGCO Corporation, the third-largest United States farm-equipment maker, said yesterday that it would dismiss about 500 workers, or 5 percent of its work force, as it closes two factories because of reduced demand for tractors and other agricultural implements.

They thought they were investing in ultra-safe securities backed by banks and real estate; instead, they were victims of a long-running Ponzi scheme orchestrated by a man they had considered a friend. **********As she describes the betrayals, her constant worries about money, another victim's loss of a house, all the marriages bruised and retirements postponed, Mrs. Barzelatto says the same thing over and over: ''This is a violent crime.'' **********And a small but growing group of people would like to see it treated that way. The victims' rights movement, which two decades ago began demanding recognition and help for those who have suffered from violent crimes, is now turning its attention to those injured by white-collar crime. **********Their advocates have already succeeded in persuading Congress to allow money from a special fund for crime victims to be used to help those injured by economic crimes, and the first federally financed pilot programs began last year. These efforts are likely to be expanded in coming years because of the growing recognition of ''just how devastating these crimes can be,'' said Kathryn M. Turman, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime in the Justice Department. **********And the victims themselves are becoming increasingly assertive. They have begun to insist on their right to participate in court proceedings by speaking when the criminals who stole their money are sentenced. And they are setting up self-help groups, including one in Los Angeles for people whose credit records have been ruined by charge-card thieves. **********Fueling the movement to assist these victims is a surge in their numbers. For while violent crime has plummeted nationwide, white-collar crime against individuals has risen sharply, according to law enforcement officials. **********The crimes range from securities frauds to sweepstakes schemes to identity theft -- using someone's Social Security number or other personal data to apply for credit cards, loans or even a fake driver's licenses. **********''There are more swindles, more frauds,'' said Robert M. Morgenthau, the District Attorney in Manhattan. The strong economy and booming stock market help explain the trend, he said, adding, ''Honey attracts bears.'' **********New uses of technology, especially Americans' infatuation with the Internet, have contributed to a shift to defrauding individuals from defrauding institutions, like savings and loan associations or, as in the big insider trading cases, the overall stock market. **********''One thing that has dramatically changed is the availability of mass technology that lets those with criminal motivations reach a much wider audience of victims,'' said James K. Robinson, Assistant Attorney General for the criminal division of the Justice Department. **********While there are no government statistics on the incidence of financial crime, complaints to watchdog groups and regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission have jumped by 20 percent in two years. Last week, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it was setting up a special complaint center for Internet fraud that would collect data and analyze trends. **********In a survey of American households, almost 40 percent of respondents said they had been defrauded in some way in the last year, the National White-Collar Crime Center, a clearinghouse and training center for law enforcement groups, reported this month. Though most complained of consumer rip-offs like unnecessary auto repairs, dozens of the 1,169 who replied in the survey said they had lost money through Internet schemes, credit card fraud and investment swindles. **********Groups and government agencies that help crime victims say they have been slow to respond to this flood in part because the victims themselves are often too embarrassed to come forward. **********Jane Y. Kusic said she fell into a deep depression after she and her husband, a lawyer, invested in a Florida real estate development that turned out to be fake and cost investors about $100 million. While her experience prompted her to become a professional consultant on financial crimes, Ms. Kusic, who is based near Washington, points out that most people who lose big sums must put all their energy into trying to stay afloat financially. **********Many victims of con men speak of the betrayal as the psychological equivalent of rape. **********''I will never get over this -- it is far worse than a rape of the body,'' said one woman who said she was sexually assaulted at gunpoint earlier in her life, before losing her savings in the same scheme that entrapped Mrs. Barzelatto. ''Every moment I'm reminded, every waking moment,'' said the woman, who spoke only on the condition that neither her name nor the amount of her losses be printed. After a lifetime of hard work, she said, she now worries about making the payments on her medical insurance. **********Stories like this do not surprise those who counsel victims of financial crimes. ''When I talk about how the impact can be as serious as with violent crime, some people's eyes glaze over, but I've had attempted suicides,'' said Debbie Deem, who manages the victims' assistance program for the United States Attorney in Los Angeles. **********The victims of financial crimes are a diverse lot. Senior citizens often fall prey to telemarketing frauds, but people in their 30's and 40's complain most often that they have been defrauded over the Internet, according to the National Consumers League. And at least one Federal study suggests that young, well-educated people are the most likely to fall for swindles. **********Nor are victims of financial crimes always well-to-do. **********''If you are poor, and told you have won $1 million in the lottery, that's appealing to everyone,'' said Marta Sotomayor, executive director of the National Hispanic Council on Aging, which runs a fraud prevention program. **********There are still few programs to help victims of economic crimes. That frustrates people like Lisa Curtis, the victims' advocate in the Denver District Attorney's office, which has one of the most active of such programs (one of its cases just led to a 96-year sentence for a man who ran a fraud ring). **********''We're considered second-class citizens,'' Ms. Curtis said. **********Slowly, government and private groups have begun to respond to the needs of these victims. Two years ago, Congress made the legal change to permit money in the Federal Crime Victims Fund to go to programs that help those injured by economic crimes, although the victims themselves cannot receive direct financial aid. Previously, this money could be used only to help those hurt by violent crime, though most of the money in the fund comes from fines paid by white-collar criminals. **********The first federally financed programs after the Congressional change began last year. In October, the Office for Victims of Crime in the Justice Department released a video for Federal employees called ''Victims of Fraud: Beyond Financial Loss'' to show how devastated these lives are, Ms. Turman said. **********The Justice Department is also financing some demonstration programs, like one run by the Oregon Division of Senior and Disabled Services that sends counselors to the homes of older people whose names turn up on ''mooch lists'' -- lists of people who have fallen for schemes in the past -- seized from illegal telemarketing operations. **********On the private side, the California Public Research Interest Group helped Elsie Strong, a California businesswoman, set up a support group for victims of identity theft. Ms. Strong says it took her years to clear her credit record after someone took out five charge cards in her name, ran up big bills and stopped making payments. **********And the National Center for Victims of Crime has set up a special association for lawyers who specialize in representing crime victims who turn to civil courts to try to recover money after they have been defrauded. The formation of the legal association alarms some prosecutors, who worry that it will encourage victims to sue them for not pursuing cases even when the evidence is weak. Just the process of having to notify all the victims in a big fraud case is an overwhelming undertaking, some complain. **********Prosecutors lobbied successfully for the narrowing of a proposed constitutional amendment on victims' rights sponsored in the Senate by Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, to exclude victims of financial crimes. **********The narrowing has caused a split among victims' rights groups, with some, like the National Center for Victims of Crimes, withdrawing their support for the amendment, said David Beatty, director of public policy for the center. **********But the biggest dream for those who have suffered from financial crime is not a constitutional amendment; it is getting some money back, preferably from the people who stole from them. That seldom happens. **********Judges do sometimes order people who are guilty of financial crimes to make restitution to their victims. Victim Services, a nonprofit agency that handles many of the restitution orders in New York City courts, is pushing prosecutors to ask for repayment more often, ''because the sense of accountability is so important,'' said Paula A. Rogowsky, program director for the Brooklyn Criminal and Supreme Courts. **********Even when repayment is ordered, victims usually collect only pennies on the dollar of what they are owed  or get nothing at all. The perpetrators have frequently spent all the cash; in many cases, prosecutors suspect, they have hidden the assets. Some try to use bankruptcy protection to make it harder for their victims to collect anything. **********''What we were finding is that by the time we get there, there is nothing left,'' said Melinda L. Haag, deputy chief of the general crimes section in the Office of the United States Attorney in San Francisco. Ms. Haag directs a pilot program that tries to deal with this problem by assigning fraud investigators to track the assets of suspected perpetrators before they are indicted. **********Though the program is only a few months old, it is already attracting the attention of people like Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, who prosecutes hundreds of white-collar criminals a year. She supervised the case against Gerald P. Hirsch, who pleaded guilty to six counts of mail fraud in the scheme that victimized Myrna Barzelatto and faces a prison term of about four to six years. **********Ms. White hopes to meet with fellow prosecutors to explore ways of improving restitution to victims of financial crimes. Getting money back, she said, ''will make them feel better than anything.'' **********Mrs. Barzelatto would agree. From her home in White Plains, she is helping to organize her fellow victims, who hope to speak at the July sentencing of Mr. Hirsch. While she hopes he gets the longest possible sentence as a just punishment for all the harm he has caused, she said, ''I'd be very happy to let this guy go free if it would let me have my money back.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/11/business/rite-aid-calls-earnings-forecast-inaccurate.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-11-11", "snippet": "Rite Aid Corp tells analysts and investors not to rely on forecasts for profit and cash flow made last month; company's stock falls $2.5625, to $5.375; forecasts were made Oct 11 by Matin L Grass, who was then chairman; he was ousted by company's ...", "word_count": 242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rite Aid Calls Earnings Forecast Inaccurate", "print_headline": "Rite Aid Calls Earnings Forecast Inaccurate", "body_text": " **********The Rite Aid Corporation, the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain, told analysts and investors today not to rely on forecasts for profit and cash flow made last month.

Built on the site of the former national mint as an urban refuge for the country's oil barons, it has private suites with built-in saunas, a lounge serving Cognac and cigars, and a spacious gym where each morning Indonesia's repo man, Eko S. Budianto, can be found on a treadmill, getting in shape to go after some of Indonesia's wealthiest people. **********Mr. Eko, 38, heads the asset management division of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, the Government agency in charge of an estimated $35 billion bailout of Indonesia's banks. Mr. Eko's job is to get the corporate cronies of former President Suharto who helped create the mess to cough up roughly $23 billion that they owe to the banks. If they do not, he has carte blanche to seize their assets, even if that takes the help of the army. **********''I see myself as a loan workout officer with a big stick,'' Mr. Eko said. **********Student protests may be more romantic, and investigations into the ill-gotten wealth of former President Suharto more attention-grabbing, but the work being done by Mr. Eko and his colleagues at IBRA, as the agency is known, represents the brass tacks of the national reforms demanded in widespread protests last year. IBRA staff members see themselves as an integral part of the political transformation from the rule of Mr. Suharto, cuff-linked Robin Hoods painstakingly reversing 34 years of Government-sanctioned larceny. **********The task is staggering. Since IBRA was set up in January 1998 as a condition of a $40 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund, it has taken control of almost 50 failed banks, and with them has gained stakes in about 200 companies. In this portfolio, worth roughly 105 trillion rupiah ($15 billion), are stakes in Indonesia's largest auto maker, its largest tire maker and its largest shrimp farm. IBRA's real estate holdings make it one of Jakarta's biggest landlords. Add the 220 trillion rupiah in bank loans it has inherited, and IBRA controls nearly a fifth of Indonesia's economy. **********''They own everything,'' said one American investor in Jakarta who hopes to buy some of IBRA's holdings. ''There's no use talking to borrowers anymore. You have one-stop shopping.'' **********IBRA aims to sell off these assets bit by bit to help the Government offset the tremendous cost of rebuilding the banks, an essential ingredient to economic growth but a burden big enough, economists say, to cut into programs for the poor. IBRA hopes to raise 17 trillion rupiah by spring. **********The decision of what to sell and when, however, is fraught with financial and political risks. IBRA, created under the deeply unpopular government of Mr. Suharto, who resigned last year, has few political friends. Selling sooner would please foreign investors looking for bargains, but it would mean going head to head with some of the nation's most powerful people, tycoons connected to Mr. Suharto and his successor, B. J. Habibie. Selling later would fetch higher prices but risk alienating foreign investors and would leave IBRA subject to the whims of the incoming coalition Government, which defeated Mr. Habibie's party in June elections. **********All the while, the agency has had to please its patrons at the International Monetary Fund, which is due to sign a letter soon releasing an additional $1 billion in loans to Indonesia, subject to progress on bank restructuring. Yet, given its difficulties, observers say, IBRA is less likely to uproot crony capitalism than to serve as its inadvertent caretaker until the day when the cronies can buy their empires back. **********''They're running out of time,'' said Andrew MacIntyre, an associate professor of international relations at the University of California at San Diego. ''It's going to be harder for IBRA to operate in the new environment than the old environment.'' **********IBRA's challenges reflect those facing regulators, on a smaller scale,  in countries across Asia -- especially in Thailand and South Korea -- as they battle entrenched old-boy networks to bring accountability and long-term health to their economies. **********''What you want to see is court cases against lots of crooks,'' said Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management, whose $1.5 billion in funds is invested largely in Asia. ''But given the cultural impediments in Asia, I don't think you'll see it.'' **********Mr. Eko said he was not afraid of taking influential debtors to court. Two-thirds of the 155 trillion rupiah in loans he is trying to recover is owed by just 200 companies, many of which belong either to Mr. Suharto's family or to his friends. **********Mr. Eko advised some of the borrowers while working at Chase Manhattan Bank in the late 1980's. Among his clients was Mohamad (Bob) Hasan, a plywood magnate and close friend of Mr. Suharto's. **********A decade later, Mr. Hasan was just one of some 200 debtors required by Mr. Eko to appear at IBRA's Spartan aerie atop the headquarters of one of the banks it took over last year. One by one, they trooped up to the 30th floor earlier this year to discuss how they would repay their debt to the country -- Mr. Hasan, a parade of other tycoons and even Mr. Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo (Tommy) Mandala Putra. **********Mr. Eko is well cast for his role as IBRA's steely negotiator. A former martial arts champion, he now spends his spare time hunting wild game in the jungles of Sumatra and is as comfortable talking about his favorite .308 caliber rifle as he is explaining the intricacies of corporate debt restructuring. **********After earning his bachelor's degree at the University of Northern Colorado and an M.B.A. at Golden Gate University in San Francisco,  Mr. Eko worked at Chase eight years, first in the United States and later in Hong Kong and Jakarta, moving from the credit unit to financing coal mines and gas pipelines. He left in 1993, and after a year at the American Express Bank in Jakarta, joined Bank PDFCI, an Indonesian development bank. **********Mr. Eko was charged with cleaning up Bank PDFCI's own bad-loan mess, but his efforts were ultimately for naught. The bank was borrowing dollars on a short-term basis and handing out long-term loans in rupiah. When the rupiah crashed in 1997, Bank PDFCI found itself in a squeeze, having to pay off dollar loans with less valuable rupiah. **********The final straw came, Mr. Eko said, when Dharmawangsa Puri Lestari, the company that had built the luxurious Dharmawangsa Hotel and Klub Bimasena, defaulted on its loan. Foreign lenders pulled in their credit lines, and by last August Bank PDFCI had become one of the 48 banks closed by IBRA. **********The same month that IBRA took over Bank PDFCI, one of the bank's commissioners, Glenn Yusuf, resigned to become chairman of IBRA, a move that raised questions because Mr. Yusuf was also president of a Government-owned investment bank that was advising IBRA. (Other advisers are Lehman Brothers and J. P. Morgan.) Foreign experts in Indonesia dismiss the apparent conflict of interest, pointing to a shortage of financial expertise in the nation. **********''There are very few players who can work on the kinds of transactions that IBRA has to work on,'' said Morgan McGrath, the regional manager for Southeast Asia at Chase Manhattan, who once employed not only Mr. Eko but several other executives now working at IBRA. ''Their experience will serve them well.'' **********It was Mr. Yusuf who took Mr. Eko aboard at IBRA. Since joining the agency last August, Mr. Eko has been slowly putting pressure on Indonesia's big debtors. In June, IBRA published the names of the country's 200 largest corporate borrowers. Second on the list, with 3.5 trillion rupiah in loans, is Timor Putra Nasional, the automobile company controlled by Tommy Suharto. Fifth-largest, with 2.9 trillion rupiah in debt, is a petrochemical company owned by the timber tycoon Prajogo Pangestu and Mr. Suharto's second son, Bambang Trihatmodjo. **********IBRA gave the debtors until June 30 to sign a letter committing them to discuss restructuring with IBRA. All but 26 signed, and IBRA's accountants will decide whether the 26  are healthy enough to restructure. Those that are too ill to survive or prove uncooperative will face litigation and possible foreclosure by Mr. Eko and his newly appointed bailiffs. **********''The debtor has a choice,'' he said. ''They can play hardball with me, or they can work together with me.'' **********In February, the Government gave IBRA the authority to seize debtors' assets without going through the courts. Mr. Eko said IBRA also has assurances from the chief of Indonesia's armed forces, General Wiranto, that the army will back IBRA up. Mr. Eko expects trouble. He said he now travels with four bodyguards. **********Some worry, however, that the debtors, not Mr. Eko, may need the guarding. ''There's no protection for victims,'' said James Redway, a lawyer representing the Indonesian tire maker Gadjah Tunggal for the Philadelphia-based law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius. **********Still others say IBRA's special powers may not be so powerful after all. It is still not clear whether IBRA has title to property it has seized, an unresolved legal issue that could worry investors looking to buy Mr. Eko's repossessions. **********But the bigger source of irritation is the pace of the sales. Foreign investors trying to get in on the ground floor here complain that the agency is stalling in the hopes that the economy will improve and that it won't have to sell to foreigners. Ernest Bower, president of the United States-Asean Business Council, said, speaking of asset sales, ''If you're going to create wealth and accumulate capital in the economy, you've got to start, even if initially you're going to have foreigners picking up some of this stuff.'' **********IBRA says it is in the process of selling assets and plans an initial public offering of Bank Central Asia by the end of this year. But it concedes it is stalling: signs of growth in Indonesia's economy suggest it will be able to earn more for its assets later, IBRA says. ''We're not in a rush to sell,'' said Christovita Wiloto, an IBRA spokesman. **********In the meantime, IBRA appears to have struck what many fear is a Faustian bargain with former cronies of Mr. Suharto, letting them stay involved in the management of their indebted companies. Foremost of the businesses arousing this concern is Bank Central Asia, which was owned by Mr. Suharto's long-time financier and associate Liem Sioe Liong and his son, Anthony Salim, before it was nationalized last year. **********Most of the bank's loans were to companies in that family's business empire, the Salim Group, but IBRA determined that Bank Central Asia was simply too big to shut down because it was so dominant in the nation's banking, with more branches strewn across the archipelago than any other bank. Rather than tear a gaping hole in the Indonesian economy, IBRA left the bank intact, with Mr. Salim in control as the manager most capable of delivering returns to IBRA, the bank's new shareholder. **********''What you have to ask is whether you're destroying value,'' Mr. Eko said of the decision. ''This is what people on the street are too emotional to understand.'' **********Yet some warn that such compromises may set the stage for the biggest disappointment of all, a crony comeback. Mr. Redway said he watched a similar drama unfold in Russia. **********''When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was no one who hadn't participated in the old system,'' he said. The people most capable of running the new Russia turned out to be the same ones who had run the Soviet Union. **********In Indonesia, he predicts, there will be a period of reconciliation, and then ''everything will be forgotten.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/11/business/private-sector-forced-to-share-the-inner-city-turf.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-07-11", "snippet": "Pres Clinton was so taken by Aetna Inc chief executive Rie", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Forced to Share The Inner-City Turf", "print_headline": "PRIVATE SECTOR; Forced to Share The Inner-City Turf", "body_text": " **********For the last several years, Richard Huber, the chief executive of Aetna Inc., has been quietly trying to tap the business potential of the nation's central cities, which have long been neglected by big private insurance concerns like his.

This trip promises to test his often-praised skill for communicating with the West. That is a skill in short supply these days as the goodwill in United States-China relations, which was affirmed with President Clinton's visit to China last year, has all but given way to restrained hostility. **********Mr. Zhu wasted no time setting the tone. Moments after stepping off his plane, he jumped a security line to shake hands and exchange pleasantries with reporters. In the process he firmly pushed aside one of his guards, a possibly calculated gesture of defiance to the decorum Chinese leaders almost always observe during public ceremonies. **********Mr. Zhu's nine-day, six-city tour is slightly longer than a state visit in 1997 by his boss, President Jiang Zemin, but far less ceremonial. His plans include attending to down-to-the-wire negotiations over the terms of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He has also scheduled numerous meetings with business and banking leaders around the country and will seek to address nearly every hot-button issue in bilateral relations, including China's human-rights record, its environmental pollution, its huge trade surplus with the United States, and charges that its agents have pilfered American military secrets. **********During a brief stop in Los Angeles before diving into the diplomatic deep end of his mission in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Zhu met with civic leaders and representatives of the local Chinese-American community, the largest in the country. He also had a private audience with  Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney. Mr. Eisner recently presided over a high-profile bidding war between two Chinese cities, Hong Kong and Shanghai, to be the venue for the next Asian Disneyland. **********Bone-chilling drizzle and scattered protests by people seeking independence for Tibet and Taiwan marred Mr. Zhu's arrival. So did his tardiness at a lunch at the Century Plaza Hotel, where civic and business leaders, from the former Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, to the fallen junk bond financier, Michael Milken, waited more than an hour past the appointed time for Mr. Zhu to take his place on the podium. But those setbacks did nothing to shake the Prime Minister's upbeat message. In fact, he used them as fodder for a stream of self-deprecating jokes that are his trademark. **********''God does not welcome me that much because it's raining today and I know that it was very sunny here yesterday,'' he said, beginning his luncheon remarks. Speaking in Chinese entirely without notes and with scant trace of the boilerplate phrases about friendship and warm relations that usually dominate Chinese diplomatic statements, Mr. Zhu used much of his opening speech as an apology for arriving late to lunch. **********He chided Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles and Gov. Gray Davis of California, explaining that they must shoulder at least ''half the blame'' for his lack of punctuality. Both men had arranged telephone calls with Mr. Zhu, but used that time to raise weighty issues, he said. ''They asked so many questions and I could not refuse to answer.'' **********The mayor, he said, pressed him on China's gaping trade surplus with the United States. China exported $57 billion more than it imported from the United States last year, giving it the second-largest trade surplus with the United States after Japan. Mr. Zhu said he had originally prepared a speech on the issue for delivery next week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., but had no choice but to indulge Mr. Riordan's curiosity. **********The Prime Minister then teased Mr. Davis for expanding the 10-minute call into a 30-minute debate on human rights. **********''I explained that to do this properly we should start with Rousseau and the human rights declaration of the United States,'' Mr. Zhu said to laughter. ''I spent a long time explaining my views. But whether or not he is satisfied, I don't know.'' **********Referring to the continuing trade talks in Washington, Mr. Zhu sounded optimistic that the two sides were close to a breakthrough on China's application for entry into the World Trade Organization. He said he had received ''good news'' from his top negotiator, Long Yongtu, on progress on what he called the most important stumbling block in the talks over dismantling China's ban on importing wheat and citrus fruit from some parts of the United States. **********Whether such banter will do much to soften the criticism of China's policies heard from many members of Congress, religious groups, labor unions and national security experts remains to be seen. But Mr. Zhu, despite deep bags under his eyes and a somber black suit, seemed primed to disarm hostile audiences. **********Mr. Zhu said he approached the United States Ambassador to China, James Sasser, for advice on how to present himself during the trip. Mr. Sasser, a former Senator from Tennessee, told him to ''always keep a smiling face,'' Mr. Zhu said in a spurt of fluent English. **********Mr. Zhu said that smiling all the time ''would be too difficult for me.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/18/world/with-kinder-face-the-left-is-blossoming-in-uruguay.html": {"writer_name": "Clifford Krauss", "pub_date": "1999-07-18", "snippet": "Tabare Vazquez, who is one of Uruguay's leading oncologists, and former mayor of capital, Montevideo, is waging busy campaign for President, leading leftist coalition of former Tupamaro guerrillas, Communists, Socialists and Trotskyites; political...", "word_count": 802, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Kinder Face, the Left Is Blossoming in Uruguay", "print_headline": "With Kinder Face, the Left Is Blossoming in Uruguay", "body_text": " **********From Monday through Wednesday, Tabare Vazquez fights cancer as one of Uruguay's leading oncologists. From Thursday through Saturday, he runs for President -- and along the campaign trail he wags his finger at smokers urging them to ''lay off the poison.'' **********For Mr. Vazquez, the 57-year-old former mayor of the capital, Montevideo, campaigning is like making a house call. As wintry winds blow off the pampas, he walks up and down streets of small towns telling people to button up or go to bed to nurse a sniffle. **********All of this soft nurturing comes from the man who leads a coalition of former Tupamaro guerrillas, Communists, Socialists and Trotskyites. Political leaders of Uruguay's two traditional centrist parties, including President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, say Mr. Vazquez is really a Marxist wolf in disguise who would destroy the Uruguayan economy. The local news media badger him on statements applauding the social advances of the Cuban revolution and comparing the free-market economic policies sweeping Latin America to ''a cancer.'' **********But after Mr. Vazquez easily won an April primary, polls indicate that he stands head-to-head with Jorge Batlle of the center-left Colorado Party with three months remaining before a first-round vote. Former President Luis Alberto Lacalle of the center-right Blanco Party is falling well behind, and Mr. Vazquez and Mr. Batlle are already making plans for winning over his supporters in an expected November runoff. **********Expecting to win handily in Montevideo, where unions are strong and the Government is the leading employer, Mr. Vazquez is concentrating on the countryside, trying to win the traditional stronghold of the Blanco Party, where the left is viewed with strong suspicion. Mr. Vazquez is offering farmers tax cuts, a moratorium on foreclosures and higher tariffs to protect their markets from cheap Brazilian produce. **********While his campaign caravan drove through the dairy town of Reboledo, Mr. Vazquez waved and threw kisses through the window. ''Places like this were inaccessible to us until just a few years ago,'' he said. ''If we had come here during the 1971 campaign they might have thrown rocks at us, or even fired guns.'' **********It was the violence of that campaign, as well as the urban terrorism of the Tupamaro guerrillas, that led the military to take over and install a repressive dictatorship that lasted over a decade. Now, Mr. Vazquez received a respectable welcome. Rising unemployment and a general cynicism about politicians have helped his pose as an outsider who will clean up the system. **********''With the cold war over, everything is different,'' Mr. Vazquez said in an interview. **********Mr. Vazquez's pitch is even viewed by some as conservative in a country that has had a proud social democratic tradition since Italian and Spanish immigrants formed a political movement at the turn of the century that nationalized most industry and established unemployment compensation. Mr. Vazquez says that the Blanco and Colorado parties want to disassemble the welfare state, which he intends to protect. **********''In the 1940's, when we were known as the Switzerland of South America, we didn't have the unemployment we have today,'' Mr. Vazquez said. ''We want to recuperate our old values and form of life.'' **********Before large urban audiences, Mr. Vazquez is a stirring speaker. On the stump in the provinces, he moderates the rhetoric. **********''Quietly, gradually, calmly and within the Constitution,'' he promised an audience of 150 people in Fray Marcos, ''we will transform the country.'' **********Nevertheless, he has stirred fear among some military officers by promising to investigate the whereabouts of more than 100 people who disappeared during the military dictatorship so that their families can finally locate and bury the victims. He has also suggested he could include Tupamaros and Communist Party members in his Cabinet. **********The son of a labor union leader, and the brother of a guerrilla who was imprisoned, Mr. Vazquez did not fight as a rebel. He dedicated himself to medicine, and became popular by initiating social programs for the poor youth of Montevideo while managing a local soccer club. **********Mr. Vazquez catapulted to leadership in the Socialist Party by playing an active role opposing a referendum that gave the military an amnesty in 1989. The referendum won, but Mr. Vazquez ran for mayor soon after and stunned all commentators by winning. As Montevideo's mayor in the early 1990's, he won high marks for cleaning up parks and the waterfront, while raising property taxes and salaries for public service workers. He ran for president in 1994 and lost, but managed to attract nearly one-third of the vote. **********Mr. Vazquez's true beliefs are a matter of conjecture even among his supporters in the Frente Amplio coalition. **********''He's left of Felipe Gonzalez,'' said Eleuterio Fernandez Huidobro, the top Tupamaro leader, referring to the former Socialist Prime Minister of Spain. ''Of course, these days Felipe Gonzalez is to the right of Bill Clinton.

Primakov. ''We have crises all the time. The Government changes all the time. What leader has ever given me anything, anyway? I live in a village outside of Moscow, where we don't have gas, or running water.'' **********Next door in the women's salon, Lena Kovalyova, a 29-year old client who was having her long blond hair blow-dryed, shrugged off talk of a pending vote to impeach President Boris N. Yeltsin. As far as she was concerned, none of this week's turbulent events could hold a candle to the financial collapse of last August. **********Now that, Ms. Kovalyova said, was a real crisis. **********''In August, I was upset, now I'm not,'' she said. ''Then we were all jumping, now we are not. This doesn't affect common people. If prices go up, it is unpleasant, but nothing depends on us.'' **********Getting used to political crises is now part of the post-Communist Russian experience. After the coup of 1991 and the shelling of the Parliament in 1993, the three turnovers in Government in the last 14 months seem tame by comparison. And Mr. Yeltsin's epic battles with his Communist opposition in Parliament have become background noise for many citizens who are still trying to figure what role they have in Russia's imperfect democracy. **********''There has been an unclear situation for seven years now,'' said Kirill Kaminsky, 24. ''What can I say? I don't think there will be a big collapse this time, but even if there is one, people won't go out onto the streets. People don't pay attention to such things anymore. They go on with their business.'' **********For several months, polls have shown Mr. Primakov to be Russia's most trusted politician, and most people interviewed after his dismissal on Wednesday agreed that he was worthy of respect. ''He was decent,'' said Nadezhda, 29, a hairdresser at another Moscow hair salon. ''That is why they got rid of him.'' **********''I have been shocked by the situation we have been seeing for some time,'' noted Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a Moscow daily, in an interview on a radio talk show. ''There is no confidence in anyone, first of all Yeltsin. Only the Government and Primakov had the people's confidence. Let us wait and see if the people come out on the streets in support of the Government.'' **********But when Echo Mosky, the same radio station, asked listeners to call in to say whether they were ready to protest Mr. Primakov's ouster, only 26 percent of 3,400 callers said they would. ''Not under any circumstances will I go out on the street,'' said one elderly woman. ''What's the point?'' **********It is not that people are indifferent, or that they are not worried. Several people talked about their uncertainties, even fears for the future, about their uneasy feeling that this kind of political instability cannot continue indefinitely. **********''The main thing is that things not get worse, but my opinion is that something bad will happen,'' said Sveltana Makutdinova, who sells bread at the Viktor Market, a popular neighborhood grocery store. ''The ruble will go down again, and prices will go up. I think people's patience is almost exhausted. Everyone is on edge.'' **********For Tatyana Norkina, a 52-year-old employee at the state Committee for Land Resources, the worst is never knowing what to expect. ''Whenever a new minister has to be appointed, we don't work for a time,'' Ms. Norkina said. ''Our ministries keep being united, then divided. First our committee belongs to one ministry, then another. We move from one building to another. Right now is sowing season, but we won't be able to work. We don't have the laws in place.'' **********Some blame Mr. Yeltsin, others blame his advisers.

''It's not about NATO. It's about the U.N.'' **********Mr. Vujovic, who is an Assistant Foreign Minister, said Yugoslavia was eager for a political agreement that would grant Kosovo ''wide autonomy and self-government, based on the principle of equal status for all communities,'' including the province's minority Serbs. **********But he also said Belgrade must play a role in carrying out a settlement, which he said must respect the sovereignty of both Yugoslavia and Serbia over Kosovo. **********Mr. Vujovic praised the efforts of the Russian special envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who in difficult talks with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has been trying to find a balance between Belgrade's demands and those of the NATO alliance. **********Among Mr. Chernomyrdin's great virtues, Mr. Vujovic said, is his effort to ''reaffirm the vital state interests of Yugoslavia in bringing this crisis to an end,'' including respect for its ''sovereignty and dignity.'' **********Two of the difficulties in those talks, Yugoslav and American officials say, are Belgrade's desire to be an active negotiating partner and its desire to keep more than a symbolic number of troops and policemen inside Kosovo, along its borders with Macedonia and Albania, and on guard at Serbian holy sites. **********Senior Yugoslav officials have said President Slobodan Milosevic is ready for a settlement in Kosovo and will meet most of NATO's requirements, including the presence of some NATO troops in any United Nations force. But the officials emphasize that he needs to be seen as a serious negotiator from a sovereign country rather than as a vanquished foe capitulating to NATO demands. **********Mr. Vujovic insisted today, for example, that while Belgrade was ready to accept a United Nations mission in Kosovo as part of a settlement, who takes part in that mission, and ''its mandate, modalities and volume'' should be negotiated in ''direct dialogue'' between Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Yugoslav Government. **********''We need a political solution that can fly and can be operable,'' he said. ''It's about a global solution to be discussed within the U.N. Security Council.'' **********NATO began its air attacks on Yugoslavia without a Security Council resolution, insisting that its actions were legally founded in the right of ''humanitarian intervention.'' But NATO officials knew that they could not get such a Security Council resolution, because Russia and China said they would veto one. The Germans, French and Italians went along, even though they were unhappy about the lack of United Nations authorization. **********Belgrade has said it is fighting to preserve international law and the postwar order as well as its sovereignty. It has demanded that any political solution be cast in a United Nations Security Council resolution and that any international force put into Kosovo be under a United Nations flag. **********NATO has issued a joint statement with the Group of Seven industrial countries and Russia calling for a Security Council resolution. But NATO is reluctant to get into direct negotiations with Mr. Milosevic, preferring to use the Russians as a go-between. **********But now fearing that Moscow is too close to Belgrade, NATO has deputized President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland to act on its behalf alongside Mr. Chernomyrdin. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin spent nearly seven hours in talks with Mr. Milosevic this week, then flew back to Moscow for further talks with Mr. Talbott and Mr. Ahtisaari, which were inclusive. But Mr. Talbott said they were making progress and would continue next week in Moscow. **********So it is not clear whether Mr. Chernomyrdin will return here for more talks with Mr. Milosevic on Monday or Tuesday, as both men originally announced. **********Mr. Vujovic today emphasized the positive, saying: ''We are open to a peaceful solution, open to diplomatic negotiations. We are open to playing a constructive role in reaching a political solution on Kosovo.'' **********But NATO wants nearly all Serbian forces to be withdrawn from Kosovo and Belgrade's authority to be supplanted in Kosovo by an international authority until new elections can be organized. So there is much left to negotiate. **********Still, senior Yugoslav officials say they believe a settlement is inevitable unless NATO countries -- Britain in particular -- balk and harden the alliance's demands. **********Mr. Vujovic repeated Belgrade's demands for a bombing halt and a withdrawal of NATO forces from Yugoslavia's borders as a precondition for any political settlement. **********Earlier today, NATO air strikes hit a fuel depot in Belgrade, shattering the windows of the Swiss Ambassador's residence as he was holding a National Day reception. **********Among the guests was the Swedish Ambassador, whose own residence had its doors and windows blown out the previous night when an errant bomb hit a hospital, killing three patients and a security guard. The residences of the Norwegian, Spanish, Indian and Hungarian Ambassadors were also damaged, as was the Libyan Embassy. **********The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet quoted the Swedish Ambassador, Mats Staffansson, as saying: ''We had just come to dessert when a crash came.

In August, DaimlerChrysler AG issued a $4.5 billion global bond, the largest offering by the corporation so far. **********\"Many institutional investors have said that they intend to be fully invested by the end of October,\" said Suni Harford, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney Inc. in New York. \"Companies are rushing to raise cash now because of fears that financial markets will be illiquid and too expensive later in the year.\" **********The $4.5 billion bond was a three-part deal: a three-year, $1 billion floating-rate note paying 0.27 percentage point above three-month interbank loans in London (these are currently trading at about 5.5 percent); a five-year, $1.5 billion fixed-rate bond paying a coupon interest rate of 6.90 percent; and a 10-year, $2 billion fixed-rate issue with a coupon of 7.2 percent. On Friday afternoon, the bonds were yielding 5.85 percent, 6.77 percent, and 7.11 percent, respectively. By contrast, three-, five- and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds were returning 5.75 percent, 5.72 percent and 5.86 percent. **********Although the bond is sold in minimum denominations of $1,000, which in theory allows for retail distribution, the vast majority of buyers have been institutions. A DaimlerChrysler spokesman said the smallest bids had been in the region of $500,000. The bond is still fairly liquid, so if brokers can find a market maker that is willing to deal in small amounts, it should be possible for retail investors to buy into it. But the window of opportunity is narrowing and some analysts suggested that within a few weeks the bond will be gone, tucked into long-term portfolios. **********\"DaimlerChrysler is a solid company and one which retail investors can easily get to grips with,\" said Peter Charles, a fixed-income analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in London. \"It is a truly global player and dominant in its field. Also, the company's leverage is conservative relative to other car manufacturers. Add to these key points a reasonable yield and one can see why traditional fixed-income retail investors might be interested in the bond.\" **********Paul Braine, a fixed-income fund manager with Investec Guinness Flight in London, is not convinced that DaimlerChrysler's global bond is all that attractive. His concern has to do with yields on bonds, like Daimler's, with only a little default risk, which he said do not pay enough extra interest to make them more attractive than super-safe issues while their security is much better than the best of the junk category. **********DaimlerChrysler has about 300 bonds outstanding, many of them Eurobonds. Recent issues include a five-year maturity targeted at retail investors that pays a 3.5 percent coupon. The car manufacturer issued another Eurobond in July, with a coupon of 4.5 percent. This bond is due to mature in January 2005. **********\"The 2004 DaimlerChrysler Eurobond is fairly illiquid,\" said Jeroen Van den Broek, an analyst with ABN-AMRO. \"Even if investors were able to get their hands on some paper, I would not necessarily recommend that they buy it. The bond has a tighter spread to government bonds than companies with better credit quality. Investors would probably be better-off buying the January 2005 Eurobond. This bond is trading in line with companies of a similar credit rating and investors are getting extra yield compared to the earlier issue.\" **********Buying Eurobonds is fairly straightforward, although there is no formal marketplace. The market is telephone-driven and the houses are based in London. Investors simply give brokers details of the bonds they want to buy. For the most part, Eurobonds are issued in bearer form, with no formal register of ownership held by the company. A vital aspect of a Eurobond is that it is not subject to withholding tax. **********Merrill Lynch & Co. was asked to provide details of the costs that its clients could expect to encounter if they were buying any of the above-mentioned bonds. A spokesman said the minimum cost would depend on the bond. In theory, however, a Merrill Lynch client could buy $1,000 worth of the $4.5 billion global bond, he said. The fees would range from 0.5 to 1.5 percent and depend on the maturity of the bond. But he said that a 1 percent fee would probably be typical for small transactions. **********MERRILL LYNCH & CO.

They are in radio contact with communications aircraft and spotter planes, which help guide them to potential targets. They have heat-sensing infrared cameras that allow them to magnify fuzzy pictures of what is on the ground. And they have their own eyes. **********But identifying targets is complicated by the altitudes and speeds at which the pilots fly, as well as by weather and combat conditions -- including the possibility that enemy troops are using civilian vehicles or using civilians as shields. **********In the Balkans conflict, NATO pilots have been flying fairly high -- 15,000 feet and above -- to avoid ground fire. **********One United States Air Force F-16 pilot likened the experience to bungee jumping from the top of a building and trying to pick out details on the ground during the descent. **********''It's part of the job and you get used to that, but it's extremely difficult to put a lay person in that situation and have them understand the complexity,'' the pilot said. **********Defending the actions of NATO pilots in attacking two convoys in Kosovo last week, Brig. Gen. Dan Leaf of the United States Air Force, the commander of an air wing at Aviano Air Base in Italy, said in Brussels today that distinguishing a tractor from a military truck is harder than it might appear. **********''As we watch these videos in the comfort of this room and on a large display, it appears possible the vehicles are tractors or tractor-type vehicles,'' General Leaf said after playing back cockpit videos of one of the convoy attacks. **********''As I reviewed the tapes with the pilots, they agreed,'' he said. ''However, they were emphatic that from the attack altitude, to the naked eye, they appeared to be military vehicles.'' **********General Leaf said that a pilot in another warplane used high-powered binoculars to study the convoy that was being attacked and that the pilot concluded that the convoy included military vehicles. **********NATO provided a glimpse of what an attacking pilot is going through when it released an audiotape last week of the debriefing of a pilot involved in one of the convoy attacks. **********On the tape, the F-16 pilot described making a series of passes just after midday over an area of Kosovo in which he saw villages burning. **********The pilot described seeing ''three uniformly shaped dark green vehicles, look like deuce-and-a-half troop carrying vehicles.'' **********He said he went in ''on two passes to get a close look, both with my eyeballs and with my targeting pod -- IR picture.'' He subsequently dropped a laser-guided bomb that he said destroyed one of the vehicles. **********The IR, or infrared, camera to which he referred is part of a targeting device contained in a military system known as Lantirn. The system was developed to provide low-altitude navigation and nighttime targeting, but it is routinely used by fighter pilots for targeting during daytime as well. Its heat-sensing infrared camera is able to pick out targets from a distance of up to 25,000 feet but not to display them as sharply as a television camera. **********Pilots say they are trained to recognize vehicles that they are likely to encounter in a combat area, particularly tanks and troop carriers. **********But because of their speed and altitude, pilots say they also rely on their infrared targeting device, which provides them with a magnified picture on a four-and-a-half-inch by four-and-a-half-inch screen that sits by their knee in the cockpit. **********Because it makes images based on heat rather than light, the targeting device is particularly useful at night. But it also has a number of advantages for pilots in daylight, including allowing them to pick out vehicles that have been camouflaged, to keep the picture centered on the screen even as they pass by and turn, and to magnify the image substantially. **********But the picture the system provides is not crystal clear, and its usefulness is limited in wet weather."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/business/personal-business-what-to-do-with-the-bonus-check.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Cottle", "pub_date": "1999-01-31", "snippet": "Bonuses, once the exclusive preserve of top executives, are now going to middle managers, production workers and support staff at many companies, exposing them to the temptation to spend in advance and be caught short if the bonus falls through; a...", "word_count": 992, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "What to Do With the Bonus Check?", "print_headline": "PERSONAL BUSINESS; What to Do With the Bonus Check?", "body_text": " **********IT'S bonus season again, and not just on Wall Street. Sure, the financial-services bonus babies are as numerous as ever, offering up silent ''show me the money'' prayers that last fall's market gyrations will not eat too far into the six-  or seven-figure checks they are counting on to finance a swank Upper East Side duplex or a little place in the Hamptons. But though the dollars in other industries do not approach the lofty heights enjoyed on Wall Street, the culture of bonuses is spreading steadily through the ranks of corporate America. **********Once the exclusive preserve of top executives, bonuses and other variable compensation plans are now going to middle managers, production workers and support staff at many companies. And as they do, the new swimmers in the bonus pool must adjust to receiving a substantial fraction of each year's income in one lump. **********In 1998, 72 percent of 1,069 companies surveyed by Hewitt Associates, a management consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill., reported having variable pay plans -- incentive bonuses, stock options, profit sharing and so on -- for nonexecutive workers. That makes the pleasure of having one's efforts translated into a fat check at year's end a more common experience now than in any of the previous 21 years Hewitt has conducted the survey; the figure is up from 60 percent in 1994. These programs vary pay based on performance; they are distinct from holiday bonuses, routine employer matching of 401(k) contributions or traditional company stock purchase plans. **********The flip side of this growing kind of variable pay is that it is, well, variable; there's no knowing for sure what's coming. According to Hewitt, most variable compensation plans do not put base pay at risk; they pile bonuses on top of regular salary. But there is a danger that employees will give in to the temptation to spend in advance and be caught short if the bonus falls through. **********Hard data on the effects of incentive pay systems on employees' financial habits are scarce. But anecdotal evidence suggests that Jane and John Q. Public are not following in the footsteps of those in the Wall Street crowd who dive into lavish life styles that render them dependent on a hefty year-end check. Away from Wall Street, it is not unusual to find employees who have received bonuses like clockwork for several years running and still insist that they do not rely on the money or allow it to alter their standards of living, instead treating each year's bonus as a unique windfall. **********''It's like we'd jinx it if we bought something ahead of time,'' Bjorn Berstein, a Seattle-based carpenter, said of his performance-based bonus, which came to about $1,200 last year. **********SAVINGS and investment seem to be the most popular uses for this found money. ''That check comes in and goes straight to the bank,'' said Sue Koehler, an operations manager with Sanders Tool & Supplies in Peoria, Ill., where bonuses can, in some cases, amount to several months' pay. ''Usually we've got something cooking that we want to invest it in. Maybe we'll take a little trip with part of it, but the majority is definitely for investment.'' **********Jonathan Tobert, a clinical researcher in Rahway, N.J., for Merck & Company, the drug giant, said he had gone even further, choosing to defer receiving all of his bonus income until he retires. (The company invests it for him in the meantime.) He won't have to pay income tax on the money until then, either. **********Of course, not everyone can save the whole bonus. Some people put the money toward big-ticket necessities like a child's college tuition. For Lesli Hicks, a media specialist with USAA Life Insurance in San Antonio, where bonuses can be about 15 percent of a worker's base salary, this year's check will help as she and her husband pursue adopting a baby from China -- a process that they expect will cost $15,000. ''Without the bonus we would be able to do it eventually, but it would be longer in the making,'' she said. **********Shirley Herring's sons are married and out of the house, so she feels free to spend her bonus on expensive toys. For Christmas one year, Ms. Herring, a shipping manager at Sanders, bought her husband a 1951 Ford to restore. Another year, she said, the couple went touring on ''the biggest Harley you can buy.'' **********Such stories contradict the conventional wisdom of compensation experts and financial planners that it is human nature for employees to start thinking of bonuses as entitlements. ''The overall expectation is that they're going to get a bonus, almost regardless of the success and prosperity of the country or company,'' said Hrach Bedrosian, a New York University professor and management consultant. ''When the bonus doesn't come through or doesn't come through as large as expected, they're really put back.'' **********Some people say they have little choice but to think that way. ''I'd love to invest the money, and I would if I didn't need it so badly,'' said Gina Szczepanski, a sales representative for USAA. After contributing 10 percent to her church and paying her property taxes, Ms. Szczepanski's plans for her bonus run to new tires and a brake job for her car. Still digging out of debts left over from her divorce two years ago, she said she didn't know what she would do without the bonus money each year. **********Employees who are not in dire straits may be kidding themselves when they say bonuses don't affect them. Without realizing it, they may spend their regular pay more freely, on the unspoken assumption that bonus checks will be there for rainy days. People may say they don't count on a bonus in order to keep from being disappointed if it falls through, Mr. Bedrosian suggested. ''It's a way of saving face or rationalizing if it doesn't happen.'' **********Or, maybe the rank and file has a better grip on its financial best interests than it is usually given credit for."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/12/world/israeli-race-for-prime-minister-is-down-to-the-wire-with-little-cheering.html": {"writer_name": "Deborah Sontag", "pub_date": "1999-05-12", "snippet": "Few Israelis seem inspired by candidates for Prime Minister as vote nears; campaign has been devoid of substantive debate on key issues; conversations with resident of south-central Israel indicate Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak are t...", "word_count": 2457, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Israeli Race for Prime Minister Is Down to the Wire, With Little Cheering", "print_headline": "Israeli Race for Prime Minister Is Down to the Wire, With Little Cheering", "body_text": " **********Six days before the Israeli elections, Chaim Yisrael, an elderly Hasidic Jew, hurried to complete his shopping near the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He was on his way to tutor Torah, he said, but he could spare a few minutes. **********''You know, there's only one real leader for us,'' he said, raising his bearded chin, peering heavenward over the brim of his black hat, and pointing at the sky. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Yisrael said, he is planning to cast a half-hearted vote for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. **********''On the personal side, he looks a little like Clinton morally,'' Mr. Yisrael said. ''But ideologically, he's fine. What choice do we have really? Politics is the land of relativity, and he will be better to protect the land of Israel.'' **********Eight miles away and a world apart, Moussa Ibrahim was equally equivocal. Standing over a mountain of salty pumpkin seeds in his gourmet shop in Abu Ghosh, an Israeli-Arab village, said he will vote for Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader. **********''Not because I am a big fan,'' he said. ''But because I want to be able to go out in the street and say I have a Prime Minister who is not a paranoid, a cheater and a liar.'' **********This election campaign is reputedly a personality competition, devoid of substantive debate on issues like the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, the economy and tensions between secular and religious Jews. But few Israelis seem inspired by the personalities themselves. **********From the craggy hills of the West Bank to the sleepy desert town of Beersheba, from affluent Tel Aviv to depressed Netivot, few Israelis offer rhapsodic endorsements of their candidates. Many say they will cast their ballots while holding their noses. ''People vote by way of elimination here,'' said Vered Alexandrovitz, a bookstore owner in North Tel Aviv. **********Israelis tend to be skeptical of predictions. They distrust the polls, which show Mr. Barak ahead of Mr. Netanyahu by about eight percentage points in a five-way race for Prime Minister. A tour of south-central Israel, including conversations with scores of voters, instead leaves the impression that Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak are in a dead heat. **********Yet the country does not seem gripped by the intensity of a tight election battle. Few balconies are strung with political banners, and road junctions are not routinely staffed by campaign workers. There have been no big political rallies, partly for security reasons, and no political debates between Mr. Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi, and Mr. Barak. **********Throughout the country, many Israelis said they consider Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak to be cut from the same cloth: both self-confident Ashkenazi Jews with master's degrees from the United States, both former members of the military elite, and both leaning toward the center -- Mr. Netanyahu from the right, Mr. Barak from the left. **********''I think they have the same profile,'' said Shmuel Lederer, mayor of a small West Bank settlement. ''No matter who is elected, we won't feel much change.'' **********Many Israelis feel that this is a critical election in which they will select the leader who oversees sensitive negotiations over a Palestinian state, an Israeli military withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the fate of the Golan Heights. **********But they are weary of the high-decibel level of Israeli politics, disgusted by dirty deals and profoundly skeptical of the the maturation of the process in the near future. **********Navon and Shoshana Armand, lifelong members of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party, do not even know if they will bother to vote on May 17, which is a holiday, a day off work. **********''Maybe,'' said Mr. Armand, a bus driver in Beersheba. ''If we're not on a picnic.'' **********Efrat **********In the large Jewish settlement at Efrat, in the arid, rocky West Bank, the grass is green, the flowers plentiful and the stores modern and well stocked. It looks like an Arizona suburb and, with 6,450 people, it is effectively a bedroom community for Jerusalem. But while some residents chose it for its amenities, many elected to live in Efrat for purely ideological reasons. **********In the small shopping plaza, the town bakery, which sells croissants and prayer shawls, is decorated, inside and out, with Mr. Netanyahu's face. In 1996, Efrat voted overwhelmingly for the Prime Minister, and most residents still back him. **********Uri Netter, 22, a cheery clerk at the unusually efficient post office, said it did not require much thought. **********''He is the only one who supports us,'' said Mr. Netter, an immigrant from France. ''Look how we have grown here and how many new settlements have popped up during his time in office.'' **********Eti Avrahami, however, is sharply critical of the Prime Minister, speaking more like a small business owner than a settler. Her family owns a grocery store in the center of town. **********''We used to believe in Bibi,'' she said. ''But everything seemed to come to a halt under him. The economy is down. The society is stuck. There's no forward motion, no swoosh.'' **********Mrs. Avrahami unconsciously echoed the themes of Mr. Barak's campaign against Mr. Netanyahu. People like her, defectors from the committed core of Netanyahu supporters, are very worrisome to his campaign. **********Bet Haggai **********This town near Hebron is a hard-core settlement, a Zionist outpost among the Palestinian towns. Bet Haggai has a frontier feeling, and the many shuttered houses on its edges suggest that the living is hard. **********Even here, however, where 98.8 percent of voters selected Mr. Netanyahu last time, the Prime Minister does not have the electorate sewn up.  ''I think people want to punish Netanyahu because he did not stop Oslo,'' the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed in 1993, said Mr. Lederer, the mayor. **********Yisrael Buskila, 24, is only a renter, a newlywed who moved in because the price was right and the view was splendid. But he believes from his core that Israel should hold onto as much of the West Bank as possible. If Benny Begin, the right-wing candidate for Prime Minister, had a chance, he would get Mr. Buskila's vote, he said. But he doesn't, so Mr. Buskila said he will vote for Mr. Netanyahu. **********He said he does not believe in the Prime Minister, but that the traits he finds unappealing -- his perceived arrogance and wiliness -- make him tough at the negotiating table. **********''With Netanyahu, you see him holding the Palestinians by the throat,'' he said. For Parliament, however, Mr. Buskila will vote for the far-right National Unity coalition. ''Why?'' he asked. ''Because they will be holding Bibi by the throat while he holds the Palestinians.'' **********Beersheba **********In this desert town, far from the political centers of the country, a Barak banner and a Netanyahu banner hang together as if they are one sign -- sharing the same string, between two palm trees. **********That would seem to sum up the  sleepiness of the campaign in Beersheba, where many voters said they were undecided. Even so, Ruthie Sheetrit, a hairdresser, said the barrage of election news was driving her and everyone else insane. ''By May 17, we'll all be meshuga,'' she said, in her shop at the central bus station. **********Sixty percent of Beersheba, a mixed town with many Sephardic Jews, Russian immigrants and Israeli Arabs, voted for Mr. Netanyahu in 1996. Since then, though, the Likud town elected a Labor mayor, and politically it is in flux. **********Mrs. Sheetrit said she would vote for Mr. Netanyahu, as she did in 1996. But her endorsement is not ringing. ''Barak in power is an unknown,'' she said. ''With Bibi, we already know the bad. So what I'm saying is, I'll go with the known evil.'' **********In Israel, political scientists say that voting is tribal. People are born into political parties -- the Ashkenazi or European power elite and Israeli Arabs are Labor while the Sephardic or Middle Eastern and African working class and the ultra-Orthodox are Likud. But everywhere it seemed that the tribes were shifting ground. **********Chaim Crispin, 46, for instance, was among those who selected Mr. Netanyahu last time. But Mr. Crispin, a lifelong Likudnik who owns a small metal business in Beersheba, said Mr. Netanyahu had immediately detached him from his party loyalty. He will vote for Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party candidate. And in a runoff election, if it comes to that, he will vote for Mr. Barak -- ''if there's no other choice, because no way I'll vote for Bibi.'' **********Netivot **********This somewhat desolate southern town that is home to poor and working class Sephardic Jews is an unlikely tourist destination. But Netivot has the tomb of Baba Sali, the late Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, a Moroccan-born sage who was revered as a healer and miracle worker. And Jews of North African descent flock to it in tour buses. If there is anything that is unadulterated Netanyahu territory, this is it. **********At a raucous bar mitzvah, celebrated with couscous and grilled meat, one man banged a drum, while another strummed an oud. Shouting above the revelry, Felix Smadar, a port worker, said, ''We're Bibi. Why? Because he's a strong man, and all the Arabs are afraid of him.'' **********But within every group, there is a freethinker. Cheli Azulay, who was celebrating her one-week wedding anniversary at the tomb, said she will vote for Mr. Mordechai, defying her new husband, because she dislikes Mr. Netanyahu. **********Sometimes, voters' motivations are personal. ''He takes his wife everywhere, this Bibi,'' Mrs. Azulay said. Yitzhak ''Rabin -- God bless his soul -- did he drag his wife around with him? What is this? I don't like it.'' **********Ashkelon **********On the pedestrian mall in this port town that is home to new immigrants from the former Soviet Union and older immigrants from North Africa, Ilana Tveritzim cuddled her small, blond daughter. **********A clerk at an employment agency who left Russia nine years ago, she is one of the immigrant voters that the candidates are furiously courting because they seem less wedded to parties than native-born Israelis. **********Mrs. Tveritzim is abandoning Mr. Netanyahu. ''He tends to bump his head against other heads,'' she said. ''That is not good in a leader. Maybe Barak is more mature.' **********At her non-kosher delicatessen in Ashlelon, stocked with sausages, Tanya Levin, of Minsk, said she is defecting from Mr. Netanyahu, too, because the economy is depressed. And Renata Koeppel, who immigrated to Israel four years ago from the Ukraine, said that her friends are feeling the sting of rising unemployment. She works at a new toy store, where she beat out 100 other immigrants for the job, her boss said. ''We will vote Barak,'' she said. **********Hearing about their fellow countrymen, Uri and Natalie Datchek were disappointed. ''Maybe they are not thinking about Israel, but themselves,'' Mr. Datchek said, endorsing Mr. Netanyahu because ''he is strong.'' **********Ramat Aviv Gimmel **********This community is so notorious as the affluent yuppie center of Tel Aviv that it is the name of the Israeli television's version of Beverly Hills 90210. In 1996, Ramat Aviv Gimmel came out strongly for Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who lost to Mr. Netanyahu. **********This is one of the places where Israelis say they will sink into depression -- or go abroad for a while -- if Mr. Netanyahu is re-elected. **********Sari Yisraeli, a real estate broker with stylishly touseled red hair, was meeting some clients at a cafe in an upscale food court in the local mall. She said she and her friends are panicked at the possibility of a Netanyahu victory. **********''If it will be Bibi, it will be tragedy -- disaster,'' she said. ''If he wins, I think I'm going to lock myself in the house for a week. Barak -- I trust his judgment -- I trust it in my gut.'' **********Inside a coffee shop, two well-dressed couples debated their choices of candidates, offering lukewarm endorsements. ''I'm a right-winger, so I will have to vote for Netanyahu,'' Avner Cohen said. **********''I don't like him,'' said his friend, Ms. Alexandrovitz. ''He's not a good choice. But don't misunderstand me. I'm not a big fan of Barak.'' **********''I didn't say I like Bibi, either,'' Mr. Cohen shot back. **********Abu Ghosh **********In his immaculate shop in this relatively prosperous Arab village in the Judean hills, Mr. Ibrahim stood between towering bottles of olive oil and hookahs, which were on sale. **********''A man like me, not a Jew -- on the one hand, they are telling me this is not your state,'' Mr. Ibrahim said. ''On the other, they are telling me you have the right to vote. So what is the value of that right in a place they say I don't belong?'' **********Election campaigns underscore the quandary of Israeli Arabs, citizens who feel they are treated as second class. With more than 300,000 voters, they represent an important bloc. In the past, their turnout, which is relatively low by Israeli standards, has been somewhat assured by their desire to cast a ballot for the Arab parties in the Parliament. **********But in this election, where there is likely to be a runoff, will they be motivated to vote a second time, to choose between Mr. Barak and Mr. Netanyahu? In a close race, the answer is very important to Mr. Barak, and his party is working hard to overcome the cynicism many Israeli Arabs feel. **********''The leftist parties scream, ''Give us your vote so that we can get back in power and make things right for you,' '' Mr. Ibrahim said. ''Then regimes change, but nothing changes for us. They are right to worry about the Israeli-Arab turnout.'' **********Mea Shearim **********In the shopping district near here, the walls are plastered with posters warning against casting a blank ballot for Prime Minister. **********''White slip, black future,'' the new posters say ominously. **********The posters are trying to combat a community-wide campaign that is urging strictly religious Jews in Mea Shearim to be neutral. It is a pragmatic response to the possibility that Mr. Barak could win as well as an expression of the feeling that the religious community has become too politicized. **********Standing near one wall of posters, Rickie Sofer, who immigrated to Israel 30 years ago from Brooklyn, said she was considering abstaining altogether, even from the vote for Parliament. **********''The truth is, between you and me, I think they're all dishonest,'' she said. ''Last time, I voted for Netanyahu. He looks like a gentleman. But I'm very disappointed by his conduct.'' **********Mrs. Sofer is unusually independent-minded. Most members of the religious community vote according to their rabbis' recommendation, although most rabbis have not yet made their endorsements. **********Asya Konofnitsky, a young mother who held her tiny daughter's hand at a bus stop, looked stunned when she was asked for whom she would vote. **********''How could I know?'' she said. ''The Torah sages have been silent. What they tell me. That's what I will vote.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/13/world/senator-tells-nuclear-bomb-labs-to-end-foreign-scientists-visits.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1999-04-13", "snippet": "Republican Sen Richard C Shelby, chairman of Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, says after two days of security briefings at Los Alamos National Laboratory that it should end visits by foreign scientists in wake of allegations that China sto...", "word_count": 312, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Senator Tells Nuclear Bomb Labs To End Foreign Scientists' Visits", "print_headline": "Senator Tells Nuclear Bomb Labs To End Foreign Scientists' Visits", "body_text": " **********Directors of the nation's nuclear bomb laboratories should put a ''tourniquet'' on visits by foreign scientists, the leader of a Senate delegation said today after two days of security briefings at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. **********Denouncing the ''hemorrhaging'' of bomb secrets to foreigners, Senator Richard C.

There, prices largely reflect the ups and downs in the mood of the public, rather than the ever soaring ambitions of consignors. **********That is one reason for the success of the antiquities sales put together every year, late in September, by the auctioneer Francois de Ricqles with the assistance of Jean-Philippe Mariaud de Serres, the Paris dealer who operates as a registered expert guaranteeing the authenticity of the items. **********Another reason, which came out strongly in the two-day sale conducted on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, is the number of pieces consigned from old French collections. They give collectors an exhilarating impression of discovery and, more importantly, the feeling that they will not raise ethical problems. With the widening recognition that commercial digging, aside from being illegal in virtually every country, is highly destructive, buyers are beginning to shun pieces visibly dug up in recent years. **********This month enthusiasm triggered by works from old collections seemed more vivid than usual. A leaping wild goat carved in the 14th century B.C. as part of some wooden seat for an Egyptian ruler would have sold with difficulty in the past \u2014 the right side of the face is a modern restoration. But the goat belonged, long ago, to a collector called Albert Ferdinand Pagnon (1847-1909) and that sent it leaping to 60,970 francs ($9,900), two and a half times the estimate. Museums, too, are becoming more sensitive to the issue of legitimacy, which in this case may account in part for the Louvre Museum substituting itself for the highest bidder, as French tradition permits. **********Moments later, a piece that seemed even more exposed to the risk of failure was likewise rescued. The wooden plaque, 10 by 13.5 centimeters (4 by 5.5 inches) and engraved with the effigy of a scribe facing the deity Toth, is hardly intact. A 3-centimeter hole pokes through the pattern. The two pillars that flank it and a tablet with hieroglyphs at the top have been tagged onto it. But rarity bolstered by provenance (the Bey Ryas Pacha collection in Egypt formed before World War II), kicked it up to a generous 57,645 francs. The Louvre got that one as well. **********There were some failures, which only served to underline the truly spontaneous character of the sale. A stone slab from the site of Heliopolis carved in sunken relief with the effigy of a daughter of Akhenaten was too small (18.5 by 18 centimeters) and too ungainly to warrant an estimate of 400,000 to 450,000 francs. It fell unsold at 260,000 francs. Another slab carved with two bulls, also from Heliopolis, sold but only just \u2014 even as a fragment it is damaged. Wisely, De Ricqles let it go on a bid of 41,000 francs, well below the 70,000 to 80,000 franc estimate. **********Such corrections in midstream, rare in London and New York, leave auction buffs with the feeling that here at least the true ecology of the auction market survives intact. **********Variations such as these occurred several times. Two bronze helmets consigned by a Paris physician who bought them in 1970 fared in markedly contrasted fashion. One, of the Chalcidian type common in the fourth century B.C., was restored with tin solder, a technique abandoned in the 1930s. A modern restorer will need to remove it before cleaning off the layer of adhering clay and corroded metal in order to bring out the patina. The process will easily add $5,000 to the purchase cost, to say nothing of the uncertainty of the outcome. Intimidated, collectors held back. The second helmet was a Corinthian-type from the fifth century B.C. from Apulia in southern Italy. In good condition, except for the loss of the devices holding the plumes, it rose to a mind-boggling 310,392 francs as two collectors tried to get it. **********The passion for Greek and Roman antiquities, which has left an indelible imprint on French art since the Renaissance, could be gauged from some interesting pieces that turned up that week. There were bronzes collected by a French couple between the 1930s and the late 1950s. A Hellenistic bronze bed ornament with a horse head at one end and the bust of Diana at the other, badly damaged by corrosion, nevertheless went up to 53,210 francs \u2014 a huge price for a piece in that condition. A bronze Hercules, one arm raised to strike with his club now missing and the other stretched with the Nemean lion hide draped over it, had a blackish patina that spoke of decades spent above ground. It rose to 221,078 francs. **********Some stone sculptures could be seen to have reached France a very long time ago. A marble head of Athena, dating from the first or second century, according to Mariaud de Serres, with its nose restored and its face reworked and polished probably in the 18th century, largely exceeded its estimate at 47,668 francs. **********Later came a fascinating portrait of a child. The bust, inspired by Ancient Roman statuary, was carved in 17th-century France and the ancient Roman head of a young boy was fitted on to it. Mariaud de Serres dates the head to the third century A.D., adding that it was repolished and restored in the 19th century. I suspect that this was done when the bust was carved. The composite piece makes up a remarkable portrait that cost its buyer 88,684 francs. **********- **********THE auction culminated with two statues from early dynastic Egypt acquired after World War I. Both are missing one leg. One has lost both arms, the other retains the stump of one. The faces and the torsos are also damaged. Yet they were furiously fought over, each bringing a phenomenal 698,381 francs. In New York, where condition is paramount, they might not have enjoyed that easy ride. **********Not least among the attractions of such sales are the many small objects from private owners that carry modest estimates. London and New York auction rooms shun these because the cost of processing them is not justified by the profit. Collectors love them. **********In the Drouot sale, a rare bronze draped figure of a woman cast in the Iberian peninsula around the fourth or fifth century B.C. could be had for 4,213 francs. An astonishing small stone figure of a highly stylized ram ascribed to \"Iran, 3d millennium B.C.,\" but possibly Anatolian, went to a Parisian collector who paid 8,315 francs. **********As they went out, some buyers wore on their faces the expression of the cat that has been at the bird's nest. That is the unmistakable hallmark of an auction where the objects caused all the excitement, not the frantic efforts of some \"public affairs department\" issuing press releases."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/12/business/international-briefs-spanish-buyer-gets-control-of-chile-utility.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-05-12", "snippet": "Endesa SA, top energy company in Spain, buys control of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad SA, Chile's biggest generator of electricity, clinching two-year, $4.8 billion quest to be dominant force in nation's power business and broaden Endesa's reac...", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Spanish Buyer Gets Control of Chile Utility", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Spanish Buyer Gets Control of Chile Utility", "body_text": " **********Endesa S.A., the top energy company in Spain, bought control of Chile's biggest generator of electricity yesterday, clinching a two-year, $4.8 billion quest to be the dominant force in the nation's power business and broaden Endesa's reach in Latin America. **********Endesa, through its Chilean unit Enersis, spent $1.86 billion, or 360 pesos a share, for 30 percent of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. on the Santiago stock exchange.

The bombing has provided those officers and the Serb leader with a common enemy, NATO. **********''The 'rally round the flag' effect in Serbia has been profound,'' said a Government official who has been studying the Balkans for a decade and attributes the change in army morale to the NATO bombing. ''It is not Slobo's war. It is the army defending the country.'' **********Despite public assertions that the bombing is going well, intelligence reports provide a far less sanguine assessment. Longtime observers of Yugoslavia in the American Government said in a series of interviews that the Yugoslav Army in Kosovo had escaped crippling materiel damage and significant casualties by dispersing its units well before bombs began to demolish their bases, barracks and fuel depots. **********The NATO campaign has also had the unwanted consequence of helping to restore the Yugoslav Army to the respected position that it enjoyed before the violent collapse of the Yugoslav federation began in 1991. Then the army was the primary glue holding Tito's multinational union together. As such, it was systematically weakened and humiliated by Mr. Milosevic to suit his nationalist ends -- until NATO's bombing changed his defense needs. **********The campaign has had only ''a marginal effect'' in diminishing the capacity of Yugoslav contingents to force ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo or carry out attacks against insurgents from the Kosovo Liberation Army, one official said. **********The Supreme NATO Commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, insisted in Brussels this week that the bombing had hobbled Yugoslav air defenses and was wearing away the resources of Mr. Milosevic's armed forces. But General Clark also acknowledged that despite the bombing, ''you might actually find out that he's strengthened his forces in there.'' **********American officials in Washington went considerably farther this week. They characterized as ''greatly exaggerated'' claims by Western leaders and NATO commanders that the bombing had damaged Yugoslav Army morale and hampered the ability to conscript troops. **********In Serbia, the army's image seems to have soared, most noticeably in  Belgrade. Many capital residents  had lost respect for the military because of its failures in unpopular ethnic conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia. But the army is now regarded as the defender of the nation. **********''Yugoslav males did not want to get sucked into the fights in Croatia or Bosnia,'' said an American military official who has long experience in the region. ''But indications are that young men are responding to the draft now and in significantly higher numbers than in the past. After five weeks of bombing in Kosovo, they are saying to themselves, 'Gosh, we are still standing.' It is easy to march to the drum if you don't think you are going to get killed.'' **********NATO and Pentagon commanders maintain that the air war is slowly but steadily taking apart the Yugoslav military. They say the Air Force has been disabled and essentially grounded, especially after strikes overnight against aircraft found at an airfield in Montenegro. They concede that the Yugoslav Army is holding up relatively well, but pledge that the intensifying campaign will grind away its forces and morale. **********''If they're not feeling it yet to the full extent, they will in time,'' a senior American military officer said. ''These are hearty people. They're used to a certain amount of suffering. You're not going to crush their morale in 30 days. They're going to have feel some real pain before they collapse.'' **********A factor in the army's success is that its commanders knew that they would have to absorb punishment and, the experts said, they prepared well for it. **********When the bombardment began on March 24, the Yugoslav Army had built up its forces in and around Kosovo. It relied on a large number of reservists and conscripts to fill out a force of 40,000, including 24,000 army troops and 16,000 military police officers. **********The initial barrages focused almost exclusively on air defenses. By the time that NATO turned to army targets, including barracks, staging areas and headquarters, the those complexes had been emptied. **********NATO and the Pentagon, one officer said, now believe that five weeks of bombing have caused casualties that number only ''in the hundreds.'' **********By the time General Clark asked for and received approval to intensify the strikes at the end of last month, the army and police units had routed the Albanians from most Kosovo villages and towns. **********Then they hunkered down. Some have dug into defensive positions along the Kosovo borders with Albania and Macedonia. But most have dispersed, moving in relatively small units that are much harder for NATO's high-flying planes to strike. **********''They're hiding their vehicles whenever they can, staying under cover, staying relatively immobile --  No. 1 to cover themselves from air strikes and, No. 2, to conserve fuel,'' a senior military official said. **********Last week, the Pentagon estimated that NATO attacks had destroyed 10 to 20 percent of the 300 tanks that the Yugoslav Army has in Kosovo. To put it another way, that leaves 80 to 90 percent intact, by the Pentagon's count. **********Although officials say the attacks have limited Yugoslavia's ability to mount effective military operations, the army does not have to mount offenses, at this point, having completed its campaign in Kosovo. **********It simply has to hold on to the defensive positions that it has on the ground, which it could do indefinitely, as long as the army's soldiers remain motivated, despite the destruction of fixed targets like headquarters and barracks, officials said. **********''It will be a while before you have any wear and tear on the foot soldier,'' a senior military officer said. ''It's hard to do that with air power alone. That's the lesson of Vietnam. We pounded Vietnam and we never did stop the supplies along the Ho Chi Minh trail.'' **********The Yugoslav armed forces, although badly overmatched, have effectively used churches, schools and hospitals to shield troops and equipment against strikes by pilots who are under orders to avoid killing civilians. **********''They've taken their strengths and applied them against our weaknesses,'' a former Western military attache to Belgrade said. ''They know our loathing to lose pilots, and they've used their air defenses in a way that exploits that.'' **********Intelligence reports indicate that the army is still able to dispatch fuel to its forces, although there are widespread shortages and rationing for civilians. Although the railway and bridge destruction has made transporting fuel much more difficult, two senior defense officials said the army was still shipping gasoline in small convoys of six-axle trucks, bypassing destroyed routes or building makeshift river crossings. **********The ability to improvise and endure underscores how the war has revitalized the army officer corps. **********Many officers have long grumbled about and, in some cases, flatly opposed the wars that Mr. Milosevic prosecuted in Croatia and in Bosnia. In the course of those conflicts in the early 90's, he shifted resources from the army, which has historically seen its mission as one of protecting the nation from outside aggression, to the more loyal and more pliable Serbian police. **********Police officers are now significantly better paid and have better housing than army officers. The changes caused enormous morale problems among an officer corps that plucked its recruits from villages, trained them in guerrilla warfare in special schools and largely insulated them from the country's chronic economic problems. **********Mr. Milosevic also purged scores of senior army officers to find generals who were willing to command troops that work with the police in savage attacks on civilians. Midlevel army officers have long questioned the professionalism of the loyalists, while quietly voicing doubts to Western military officers about the future of the army. **********But American Government experts on the region said this week that the bombing of Yugoslavia had silenced the grumbling and erased the doubts, at least for now, while handing the army a mission that officers perceive as legal and just. **********''Either by dumb luck or a stroke of genius, Milosevic has given the army a direction,'' said the American military official who spent time in the region. ''Militaries respond well to crises. When you talk to senior Yugoslav Army officers, they always speak of the Constitution. They will talk about defending their borders against external threats and defending the country against internal enemies. It is not much of a stretch for the army to take the situation on the ground in Kosovo and feel they are doing the right thing.'' **********Partly as a result of that, the army appears to have moved to the dominant command position in the war. **********''The NATO campaign has put the Yugoslav Army in first place in the institutional command for the first time this decade,'' said James Gow, a specialist on the Yugoslav Army who teaches war studies at Kings College in London. **********Military analysts, in and out of the United States Government, voice no doubts that a large NATO ground force could make short work of the out-of-date tanks and artillery pieces that would be the pillars of the Yugoslav Army defense."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/04/business/vencor-misses-debt-payment-raising-question-of-its-survival.html": {"writer_name": "Milt Freudenheim", "pub_date": "1999-05-04", "snippet": "Vencor Inc misses debt payment, raising question about its survival; Vencor says it will not pay $14.8 million due in interest on $300 million of notes that mature in 2005; company, battered by Medicare cutbacks and heavy financial losses, is tryi...", "word_count": 585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Vencor Misses Debt Payment, Raising Question of Its Survival", "print_headline": "Vencor Misses Debt Payment, Raising Question of Its Survival", "body_text": " **********Vencor Inc., one of several troubled nursing home chains, missed a payment on its debt yesterday, providing new fodder for investor concerns about its ability to survive. **********The company, which said last month that its survival was an issue, said yesterday that it would not pay $14.8 million due in interest on $300 million of notes that mature in 2005. **********Battered by Medicare cutbacks and heavy financial losses, Vencor, which is based in Louisville, Ky., is trying to negotiate new terms from banks and Ventas Inc., a real estate investment trust that retained almost all the properties when Vencor  split in two early last year. **********With yesterday's announcement, Vencor said it had opened a 35-day period before the banks could demand repayment and force it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy law, an action that could also push Ventas to seek bankruptcy protection. The banks had already set a deadline of May 28 for Vencor to comply with the terms of its loans. **********Vencor said last month in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had a deficit of $683 million in working capital. It reported a loss of more than $600 million in the fourth quarter of 1998. Medicare officials have demanded the return of $90 million that the Government said were overcharges. **********Shares of Vencor, which have lost most of their value this year, fell 6.25 cents yesterday, to 87.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange; shares of Ventas fell 12.5 cents, to $4.375. Bonds of Vencor have plunged 82 percent since January. They were bid yesterday at about 15.5 cents on the dollar. **********Analysts said the crux of the problems at Vencor, one of the nation's largest operators of nursing homes and hospitals for long-term patients, was the refusal of a co-founder, W. Bruce Lunsford, to reduce the rents the company pays. Mr. Lunsford, who resigned as Vencor's chief executive in January, still holds that post at Ventas, which holds the leases on most Vencor facilities. **********''It's not looking good for Vencor,'' said Lori M. Price, a health care analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer. She said the banks would probably act to protect their stake unless Mr. Lunsford agreed to rent concessions. **********But another analyst who specializes in troubled companies said that Mr. Lunsford had strong reasons to keep Vencor afloat. He added that other nursing home operators would also insist on low rental terms because most of the industry is struggling with cuts in Medicare. **********The analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that if Vencor foundered, Ventas would be stuck with more than $200 million it had guaranteed for leases that Vencor has with other landlords. **********A spokesman for Vencor refused to comment yesterday. Officials at Ventas did not reply to messages requesting comment. **********Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said the ''most logical thing'' would be for Vencor and Ventas to merge back into one company, which would ''give them the resources to pay all their debt and lease obligations without invoking Chapter 11.'' **********The ''least logical,'' he said, would be to end up in bankruptcy court. **********Vencor operates 60 hospitals, 309 nursing homes with 40,000 licensed beds, and related service businesses in 46 states. **********Changes in Medicare payments virtually crippled the formerly lucrative business of providing contract therapists and other specialized workers to many small nursing homes. Under the new system, which took effect last summer, Medicare typically pays a flat amount for each nursing home patient instead of paying an added fee for each service the patient receives."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/29/business/sec-charges-68-companies-and-individuals-with-accounting-fraud.html": {"writer_name": "Floyd Norris", "pub_date": "1999-09-29", "snippet": "Securities and Exchange Commission files charges against 68 companies and individuals, who are accused of accounting fraud at 15 public companies; Fran Tarkenton, National Football League quarterback who became computer software entrepreneur, is o...", "word_count": 861, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C.

Mr. Tarkenton was one of 11 chief executives named in the complaints. **********In another case, Robert M. Cankes of Franklin Lakes, N.J., the former president of Christian Dior Perfumes, the American subsidiary of the French company owned by LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., settled charges relating to accounting fraud at Model Imperial, a perfume wholesale concern and Dior customer. Mr. Cankes agreed to pay a $50,000 penalty and to an injunction barring him from future violations of the securities laws. **********The charges were filed exactly one year after Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman, warned that the S.E.C. would step up enforcement actions against what he viewed as abuses of the financial reporting system. **********''Collectively, these cases give you a cookbook for cooking the books,'' said Richard H. Walker, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director. They included companies accused of reporting nonexistent assets as well as those accused of claiming phony sales or reporting that expenses were lower than they really were. **********Mr. Tarkenton was accused of directing a scheme in 1993 and 1994 to overstate the revenues and profits of Knowledgeware by recording sales to distributors while assuring the customers that they would not have to pay unless they were able to resell the software. The S.E.C. said the company did that to convince investors that it was making a comeback. **********In 1994, Knowledgeware was acquired by Sterling Software. The amount of stock paid was adjusted down after Sterling learned that many of the accounts receivable could not be collected. **********A lawyer for Mr. Tarkenton, a quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings and the New York Giants from 1961 through 1978, said Mr. Tarkenton was ''pleased to have this matter behind him'' and had neither admitted nor denied the allegations. He said Mr. Tarkenton, who now runs a company in Atlanta that helps businesses get on the Internet, would not discuss the charges. **********As part of the settlement, he agreed to an injunction barring him from violating securities laws in the future, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and disgorge $54,187, the amount of a bonus he was paid as a result of the phony profit figures. Interest will be added to the disgorgement penalty. **********Mr. Levitt has warned that anyone involved in accounting irregularities faces possible charges, and in the Knowledgeware case charges were brought against 11 people, ranging down to regional sales managers. Nine of the executives settled, while two sales managers are fighting the accusations. **********In the Model Imperial case, the S.E.C. said the company laundered money used to make payments to an individual, now deceased, who was not identified, for the purpose of obtaining supplies of perfume. Mr. Cankes, the former Dior official, was accused of lying to auditors when he said he was not aware of those payments, and not disclosing that he had been given money by the individual who has since died. A lawyer for Mr. Cankes said that neither he nor his client, who settled without admitting or denying the allegations, would comment. **********The S.E.C. charged that officials of the Itex Corporation, a company in the barter business, falsified its profits and made $7.7 million in insider trading profits. The officials are fighting the charges. **********Other S.E.C. cases involved two finance companies, each of which has since filed for bankruptcy, that were said to have falsified profits when they were highfliers on Wall Street. The companies, Mercury Finance and First Merchants Acceptance Corporation, specialized in loans to persons with poor credit records. **********The S.E.C. said that officials of First Merchants, some of who are fighting the accusations, had employed such techniques as using company checks to make payments so that customer accounts would not appear to be delinquent, and classifying some cars as repossessed even though the company could not find either the car or the borrower. It charged a former Mercury official, who is fighting the allegations, with falsifying records to conceal the fact that revenues were falling. **********While most of those charged in the cases were executives or employees of the companies whose books were said to have been falsified, in two cases the S.E.C. named the wives of defendants as well, arguing that they had benefited from money received by their husbands. **********The S.E.C. also made clear that it would go after company officials who deceived outside auditors about business their companies did with companies that were suspected of cooking their books. **********In a case involving the Computone Corporation, a software company said to have falsified its books from 1993 to 1997, charges were filed against Michael L. Glaser, the president of CYMA Systems, a customer. Mr. Glaser, who is fighting the charges, was said to have ordered a subordinate to lie to auditors about whether CYMA had actually placed a large order with Computone.

Smith, who has recently dedicated much of his professional life to uncovering what he sees as privacy violations arising from software flaws and e-commerce schemes. **********The Internet pioneer is Brewster Kahle, founder of the Amazon subsidiary, Alexa Internet. Alexa, based in San Francisco, developed the data-collection software in question, which is being tested for use with Amazon's forthcoming zBubbles comparison-shopping service. **********The software, now available only in a trial version and only on the Alexa Web site, monitors which sites a consumer visits, looks for patterns shared by many individual shoppers and then aggregates information about the collective navigation of Web users. As a result, it is designed to continuously learn about shopping behavior and improve the quality of information it makes available to consumers. **********On Tuesday, Mr. Smith filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission in which he said that his examination of the operation of the Alexa software had disclosed that it was able to gather far more personal data about consumers than Amazon tells customers it is collecting. **********Mr. Smith, who earlier this year drew widespread attention to the privacy practices of a number of large Internet companies including the Microsoft Corporation and RealNetworks, said he had found that Alexa programs occasionally pass on personal information including names, postal addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses. They also gather information about the things people search for and pass all this data to centralized computers operated by Alexa. **********''I believe that the transmission of this personal data is a breach of the zBubbles License and Usage Agreement,'' Mr. Smith asserted in a letter to Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon. ''In addition, the software may also violate a number of federal laws including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.'' **********In a telephone interview, Mr. Kahle defended the Alexa technology, saying that though some information was unavoidably collected from Web surfers, the important point was that the information was not stored permanently and was not used to connect Web activity to an individual by name. ''The standard that we're attempting to uphold,'' Mr. Kahle (pronounced KAIL) said, ''is that if a government agency were to come and subpoena us and ask, 'Where was an individual going on the Web before he bombed the Federal building?' we'd be able to say, 'We don't know.' '' **********At the center of the confrontation is an Internet privacy issue that is being bitterly disputed in Washington: whether the good intentions of a corporation are enough to protect individual privacy. **********''What is important about what Richard's identified here,'' said James X. Dempsey, staff counsel for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington-based lobbying group, is how easily Web sites can collect pieces of data that ''come to include information that most people would consider personal.'' **********Mr. Kahle, who had previously designed information-retrieval software at Thinking Machines Inc. and WAIS Inc., two companies he helped to found, started Alexa Internet in 1996. Since being acquired by Amazon earlier this year, Alexa has focused on developing the retail giant's zBubbles service. **********The Alexa technology tries to offer online shoppers improved guidance on how to retrieve information about goods and services. It does this by studying the paths followed by many Web surfers so that individual consumers can benefit from an aggregation of shopping experiences. At the same time, the company states on its Web site that it does not link individual identity to Web activity. Mr. Smith says this discrepancy intentionally misleads customers. **********Mr. Kahle said the operation of the Alexa software reflected his own struggle for more than a decade over the potential privacy issues raised by information-retrieval technology. **********In 1992, Mr. Kahle wrote a paper, ''Ethics of Digital Librarianship,'' on librarians' responsibility to keep personal data private. Foreshadowing the very criticism he now faces, he  wrote, ''At this point this is not a problem since few servers are of a personal nature yet, but as the system grows to include entertainment, employment, health and other servers, it is easy to imagine the types of information that will be accessible through operating such a server.'' **********Mr. Smith argues that despite policy statements published on both the Amazon and Alexa Web sites, most users are not fully aware of the nature of the information being sent to the Alexa Web servers. **********That is because Web sites are increasingly becoming huge databases that gather personal information and use it to tailor content and advertising to individual consumers based on such items as address, gender, age and wealth. A byproduct of that trend is that universal resource locators, or URL's, as Web page addresses are known, increasingly contain personal information the sites have gathered. **********''One of the problems is that all of this stuff is very slippery,'' Mr. Smith said. ''I respect Brewster's ethics, but what happens if he leaves? There are no legal protections on the Web.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/23/world/biotechnology-treaty-stalls-as-us-and-developing-nations-quarrel.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1999-02-23", "snippet": "Impasse develops in talks in Cartagena, Colombia, on global biotechnology treaty to reduce risks to environment that could result from introduction of genes from different species into plants, animals or microorganisms; biggest split is over wheth...", "word_count": 567, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Biotechnology Treaty Stalls as U.S. and Developing Nations Quarrel", "print_headline": "Biotechnology Treaty Stalls as U.S. and Developing Nations Quarrel", "body_text": " **********Negotiations to forge a global biotechnology safety treaty have hit a stalemate here over sharp disagreements between the United States and most developing countries, raising the prospect that the talks could fail. **********The talks, which have been under way for more than a week, are to end on Tuesday, and it is not unusual in such negotiations for breakthroughs to occur at the 11th hour. **********But several days of intense negotiations have failed to make much headway. **********''The protocol is very ill and in the hospital,'' Rafe Pomerance, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Environment and Development, said today. **********The Biosafety Protocol, as it is called, would regulate the shipment between countries of organisms that have been altered by genetic engineering.

Shortly before he left, a prominent opposition journalist, Slavko Curuvija, was shot dead in the street after being accused on state television of being a traitor. The Government news media and pro-Milosevic politicians made the same charge against Mr. Djindjic. **********At the airport, Mr. Djindjic told reporters he had flown into Belgrade on Montenegrin Airlines, rather than drive through Serbia in a private car, so that Mr. Milosevic's police could not arrest him away from the glare of television cameras. He arrived from Montenegro, the small, independence-minded republic that with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia. **********Mr. Djindjic said he believed that the opposition movement here had only a matter of months to force Mr. Milosevic from power before world attention wandered away from the Balkans. **********''We have not too much time,'' Mr. Djindjic said. ''If we have Mr. Milosevic in power after six months, it will be too late. The attention of the international community will focus on us maybe three or four months more.'' **********The Serbian Orthodox Church has called for Mr. Milosevic's resignation, but it was not clear today how many of its priests had used their pulpits to preach on that theme. Serbian opposition parties are almost unanimous in wanting Mr. Milosevic replaced but are bitterly divided over almost everything else. **********Besides the threat of being imprisoned by courts that Mr. Milosevic controls, Mr. Djindjic is facing daunting political problems inside the fractured opposition movement. **********He has been criticized by other opposition leaders for fleeing the country at a time of national crisis. Some of that criticism has come from inside his own Democratic Party, which he helped found and of which is president. **********A number of political analysts here say his standing as an opposition leader has been weakened by his decision not to stay with the people of Serbia as they were being bombed. **********Mr. Djindjic said today that he had been of more use to the opposition movement and to the future of Serbia by getting out of the country and lobbying European governments to give aid to individual cities where opposition to Mr. Milosevic was strong. **********The United States and many European countries have said that until Mr. Milosevic is removed from power, they will give only relief assistance to Serbia but will not help rebuild roads and bridges. **********Mr. Djindjic must also deal with the refusal of Vuk Draskovic, leader of the largest single opposition party, to join with smaller opposition parties in the Alliance for Change, an umbrella group that is staging anti-Milosevic rallies around the country. **********Mr. Draskovic, who accuses Mr. Djindjic of cowardice for fleeing during the war, has said that the time is not right for street demonstrations and that he wants to work from ''within the system'' to force Mr. Milosevic from power. **********Asked if the opposition can succeed without Mr. Draskovic, a flamboyant politician who has proven able to bring tens of thousands of people into the streets, Mr. Djindjic said popular disgust with Mr. Milosevic did not depend on the personality of anyone in the opposition. **********''I think the feeling of the people is that they want change,'' Mr. Djindjic said. ''They cannot accept compromise. Those parties that cannot accept that should leave the political scene.'' **********Mr. Djindjic said it was not he who was taking a risk by returning to Serbia, but rather Mr. Milosevic who, by staying on in power, risked his life. **********''The best solution for him would to go to The Hague,'' Mr. Djindjic said, referring to the International War Crimes Tribunal that meets there.

This article is for those of us who still do our returns using nothing but a pen, our own brainpower and maybe some correction fluid. **********The Internal Revenue Service hates us, because penmanship in this country isn't what it used to be and because the processing of millions of smudgy tax returns is cumbersome. So eager is the I.R.S. to have us file by computer that its World Wide Web site (www.irs.ustreas.gov) provides links to private companies offering electronic filing services. **********Only about a quarter of all tax returns will be electronically filed this year, but it seems like a lot more, thanks to the Irritating Techno-Bragging Phenomenon, which infects nearly everyone who masters some new bit of technology. The Wright Brothers didn't brag as much as some people who have just managed to file a 1040 from a laptop. Louis Pasteur didn't brag as much. **********If I seem bitter, it's because my kind and I are under siege. **********''This is a kind of landmark time in the sense that the breadth of public awareness on tax filing and the breadth of public acceptance of Internet commerce have come together,'' said Randy Tullos, chief executive of the Securetax.com Web site of Universal Tax Systems, where people can file on line for a modest fee. Two years ago, when Securetax was new, the company filed 7,000 returns; this year, the figure is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands. **********The I.R.S. has said that by 2007, it ''wants to do business electronically with 80 percent of U.S. taxpayers.'' Of course, it cannot order us to file by computer, though one can imagine subtle pressures. (''We notice, Mr. Genzlinger, that you had a bit of correction fluid on your 1984 Schedule A. Are you aware of the penalties for altering Federal documents?'') **********Yet thinking people don't rush into things. So I have compiled this objective analysis, weighing pen and paper against E-filing in crucial areas: **********ACCURACY -- The I.R.S. and filing services love to trumpet the mistakes we hand-filers make. Electronic filing uses the computer for calculations, and most programs raise caution flags if you have forgotten a form or tried to depreciate your spouse. **********But accuracy may be overrated. Peter Crabb, a psychology professor at Pennsylvania State University in Abington, has thought a lot about the skills we humans are losing to technology. Mathematics tops his list. **********''Simple mathematical skills are just going right out the window,'' he said. Having a tax program do our addition only encourages this. Our returns may be more accurate, but we're getting lazier. And if we can no longer do the math ourselves, he asked, ''how are we going to understand if we're getting ripped off?'' **********And accuracy works both ways. A teen-ager in Dunkirk, N.Y., was once expecting a refund of $23. Instead, he received $555,555. If you E-filers want to pass up your chance at $555,555, that's fine by me; it just improves the odds for the rest of us. **********Advantage: Paper. **********SECURITY -- People in the E-tax business are extremely concerned about keeping criminals and precocious 11-year-olds from hacking into your tax return. Thus, E-filers may be asked to use secret numbers, passwords, decoder rings or backward writing that has to be read with a mirror. **********But this ignores a broader danger, which I call the Kite in a Box Effect. Try this test: In a large box, place one 20-foot-long rope, one extension cord and one kite with string. Store the box in your garage for five years. Open. Rope, cord and kite string will be hopelessly tangled together, even though no one has touched the box. **********Electronic communications are like that box. We've got telephones,  pagers and a few zillion other things all sending out electronic signals. Sooner or later, tangling will occur. Do I want my ''income or (loss) from tax-shelter farm activities'' marching across someone's beeper? **********Advantage: Paper. **********SPEED -- All right, for crying out loud, you get your refund in days, not weeks, if you E-file. Big deal. **********Advantage: E-filing. **********PHYSICAL SAFETY -- In 25 years of doing my taxes by hand, I have never been seriously injured. By contrast, the Web site of the Consumer Product Safety Commission contains recent recall notices for seven computer products and 11 surge protectors. These notices use phrases like ''fire, shock and electrocution hazards.'' Given the already natural pairing of ''death and taxes,'' it seems like an accident waiting to happen. **********Advantage: Paper. **********PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS -- Clearly, we humans are in danger of being downsized right out of the tax equation. We can already file electronically. The I.R.S. already offers to deposit your refund directly into your bank account. Turbotax and the others can already jump-start your return for next year, by grafting information onto it from this year's. It's not much of a leap to having your employer, bank and other institutions send their forms directly into the I.R.S. computer, which would fill out your return automatically and make the appropriate deposit or withdrawal from your bank account. The tax system would become a perpetual-motion machine; the taxpayer would be expendable. **********Mr. Tullos of Securetax is not worried. ''That is potentially where it can go,'' he said, ''but where I differ from a lot of people is the pace at which I think it's going to go there.'' **********For one thing, he said, public resistance would be too great -- people would balk at giving up all control. **********Professor Crabb would resist. Tax time, he says, is a chance for personal stock-taking. ''When you do your taxes, if you do them by hand, you get a mental model of what your income is and where it goes,'' he said. So the less automated, the better. **********More cosmically, he's worried that we too readily turn our lives over to experts and technologies. ''It's just this chain of trust that we enter into, and we're helpless,'' he said. **********Advantage: Paper. **********COUNTERINTUITIVE CONCLUSION -- Despite the clear superiority of paper, I'm trying E-filing this year. Why? Because the I.R.S. says it will contribute to the public good, and we Luddites are nothing if not patriotic. **********My biggest fear, though, is that when I get to the last E-page, where you tell the computer to send the documents on their way, that final on-screen box will say, ''Submit.'' **********My likely response: ''Never!''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/04/business/outlook-1999-markets-investing-patents-new-technology-revives-old-debate.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1999-01-04", "snippet": "Debate over whether methods of doing business over Internet should be patentable promises to dominate patent industry in 1999; Supreme Court is expected to decide in coming weeks whether to review July appeals court ruling that affirmed and broade...", "word_count": 585, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Technology Revives Old Debate", "print_headline": "OUTLOOK 1999: MARKETS & INVESTING -- PATENTS; New Technology Revives Old Debate", "body_text": " **********The technologies may be new, but the debate that promises to dominate the patent industry this year dates from at least the days of Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell. **********The debate now centers around whether methods of doing business over the Internet, known as electronic commerce, should be patentable. **********''A hundred years ago, the Supreme Court struggled with the same issues that we struggle with today -- how to make our laws responsive to new technologies,'' said Rick Nydegger, a patent attorney who represents the Microsoft Corporation and other companies and teaches intellectual property law at Brigham Young University. **********''The question that is being raised with E-commerce was raised with the telegraph and telephone,'' Mr. Nydegger said. ''At the time, no one had envisioned using electricity as a way to communicate.'' **********The Supreme Court is expected to decide in the coming weeks whether to review a July ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that, according to some patent experts, represents a potential windfall for those who were among the first to file electronic commerce patent applications. Although no statistics are available, many experts speculate that the case, State Street Bank v. Signature Financial, has set off a stampede of new electronic commerce applications to the Patent Office. **********The State Street ruling affirmed and broadened earlier court decisions as well as Patent Office guidelines on software patents, including electronic commerce patents. **********''In the mid-1980's, when I used to lecture on software patents, I would get laughed out of the room,'' said Robert Greene Sterne, a patent attorney in Washington. ''I'd get booed. I'd be called a capitalist pig by software entrepreneurs who thought it should be owned by the masses.'' **********Now, Mr. Sterne notes, filings from companies like Microsoft, which initially rejected the idea of software patents, are tumbling in. **********Gregory Aharonian, a patent-search consultant, has long been critical of the quality of the nation's software patents, and he is no more sanguine about electronic commerce patents. ''The E-commerce patents are about as valid as software patents in general, which aren't very valid to begin with,'' he said. **********Mr. Aharonian contends that the Patent Office does not have the proper resources to research what is known as ''prior art'' -- previous inventions that are similar to a new technology. For example, he says, a score of software patents have been issued recently covering solutions to the Year 2000 problem, but none of them mention a paper on the subject produced by I.B.M. in 1986. Such oversights make a patent more vulnerable to legal challenges. **********''It's extremely relevant,'' he said. ''But none of the issued Y2K patents have cited it. That's just gross failure.'' **********Q. Todd Dickinson, acting commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office, says that his agency is doing an admirable job and adds that 20 new patent examiners have been hired recently for the division responsible for reviewing most electronic commerce patents. **********How successful have patent-wielding companies been in licensing their electronic commerce technologies so far? It's hard to say: patent licenses are not publicly recorded. **********Mr. Sterne, who represents several dozen software companies, says patents are important for small enterprises mostly because they help attract investment capital and provide momentum for initial stock offerings. **********''Patents are having a major impact on financing,'' he said. ''The investment banking community, the venture capital community and the angel investing community are becoming very interested in intellectual property.'' **********But Mr. Aharonian remains skeptical about the value of electronic commerce patents. ''Until they end up in court, nobody's going to know whether they're valid,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/08/world/crisis-balkans-danube-nato-bombing-bridges-yugoslavia-disrupts-trade-europe-asia.html": {"writer_name": "Edmund Andrews", "pub_date": "1999-04-08", "snippet": "Bombing by NATO of bridges along Danube in Yugoslavia strands scores of freighters from Budapest to the Black Sea and paralyzes shipments of oil, iron ore and farm goods to Western Europe; disruption will have limited impact on Yugoslavia because ...", "word_count": 675, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NATO Bombing of Bridges in Yugoslavia Disrupts Trade on Europe-Asia Link", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE DANUBE; NATO Bombing of Bridges in Yugoslavia Disrupts Trade on Europe-Asia Link", "body_text": " **********The  bombing by NATO of bridges along the Danube in Yugoslavia has stranded scores of freighters from Budapest to the Black Sea and paralyzed shipments of oil, iron ore and farm goods to Western Europe. **********The disruption will have a limited impact on Yugoslavia because its trade with Western Europe is negligible, but it is likely to be painful for Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine. **********About 60 ships, most loaded with farm produce like wheat and corn, are now stuck in Mohacs, Hungary, because they cannot get past the bombed-out bridges to their destinations in Romania and Bulgaria. **********Dozens of southbound barges are also stranded. In Austria, a leading producer of construction materials has been cut off from its Romanian cement suppliers. Another company in Vienna is waiting anxiously on a bargeload of sunflower seeds, used for their oil, that has been blocked from leaving Romania. **********''The whole Danube waterway has been blocked because of the bridges that were completely damaged in Yugoslavia,'' said Mihaly Muller, a spokesman for the Hungarian Transportation Ministry. **********The river is a major transportation link that flows 1,770 miles from the Black Forest in southern Germany through Austria to the Balkans and the Black Sea. **********But the attack on Yugoslavia has sliced the Danube in two, cutting off downstream countries like Romania and Bulgaria from their upstream markets in Western Europe. **********''Until last week, we had fairly unrestricted transit all the way through to the Black Sea,'' said Karl Hillerer, a top manager at the Danube Shipping Company in Passau, Germany. ''Now that has all stopped.'' **********Despite the Balkan wars, Danube freight shipping has been climbing steadily. Romania ships a wide variety of commodities, particularly oil and iron ore. Bulgaria has built up a business in ''roll on-roll off'' traffic, in which loaded trucks are put onto ferries, carried to Austria or Germany and then driven to their destinations. The river has also been important for shipments of oil to the West. **********European companies are scrambling for alternative routes. **********''This is an added burden that will weigh down the whole region,'' said Gustav Poschalkote, chairman of Express International Spedition, a shipping company in Vienna that normally sends more than 2,000 ships a year down the river. ''It is not only trade with Western Europe; these countries also carry out a lot of trading with each other.'' **********Shipping executives said that detours exist, but that they are more expensive and slower. Many products can be transferred from ships to trains, though no one is quite sure about train capacity in Romania, and railroads are more expensive than barges. Some could be shipped from the Black Sea through the Mediterranean and Adriatic, but that route would be several times longer. **********The disruptions have already had an impact on many companies in Austria, long a center for business with Central European countries. **********Lasselsberger Holdings International G.m.b.H., a construction-materials company based in Worth, has been importing cement from Romania for five years. Now it has several shipments stranded in Izmajil, near the Black Sea. **********''We've had delays time and again, but we have never come to a complete interruption in the traffic,'' said Anton Lasselsberger, the general manager. ''We're studying the alternatives, but we can't say yet how much damage there might be. The big question is how long this will last.'' **********Voest-Alpine Stahl AG., a major Austrian steel manufacturer on the river at Linz, gets much of its coal and iron ore from Central Europe over the Danube. If deliveries become unreliable, the company may have to depend more heavily on suppliers in other countries. Company executives declined to comment. **********The biggest disruption has been in Hungary, which has an extensive trade with the rest of Central Europe. **********At Ferroport, one of Budapest's biggest freight-forwarding companies, executives predict that the city's shipping volumes will decline by half as a result of the blockage. **********''It seems that we have lost one of our legs,'' Laszlo Mester, managing director of Ferroport, said in a telephone interview.

''We're getting dangerously close to the point when world leaders take a look at what Saddam Hussein has done and people think they can thumb their nose at us,'' he said. ''Maybe Milosevic has decided that if Saddam Hussein can ride it out, 'maybe I can as well.' How many weeks have we been threatening this man?'' **********But Mr. Kasich argued against American involvement, saying: ''I see it as essentially a civil war and something people have been concerned about for centuries. This is not a matter of whose heart bleeds more for innocent people being brutalized or killed. The question is, can a great power have the discipline to define what is in the direct national interest? -- because without the discipline you diminish yourself, and when you diminish yourself the world becomes less secure.'' **********In criticizing Mr. Clinton over foreign policy, Republicans are seizing on one of the few areas in which polls find that people trust their party more than Democrats. Those who oppose American participation may also be playing to an isolationist segment of the Republican primary electorate. **********''They are fighting for their core constituency of right-wing fundamentalists who say, 'Let's stay home and take care of our own, deal with our issues first,' '' said Barbara A. Bardes, a professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati. ''The other Republicans are guarding their bets; you don't want to be on record being really deeply in favor of this because they don't want to get trapped if next week we have video pictures of hundreds of Kosovars massacred in a mass grave.'' **********Republican voters are less supportive of the air strikes than Democrats. A nationwide CBS News Poll conducted Wednesday evening found that while a large majority of Democrats supported the air strikes against Serbia, Republicans and independents were more divided. Among Democrats, 61 percent were in favor of the American involvement; 18 percent were opposed. Republicans were evenly split: 44 percent in support, 41 percent against. **********''The politics of the Republican primary electorate is more isolationist, nationalistic and fundamentalist than the electorate as a whole,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who has worked in Serbia. **********Governor Bush released a statement only after some candidates criticized him for not being forthcoming. ''This is about war and peace and life and death,'' Mr. Buchanan said of Mr. Bush. ''I don't think you can declare a moratorium on discussing matters of this magnitude if you presume to lead the United States of America into the 21st century.'' Mr. Buchanan said he opposed American involvement because ''this is an ugly civil war on the Balkan peninsula where no vital American interests are engaged.'' **********At his news conference, Mr. Bush was vague when asked whether he agreed with Mr. Clinton's rationale for the bombing. ''My question is, 'Is it good for America?' '' he asked. ''And that'll be the question I'll ask should I end up being the President. Right now as Governor, I'm going to go figure out how to get a tax cut through.'' **********In opposing the bombing, Mr. Quayle asserted that had he been President, the nation would not find itself enmeshed in Serbia. ''You have to have credibility when you're sitting down and negotiating,'' he said. ''The United States right now is a paper tiger. Do you really believe you're going to be able to bomb Milosevic into submission? If they think they can, they know a different Milosevic than I do.'' **********Explaining his opposition, Senator Smith said: ''We see here an emotional reaction to a terrible humanitarian crisis. We could have done more to put pressure on Serbia through its neighbors. You can't jump into every civil war that's going on.'' **********While Mr. Forbes also criticized Mr. Clinton, he backed the President's action. ''It's no surprise that Milosevic was going to push the thing and we've let him get away with it,'' he said. ''We could have avoided all of the bloodshed if we had been firmer earlier.'' **********Mr. Alexander said he feared that the President's decision would lead to use of American ground troops. ''If we put forces on the ground,'' he said, ''there is a moral obligation. The President should say we are likely to be there for a long time, and there is a likelihood that we will have to send additional ground forces to protect our peacekeepers.'' **********Several Republicans said they expect to emphasize foreign policy matters like Kosovo in their campaigns. But others conceded that foreign issues have not been particularly pivotal in recent Presidential elections. ''Since the end of the cold war,'' Mr. McCain said, ''most Americans have paid very little, if any, attention. I don't know if this will change or not.'' **********Former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, the only rival to Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, sounded like some of the Republicans. Mr. Bradley backed the bombing but raised what he called ''serious questions'' about the Administration's stewardship of foreign policy. **********''We are escalating our commitment without establishing a clear exit strategy,'' he said. ''As with Bosnia, we run the risk of becoming bogged down in a quagmire whose end we cannot predict or control.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/26/business/patents-viagra-s-success-has-brought-light-second-big-market-for-sexual.html": {"writer_name": "Teresa Riordan", "pub_date": "1999-04-26", "snippet": "Patent and Trademark Office has granted two patents for what seems to be same product: ointment to treat female sexual dysfunction; one patent is given to Dr Michael Wysor and Dr Wanda Drinnon Wysor, other patent is awarded to Vivus, drug company;...", "word_count": 793, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Patents; Viagra's success has brought to light a second big market for sexual dysfunction therapies: women.", "print_headline": "Patents; Viagra's success has brought to light a second big market for sexual dysfunction therapies: women.", "body_text": " **********WITH the recent success of Viagra, the impotence drug for men, a number of companies are scurrying to develop sexual-dysfunction therapies aimed at an even larger market: women. **********A recent article in The Journal of the American Medical Association, for example, reported that 43 percent of women suffer from sexual dysfunction, compared with 31 percent of men. **********''It's potentially a $5-billion-a-year market,'' contends Dr. Michael Wysor, who along with his wife, Dr. Wanda Drinnon Wysor, patented an ointment this month that when applied to the clitoris, the inventors say, can induce multiple orgasms in women. **********Michael Wysor, who is based in Knoxville, Tenn., and who specializes in treating impotence, said of the ointment: ''It increases blood flow tremendously and basically eliminates the need for foreplay. This is going to have an impact equal to that seen with the introduction of the Pill.'' **********The Wysors thought that theirs was the first such patent to be issued, so they were surprised to learn last week that a similar patent had been issued the month before to Vivus, a drug company in Mountain View, Calif. **********The Wysors' patent appears to cover a broad range of hormone-like chemicals called prostaglandins in treating female sexual dysfunction as well as in preventing yeast infections and improving vaginal muscle tone. **********A prostaglandin known as alprostadil is already on the market to treat male impotence. Indeed, Vivus sells a pellet version of alprostadil that is inserted into the tip of the penis. An injectable version of alprostadil is sold by Upjohn under the name of Caverject. Other companies have been developing a cream version, which has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. **********So what advantage would a prostaglandin-based gel have over Viagra, which is being tested for use in women? **********''It's a naturally occurring substance delivered locally, so there is a  very low incidence of systemic side effects,'' said Leland Wilson, president of Vivus. Because Viagra is taken as a pill, he said, it has to circulate in the whole body, ''to the heart, brain, and lungs in order to get to a small area in the genital region.'' **********Vivus thus far has tested its gel only in female cats and rabbits. Though the Wysors have not conducted formal clinical trials, their patent refers to testing done on human volunteers who experienced on  average ''enhanced sexual response in three to four minutes.'' **********What about the similarity between the two patents? Normally, a conflict between pending patent applications is resolved before the patents are issued, in a secret procedure called an ''interference.'' **********''I think the Patent Office goofed here,'' said Michael Ebert, the Wysors' patent lawyer, who is based in New York City. **********Mr. Ebert contended that the Wysors' patent was strong because it was based upon human studies. Officials at Vivus said they were still studying the rival patent but noted that they applied for, and received, their patent before the Wysors did. **********''Ours is a bigger, better and earlier patent,'' said Nina Ferrari, a spokeswoman for Vivus. **********At this point, it is likely that any conflict between the two patents would have to be resolved in court. **********The Wysors received patent 5,891,915. Vivus was awarded patent  5,877,216. **********Pictures Available On Patent Web Site **********Last week, in a ceremony at the Commerce Department, the Patent and Trademark Office demonstrated a new feature of the searchable patent data base on its Web site.

Bond prices fell and the dollar weakened. **********Mr. Greenspan's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee suggested that while the central bank wanted to keep its options open, it was somewhat more inclined to raise rates than to lower them, given that the economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year and has shown signs of considerable momentum in the first two months of this year. **********He told senators that after cutting rates three times last fall, leaving the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks at 4.75 percent, the Federal Reserve now needed to reassess whether current economic conditions justify keeping rates where they are. **********During the time the Fed was cutting rates, the global crisis was threatening to create a credit squeeze in the United States, a threat that has since lessened. Some economists have criticized the Fed's third rate cut last fall as unnecessary given the resilience of the economy and the financial markets, and have speculated that Mr. Greenspan would like to undo it, a surmise that he gave some credence to today. **********''The Federal Reserve must continue to evaluate, among other issues, whether the full extent of the policy easings undertaken last fall to address the seizing-up of financial markets remains appropriate as those disturbances abate,'' Mr. Greenspan said. **********The Fed next meets to review monetary policy on March 30, but analysts said that unless the economy veered markedly in one direction or the other there was little chance of any policy change before late spring or early summer. **********Mr. Greenspan said that after three consecutive years of 4 percent annual growth, the Federal Reserve expects the economy to slow to a more modest growth rate this year, and that as the economy slows any incipient inflationary pressures will remain contained. But the Fed has been forecasting a slowdown for two years, and it has not materialized. On the other hand, as Mr. Greenspan pointed out, neither has inflation. **********Still, Mr. Greenspan did today what central bankers are paid to do: worry about what could go wrong, and provide some assurance that if the economy does go awry he has a plan. **********Mr. Greenspan said he remained concerned about the level of stock prices, which he said were ''high enough to raise questions about whether shares are overvalued,'' especially if companies fail to post the robust earnings investors have come to expect. But he passed up an opportunity to say investors were suffering from ''irrational exuberance,'' answering a question on the topic by saying it is all but impossible to identify a stock market bubble before it has burst. **********''Nobody has questioned at all that the dramatic acceleration that we have seen in some technologies, and the marked increase in productivity and profitability of American businesses, has undoubtedly had a significant impact on underlying prices of all capital assets, including equities,'' Mr. Greenspan said. **********''Whether or not it's gripped by irrational exuberance is an issue that you won't really know for sure except after the fact,'' he said, adding, though, that stock prices were high enough to give him ''concerns.'' **********Mr. Greenspan identified the rapidly growing trade deficit, and its contribution to a large and rising current account deficit, as one of the most notable long-term threats to the nation's economic health. **********''Should the sustainability of the buildup in our foreign indebtedness come into question, the exchange value of the dollar may well decline, imparting pressures on prices in the United States,'' Mr. Greenspan said. **********He quickly added that the trade deficit so far has been a symptom of forces that have proved beneficial, with weak demand from abroad helping to offset the strains on the economy from extremely strong domestic demand even as the strong dollar holds down import prices. **********The Fed chairman said the United States remained ''vulnerable to rapidly changing conditions overseas, which, as we saw last summer, can be transmitted to U.S. markets quickly and traumatically.'' **********The outlook in Russia remains ''troubling,'' he said, while Brazil's outlook is uncertain. Contradicting Japanese officials who say their country's beleaguered economy has hit bottom and is ready to rebound, Mr. Greenspan said Japan was still weakening. **********Mr. Greenspan used much of his prepared testimony to explain the temporary factors that have contributed to the remarkable confluence of strong growth, low unemployment and dormant inflation, and the more fundamental forces reshaping the economy. **********Among the temporary factors, he said, are the steep decline in oil prices and commodity prices generally. But even if those prices begin rising, the economy may prove less susceptible to inflation than it has been in the past, largely because companies are investing heavily in technology and cost-saving equipment, he said. **********Unable to raise prices, and unwilling to pay higher wages, companies have had to cope by improving their productivity, or output per worker, he said. Several factions within the Fed have been debating for the last several years whether the United States is seeing a resurgence in productivity growth after nearly three decades of stagnation, and in his comments today Mr. Greenspan again weighed in on the side of those who think the improvement in productivity is part of a basic improvement in the country's economic outlook. **********''According to rough estimates, labor and capital productivity has risen significantly in the past five years,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''It seems likely that the synergies of advances in laser, fiber optic, satellite and computer technologies with older technologies have enlarged the pool of opportunities to achieve a rate of return above the cost of capital.'' **********Technology, he said, allows companies to be more nimble, ordering parts or raw materials only as needed, restraining costs and increasing production capacity faster than actual output has risen. The process of holding down costs and prices has become self-reinforcing, he said, with workers no longer expecting big wage increases to make up for inflation. **********But lest he be seen as taking his eye off the potential for inflation, Mr. Greenspan added that improved productivity would not keep the country from running short of workers if the economy continued to race along. **********''This worker depletion constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation outlook because it presumably cannot continue for very much longer without putting increasing pressure on labor markets and on costs,'' Mr. Greenspan said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/09/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-09-09", "snippet": "Corn prices fall amid signs that crop suffered less damage than expected from dry spell before harvest began in most states; graph (M)", "word_count": 39, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********CORN FALLS.

So before the real celebrations begin early next year, it's only fair to ask the question: What will bring the good times to an end? **********You can be sure something will. For while there is no end in sight for the current expansion, which began in March 1991, and there is plenty of evidence that the American economy has entered a new era of higher productivity growth than in the 1970's and 80's, that does not mean the business cycle is dead. **********''The mix of growth and inflation looks pretty good to us,'' said Kim Schoenholtz, chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney, the investment banking arm of Citigroup. **********Indeed, Mr. Schoenholtz and his team at Salomon Smith Barney are convinced that the economy has plenty of life in it still. They are probably right. ''But if you want to find reasons to worry,'' he says, ''you can round up the usual suspects.'' **********Ah, the usual suspects. The words made me think not so much of Claude Rains's great line near the end of ''Casablanca,'' as of the 1995 movie that used the phrase as its title and made Kevin Spacey a star. And the echoes from that film are even more apt: Just as Keyser Soze, the hero-villain in ''The Usual Suspects,'' walks away from the mayhem with a fortune, so too the American economy is likely to emerge relatively unscathed from the next downturn, whenever it comes. **********Here's why: There are several clear sources of tension within the economy today. Household debt has risen to record levels, just as it did before nearly every previous recession. The current account deficit -- which requires Americans to sell off assets to pay for all the extra imports we buy -- has soared well past its old peak. Oil prices are on the upswing. And the stock market, by almost any measure, is overvalued, stirring fears that a sharp fall on Wall Street could prompt many affluent Americans, no longer so flush with their winnings, to tighten their belts. **********But consider the suspects one by one. **********As a rule, Americans have never stopped spending on their own merely because their debts reached what seemed like excessive levels. Yes, real consumer spending cannot continue growing at its breathless pace of over 5 percent a year. But even when consumers do take a much-needed breather, a slowdown in spending would almost certainly not be enough to bring the expansion to a halt. It is only after a recession hits and job losses rise that Americans tend to begin repairing their personal balance sheets. **********The one recession sometimes attributed to a spontaneous drop in consumer spending -- the 1990-91 downturn that coincided with the buildup and fighting of the gulf war -- is more logically blamed on the sudden shock of higher oil prices on top of the Federal Reserve's earlier efforts, at the end of the 1980's, to reverse a buildup of inflation. **********Speaking of oil prices, they played a starring role in the recession of 1973-74 (Arab oil embargo), the extended downturn at the beginning of the 1980's (Iranian revolution) and at the time of the gulf war. But each time oil prices took off, they also prompted or helped perpetuate a broader wage-price spiral, forcing the Fed to react by sharply raising interest rates to control inflation. There is no sign in the markets that the latest jump in oil prices, to around $27 a barrel, will have a similarly broad effect. **********And even if higher oil prices, combined perhaps with a drop in the value of the dollar from worries over the big deficits with America's trading partners, caused a flurry of inflation fears, the Fed could probably dampen them with only a modest further tightening of the monetary spigot. **********OF the handful of usual suspects, then, only one, a stock market collapse, probably can spread enough fear to cause a recession by itself. That's clearly worth worrying about -- but remember October 1987 (or October 1998, for that matter) vs. October 1929. The Fed does. **********Policy makers have a clear script to follow in response to panic on Wall Street: flood the markets with cash and bring interest rates down quickly. That may create problems later on, but such moves would certainly limit any damage to the real economy from the financial turmoil. **********So for all these other worries, the real risk to the economy remains the traditional bad guy: price inflation driven by wage gains well in excess of productivity improvements. ''The danger,'' says Robert DiClemente, who watches the American economy for Salomon Smith Barney, ''is that success breeds excess.'' **********Inflation, like Franco, is still dead. But just as in ''The Usual Suspects,'' the least likely suspect could turn out to be the murderer in the end. **********''Keaton once said, 'I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him,' '' Kevin Spacey's character, Verbal Kint, tells the agents investigating the crime. ''Well, I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.'' **********The only thing that should scare us these days is the threat of inflation. Allowed to escape, inflation could kill our remarkably healthy economy just as it is beginning to help those long left out of America's rising prosperity.

In the last 20 years, Nielsen ratings for the United States Open have plummeted from a high of 5.8 in 1981 to a low of 2.3 in 1997; they were 2.8 last year. **********''The Open is competing with Major League Baseball, pro football, college football,'' said Rick Burton, director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center of the Charles H. Lundquist College of Business at the University of Oregon in Eugene. ''And it's got image issues. Its positioning is staid -- it's Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport. They're talented athletes, but they're not very exciting to nontennis aficionados. Tennis needs more people like the Jensen brothers, the Williams sisters, to bring it a distinct personality.'' **********To develop a more dynamic image for the sport, the tennis association hired Fallon McElligott New York City, a unit of Fallon McElligott, which is known for its irreverent advertising. The agency's executive creative director is Jamie Barrett, who previously worked at Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., on advertising for Nike, the pre-eminent sports marketer, which is also famously irreverent. **********Budgeted at a record $2 million, the association's campaign is meant to make the Open ''inclusive to all kinds of fans, not just the hard-core tennis enthusiast,'' said John Gerzema, managing partner of Fallon McElligott New York City. The campaign includes pictures on New York City buses of different groups of people seated in rows of stadium seats; the side of one bus shows a row of society matrons wearing hats and holding tiny dogs while the other side of the bus shows punk rockers. The ads say the Upper East Side and the East Village, respectively, are ''going to the U.S. Open'' and ask, ''Are you?'' **********Advertising appearing in commuter trains in the New York metropolitan area repeats this theme, illustrating it, in one case, with a man who could hardly be described as fit leading a step aerobics class. The copy says the regular step aerobics instructor at Equinox, a Manhattan health club, ''will be out at the U.S. Open next Thursday'' and adds: ''You may want to do the treadmill that day. Almost everyone's going to the U.S. Open. Are you?'' **********On cable, network and local television, the association is running four humorous 30-second spots depicting fictitious tests that compare tennis with various sports: for example, one commercial shows a pair of figure skaters unsuccessfully trying to complete a routine on a hard-surface tennis court. All spots claim nothing beats ''the excitement of U.S. Open tennis.'' **********Like the tennis association, I.B.M. is aiming its U.S. Open advertising at a relatively young group, in this case technologically oriented, Internet-savvy consumers who are potential I.B.M. customers. The advertising is an extension of I.B.M.'s ongoing ''e-business'' campaign, which uses a red ''e'' logo to promote Internet-related products and services. **********I.B.M.'s Open campaign features striking black and white photographs of youngsters playing tennis in New York City streets. Also in each ad are  an inspirational, one-word headline, the red ''e'' logo and a statement that www.usopen.org, the tennis association's Web site, is ''an I.B.M. e-business.''

This threatens to topple the \"magic formula\" of coalition rule among the country's four biggest parties that has existed since 1959. **********The People's Party, whose most visible spokesman is the millionaire industrialist Christoph Blocher, appealed to voters worried about taxes, immigrants and closer ties with the rest of Europe. **********With its clear-cut answers \u2014 which some labeled simplistic and dangerous \u2014 the party was able to consolidate voter support from a number of smaller right-leaning political parties, analysts said. **********\"Blocher has built a bridge between the democrats and those on the extreme right,\" said Frank Meyer, an editorialist for Zurich's Sonntags Blick, who has frequently written in opposition to the industrialist's politics. **********Mr. Blocher, he said, appealed to \"those who have fear of too many foreigners, fear of globalization and fear of Europe. He had a simple message: No.\" **********The People's Party campaigned on claims that too many people were abusing asylum laws by seeking refugee status. Accusations of crime and drug dealing, and fear that jobs were being lost to foreigners were fueled by a large influx of Kosovars who had fled their war-torn province. Many of them had relatives in Switzerland, who have worked here for decades as laborers, but the presence of tens of thousands here led to an anti-foreigner backlash and calls for tightening asylum laws. **********Those fears are tied to closer union with Europe, where member countries must allow free movement of people across borders. There are fears that Switzerland would be swamped by a new wave of immigrants if it joined the European Union. **********\"It's impossible to close the borders,\" said Felix Mueller, a commentator for the Neue Zuercher Zeitung in Zurich. \"There will be some tightening, but basically this is about Swiss identity.\" **********\"It boils down to sending your kids to school and finding out that 60 percent of the other children can't speak German,\" he said, adding that there is a feeling that there are just too many foreigners to integrate. **********Beat Kappeler, who writes for Zurich's Weltewoche weekly, agreed: \"It's a problem in the schools and at work. I don't agree with all his solutions, but Blocher asked the right questions.\" **********The vote also reflected the reflected the deep-seated and continuing reaction to the disclosures about Switzerland's role in World War II, Mr. Mueller believes. \"This is greatly underestimated, especially for the elderly,\" he said. \"There is great anger over this, and that generation helped Blocher build a solid base.\" **********Mr. Blocher has been outspoken against using Swiss funds to establish a foundation for the needy, including Holocaust survivors. **********The People Party's sweep remakes the 200-member lower house of Parliament, where it will be the country's second largest party with 44 seats. **********\"This is undoubtedly the most important shift in the vote and possibly in parliamentary seats in Swiss political history since the introduction of the proportional system 80 years ago,\" wrote the editor of Le Temps newspaper in Geneva. **********His front-page views were side-by-side with a large photograph of Mr. Blocher. **********The future of the country's seven-member governing body, called the Federal Council, is also at stake.

In the second quarter, though, only about $1 of every $4 did, according to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual funds. **********There has been a decline in total net sales, too, though much milder. After a staggering $17.8 billion inflow in the first three months of the year, index funds took in just $12.3 billion in the second quarter, according to AMG. Their portion of new dollars fell more drastically because total net cash flows to the stock mutual funds tracked by AMG doubled in the second quarter. Fund industry officials say the latest figure was depressed slightly by a one-time shift in June of a large amount of money to an indexed portfolio outside the fund industry. **********To be sure, index funds remain popular. Vanguard Group, the index-fund king, took in nearly twice as much money as any other fund family in the first five months of the year, according to the Financial Research Corporation of Boston. **********Index funds are ''still taking in money faster than the average equity fund,'' said Carl Wittnebert, director of research at Trimtabs.com Investment Research in Santa Rosa, Calif. ''It's just not as lopsided as it was a few months back.'' **********The recent slowdown has come as actively managed stock funds have begun beating indexes for the first time in years. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 28.6 percent last year -- twice the return of the average diversified stock fund. And in the first quarter of this year, the S.& P. 500 rose 5 percent, while the average diversified stock fund managed a measly 1.3 percent return. **********But in April, the improving global economy and nosebleed valuations of some of the largest stocks in the S.& P. spurred investors to step up purchases of cyclical stocks and smaller-capitalization shares, providing an easier environment for stockpickers to beat their benchmarks. As a result, about two-thirds of mutual funds topped the S.& P.'s 7.1 percent return in the second quarter, according to Lipper Inc. **********Benefiting from a recent strong performance and continuing contributions from existing shareholders, the giant Magellan fund run by the FMR Corporation's Fidelity Investments arm has set a record; yesterday the assets of the fund, which is closed, hit the $100 billion mark for the first time. **********Robert Adler, AMG's president, is not sure if a shift in performance is the only factor at play or even whether index-fund sales will continue to slow. It would be bad for the stock market if the flows for index funds actually turned negative, he said. **********The figures ''indicate a slowing demand for these funds from the beginning of the year, but clearly the trend is not negative,'' he noted. **********Brian Mattes, a Vanguard spokesman, said: ''If anything is predictable, it is that cash flows follow tremendous performance. Indexing is a long-term strategy and one quarter, or a six-month period, or even a year of relative underperformance against active management is meaningless.

To meet targets, many governments will probably have to pay owners to scuttle vessels, or the governments will have to reduce immense subsidies. **********''The bottom line is that some folks are going to have to find a new job,'' said David Schorr, a fisheries expert at the World Wildlife Fund, adding that politicians will face some tough choices about who is forced out of fishing, and where. **********Even without knowing whether the voluntary effort will work, fishery officials call the plan one of the most significant to address the need to preserve fish stocks. **********''Globally, the problem of overcapacity in the world's fleet is probably the single greatest threat to the world's fish resources,'' said Terry Garcia, chief American delegate to the negotiations. **********''Within the next decade or so, if we do not take steps to address the problem of overcapacity, then the demand for wild fish stocks is going to exceed the supply.'' **********Some experts say this has already occurred. After decades of growth, the catch has leveled off, suggesting that many fish are being caught faster than they can reproduce. **********The new agreement calls for nations to cap their fleets at existing levels and then to scale them back progressively, and to eliminate subsidies to companies that are deemed to overfish. **********Past efforts to control overfishing have focused on strictly regulating the quantity of fish that can be legally caught, the size of fish that may be kept, the length of the fishing season and the type of equipment and nets used. **********But that approach, the nations agreed, is flawed, given the capacity of many fishing fleets to catch more fish than permitted. Increasingly, countries have recognized that they must find ways to cut the industry's capacity. In 1997 fishing vessels at sea were estimated to have caught 95 million tons, the international food agency says. **********Despite strict controls on fishing in recent years, New England fishery managers concluded in December that the cod fishery in the Gulf of Maine is collapsing. The Clinton Administration has already proposed new spending to take some of the region's boats out of service, and last month the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed guidelines for buying back licenses and scrapping boats throughout American fisheries. **********The new international measures recommended in February, at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, will have no immediate impact. The first step is to get an accurate measure of how much fish the world's fleets really can catch. **********Each nation that signs the agreement pledges to reduce overcapacity, starting between 2003 and 2005. **********''This is the first significant international document on the management of fishing capacity,'' said Dominique Greboval, a fisheries planning manager with the Food and Agricultural Organization. ''It might not look like much, but in terms of approach it is a significant departure.'' **********The agency has estimated conservatively that the fishing industry's overcapacity is at least 30 percent. Gareth Porter, a fisheries expert for the World Wildlife Fund, has estimated overcapacity at almost 150 percent. **********And the food agency found several years ago that worldwide, the fishing industry was spending $54 billion more than it was taking in every year. **********The world's fishing fleet numbers about four million vessels -- about one-third of them large enough to have decks and motors, the agency says. About 40,000 are larger than 100 tons and longer than about 78 feet. And more than a thousand of those are owned in the United States.  The new agreement, which was pushed by the United States and Japan, is one of a series of United Nations pacts since 1995 to address overfishing, and the most explicit on controlling overcapacity. **********But the political barriers to following through are daunting. **********''There is so much invested in the way things are that changing and downsizing the industry is an enormous task,'' said Anne Platt McGinn, of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization. ''Probably the European Union is going to have the hardest time of all, because their fishermen are so over-subsidized.'' **********As in the United States, government programs in Europe have encouraged the modernization and expansion of the fishing industry, but other programs have aimed at reducing the size of the fleet to control overfishing."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/21/technology/what-s-next-fuel-cell-may-be-the-future-battery.html": {"writer_name": "Anne Eisenberg", "pub_date": "1999-10-21", "snippet": "Fuel cells are nearing development point that will enable them to replace not only batteries used in laptops or cell phones, but even the recharger; some experts say latest fuel cells may provide power source that weighs far less and lasts far lon...", "word_count": 934, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fuel Cell May Be the Future 'Battery'", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEXT; Fuel Cell May Be the Future 'Battery'", "body_text": " **********THE next time the batteries in your laptop or cell phone conk out at the most inconvenient moment, take heart. **********Scientists are fine-tuning an invention that may eventually replace not only those fallible batteries but even the recharger. **********The invention is the fuel cell, a device that may one day sit neatly inside your mobile phone or laptop. It uses the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to generate a continuous stream of electricity for days on end with no help whatsoever from a battery. **********Fuel cells were once seen as future power sources for cars, buses and power stations, but inventors are now proposing them for the subkilowatt world of portable electronics. They may soon come to the aid of soldiers, police officers and even everyday commuters who are weary of the inconvenience of their battery packs, rechargers and spare AA's. **********Some experts say the latest fuel cells may provide a power source that weighs far less, and lasts far longer, than any battery on the market, in part because of their efficient use of hydrogen. **********''Fuel cells have a simply amazing ability to extract energy from the hydrogen atom,'' said Christopher Dyer, a senior member of the technical staff at Motorola Labs in Tempe, Ariz., who is the inventor of a fuel cell designed for use in portable electronic devices. **********The principle of every hydrogen-based fuel cell is that when hydrogen is joined to oxygen, forming water, energy is produced. The energy takes the form of electricity and some waste heat. **********The byproducts, depending on the source of the hydrogen, are a bit of water vapor and, often, carbon dioxide, which is vented from the fuel cell. **********Give the fuel cells enough hydrogen, plus the oxygen that is provided free in the atmosphere, Dr. Dyer said, and they could power devices like cell phones for days, weeks or even months. The hydrogen that drives these small marvels will probably be provided by methanol, a compound commonly known as wood alcohol that contains hydrogen, Dr. Dyer said. **********''A liter of methanol should provide enough electricity to run a laptop for more than a week,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''A lithium ion battery of comparable volume has a tenth of that energy.'' **********Lithium ion batteries, commonly used in laptops, each provide about three hours of energy. **********Fuel cells have another advantage besides a high energy output, Dr. Dyer said.  They can be replenished quickly, unlike batteries, which require a slow recharging.  Dr. Dyer imagines that owners of cell phones, laptops and pagers will someday refuel their devices by occasionally slipping in a new ampul of methanol. **********''Methanol is inexpensive,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''Ampuls of it could be bought from a supermarket.'' **********Fuel cells are not new devices, although the intense recent interest in them is. They were demonstrated in the 19th century and deployed more than a century later to provide electric power for NASA's space vehicles. But the internal processing required to produce that continuous stream of electricity high in the sky proved too expensive for daily applications. **********That is changing now, as engineering advances have gradually lowered costs. At the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington, Va., Robert Nowak, a program manager, said research sponsored by the agency would aid the overladen American soldiers who routinely carry 20 to 30 pounds of batteries on their missions. **********''Fuel cells begin to look very attractive when you consider what you need in the equivalent battery power to run a computer, radio and other gear soldiers must often take with them,'' he said. **********But Dr. Nowak has not entirely banished batteries from the fuel cells his agency has helped to develop. Like many people in the field, he supports a hybrid, or dual, system that uses both a battery and a small fuel cell. The battery provides peaks of power when needed, and the fuel cell keeps the battery recharged. **********''In principle this means you will only add fuel to the cell from time to time,'' Dr. Nowak said. ''The battery will supply any transient power that exceeds a baseline level.'' **********While most small fuel cells are more common in research laboratories than in factories, the H Power Corporation in Belleville, N.J., is a commercial producer of subkilowatt fuel cells. **********One type it makes provides backup power for road signs with changing messages like ''Congestion Ahead'' or ''Parking Lot A Is Full.'' **********''The fuel cell is the backup for the solar panel,'' said Rene DuBois, director of sales and marketing at H Power. **********Variable road signs with solar panels can go dead when, for instance, snow covers the power source, and a fuel cell can keep the system operating and fully charged. **********Many experts in the field predict that fuel cells will be widely accepted in part because battery development will be unable to keep up with consumers' demand for lightweight electronic products. **********''The small-electronics-equipment market is quietly demanding more and more energy,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''The rate of progress in battery development is probably too slow to meet this demand.'' **********The bright screens, souped-up processors and whiz-bang features of the latest laptops, cell phones and other portable devices are insatiable users of batteries. Consumers may not be carrying 20- to 30-pound packs, as the soldiers do, but many of them are routinely hefting 12 to 14 pounds apiece once the weight of the power cord, recharger and spare battery is calculated along with the weight of the laptop. **********But fuel cells are not going to supplant batteries just yet. ''Not a single one is fully functional in a piece of portable equipment,'' Dr. Dyer said. ''It's early days for the fuel cell. I think it will be coming soon, but it isn't quite here yet.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/02/world/new-indonesian-assembly-begins-trying-to-organize-next-election.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-10-02", "snippet": "Indonesia's new national Assembly convenes; decides that presidential selection should be conducted in Oct instead of Nov, as originally planned (M)", "word_count": 350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Indonesian Assembly Begins Trying to Organize Next Election", "print_headline": "New Indonesian Assembly Begins Trying to Organize Next Election", "body_text": " **********The new national Assembly convened today, and in an irreverent demonstration of the first precarious steps toward popular Government, members booed when President B.

Some are single parents with jobs; some are people making as little as $527 a week. Over all, the number of people affected by the tax is expected to grow 26 percent a year for the next decade. **********But many of the wealthy will not be among them. Even with the A.M.T., the number of taxpayers making more than $200,000 who pay no taxes has risen to more than 2,000 each year. **********How a 1969 law aimed at the tax-shy rich became a growing burden on moderate earners illustrates how tax policy in Washington can be a hall of mirrors. **********While some Republican Congressmen favor eliminating the tax, other lawmakers say such a move would be an expensive tax break for the wealthy -- or at least would be perceived that way, and thus would be politically unpalatable. And any overhaul of the system would need to compensate for the $6.6 billion that individuals now pay under the A.M.T. This year, such payments will account for almost 1 percent of all individual income tax revenue. **********''This is a classic case of both Congress and the Administration agreeing that the tax doesn't make much sense, but not being able to agree on doing anything about it,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington. **********Mr. Steuerle was a Treasury Department tax official in 1986, when an overhaul of the tax code set the stage for drawing the middle class into the A.M.T. **********In eliminating most tax shelters for the wealthy, Congress decided to treat exemptions for children and deductions for medical expenses just like special credits for investors in oil wells, if they cut too deeply into a household's taxable income. **********Congress decided that once these ''tax preferences'' exceeded certain amounts -- $40,000 for a married couple, for example -- people would be moved out of the regular income tax and into the alternative minimum tax. At the time, the threshold was high enough to affect virtually no one but the rich. But it has since been raised only once -- by 12.5 percent, to $45,000 for a married couple -- while the cost of living has risen 43 percent. And so the limits have sneaked up on growing numbers of taxpayers of more modest means. **********''Everyone knew back then that it had problems that had to be fixed,'' Mr. Steuerle recalled. ''They just said, 'next year.' '' **********But ''next year'' has never come -- and it is unlikely to arrive in 1999, either. While tax policy experts have known for years that the middle class would be drawn into the A.M.T., few taxpayers have been clamoring for change. **********Among those few, however, are David and Margaret Klaassen of Marquette, Kan. Mr. Klaassen, a lawyer who lives in and works out of a farmhouse, made $89,751.07 in 1997 and paid $5,989 in Federal income taxes. Four weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service sent the Klaassens a notice demanding $3,761 more under the alternative minimum tax, including a penalty because the I.R.S. said the Klaassens knew they owed the A.M.T. **********Mr. Klaassen acknowledges that he knew the I.R.S. would assert that he was subject to the A.M.T., but he says the law was not meant to apply to his family. ''I've never invested in a tax shelter,'' he said. ''I don't even have municipal bonds.'' **********The Klaassens do, however, have 13 children and their attendant medical expenses -- including the costs of caring for their second son, Aaron, 17, who has battled leukemia for years. It was those exemptions and deductions that subjected them to the A.M.T. **********''What kind of policy taxes you for spending money to save your child's life?'' Mr. Klaassen asked. **********The tax affects taxpayers in three ways. Some, like the Klaassens, pay the tax at either a 26 percent or a 28 percent rate because they have more than $45,000 in exemptions and deductions. Others do not pay the A.M.T. itself, but they cannot take the full tax breaks they would have received under the regular income tax system without running up against limits set by the A.M.T. The A.M.T. can also convert tax-exempt income from certain bonds and from exercising incentive stock options into taxable income. **********It may be useful to think of the alternative minimum tax as a parallel universe to the regular income tax system, similar in some ways but more complex and with its own classifications of deductions, its own rates and its own paperwork. The idea was that taxpayers who had escaped the regular tax universe by piling on credits and deductions would enter this new universe to pay their fair share. (Likewise, there is a corporate A.M.T. that parallels the corporate income tax.) **********At first, the burden of the A.M.T. fell mainly on the shoulders of business owners and investors, said Robert S. McIntyre, executive director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group in Washington that says the tax system favors the rich. Based on I.R.S. data, Mr. McIntyre said he found that 37 percent of A.M.T. revenue in 1990 was a result of business owners using losses from previous years to reduce their regular income taxes; an additional 18 percent was because of big deductions for state and local taxes. **********But that has begun to shift, largely as a result of the 1986 changes, which eliminated most tax shelters and lowered tax rates. **********WHEN President Reagan and Congress were overhauling the tax code, they could not make the projected revenues under the new rules equal those under the old system. Huge, and growing, budget deficits made it politically essential for the official estimates to show that after tax reform, the same amount of money would flow to Washington. **********One solution, said Mr. Steuerle, the former Treasury official, was to count personal and dependent exemptions and some medical expenses as preferences to be reduced or ignored under the A.M.T, just as special credits for petroleum investments and other tax shelters are. **********Mortgage interest and charitable gifts were not counted as preferences, according to tax policy experts who worked on the legislation, because they generated more money than was needed. **********But the A.M.T. has not stayed ''revenue neutral,'' in Washington parlance. **********The regular income tax was indexed for inflation in 1984, so that taxpayers would not get pushed into higher tax brackets simply because their income kept pace with the cost of living. **********The A.M.T. limits, however, have not been indexed. The total allowable exemptions before the tax kicks in have been fixed since 1993 at $45,000 for a married couple filing jointly. For unmarried people, the total amount is now $33,750, and for married people filing separately, it is $22,500. **********If the limit had been indexed since 1986, when the A.M.T. was overhauled, it would be about $57,000 for married couples filing jointly -- and most middle-income households would still be exempt. **********Mr. Steuerle said he warned at the time that including ''normal, routine deductions and exemptions that everyone takes'' in the list of preferences would eventually turn the A.M.T. into a tax on the middle class. **********That appears to be exactly what has happened. **********For example, a married person who makes just $527 a week and files her tax return separately can be subject to the tax, said David S. Hulse, an assistant professor of accounting at the University of Kentucky. **********And the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which allows a $500-a-child tax credit as well as education credits, may make even more middle-class families subject to the A.M.T. by reducing the value of those credits. **********Two Treasury Department economists recently calculated that largely because of the new credits, the number of households making $30,000 to $50,000 who must pay the alternative minimum tax will more than triple in the coming decade. The economists, Robert Rebelein and Jerry Tempalski, also calculated that for households making $15,000 to $30,000 annually, A.M.T. payments will grow 25-fold, to $1.2 billion, by 2008. **********Last year, many more people would have been subject to the A.M.T. if Congress had not made a last-minute fix pushed by Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, that -- for 1998 only -- exempted the new child and education credits. The move came after I.R.S. officials told Congress that the credits added enormous complexity to calculating tax liability. Figuring out how much the A.M.T. would reduce the credits was beyond the capacity of most taxpayers and even many paid tax preparers, the I.R.S. officials said. **********EVEN if Congress makes a permanent fix to the problems created by the child and education credits, it will put only a minor drag on the spread of the A.M.T. as long as the tax is not indexed for inflation. The two Treasury economists calculated that revenues from the tax would climb to $25 billion in 2008 without a fix, or to $21.9 billion with one. **********In 1999, if there is no exemption for the credits, a single parent who does not itemize deductions but who makes $50,000 and takes a credit for the costs of caring for two children while he works, will be subject to the A.M.T, estimated Jeffrey Pretsfelder, an editor at RIA Group, a publisher of tax information for professionals. **********If the tax laws are not changed, 8.8 million taxpayers will have to pay the A.M.T. a decade from now, the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last month. Add in the taxpayers who will not receive the full value of their deductions because they run up against the limits set by the A.M.T., and the total grows to 11.6 million taxpayers -- 92 percent of whom have incomes of less than $200,000, the two Treasury economists estimated. **********While many lawmakers and Treasury officials have criticized the impact of the tax on middle-class taxpayers, there are few signs of change, as Republicans and the Administration talk past each other. **********Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is the chief tax writer, said the A.M.T. should be eliminated in the next budget. **********''Unfortunately, the A.M.T. tax can penalize large families, which is part of the reason why Republicans for years have tried to eliminate it or at least reduce it,'' Mr. Archer said. ''Unfortunately, President Clinton blocked our efforts each time.'' **********Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said the Administration was ''very concerned that the A.M.T. has a growing impact on middle-class families, including by diluting the child credit, education credits and other crucial tax benefits, and we hope to address this issue in the President's budget. **********''Subject to budget constraints, we look forward to working with Congress on this important issue,'' he continued. **********That revenue concerns have thwarted exempting the middle class runs counter to the reason Congress initially imposed the tax. **********''You need an A.M.T. because people who make a lot of money should pay some income taxes,'' said Mr. McIntyre, of Citizens for Tax Justice. ''If you believe, like Mr. Archer and a lot of Republicans do, that the more you make the less in taxes you should pay, then of course you are against the A.M.T. But somehow I don't think most people see it that way.'' **********THE Klaassens, meanwhile, are challenging the A.M.T. in Federal Court. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments in March on their claim that the tax infringes their religious freedom. The Klaassens, who are Presbyterians, say they believe children ''are a blessing from God, and so we do not practice birth control,'' Mr. Klaassen said. **********When Mr. Klaassen wrote to an I.R.S. official complaining that a $1,085 bill for the A.M.T. for 1994 resulted from the size of his family, he got back a curt letter saying that his ''analysis of the alternative minimum tax's effect on large families was interesting but inappropriate'' and advising him that it was medical deductions, not family size, that subjected him to the A.M.T. **********Under the regular tax system, medical expenses above 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income -- the last line on the front page of Form 1040 -- are deductible. Under the A.M.T., the threshold is raised to 10 percent. **********Still doubting the I.R.S.'s math, Mr. Klaassen decided to test what would have happened had he filed the same tax return, changing only the number of children he claimed as dependents. He found that if he had seven or fewer children, the A.M.T. would not have applied in 1994. **********But the eighth child set off the A.M.T., at a cost of $223. Having nine children raised the bill to $717. And 10 children, the number he had in 1994, increased that sum to $1,085 -- the amount the I.R.S. said was due. **********''We love this country and we believe in paying taxes,'' Mr. Klaassen said. ''But we cannot believe that Congress ever intended to apply this tax to our family solely because of how many children we choose to have. And I have shown that we are subject to the A.M.T. solely because we have chosen not to limit the size of our family.'' **********The I.R.S., in papers opposing the Klaassens, noted that tax deductions are not a right but a matter of ''legislative grace.'' **********Mr. Klaassen turned to the Federal courts after losing in Tax Court. The opinion by Tax Court Judge Robert N. Armen Jr. was summed up this way by Tax Notes, a magazine that critiques tax policy: ''Congress intended the alternative minimum tax to affect large families when it made personal exemptions a preference item.'' **********Several tax experts said that Mr. Klaassen had little chance of success in the courts because the statute treating children as tax preferences was clear. They also said that nothing in the A.M.T. laws was specifically aimed at his religious beliefs. **********Meanwhile, for people who make $200,000 or more, the A.M.T. will be less of a burden this year because of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which included a provision lowering the maximum tax rate on capital gains for both the regular tax and the A.M.T. to 20 percent. **********Mr. Rebelein and Mr. Tempalski, the Treasury Department economists, calculated recently that people making more than $200,000 would  pay a total of 4 percent less in A.M.T. for 1998 because of the 1997 law. By 2008, their savings will be 9 percent, largely as a result of lower capital gains rates and changed accounting rules for business owners. **********''This law was passed to catch people who use tax shelters to avoid their obligations,'' Mr. Klaassen said. ''But instead of catching them it hits people like me. This is just nuts.'' **********Three Ways to Deal With a Taxing Problem **********PRESIDENT CLINTON, his tax policy advisers and the Republicans who control the tax writing committees in Congress all agree that the alternative minimum tax is a growing problem for the middle class. But there is no agreement on what to do. Here are some options that have been discussed: **********RAISE THE EXEMPTION -- Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, two years ago proposed raising the $45,000 A.M.T. exemption for a married couple by $1,000. But that would leave many middle-class families subject to the tax, because it would not fully account for inflation. To do that would require an exemption of about $57,000, followed by automatic inflation adjustments. That is the most widely favored approach, drawing support from people like J. D. Foster, executive director of the Tax Foundation, a group supported by corporations, and Robert S.

But millions of taxpayers will lose these credits, or get only part of them, unless Congress makes a fix each year or permanently exempts them. **********ELIMINATE IT -- Mr. Archer and other Republicans want to get rid of the A.M.T. but have not proposed how to make up for the lost revenue, which in a decade is expected to grow to $25 billion annually. Recently, however, Mr. Archer has said that in a period of Federal budget surpluses, it may be time to scrap the budget rules that require paying for tax cuts with reduced spending or tax increases elsewhere.

I know my actions are wrong, and probably will raise tariffs for the rest of you law-abiding citizens. But I also know that my actions are no indication that I'm likely to walk away from a hotel with one of its television sets. **********Such a leap of theft hit me recently as I was winding my way through one Web site after another, each devoted to employee theft. The numbers bandied about on these sites are staggering: businesses supposedly lose $52 billion to $120 billion a year. But forget about trying to find solid support for these numbers or even tracing them to an original source. And everything from vanishing pens to ''stolen time'' to multimillion-dollar embezzlement is lumped together. **********''Many of us are not completely legal,'' said Laura P. Hartman, a professor of business ethics at the University of Wisconsin. ''There's no doubt that driving 57 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone is illegal. But violating that law doesn't make you the same as a child rapist. And when we categorize theft in the workplace as one big category, we are doing just that.'' **********Written policies at most companies draw no distinctions, barring employees from taking or using any company property for personal purposes, no matter how small, said Jay Hotchkiss, a Portland, Me., consultant who helps companies write employee handbooks. But few try to enforce such policies down to the paper clip, he said. **********Some business owners are resigned to petty theft by customers or employees. ''I own a restaurant and we've got these creamers for coffee that are cute little chickens,'' said Scott Adams, whose main living comes from drawing the ''Dilbert'' comic strip. ''The cream pours out of their little open beak. As soon as we got them they were a big hit and started disappearing like crazy. We were happy about it because anybody who steals a creamer obviously liked the restaurant.'' **********But Mr. Adams, whose first Dilbert book was ''Build a Better Life by Stealing Office Supplies,'' said analyses of employee theft were always biased. ''They fail to take into account how much the employer has stolen from the employee,'' he said. ''I don't know anybody who doesn't do as much work when they're not on the job. I've got a feeling the net of that is in favor of the employer.'' **********But basing ethical behavior on a tit-for-tat model can spiral out of control. Even the consultants hired to stem the tide of theft say success depends on being reasonable, not puritanical. Rather than looking for petty ''borrowing'' or Web surfing on company time, said Michael G. Kessler, a forensic accountant based in Manhattan, ''I'm looking for the person who's going to sit there and run his business out of my computer.'' **********Simply put, it is ludicrous to treat all infractions as if they had the same ethical outcome. Clearly, they do not. Not only is mutual respect lost if companies practice the petty rigidity of assigning every wrong the same punishment, but it can also have the perverse effect of provoking otherwise loyal, productive employees to up the ante of what they will take from the office. **********REASONABLE solutions can vary from company to company. American City Journals, a chain of city business newspapers based in Charlotte, N.C., states in its employee manual, ''Use of office equipment such as copy machines is allowed for incidental personal use and to further your commitment to nonprofit and community activities.'' **********But while rules may make it easier for employees and employers to know what's allowed and what's not, no policy can anticipate every situation. It is better to create an ethical climate where employees see themselves as stewards trusted with some reasonable discretion over their use of the company's resources. **********As for me, I've decided to end my days of knife-lifting. As I said, stealing is wrong.

The dark, gothic aesthetic of his contemporaries, Veronique Branquinho, Olivier Theyskens and Balenciaga's Nicholas Ghesquiere, for example, has had an enormous effect on many a runway this season. **********Scott, an American designer, who was 23 when he presented his first collection, says a photo of the \"Dynasty\" actress Linda Evans climbing a rock in an evening dress and looking over her shoulder in terror was an early inspiration. \"Tragic glamour,\" says Scott, \"that sums it up.\" Although he has moved on since then (this is his fifth season), the image of Evans is pure '80s. What is considered retro for some, becomes a point of departure and reference for others. **********In reply to media criticism of his show last March, Scott told Self Service magazine, \"Anyway, a 60-year-old journalist is not going to have the same ideas and values as a 24-year-old, and that is just the way it is.\" Scott's remark was voiced less in bitterness than as a statement of fact. **********Although the generation gap, as it used to be called, may appear to have narrowed, the rift has, in fact, grown wider. The parents of today's college students may share the same body-piercing and hip hop clothes as their kids, but the post-World War II value system that was instilled in them as children is as indelible on their psyches as freshly inked tattoos. **********Like every age before, the culture and attitudes of today's young people have been shaped by, and are a reaction to, the world around them. Certainly designers in their twenties have grown up with AIDS and the impact it has had on sex; and, from the nightly news to its romancing in pop culture, violence has set the tone in their lives. It is only natural that these circumstances should be reflected creatively in their designs. Even if it is unintentional, they are transforming that reality into their vision of what is modern and beautiful. **********When recently asked about the influences of violence and sex in his work, Scott looked perplexed. A similar look of puzzlement came over the face of Belgian menswear designer Raf Simons, 31, when the same question was put to him. So what does make today's young designers tick? As Skye Edwards of Morcheeba sings on the group's latest CD: \"I am the new, for reasons I can never explain.\" Historical analysis will only make it clear in retrospect. **********In the postwar era, the parents of the baby boomers, who lived through and survived the Depression and World War II, optimistically embraced the future and new technology. Unfortunately, their notion that history had taught them how to reorder life and recognize the enemy left them frozen, like the townspeople in the film \"Pleasantville,\" in an idealized black and white world. **********Steeped in historical references, the generation that came of age in the late '60s and early '70s naively set out to overturn the system with their ideas, fashions and music. \"We set out to change the world, but only changed ourselves,\" the rock star Curt Wild says at the end of the Glam Rock film \"Velvet Goldmine.\" **********\"What's wrong with that?\" asks the reporter Arthur Stuart. **********Gesturing at the banal inhabitants in the bar around them, the disillusioned Wild responds, \"Look at the world.\" **********- **********THE world, if one is to believe all of what one reads, sees and hears, has been going to pieces ever since. Everything, while becoming increasingly interconnected, has also become more fragmented. There are no constants, and there is certainly no black and white. Although the younger generation is just as hell-bent on rebellion and dead set on breaking with the past as those that came before, they have replaced the idealism of their parents with their own brand of hard-edged cynicism. They do, however, have the same need to carve out and create their individual sense of style, identity and power. Paradoxically, as products of a consumer society, they may talk about individuality, yet wholeheartedly endorse validation through brand identification; whether it is the Nike swoosh, Louis Vuitton monogram, Gucci double Gs or Prada metal triangle. **********While their parents wore clothes as a means of calculated provocation, the younger generation often uses design to create meaning through the subtlety of abstraction, a system of signs and the codification of cool. Aaron Betsky in \"Icons: Magnets of Meaning,\" writes: \"By misusing an object, layering it with our intentions, and reforming it in our lives, it can become a commentary on how we create sense within our world.\" **********Although they often lack, a knowledge of historical perspective, young designers dismiss the past as irrelevant one minute, but feel free, not unlike the way contemporary DJs use sound, to sample fragments of everything that has come before. **********\"Try as I do to break out of the '70s,\" said Tom Ford after the Gucci show last week, \"references from that time continue to influence my sense of beauty in ways I am not even conscious of.\" Ford, 37, says a woman 20 years older might think a \"matched suit and perfect makeup pretty,\" but find his clothes for Gucci aggressive, while, he adds, he sees the vision of Alexander McQueen, a designer 10 years his junior, to be more extreme and violent than his own. **********It only makes sense, for example, that Scott's clothes would be imbued with an abstract '80s sense of glamour and extravagance, as he grew up \"watching bitch fights in eveningwear\" on \"Dynasty,\" but to be contemporary, he says, they must have an \"urban reality.\" The '80s, he adds, was \"the last time we looked to the future. When I look to the year 2000, I look to the future. My set of references and my reason for reacting are different.\" It is a given that someone 10 years younger than Scott might say that the '90s was the pinnacle of modernity. **********\"I feel a big difference in generations only if it is seven years,\" says Simons about his girlfriend Veronique Branquinho. Punk, which peaked in 1977, has been a constant design influence for Simons. \"As a youth style,\" he says, \"punk was the strongest ever visually. There were no limits, no strict codes for being a punk. You could interpret it on your own personal level.\" Punk style \u2014 once associated with anarchy, chaos and futility \u2014 is now considered as quaint as Roaring Twenties flappers, who, in another time, were thought to be subversive. **********Sexual attitudes have also radically changed. Monica Lewinsky's frank, and almost blase\u0301, discussion of her sexual encounter with President Bill Clinton with Barbara Walters last week on ABC's \"20/20\" exemplifies just how relaxed her generation is to the subject. (She is 25.) It is hard to believe, therefore, that in 1980 people found the Calvin Klein Jeans/Brooke Shields spot \u2014 \"nothing comes between me and my Calvin's\" \u2014 shocking. Or that the film \"Solomon and Sheba,\" a 1959 sword and sandal epic that is now viewed as a piece of period kitsch, received a \"condemned\" rating by Catholic Life Magazine because its voluptuous star, Gina Lollobrigida, appeared in diaphanous gowns. Her costumes, which implied nudity and wanton behavior then, would be considered armor by today's standards. **********- **********STILL for all its apparent permissiveness, younger designers approach sexuality with a kind of detachment that is so different from that of the sexual revolution of their parents' generation. Look at the sheer dresses created last season by Nicholas Ghesquiere for Balenciaga, which are innocently monastic and witchy at the same time. **********Or, take Terry Richardson's images of a man and woman \u2014 dressed in pink no less \u2014 enacting the Kama Sutra for the shoe designer Cesare Paciotti. The emotional separation between Richardson's models is in sharp contrast to their blatantly sexual poses. Going beyond advertising, Richardson photos question today's values. **********A similar argument could be made for \"A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue\" by Wendy Shalit, 23, who advocates that women take control of their bodies and find empowerment through abstention from sex. Something as ancient as virginity is not only radical, but is the perfect example of how everything old is new again. **********RICHARD BUCKLEY is fashion consultant at Dutch magazine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/13/business/company-news-consolidated-accepts-dominion-s-offer.html": {"writer_name": "Bridge News", "pub_date": "1999-05-13", "snippet": "Consolidated Natural Gas Co rejects $6.7 billion unsolicited bid by Columbia Energy Group and approves revised $6.4 billion takeover offer from Dominion Resources Inc (S)", "word_count": 104, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONSOLIDATED ACCEPTS DOMINION'S OFFER", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CONSOLIDATED ACCEPTS DOMINION'S OFFER", "body_text": " **********The Consolidated Natural Gas Company has turned down a $6.7 billion unsolicited bid by Columbia Energy Group of Herndon, Va., and approved a revised $6.4 billion takeover offer from Dominion Resources Inc. of Richmond.

This is likely to continue, analysts at Salomon Brothers state in a report, because present interest rates in Denmark, Greece and Sweden do not fully price in membership, even by 2004. **********That may not provide much guidance for equity investors because, except for Greece, the stock markets have been moved more by factors unrelated to EMU, and their performance has varied greatly across the four countries. **********Guillaume Rambourg, a manager of European portfolios at Gartmore Investment Management, pointed out that Swedish stocks had risen about 11 percent this year, while the market in Denmark was down 8 percent. Britain was in the middle, rising about 10 percent, and Greece beat them all, recently showing a 33 percent gain for the year. **********Greece's economic history is somewhat checkered, which is why EMU membership matters more there than in the other prospective second-wavers, and why its markets are soaring as membership appears more likely. **********\"There are some similarities to Italy, in that both suffered from a bloated pension system and large public deficits,\" said Roger Monson, head of emerging-market strategy at the Dutch bank Rabobank. **********\"But Greece's is an inherently weaker economy than Italy's,\" he added. \"Its natural-resource base is very limited, its level of education is lower by some way, and its exports are far less diversified and more subject to global competition due to lower knowledge-based content. Greece's position in the Balkans, with all that that implies, is also a hindrance to wealth generation.\" **********Despite such an unpromising backdrop, Mr. Monson said, \"Greece is likely to benefit further from its convergence program, and its equity market should enjoy above-average performance in the next six to 12 months.\" **********With Greek government debt yielding four percentage points more than German debt, Mr. Monson said, this implies a further rally for bonds, and heightened valuations for certain stocks as well. **********\"I think we may see better performance over the next year from construction firms, who may also benefit from rebuilding after Kosovo, as well as food exporters and well-placed hotels,\" he said. **********Mr. Rambourg of Gartmore agreed that \"there is still a bit to go\" on interest-rate convergence, with bank stocks the best way to take advantage of it. Banks benefit from gains on their bond portfolios, he said, as well as from growth in lending and in funds under management. **********Salomon Brothers said that after the sharp rally, shares in some industries were \"fully valued,\" which means expensive, and the Balkan war could hit prices if NATO commits ground troops. **********The stock market in peaceful Denmark has been one of the worst this year in Europe. One reason is a hangover from several years of strong growth. **********\"The economy has had too much of a good thing,\" said a report by Merrill Lynch & Co. \"That has pushed Denmark's inflation up, its international competitiveness down and its current-account balance into the red.\" **********During the fat years, Mr. Rambourg said, the stock market also did well, led by TeleDanmark AS, the national phone company. **********Investors have taken profits, pushing TeleDanmark down about 15 percent this year, he said. There has also been selling of shares in the banking industry, which is undergoing heavy consolidation. He noted that Gartmore's managers had \"added just a bit to Denmark; we thought it was due a bounce.\" **********The bounce in Sweden has been helped by the rise in the krona against the dollar and euro. Another lift was supplied by the merger of Swedish and British drugmakers that produced AstraZeneca. Mr. Rambourg said that fund managers who try to replicate the performance of the main Swedish market index have bid up the new company's stock to match its index weight. **********Sweden is a favorite among institutional investors, with Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter strongly overweighting it in model portfolios. They also recommend British stocks, but not with less enthusiasm. **********Britain has enriched international investors by not being in EMU. As with the krona, the pound has risen against the euro, although it has fallen against the dollar in recent months. The British economy has also managed to avoid the malaise afflicting much of the euro zone, further strengthening share prices. **********\"The prospects for the U.K. economy are much improved and a growth rebound is on the horizon,\" said Richard Crehan, a Morgan Stanley equity strategist. **********- **********For further information: **********GARTMORE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.

Results", "body_text": " **********Car and truck buyers were out in force in April, and as a result the auto industry turned in strong sales results just as it heads into the crucial summer selling season. Sales rose 3.9 percent over all in April, and the industry sold cars, sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans at a brisk seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.3 million. **********The impressive results came despite lower-than-expected sales at the General Motors Corporation. G.M. said its sales fell 4 percent in April, with car sales falling 4.5 percent and truck sales falling 3.5 percent compared with results in the month a year earlier. Wall Street analysts cautioned that the G.M. results were not as weak as they seemed because G.M. had blockbuster results last April when it was offering particularly hefty rebates. Still, analysts expected G.M.'s sales to decline no more than 3 percent. **********But G.M. executives were upbeat. ''April was a very good month for us,'' said Roy S. Roberts, vice president and group executive for North America Vehicle Sales, Service and Marketing. ''Our market share is north of 30 percent for the first time in seven months.'' G.M.'s market share in April was 30.6 percent, down from 33.2 in April of last year. Much of the decline came from G.M.'s largest division, Chevrolet, where sales dropped 10.9 percent in April. **********The sales came at a price. G.M. offered hefty rebates and other incentives on many of its vehicles in April. For instance, current Cadillac owners are entitled to $1,000 off the price of any new Cadillac except the Escalade sport utility vehicle. Pontiac will lease its Grand Am sedan for $219 a month. And Buick is offering three-year, zero interest leases on four of its models, as if it were borrowing the money at Japanese interest rates and passing on the savings to its customers. **********Nevertheless, with nearly a year of especially strong sales results, auto makers are considering building factories in the United States to help meet demand. G.M.'s board tentatively approved plans to build a new factory in Lansing, Mich., to produce rear-wheel-drive luxury vehicles. G.M. is still negotiating agreements with the United Automobile Workers union and state and local governments but could begin construction for the factory as early as this summer, said Kyle W. Johnson, a company spokesman. **********Honda, which said on Monday that its sales rose 4 percent last month and 8.3 percent so far this year, is considering building its third American factory and is looking at sites in Alabama and Georgia. Alabama is considered the front-runner for the factory, which would build sport utility vehicles. **********Wall Street analysts said the industry's strong sales reflected a buyer's market. ''There are a lot of really interesting products out there for people to buy, and people are getting good prices,'' said Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. **********Economists concur that the strong sales are fed by several factors: strong economic growth, a surging stock market, low interest rates, tax refunds and hefty rebates and other sales incentives. Auto executives agree but add that some of the strength in sales can be predicted by reading demographic tea leaves. **********David P. Bostwick, director of corporate market research for DaimlerChrysler A.G., said auto makers were selling more cars and trucks because the leading edge of the baby boom had reached prime car-buying age. ''This is basically the time when you buy more cars more often than any time of your life,'' Mr. Bostwick said. **********Other auto makers also reported strong sales. On Monday, the Ford Motor Company said its sales rose 6.6 percent, DaimlerChrysler sales rose 3 percent, Toyota sales rose 9.6 percent and Nissan rose 21.5 percent. **********Mazda sales rose 16.7 percent in April, to 21,989. Kia sales nearly doubled, to 10,606, and Hyundai sales nearly doubled, to 10,685. **********Daewoo, the Korean company that began selling cars in the United States last September, sold 2,006 cars in April. Volkswagen A.G. said its April sales rose 29.5 percent. Audi  said its sales rose 29.3 percent, to 5,592, because of strong sales of the Audi A4 and A6 models.

So what's wrong with this picture?", "body_text": " **********IN one sense, yesterday was an unusual day for the Eastman Kodak Company. About 8:30 A.M. -- an hour after it released its fourth-quarter earnings but an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened -- George M. C. Fisher, the company's chief executive, broke with his tradition of refusing to forecast anything. He told analysts that Kodak would earn $4.81 to $5.24 a share this year and would cut $200 million more out of annual costs than the total of $1 billion it had already promised to cut by the end of 1999. **********But in another sense, yesterday was business as usual -- or, at least, the way business has been in this tumultuous stock market environment. Kodak announced that its profits were up even though its sales were down. Shareholders skidded right past the profit rise, focused on the sales drop and spent the day dumping Kodak stock. By the time the carnage was over, Kodak's stock had plummeted $8.1875, or 10.4 percent, to $70.50. **********Kodak executives could be forgiven for an awful sense of deja vu. A similar scene played out in October, when Kodak's shares plunged more than 13 percent after shareholders ignored a profit increase in the third quarter and focused on flat sales. **********But if shareholders were disappointed then, they are furious now. Three months ago, Kodak's earnings were a penny above analysts' expectations, and its cost-cutting regimen was ahead of schedule. This time, analysts expected a lot more and Kodak delivered a lot less. **********It is not that Kodak's numbers were all that bad. The net earnings for the quarter were $272 million, or 83 cents a diluted share, a huge improvement from the loss of $744 million, or $2.29 a share, it posted the last three months of 1997. Excluding charges, Kodak clearly is in better shape than it was a year ago: earnings of $1.05 a share, compared with 75 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. **********But analysts had expected earnings of at least $1.15 a share and were unprepared for the 6 percent drop in Kodak's revenue for the quarter, to $3.56 billion, and the 8 percent decline, to $14.54 billion, for the year. **********''We bobbled the ball,'' Mr. Fisher acknowledged. Analysts were less kind. ''They did a lot worse than bobble the ball, they fumbled it,'' said Peter J. Enderlin, an analyst with the First Albany Corporation. **********Indeed, even Kodak seems to be viewing 1999 with some trepidation. Mr. Fisher's unexpected earnings forecast bracketed the Wall Street consensus prediction of $5.19 a share this year. While some analysts took his willingness to even suggest $5.24 as a sign of optimism, far more took his pronouncement as an early alert that Kodak might not even hit $5.19. **********''Without using the words, he is warning the Street that its expectations are too high,'' said B. Alexander Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research. **********If the next quarter looks anything like this one, it may be a prudent warning. Kodak's woes sprang from so many places that they approximated the proverbial death by a thousand cuts. **********Overseas, faltering economies in Brazil and Asia bit heavily into sales, while a weak Mexican peso meant that robust Mexican sales sounded meager in dollars. In Japan, where subcontractors make Kodak's digital cameras, the strengthening yen  drove Kodak's digital losses, which had dropped to $52 million in the third quarter, back up to $92 million  the last three months. ''Our market share grew, but that couldn't counteract the impact of the strong yen,'' said Harry Kavetas, Kodak's chief financial officer. **********Kodak and Danka Business Systems pretty much rewrote the 1996 agreement under which Danka sells Kodak copiers. But Danka still owes Kodak millions of dollars, and few analysts expect Kodak will ever see that money. **********Kodak's much acclaimed cost-cutting program came up short in December, too, in part because lower demand for film and copiers drove down manufacturing volume. While Kodak cut annual costs by $730 million in 1998, it cut only $80 million out of fourth-quarter costs. **********Domestically, Kodak spent heavily to advertise its high-end Max film while reducing prices on older Kodak Gold films. The moves helped restore Kodak's share of the domestic film market to 70 percent, back from  67 percent in 1997, but ''the pricing pressures pretty much offset any gains they got from cost-cutting,'' Mr. Henderson said. **********Still, some analysts think the price cuts were a smart pre-emptory move. ''They are driving private-label manufacturers out,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an anlayst with Mercer, Bokert, Buckman & Reid. Others note that the price cuts are a shot across the bow of its archrival, Fuji Photo Film. **********Kodak has other bright spots looming. This year, it is expected to finally introduce its program for using America Online to deliver processed photographs electronically. It is also expected to roll out Picture CD, a method for providing developed photographs on compact disks. **********All told, few analysts took Kodak, despite its disappointments, off their buy lists. In fact, many say that at the 14 times estimated 1999 earnings it sells at, Kodak stock is a pretty good buy. As Mr. Enderlin of First Albany put it, ''You can't not be bullish when the stock's so cheap.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/26/business/the-media-business-cbs-chief-wants-to-acquire-nbc.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-02-26", "snippet": "CBS Corp president-chief executive Mel Karmazin, in seemingly off-the-cuff remark, says he would like to buy NBC from General Electric Co and would be willing to overpay 'to get a deal done,' address to American Association of Advertising Agencies...", "word_count": 179, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CBS Chief Wants To Acquire NBC", "print_headline": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS; CBS Chief Wants To Acquire NBC", "body_text": " **********In a seemingly off-the-cuff remark that set off immediate media attention, Mel Karmazin, the president and chief executive of the CBS Corporation, said yesterday that he would like to buy NBC from the General Electric Company and would be willing to overpay ''to get a deal done.'' **********Mr. Karmazin, speaking at the American Association of Advertising Agencies conference in New Orleans, repeated an interest that he has articulated before.

But investors are increasingly begging to differ. **********According to David Hale of the Zurich Group of financial companies in Chicago, investors are now so confident that economic globalization and technological innovation are mainly responsible for America's current prosperity that many believe that \"politicians have become irrelevant to the process.\" **********As in the period immediately before World War I \u2014 the previous high point of globalization \u2014 there is a widespread belief that business and corporate leaders, not politicians, are the dominant personalities reshaping the global economic order, Mr. Hale says. In any case, Mr. Clinton will either survive or be replaced for the rest of his term by Vice President Al Gore, whose economic philosophy is not very different. **********And insofar as Washington has contributed to economic growth, the credit is due primarily to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and to Robert Rubin, the Treasury secretary. **********In some fields where the president can make a difference, such as trade policy, Mr. Clinton has not been doing much anyway. As one top Washington trade lawyer puts it, \"Mr. Clinton's leadership on trade can hardly be missed, as he hasn't been showing any for the last four years.\" **********Of course, much of Wall Street's insouciance about impeachment is due to the belief that Mr. Clinton won't be removed from office. If he were, says Thomas Gallagher of Lehman Brothers in Washington, there would probably be \"a sharp but short negative reaction\" in the markets. **********Once it was clear that Mr. Clinton's economic team would remain in place, and continuity was established under Mr. Gore, confidence would quickly return.

No one is known to have fallen ill from wine made with the byproduct in question. **********Whether Chinese Customs is under pressure from domestic Chinese wine producers to restrict imports, or whether Chinese Customs is simply being unduly persnickety, remains unclear. **********In the last six months, as domestic stockpiles of a whole range of food and manufactured products have grown, China has banned a variety of imports, including pigs from Madagascar, horses from Zimbabwe and meat and dairy products from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany. China also banned all Dutch poultry, after a single chick was found to have chicken plague. **********This time, as in other cases, Chinese authorities pointed to a minor action taken by the government of another country as a justification for its reaction. **********''The wine sealed by the French authority was reported to be contaminated during the process of purification by the blood of a cow,'' The China Daily reported today. **********The newspaper said that health inspection bureaus in some Chinese provinces had ordered that all sales of French wine halt immediately while all wine imported from France had been taken off the shelves of some large department stores. **********Jean Louis Porry, a senior French diplomat responsible for agricultural affairs, said he was surprised by the ban because French and Chinese officials were in the process of what he thought was a simple procedure to certify that French wine imports were not contaminated. Then the ban suddenly came down late last week. **********''I don't understand it at all,'' Mr. Porry said. ''This wine comes from four small regions. This is only low-quality table wine. We are quite sure that none of it was being exported.'' **********The problem, tenuous as it might sound, began two years ago when Europe banned use of the bovine blood byproduct as a purifying agent in wine-making because of an outside chance that it could pass on spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease. **********In June, French officials discovered that winemakers in four small regions of southern France were still using the byproduct. But it affected less than 85,000 liters of wine out of 5.4 billion liters that France produces each year, and no cases of infection have been reported. **********Officially, China imported five  million liters of wine from France last year. Yet various executives  say that, as with countless other products, perhaps as much or more is also smuggled into China to avoid the 118 percent import duty. **********A French wine importer and distributor in Shanghai said that he was confused by the new ban. **********''This is very surprising,'' he said. ''You cannot export wine from France that is contaminated. Wine is such an important export that French Customs is extremely tough.'' **********He also expressed concern that the ban would unfairly create a negative impression of French wine in China, just as it is starting to become popular."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/world/mexican-candidate-plays-the-bad-boy.html": {"writer_name": "Julia Preston", "pub_date": "1999-11-05", "snippet": "Roberto Madrazo Pintado is running unexpectedly strong race in Mexico's governing party's presidential primary; his main opponent is Francisco Labastida Ochoa; Madrazo photo (M)", "word_count": 1694, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mexican Candidate Plays the Bad Boy", "print_headline": "Mexican Candidate Plays the Bad Boy", "body_text": " **********Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who is running an unexpectedly strong race in the governing party's presidential primary, delights in playing the bad boy. **********''They say Roberto Madrazo takes government money to spend on his own people. Well, it's true!'' reads the opener to one of his newspaper ads, a sassy reference to the accusations that he has used public funds to further his career. **********Then the ad shows Mr. Madrazo with ''his own people,'' a crowd of grinning truck farmers who benefited from one of the programs he created as governor of the state of Tabasco. **********Forged in the back-slapping politics of his gulf coast state, Mr. Madrazo relishes his reputation as a politician who is not afraid to flout the rules to get things done. He has mounted an effective campaign for the Mexican presidential nomination by styling himself as a renegade with the wile and guts to make bureaucrats pay attention to the little people they have long ignored. **********If Mr. Madrazo has populist flair, he is also a master of hardball machine politics who has shown he will use whatever resources he has -- including public funds -- to advance his career. And he has a streak of old-time demagoguery, easily bending facts to fit his political message. **********The primary in which Mr. Madrazo is running is the first one ever held by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has won every presidential election in Mexico for seven decades. His main opponent, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, is a silver-haired veteran of 37 years in government posts who personifies the candidate of caution. That has helped Mr. Madrazo cast himself as  an anti-establishment insurgent who pledges to give the grass roots and the provinces new power over the elite in Mexico City. **********Early in the primary campaign, party leaders were stunned when polls showed Mr. Madrazo ahead of Mr. Labastida. A highly effective series of television ads, and a catchy slogan, hit a nerve with Mexicans whose standard of living was devastated by a recession in the mid-90's. **********This week, after months of intensive campaigning, Mr. Labastida has taken the lead in the polls. But since this is the party's first primary and many of Mr. Madrazo's supporters are reluctant to express their views openly, the reliability of the surveys is uncertain. Whoever wins the vote, which is scheduled for Sunday, has a strong chance to become the next president of Mexico because the opposition is divided. **********In four and a half years as governor of Tabasco, a state rich in oil and poor in practically everything else, Mr. Madrazo proved that he is a deft politician with a popular touch. **********''Everybody in my family adores that man,'' said Juana Perez Sarracino, the 43-year-old owner of a street-corner grocery in Villahermosa, the state capital. ''No politician ever did more for us.'' **********Mr. Madrazo started a program to supply free textbooks to secondary school students. He built highways and bridges, badgered the national oil company into spending more money on local development and attracted some big-name commercial operations, like Sam's Club, to open stores in the state. **********Among party stalwarts he gains favor by being the son of Carlos Alberto Madrazo, a politician who spearheaded a movement to bring democracy to the governing party, which is known as the PRI, by holding internal elections for party leaders. When Carlos Madrazo was killed in an airplane accident in 1969, his reforms died with him. Roberto Madrazo's mother was also killed in the crash, leaving him an orphan at 16. **********Much of his appeal comes from his tenacity in pursuit of his ambitions and readiness to stand up to the powers-that-be. In fact, the incident that his critics regard as most damning to his reputation is one that inspires his followers. **********The 1994 election in which he became governor was challenged by opponents who accused him of campaign spending violations and vote-buying. He denied any wrongdoing, but a review by federal election officials, ordered by President Ernesto Zedillo, revealed ample evidence of fraud. Mr. Zedillo tried to get Mr. Madrazo to resign, but he refused. His supporters in Tabasco staged an uprising, paralyzing the state capital. Finally Mr. Zedillo backed down. **********''I've always been willing to take things to the ultimate consequences in order to break with vested interests,'' Mr. Madrazo said of his philosophy in an interview. **********Mr. Madrazo does not look the part of the Kingfish. He is slight of frame, and getting slighter with the rigors of the campaign. At 47, he still looks youthful, with few patches of gray in his neatly clipped hair. In conversation he is attentive and soft-spoken. But when he takes to the stump, his resonant voice rises to make soaring speeches. **********But his speeches, though crowd-thrilling, often stray from the facts. Mr. Madrazo was accustomed to doing politics in Tabasco, where the PRI still has hammerlock control. **********One of Mr. Madrazo's most frequently repeated campaign promises to PRI followers is that he will finish what his father started by bringing democracy to the party. But PRI leaders in Tabasco said that as governor he ruled the party there with iron top-down control. **********Last year the state PRI in Tabasco elected its party president for the first time. But Mr. Madrazo's candidate was defeated and Hector Arguello, a federal senator and longtime leader of farmers' groups, won. **********''The marriage didn't last six months,'' Mr. Arguello said in an interview. Faced with what he described as a relentless war of attrition with Governor Madrazo, he resigned as state party president, and in September he left the party. **********Mr. Madrazo dismissed Senator Arguello's resignation as ''a personal decision.'' He insisted that the Tabasco PRI was a model for what he would like to achieve nationally. **********Raul Ojeda, who as a PRI federal deputy also locked horns with Mr. Madrazo over party politics, said: ''He ran Tabasco as though it were a cattle ranch. There was no room for those of us who spoke up to challenge him.'' **********In his campaign, Mr. Madrazo has made much of his success at attracting investment, both Mexican and foreign, to Tabasco. But the man Mr. Madrazo appointed to lead his drive to woo investors to Tabasco said the governor had repeatedly sabotaged his efforts, and after 18 months on the job he, too, resigned in protest. **********Gerardo Priego Tapia, 34, who ran a family air-conditioning company and who holds a master's degree in public administration from New York University, was approved by Mr. Madrazo head the Tabasco Foundation, a new economic development board. **********Mr. Priego said Mr. Madrazo and officials in his government had used information from talks with potential investors to force up the price of their property purchases and had asked for payments to the government that struck investors as inappropriate. **********When Mr. Priego voiced his complaints, Mr. Madrazo's government harassed his family. In mid-1998 Mr. Priego quit the foundation and also closed his business in the state. **********''I concluded that he didn't want powerful private investors from outside the state because he didn't like to lose political control,'' Mr. Priego said. ''He didn't want to share the stage with anyone that didn't depend on him.'' **********Mr. Madrazo said Mr. Priego's incompetence had scared away the investors. **********When his presidential campaign began, Mr. Madrazo caught Mexicans' attention with the series of expertly produced television advertisements touting his work as governor. ''Who says it can't be done?'' went the upbeat slogan that voters everywhere began repeating. **********But the ads illustrated Mr. Madrazo's penchant for pushing the law to the limit, and sometimes beyond, to further his goals. His rivals complained that he had used funds from the Tabasco state treasury to promote himself, and they tried unsuccessfully to get the party authorities to block him from using the slogan. **********Responding to these charges, Mr. Madrazo gave a detailed account in an interview of how the ads were put together. **********He said he spent about $8.5 million a year over three years from two lines in the Tabasco budget that were earmarked for promoting the successes of state programs. He said Carlos Alazraki, the advertising executive who made the ads, was hired by the Tabasco government in 1996 to promote its achievements, long before Mr. Madrazo had decided to run for the presidential nomination. And he added that the funds had been approved by all parties in the Tabasco legislature. **********Copies of the state budget for the last two years, which were provided by Mr. Madrazo's allies in the legislature, show that they did include funds for promotion of state projects, but they amounted to about half the sum Mr. Madrazo mentioned. The money was not authorized in two budget lines, but in more than a dozen line items buried in outlays for agencies across the government. It remains unclear where the rest of the money for the ads came from. **********Mr. Alazraki, even though he is one of Mr. Madrazo's closest supporters, said that he had begun his work for the Tabasco government in August 1998, not two years earlier, and that Mr. Madrazo ''must have his dates mixed up.'' **********And Carlos Alberto Valenzuela, who represents a major opposition party in the state legislature, said he never intended to approve funds for Mr. Madrazo's ads when he voted in favor of the overall state budgets. ''It offends me that he has the nerve to say that,'' Mr. Valenzuela said. **********Mr. Madrazo's past in Tabasco may yet come back to haunt him. **********So far he has eluded prosecution on charges that he took illegal donations and exceeded campaign spending laws in the 1994 governor's election. **********In 1996 the federal attorney general determined, based on financial documents provided by the opposition, that Mr. Madrazo had spent at least $38.6 million in his race for governor of Tabasco, a state of about 1.8 million people. **********That amount was roughly 30 times the legal limit in Tabasco and similar to the eye-popping war chest that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has amassed for a national campaign in the United States. **********But since the vote was governed by state laws, the attorney general had to turn the investigation over to officials in Tabasco, who were appointed by Mr. Madrazo. They quickly shelved it. **********If Mr. Madrazo becomes the presidential candidate, opposition leaders have said they will renew efforts to bring him to account."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/13/news/function-vs-fantasy-prada-and-gucci-slug-it-out.html": {"writer_name": "Suzy Menkes", "pub_date": "1999-01-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Function vs. Fantasy :Prada and Gucci Slug It Out", "print_headline": "Function vs. Fantasy :Prada and Gucci Slug It Out", "body_text": " **********THEY are the fashion titans of the 1990s. In one corner, a streak of blood red across the sleek hair, scarlet sequins dripping on the jacket and the crescendo from \u2018\u2018Psycho\u2019\u2019 on the soundtrack. **********On the other side, a khaki-clad figure, bag strapped to the chest, ready to stride out on biker boots into the urban jungle. **********This war of two fashion worlds has been mademore piquant with the announcement on Tuesday that Prada has sold its 9.5 percent stake in Gucci to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, thus increasing the possibility that Gucci will be taken over by the French luxury-goods company. At the same time, Prada itself hopes to cooperate on an undisclosed basis with LVMH. Both factors have important implications for the fashion industry. **********Gucci and Prada have come to represent two opposing fashion philosophiesat the end of the 20th century: hedonism and optimism versus function and utility. Judging by their current menswsear shows (viewed on-line and on tape), theyhave both entrenched their positions. **********\u2018\u2018I started with the same inspiration as last season: optimism, more color, more relaxed **********not minimal, but the clothes worn in a minimal way,\u2019\u2019 said Gucci\u2019s Tom Ford, referring to the white V-necked T-shirts that cooled down the rich velvet jackets and embroidered jeans or partnered the piebald fur coats and sleek suits. **********Prada, by contrast, was strictly practical: flap pockets, omnipresent zippers, tab fastenings and a military palette of khaki, fawn, gold, ginger and brown.These clothes were not just sporty but ergonomic, with a sense that form and function are inseparable. Even the capes \u2014 one a military archetype in khaki with a red lining \u2014 looked like genuine outerwear. **********\u2018\u2018Protection is an important point and I wanted to make formal things more functional,\u2019\u2019 said Miuccia Prada, referring to bicycle clips on workplace clothing and boots with everything. **********Both houses are quintessentially 1990s in that they deal in items. That means that any piece, isolated from a powerful presentation, has a distinctive character. That might mean (since both are historically accessory houses) the footwear: Prada\u2019s biker-meets-hiker rubber-toed boots, showcased by pants cropped below the knee; or Gucci\u2019s square-toed, patent-leather shoes, catching the light like the oil-slicked hair.Ford sees the shiny feet as part of \u2018\u2018the need to clean things up a bit.\u2019\u2019 **********But clothes are also used like accessories to highlight an otherwise simple outfit. These modern-minded designers have understood that the current look is never fastidiously put together and that the perfectly cut flat-front pant (Prada) or the ultimate leather jacket (Gucci) can be the compass point around which a wardrobe turns. **********The blurring of clothes and accessories is underscored byPrada\u2019s latest hit:the \u2018\u2018hands-free\u2019\u2019 bag built into a garment. Prada has developed a lexicon of signature pieces from the original, much-copied nylon bag. Now the body-bag has been developed for the fall season on the front of an anorak, at the waist or fitted under a jacket. **********Sensuality rather than practicality is emphasized at Gucci.Tactile deep-pile fabrics like the iridescent velvet jackets still have a whiff of the hippies. Then there is the fur: patchworks of pieces forming a camouflage effect on a vest; fur collars, linings or splashy coats. **********It can be ultra-cool to be low-key. Prada\u2019s aim is to blend luxury items \u2014 brown suit, gold suede jacket or even soft-as-silk track suits worn with elegant loafers \u2014into the urban landscape. **********You could spot the more showy pieces at Gucci, where the flower-decorated jeans have a Hollywood allure and where the red and green string belt looks like an instant status symbol. But there are also quieter classics:well-proportioned sweaters or blazers in felted cashmere to whichFord gave raw edges. **********Reviewing the collections on-line, Prada\u2019s show lookedmeatier than Gucci\u2019s. But the significance of both collections is that they reinforce already strong images of houses that have marked the 1990s.If LVMH gets Gucci, and if Ford stays at the creative helm, the war for the hearts, bodies and feet of the luxury consumer can only escalate. **********SUZY MENKES is fashion editor of the International Herald Tribune."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/09/business/company-news-pinnacle-holdings-to-buy-communication-towers.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-09-09", "snippet": "Pinnacle Holdings Inc, which rents space on communication towers in Southeast to telecommunications companies, says it has agreed to buy 552 towers and other sites for $50 million to continue its consolidation plan; deal involves 20 separate trans...", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PINNACLE HOLDINGS TO BUY COMMUNICATION TOWERS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; PINNACLE HOLDINGS TO BUY COMMUNICATION TOWERS", "body_text": " **********Pinnacle Holdings Inc., which rents space on communication towers in the Southeast to telecommunications companies, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy 552 towers and other sites for $50 million to continue its consolidation plan.

He was 72. **********Mr. Eversman suffered an infection after receiving chemotherapy treatment for myelodisplasia, a failure of the bone marrow to produce enough blood cells, said his wife, Elizabeth. A passionate golfer and skier, Mr. Eversman had bounced back from previous chemotherapy sessions to play golf again last summer, before the fungal infection. **********In a career that spanned 35 years on Madison Avenue, Mr. Eversman rose from the mail room of the J. Walter Thompson Company's Detroit office to executive positions with that agency and, later, with N. W. Ayer Inc. He managed the accounts of a long list of advertisers, including the Ford Motor Company, Eastman Kodak and the United States Army. **********The Army assignment, which Mr. Eversman took on at N. W. Ayer in New York, was somewhat ironic because ''he was a steadfast Marine himself,'' said his eldest son, Mark. **********Mr. Eversman, who enlisted in the Marines at 17, was in boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., when Japan surrendered in World War II. He was discharged and enrolled at Purdue University before the corps called him back up during the Korean War. **********He returned to Purdue in West Lafayette, Ind., where his father had been a star athlete and basketball coach before embarking on his own advertising career in Detroit. After graduation from Purdue, Mr. Eversman joined J. Walter Thompson, where one of the accounts he managed was that of the Marine Corps. **********In 1974, Thompson named him manager of New York advertising and promoted him to executive vice president. A year later, he returned to Detroit as general manager of Thompson's office there. He left Thompson in 1977 to join N. W. Ayer, where he remained for more than 10 years. **********When he retired from N. W.

Abandoned belongings and plastic bags littered the ground. Baby food and even identification cards were dropped in the mud. **********On Tuesday night some 45,000 refugees were deported from the border camp at Blace, evacuated on buses and dispersed throughout the region. The operation, unannounced and executed by the Macedonian authorities under cover of darkness, was chaotic. **********More than 10,000 refugees remained unaccounted for 24 hours later, said a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The organization was trying to verify reports that refugees had been sent in buses to Greece, Turkey and Albania. **********''We are working to locate them,'' said Paula Ghedini, the spokeswoman. ''Because it was not announced, we only found out from other people.'' **********The agency has complained about the evacuation to the Macedonian Government, which has said repeatedly that it cannot handle the tens of thousands of refugees. Today, Deputy Prime Minister Radmila Kiprijanova said at a news conference that 9,500 refugees had been taken to Albania by bus and that some would be flown to Germany. **********The bulk of the refugees, about 45,000, were dumped during the night in new camps down the road or elsewhere in northern Macedonia. In the chaos of the operation, many families were split up. **********After the terror of forced expulsion from Kosovo, fleeing their homes and losing everything they own, hundreds lost family members in the crush and are clamoring for news and information. **********The camp here at Blace, home for more than a week to an estimated 65,000 people, was deserted today. The makeshift shelters of plastic sheeting and blankets were abandoned. Nothing moved across the hillside and fields except scraps of rubbish blowing around. Where thousands of voices had created a constant din, there was silence. **********The smell of thousands of unwashed people, crammed closely together, still hung in the air. Clothes and blankets were heaped together in a huge pile, as if people had dropped them as they filed past on the way to the buses. **********No one was crossing the border from Serbia, and there were unconfirmed reports that the border had been closed. **********The Macedonian authorities began loading up and busing out refugees two days ago. For some reason they suddenly accelerated the operation and in 24 hours cleared out more than 45,000 people. They were moved directly, bypassing the transit camps where they were to get food, water, showers and clothing. **********While aid workers interviewed here agreed that it would have been impossible to keep the thousands at Blace, they expressed concern at the Government's methods. They said they wanted to insure in the future that all refugees were registered before they were moved out. **********Some 10,000 were sent to Albania, the Macedonian Government announced today. It is not clear whether Albania, which has been overwhelmed with more than 200,000 ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo in recent weeks, was consulted on the move. **********Another 1,500 refugees, wet mud still clogging their shoes, were sent straight to the Skopje airport and boarded planes for Turkey. **********Ms. Ghedini said aid workers had told her that a convoy of 20 buses crammed with refugees had been observed driving as far as the border with Greece, apparently on its way to Turkey. Greece has offered to take 4,000 refugees and Turkey 20,000. **********Ms. Ghedini said there was evidence that the refugees had been given no choice in how or where they were sent. ''We do have some concern that some sort of pressure was used,'' she said. ''It is not clear if they were taken forcibly, but we do know it was involuntary. Refugees do not usually leave their possessions behind.'' **********There were many accounts of refugees who did not know where they were headed and who were separated from family members as they boarded the buses. **********Just a few miles down the road in a new tented refugee camp, Ejup Kamerolli said he had lost two teen-age sons. ''The police separated us as I was passing to the buses,'' he said. ''They put the children in the bus and made us step back. I saw them drive off, but I do not know where they went.'' **********Close to tears, Mr. Kamerolli, a former policeman from northern Kosovo, was standing with dozens of others to register lost children at a table set up by Save the Children. **********''I am not afraid they will be lost,'' he said. ''While they are with other Albanians they will be O.K., but I just want to know where they are.'' **********If the refugees had been given proper information they would have insisted on staying together, Ms. Ghedini said. She added that the haste of the operation and disregard for the splitting up of families had made the job of tracing refugees harder. **********Aid workers compiling the lists said they feared that the problem of missing children was enormous. In just two hours in two camps, Save the Children registered 56 parents who had lost children and 26 children who had lost their parents on Tuesday, said Christina Gale, a representative of the group. **********Refugees clustered around the table in front of her. One woman, Blerina Qyqalla, lost her 5-year-old in the crush of the nighttime exodus from Blace. A 7-year-old boy was found completely alone, separated from his parents by the police at the border. **********Yusuf Bajgore was registering his three small nephews. Their parents had somehow been separated from them inside Kosovo, when they were expelled from the capital, Pristina, by Serbian forces. **********''I have been looking everywhere for them,'' Mr. Bajgore said. ''We are still living in the open. I have not even had time to organize a tent. I have only rumors, that someone saw them somewhere. Nothing else. The children are crying, but at least they are with relatives -- otherwise they would go crazy.'' **********Despite the anguish of so many separations, refugees in the Stankovic camp a few miles down the road were enjoying small pleasures and daily routines. Women washed babies with bottles of water and strung clothes on the wire fences to dry. **********Children ran to watch as NATO forces used twin-motor Chinook helicopters to fly in more tents. American marines arrived to hand out bread and water from trucks, and they set up more tents for the sudden influx of about 6,000 people in the last two days, shooing children back with their hands and big grins. **********Part of the 24th Marine Expedition Unit, they had come off the amphibious assault ship Nassau in the Mediterranean and were enjoying their first spell on dry land in weeks. ''They were excited to get off, after five weeks on board eating dry rations,'' said Lieut. Jason Arthaud, in command of 50 men. **********Yet the camp remains a secure zone and refugees are fenced in, with Macedonian soldiers and guards at the gate. Aid workers expressed concern that refugees were not allowed to leave the camp, even when some have relatives and houses available to them in Macedonia and abroad. **********''In a few weeks it could be like camps for Cambodians -- that is, concentration camps,'' said a physician with Doctors of the World who spoke on condition of anonymity. **********The refugees were pessimistic about their future. ''I think I will never see my homeland again,'' said Fazile Pervetica, a grandmother, as she looked over two tiny children sleeping on a blanket on the ground. ''I am too afraid of Milosevic to try to go back.'' **********Her two sons had remained inside Kosovo to guard the houses, Mrs. Pervetica said. ''We do not know if they are alive or dead,'' she said. She has fled Serbian forces several times in recent months and said she could not face moving further, even though she had yet to find a tent. **********''They can take us anywhere they want,'' she said.

Relatives are expected to start arriving in Germany for private reunions with the three men tomorrow. **********''They are all in good health,'' said Colonel Mack Blanton, chief of clinical services at Landstuhl, after the soldiers' first checkup. ''The injuries that we've seen so far are not major injuries.'' **********He said the most noticeable symptom of their time in captivity was that the former prisoners -- all in their early 20s -- could not seem to get enough to eat, even though the crew of the C-9 medical evacuation plane that picked them up in Zagreb, Croatia, had brought stacks of pizza and take-out hamburgers. **********The soldiers, carefree and bantering during much of their nine-hour journey from the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, with the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, seemed transformed by the time they stepped onto the tarmac from an Air Force medical evacuation plane. **********They stood erect, gave a thumbs-up sign, crisply saluted a line of senior officers who were waiting to greet them, and stiffly submitted to hugs from their commanders before climbing into a helicopter for the trip to the medical center. **********The three were accompanied by Mr. Jackson, who had gone to Belgrade with an interfaith delegation of American religious leaders to appeal to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to free the soldiers. Mr. Jackson said the success of his mission could be an opportunity to break what he called the ''cycle of violence'' in the NATO bombing campaign and Serb violence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. **********But the emphasis of the day was on the former prisoners, and not on diplomacy. The soldiers, in a series of encounters with reporters, described their last days in prison as nerve-wracking and, in the final moments, bittersweet. **********Staff Sgt. Christopher J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich., said that on Friday afternoon they were taken from their prison cells -- he said he believed they were somewhere in Belgrade because they could hear traffic noises from outside -- to meet Mr. Jackson for the first time. **********On the windows of the room where they waited, someone had taped paper printed with a target. Since the start of NATO bombing, many Serbs have worn T-shirts or signs with targets as a protest against the air strikes. Seeing the bulls-eye drawings caused the soldiers, who had been kept separately in small cells with almost no contact with outsiders, some moments of alarm. **********''We thought we were left to be in a bombing situation,'' Sergeant Stone said. ''But that wasn't the case. It was just a prank.'' **********The three were told the next day, Saturday, just before bedtime that they would be released, and excitement kept them up all night, said Staff Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles, and Specialist Steven M. Gonzales, 22, of Huntsville, Tex. **********But when the time came to say goodbye to their guards, the soldiers said they felt mixed emotions. **********''They were very kind to us,'' said Sergeant Stone. ''As we were leaving them, it was kind of sad to know there's this war going on and we're leaving and they're left behind.'' **********He said they shook hands with the guards and the Yugoslav Army officers who came in the morning to hand them over to a visiting delegation of American religious leaders. ''We told them that we would continue to pray for a peaceful end to this crisis,'' Sergeant Stone said. **********Speaking at the air base, Mr. Jackson urged NATO and the United States to respond to the gesture by reopening negotiations with Mr.Milosevic, even though many officials have said he can not be trusted. **********''Some would say that Milosevic let them go as a cynical gesture, but what would they have said if he had kept them?'' Mr. Jackson said, adding that President Clinton, as Commander in Chief, ''must weigh in.'' **********More details emerged about the imprisonment of the three during their trip out of Belgrade because they stopped and spoke to journalists several times along the journey. **********The soldiers said they could not talk about the circumstances of their capture until they are interviewed by military investigators. But they did tell some of the clergy who traveled with them after their release that in the first days after they were seized, they were beaten and kicked and for a time had hoods placed over their heads so they could not see where they were. **********The mistreatment occurred only at the the beginning of their captivity, said Sergeant Stone, and then they were treated properly. He should know, he said, because the first books provided the soldiers by their prison guards were in English, about the Geneva Convention. ''Oh, we sure did read them,'' he said with a smile. ''I think all three of us now fully understand our rights under the Geneva Convention.'' **********Sergeant Stone said he drew himself an American flag on a piece of toilet paper and kept it with him ''as a symbol of my country.'' He brought it out with his few possessions when he was freed. **********Specialist Gonzalez and Sergeant Ramirez talked extensively about how their faith sustained them. ''I always had memories of my family and friends and always the Lord my God as my companion,'' said Sergeant Ramirez, who had a birthday in captivity on April 10. **********Mr. Jackson praised the three soldiers for behaving well while living under pressure and ''in a vacuum,'' as he put it. ''They never broke. They kept their dignity, their poise, their self-respect,'' he said. ''They represent the best that this generation has to offer and we thank God to be their fellow Americans.'' **********The freed prisoners left Belgrade at about 8:15 A.M., traveling in a Yugoslav bus under police escort to the border with Croatia. From the Croatian border, the soldiers were then transferred to a Croation tourist bus rented by the United States Embassy and -- still in the company of the ministers, priests and other clergy in the Jackson delegation -- were driven to the Pleso airstrip in Zagreb and then flown to Ramstein. **********As he had since arriving in Belgrade on Thursday night, Mr. Jackson proved himself a master at stage-managing events. In meetings with Yugoslav officials, Mr. Jackson grabbed the initiative by seizing their hands and holding on as he said prayers for peace in Kosovo. He gave the soldiers quick lessons in media stardom, coaching the three in a refrain that they were to repeat at his signal at several stops on their journey to Germany. **********Holding hands, they chanted for each new set of cameras, ''Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at last.'' **********The soldiers took their cues with good humor, bowing their heads in prayer with Mr. Jackson when bidden, joining hands and doing their chant. At one stop, however, Staff Sgt. Ramirez turned to Specialist Gonzales and joked, ''This is the last time we're going to hold hands.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/21/technology/surfing-in-circles-and-loving-it.html": {"writer_name": "Tina Kelley", "pub_date": "1999-01-21", "snippet": "Internet surfing using Web ring makes it easier for people with similar interests or hobbies to communicate with each other; Web rings are circles of Internet pages on various topics that are linked democratically, by their creators, as opposed to...", "word_count": 2242, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Surfing in Circles And Loving It", "print_headline": "Surfing in Circles And Loving It", "body_text": " **********IF using a search engine can be like drinking from a fire hose, Internet surfing using a Web ring is like sharing a cup of tea with a group of strangers who are batty about a favorite hobby, like collecting Australian emergency-squad insignia. **********Web rings are circles of Internet pages on various topics that are linked democratically, by their creators, a change from the wider Web's more official and commercial clamor. The rings provide homespun displays of hobbies, obscure and common expertise and general camaraderie. **********More than 60,000 Web rings, including more than one million member sites, can be searched via Web Ring (webring.org), which was purchased in December by Geocities, the free home-page service. There are structures similar to Web rings, like Looplink (www.looplink.com) and The Rail (www.therail.com); Web Ring is the largest of its type. **********A Web ring is like a giant backyard fence, said Bruce J. Zanca, a Geocities spokesman. ''It allows all the people who are interested in the same topic to move in next door to each other, click on an icon, go to their neighbors' houses and see what's doing in there,'' he added. **********It all started in June 1995, when Sage Weil, a high-school student in Ashland, Ore., wrote some computer code to link Web sites, or particular pages from various sites, in rings. Mr. Weil is now a junior studying computer science at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif., and is still involved with Web Ring. The main advantage of a Web ring, he said, was that ''it allows anyone to create their own little community.'' **********Webmasters join a ring by adding to their pages the code that can be found on the home page of the particular ring. Surfers are then able to move from one site in the ring to another by clicking the Forward or Back buttons, the Show Next Five Sites button or a button that will call up a site at random from the ring. By hitting the Forward button enough times, surfers can usually travel through the entire ring and eventually land back at the beginning. But some Web rings, like The Rail, take you straight through the sites without looping you back to the beginning. **********''Looking for something in a Web ring is easier than doing a search because search engines have gotten so difficult, they just don't pick up the site you want and you get 400,000 hits,'' said Gayla Nelson of Guymon, Okla., who runs a personal Web site called www.gaylasgarden.com, which has 316 pages, including a place to adopt virtual houseplants. ''If you're doing a search for a Web ring on prisoners of war, you get whole sites devoted to them, not just sites with a dedication page about P.O.W.'s.'' **********Gayla's Garden receives about 100 hits a day, about 10 percent of them via the 20 rings Ms. Nelson has joined, which include Moms With Modems, the Original ICQ Web ring (based on the instant messaging system) and a Christmas ring. **********''You get a lot more traffic because some people surf through Web rings and just want to look at pet pages or recipe pages,'' Ms. Nelson said. **********Charley Lanusse, chief operating officer of Geocities' Starseed division, which operates Web Ring, conceded that fewer sites were searched through Web rings than through search engines. But one of the things driving the Web-ring phenomenon is the explosive growth in personal home pages, sites run by individuals -- not companies or schools or governments -- that usually cover hobbies, opinions, lists of favorite ska recordings, earnest poetry, pictures of pets and links to other sites. Geocities said it had two million personal home pages last June and now has 3.4 million. **********Rings linking similar sites have sprouted up to embrace People Born on the Fifth of May, anything having to do with Mendham, N.J. (population 4,890) and fans of fractal art, plus connoisseurs of Hanson, cribbage players, fans of particular songs and, of course, people who have derogatory things to say about Web rings. **********For surfers interested in certain topics, Web rings provide more content per click than search engines. The rings are frequently run by people who are passionate, informed and up to date about their topic of choice and who monitor the editorial content of the ring and cull the Web, focusing on their particular passion. **********Most rings can be searched through the home page of Web Ring, though most people first run across rings by noticing the Forward and Back buttons at the bottom of a Web page in a ring they landed on while surfing. **********That's how William and Pauline Stout of Hamilton, Ontario, discovered Web rings. Now they run nine of them. **********''We happened to be surfing through, looking for graphics,'' Mr. Stout said, ''and we happened on one that said Web-site-design Web ring.'' The couple hope that the Web design business they run will get them off their disability pensions, Mr. Stout added. **********The Stouts have found Web rings helpful in promoting their growing business, at www.execulink.com/wstout, and have enjoyed the camaraderie the Web ring offers with other Web page designers. ''If one person is good at what they do, it promotes the others,'' Mr. Stout said, ''so you're not just helping yourself, you're helping other people in your group.'' He has also started rings to connect E-mail pen pals, to promote helping the homeless and to welcome newcomers to the Web. **********But the rings are not entirely rosy. Those that aren't carefully watched by ringmasters tend to have defunct pages that break the circle. Sources of information are hard to verify, especially on personal home pages, and many surfers are unaware that rings even exist. **********Paul M. A. Baker, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., who studies on-line communities, said Web rings offered ''a lot of peripheral on-the-edge sort of stuff -- someone writing about the maintenance of varnishes on wooden handgun stocks, really weird stuff.'' If a site was really substantive, he said, it would not need to join a ring but would be picked up by surfers using search engines. **********''The Web ring seems to be kind of a way to give strength to the aggregate, as if having links of related things created a whole out of it,'' he said. ''I wouldn't rely on anything there unless I knew the quality of the source itself.'' **********The rings remind him of how surveys are conducted to determine the leaders in any society: ask people who are the influential ones, then ask those influential people for the names of the influential, until there are no more names. **********''There's a finite number of self-referencing links,'' Professor Baker said, and the same is true within Web rings. **********Until the Geocities purchase in December, the Web ring phenomenon had been short on commercialization, one of its main selling points in the eyes of Net surfers who are sick of spam and flickering advertisements. **********''It does seem like there's a substrate of the Web out there that increasingly won't show up in the commercial search engines,'' said Marc A. Smith, a research sociologist at Microsoft. ''Web rings are endogenous. They bubble up from below.'' **********He appreciates rings for the way members direct traffic to one another. ''The fact that they're doing it noncommercially and cooperatively is one of the very positive things about the Net,'' Mr. Smith said, especially when some search engines charge fees to companies that want to make sure that their sites get preferred placement in the list of search results, he said. **********When Geocities bought Web Ring, ring members fretted that rings would lose their cachet as a sanctuary from commercialism. **********''Geocities is generally loathed because of its hideous pop-up ads and the watermark,'' said a Webmaster for a ring, Kymm Zuckert of Weehawken, N.J., referring to the advertising pages that attempt to capture the interest of visitors to Geocities sites and to the Geocities' watermark, an animated G that often appears. ''If Geocities tries to do any of that with Web Ring, there will be a massive exodus.'' **********Pop-up ads and watermarks have been very unpopular with Geocities users, and the company says they will not appear on Web rings but will show up, as they always have, on Geocities home pages. **********Mr. Weil, who wrote the code that glues Web rings together, said he did not want to see the rings commercialized and did not think Geocities would do that. ''I think what makes Web rings really useful is the Webmasters say, 'I'm going to create a Web ring, something that's valuable,' and they have a certain attachment to it,'' he said. ''I was very leery of betraying their trust in Web Ring, to allow them to create something they're personally responsible for and own, and then if some company starts plastering ads on their sites, they're like, Hello, this is the site that I did. **********''Geocities was very understanding of the sensitivities the ringmasters have. As soon as the merger was announced, people in the rings were saying 'no pop-ups, no watermarks, blah blah blah,' but from our perspective, it was very clear and obvious that that would never happen.'' **********But Professor Baker, no fan of commercialism, said advertising could offer a seal of approval to sites that might otherwise lack credibility. **********''To some extent, a site with ads tells you something in a way of validation -- at least someone else feels this is worthy of putting money on,'' Professor Baker said. ''The fact that there are no ads there tells you that the site is not perceived as much of a market.'' **********Mr. Lanusse, of Geocities, said Web Ring had a different mechanism for advertising than Geocities: most Web Ring advertisements appear on the screen that introduces the next five pages in the ring. He does not expect that to change, he said. Mr. Zanca, the Geocities spokesman, said his company, which paid about $25 million in stock and cash for Web Ring, was interested in some unused advertising space on the rings and in how Web rings could increase traffic to Geocities home pages. **********But the spirit of Web rings remains decidedly not corporate. Dinty W. Moore, an English professor at the Altoona campus of Pennsylvania State University, likes Web rings because they let computer users shape the Internet, much as Usenet participants create their own newsgroups. **********''Internet users in search of some method to the random madness of the Web have latched onto an organizing method that they control,'' said Professor Moore, author of ''The Emperor's Virtual Clothes'' (Algonquin Books, 1995). ''They create the rings, they add the pages, they spin off new, ever-more-specific rings. Where portals like Yahoo aspire to be 'media networks,' by shaping and organizing the topic areas by which Web info is defined, Web rings are very grass-roots.'' **********As in other places on the Web, irrepressible rants and raves and self-reflexive groups pop up in rings. **********''There's a Web-ring Web ring, a ring about rings,'' said Scott Wenzel of Knoxville, Md., who runs Child Free (www.fred.net /turtle/kids/ring.html), a ring for people who have chosen not to have children. He belongs to several rings -- about cats, Swedish cars, the blues and antique tractors -- but he won't visit any ring about Web rings. **********''I'm worried I'll get sucked into a black hole and end up in another side of the universe,'' he said. **********Site-Seeing: Ring Around the Whatever **********For every thing there is a Web ring, and a site for every purpose under heaven: **********OPEN PAGES: www.hedgehog.net/op -- A collection of nearly 700 on-line personal journals, a ring so large that it has sprawled into ''suburbs,'' Web rings that are more focused, with, for example, journals by atheists or by people who promise to write about more than just what they did all day. A related list divides the journal-ists into categories like military brats, Hawaiians and others. **********FREE TO BE WE: members.xoom.com/TWCDesign/WEFREE -- For people with multiple personalities.

Cohen. [Page 4.] **********A diminutive man with twinkling eyes, Sheik Isa was very much a man who enjoyed life, ruling with a mischievous touch. **********He had dozens of wives -- though never more than four at a time, in keeping with his Muslim religion, and presided until late in life at what was known as Emir's beach, to which foreigners but not Bahrainis were welcomed. Female beachgoers who caught his eye were routinely invited to join the Emir for coffee, on a terrace overlooking the Persian Gulf. **********Even today, in their last conversation, Mr. Cohen said later, he had chided Sheik Isa, a longtime friend, telling him that his next destination in the United States should be Las Vegas, not New York. **********It was with a similar impetuousness that Sheik Isa ruled Bahrain since 1961, winning his country many friends and considerable wealth but sometimes offending people in the process. **********He declared Bahrain's independence from Britain in 1971, then maintained a pro-Western line in foreign policy. The country is now the base of the United States Fifth Fleet, which has also provoked resentment at home against the foreign military presence. **********The Emir's policies also angered Iraq, the tiny Emirate's giant neighbor, whose leaders remember that Sheik Isa allowed Bahrain to be used as a Western air base for attacks on Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. **********With an early eye to economic diversification, Sheik Isa also presided over bold changes that established Bahrain as a major financial center. **********Though oil was discovered in Bahrain as early as the 1930's, it was never found in large quantities, and as a headquarters to foreign banks and other businesses, Bahrain became proof that it was possible to prosper in the Middle East without vast energy reserves. **********But Sheik Isa was careful also to maintain an alliance with the region's economic and military powerhouse, Saudi Arabia, with which it is connected by a causeway and from which it receives oil from a shared field. **********When it came to sharing power, however, Sheik Isa was often at his most mercurial. A Constitution adopted in 1973 established Bahrain as only the second gulf Arab state, after Kuwait, to have an elected Parliament. But Sheik Isa dissolved Parliament in August 1975 after a showdown with left-wing members over domestic and regional policies. The Constitution was also suspended. **********In 1992, Sheik Isa consolidated the retreat away from even limited democracy by issuing a decree that replaced the National Assembly with a 30-member consultative council, with its members to be appointed by the Emir. **********That kind of heavy hand often served to maintain an atmosphere of domestic tranquillity in Bahrain, even as the Iranian revolution of 1979 and instability in Iraq served to underscore the dangers of the region. **********But it never fully capped the anger felt by many Bahrainis, particularly the majority population of Shiite Muslims, toward Sheik Isa and his ruling Khalifa family, who are Sunnis. **********In the Emir's final years, that bitterness was exposed in a significant way, through a low-level campaign of violence that claimed some two dozen lives after 1994 and resulted in the jailing of hundreds of Shiite Muslim activists. **********Many Government opponents said their only demand was that Parliament be reestablished. But Sheik Isa preferred to remain impervious, greeting visitors to his palace with generous gifts while his aides advised them not to try to question him on domestic political subjects."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/27/business/the-markets-currencies.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-03-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 33, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES", "body_text": " **********THE EURO FALLS.

He threatened to sue the auditing company, PricewaterhouseCoopers, if its conclusions were proved wrong. **********Indonesian regulators commissioned Pricewaterhouse to audit the Bank Bali case in August. The I.M.F., which is leading the economic rescue effort, then demanded that the investigation be expanded to include the central bank. At that point, Pricewaterhouse was engaged as an agent for Indonesia's Supreme Audit Agency. After a two-week inquiry using 20 auditors, Pricewaterhouse submitted its findings, copies of which have since circulated to the press. **********The central bank's protest is the latest fallout from a campaign by the I.M.F. and the World Bank to force Indonesia to eliminate persistent corruption in its financial system. **********While the United Nations prepares to send in troops to protect the people of East Timor from militias bitterly opposed to the recent referendum vote favoring independence, the two lending agencies are threatening the financial equivalent of armed intervention, a strategy that bankers and economists warn could easily backfire. ''It's a dangerous ploy,'' said David Fernandez, an economist for J. P. Morgan in Singapore. **********The I.M.F. and the World Bank have already poured $10 billion into Indonesia as part of the economic rescue package, assembled in 1997, early in the Asian financial crisis. **********When Indonesian soldiers joined in or countenanced the militia violence, and the Government initially refused to accept a peace force, the two international lenders suspended discussions with Jakarta on releasing an additional $2.3 billion in aid. **********President B. J. Habibie has since bowed to foreign pressure to allow United Nations troops into East Timor. But the aid talks remain on hold amid accusations that Mr. Habibie's party tried to siphon campaign funds from the troubled Bank Bali. **********Two top Indonesian officials, Finance Minister Bambang Subianto and the head of the Bank Restructuring Agency, Glenn Yusuf, testified in the Indonesian lower house this week that they were under pressure by one of the President's close associates to help cover up the scandal. **********Those accusations came on top of the Pricewaterhouse report. According to press reports, the audit uncovered ''numerous indicators of fraud, noncompliance, irregularity, misappropriation, undue preferential treatment, concealment, bribery and corruption'' in the transaction between Bank Bali and a company connected to President Habibie's ruling party, Golkar. **********The Bank Bali scandal revolves around a 546 billion rupiah fee, now about $67 million, that the struggling bank paid in June to recover money owed it by other banks. Technically, Bank Bali did not need to pay anything, since the banks had been taken over by the Bank Restructuring Agency and their obligations were guaranteed. But to hasten repayment, Bank Bali paid the money to Era Giat Prima, a company controlled by Golkar's deputy treasurer. Though Golkar denies ever having received the money, the transaction has fueled accusations that it was meant to help finance Mr. Habibie's campaign for election in November. **********The concern among lenders is that money designated to salvage Indonesian banks will end up feeding a system of corruption that regulators are trying to eradicate. **********The I.M.F. already faces criticism over charges that aid to Russia may have been diverted to officials and organized crime. And the World Bank has held back $600 million in loans for Indonesian poverty relief amid assertions that this money was being used to sway voters in the June Parliament elections. ''We've got some concerns about the Bank Bali case,'' an I.M.F. spokesman in Washington, Bill Murray, said. ''We're not going to make a disbursement until those questions are resolved.'' **********Threatening to halt the flow of aid is a potent form of persuasion. Indonesia's economy and Government depend, day to day, on the I.M.F.-led rescue package. But economists say the I.M.F. and World Bank face a quandary: having already handed over so much money to the Indonesians, they have little choice but to keep plowing funds into the country to make good on their investment. **********At the same time, threatening to cut off the aid has rattled the financial markets, raising the eventual cost of achieving a favorable economic outcome in Indonesia, a nation of more than 200 million people. **********Concerns that aid might not be forthcoming sent Jakarta's stock market down yesterday, with the benchmark index losing 2.39 percent. The rupiah has fallen 15 percent since the Bank Bali scandal broke, making it harder for Indonesia to repay dollar-denominated loans. **********Political scandal is also keeping interest rates high, raising the cost of borrowing for the Government and widening the budget deficit that the I.M.F. will have to help fill. Jakarta now pays investors an annual rate of 13 percent on one-month loans. The United States, by contrast, pays 4.2 percent. **********Economists and bankers also worry that the scandal has irreversibly undermined the authority of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, which is in charge of administering the I.M.F. bank bailout that accounts for the bulk of the aid package. Before the June elections, the Bank Restructuring Agency was winning praise for what was seen as its tough stance against politically connected borrowers. **********''Bank Bali has undermined just about all of that,'' said Bruce Gale, regional manager in Singapore for the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy of Hong Kong."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/08/business/as-empire-crumbled-frankel-turned-10-million-into-diamonds.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Kahn", "pub_date": "1999-07-08", "snippet": "Martin R Frankel converted $10 million into diamonds as his insurance empire melted down in May and he prepared to flee country; diamonds potentially provide Frankel with source of wealth separate from his overseas bank accounts, which he might ha...", "word_count": 1204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "As Empire Crumbled, Frankel Turned $10 Million Into Diamonds", "print_headline": "As Empire Crumbled, Frankel Turned $10 Million Into Diamonds", "body_text": " **********As Martin R. Frankel's insurance empire melted down in May and he prepared to flee the country, he converted $10 million into the hardest of assets: diamonds. **********Mr. Frankel, the reclusive Connecticut money manager, paid the money to California diamond merchants for three suitcases full of the gems just before he left the United States, according to people involved in the transaction and court documents. The people described the transaction as frenzied and highly unusual, with Mr. Frankel's security guards flying to Los Angeles to pick up the diamonds in a private jet on May 5, the same day firefighters doused burning file cabinets at Mr. Frankel's abandoned Greenwich estate. **********The diamonds potentially provide Mr. Frankel with a source of wealth separate from his overseas bank accounts, which he might have expected to be frozen soon after the authorities began pursuing him. And they are easier to transport than their equivalent value in dollars. But they are also highly traceable and might prove difficult to sell to legitimate dealers, independent experts said. **********Law enforcement authorities have followed leads that Mr. Frankel, a fugitive since an arrest warrant was issued in late May, is thought to have been hiding out in European countries, including Italy. But he has already remained at large longer than some experts had thought possible. Mr. Frankel left behind documents that suggested he had researched countries that do not have extradition treaties with the United States, including Brazil and Israel. **********According to Federal prosecutors and court documents, Mr. Frankel absconded with $335 million in money he managed on behalf of insurance companies in five Southern states. The case is one of the largest insurance frauds in American history. It developed over nearly a decade before state insurance regulators finally began to catch up with Mr. Frankel earlier this year, prompting him to transfer money offshore and flee the country. **********Just before he did so, Mr. Frankel ordered a wire transfer of $10 million from an account under his control at Banque SCS Alliance S.A. of Geneva to the Worldwide Diamond Company's account at Bank Leumi in Beverly Hills, Calif. Robert A. Wiener, owner of Worldwide Diamond, a wholesale diamond merchant, said in an interview yesterday that he had cobbled together the rush order in less than a week from jewelry merchant inventories. **********''He wanted diamonds that were easily salable in the market,'' Mr. Wiener said. ''I said it would take some time to put together an order of that size, but he wanted them quickly. It ended up taking less than a week.'' **********Mr. Wiener said he dealt only indirectly with Mr. Frankel. In late April, soon after Mr. Frankel and business colleagues failed to convince Mississippi insurance regulators that his finances were in good order, Richard Teel of Teel's Fine Jewelry in Los Gatos, Calif., received a call from David Rosse, Mr. Frankel's long-time security consultant. **********Mr. Rosse said a client of his intended to buy $40 million in diamonds as a hedge against bank failure connected with Year 2000 computer disorders and wanted to do so immediately, people later briefed about the chain of events said. Mr. Rosse had known Mr. Teel, an independent jeweler, from the days when Mr. Rosse served in law enforcement in California, they added. **********Mr. Frankel often used aliases, including that of David Rosse. The real Mr. Rosse is a security consultant who worked closely with Mr. Frankel since the late 1980's, when Mr. Frankel, then still living in his home state, Ohio, first became concerned about his personal safety, people who know the two of them said. Mr. Wiener, the diamond merchant, said he met the man who called himself Mr. Rosse. He said the Mr. Rosse he met looked nothing like the photographs of Mr. Frankel that have appeared in newspapers and television stories about the fraud. **********A lawyer for Mr. Rosse did not return telephone calls seeking comment. A recorded message on Mr. Teel's answering machine at his jewelry shop in Los Gatos said he was on vacation, and he did not respond to a request for comment. **********After Mr. Teel received the $40 million order, he approached Mr. Wiener, who specializes in wholesale diamond distribution. Mr. Wiener said he warned against seeking to fill an order of that magnitude in a short time. ''That kind of order would certainly disrupt the market,'' he said. ''They would not get fair prices.'' **********The order was then changed to $10 million. Mr. Wiener said he collected several hundred certified diamonds -- meaning each was accompanied by documentation that makes it easy to sell and more stable in price -- ranging from 1 to 12 carats. Most of the diamonds were one to three carats and varied in price from $10,000 to $30,000. The largest, a 12-carat diamond, was valued at about $800,000, he said. **********Mr. Rosse flew to Los Angeles to inspect a sample within several days of placing the order, Mr. Wiener said. Soon afterward, another of Mr. Frankel's security guards accompanied Mr. Teel to Worldwide Diamond offices on Hill Street, where they packed the diamonds into two full-sized suitcases and an army-style duffel bag. They then departed for a waiting private jet at Los Angeles International Airport, Mr. Wiener said. **********The transaction was unusual because diamond buyers tend to prefer that the merchant ship the gems to a final destination rather than accepting transportation risks themselves, Mr. Wiener said. He also said that the $10 million order was the largest he had received in his 23 years in business, but added that he had no reason to suspect that the sale was illegitimate. He said he was merely acting as a supplier to Mr. Teel, a retailer he had known for many years, and that Mr. Teel had told him that Mr. Frankel came widely vouched for. Mr. Wiener also said he declined to accept cash as payment for the diamonds and demanded a wire transfer so that he could verify that the money was coming from a well-known bank, a precaution against money laundering. **********''If this payment had been cash, we would not have touched it,'' Mr. Wiener said. ''I don't think you can walk into bank like SCS with suitcases of cash and ask them to wire it.'' **********In late May, the F.B.I. froze Mr. Wiener's account at Bank Leumi, he said. The account contained less than $1 million because he had already paid outside vendors for the diamonds he sold to Mr. Frankel, Mr. Wiener said. He said he was cooperating with law enforcement officials. **********Whether the cache of diamonds will prove useful to Mr. Frankel on the run remains an open question. **********Diamonds with full documentation are considered highly liquid. But the authorities can also notify dealers not to accept any diamonds that meet the description of those purchased by Mr. Frankel. Because each has its own documentation, the cuts and quality are unique and are considered readily identifiable by experts. **********''There's a lot of interplay between diamond dealers and law enforcement,'' said Bob Lindquist, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Washington, who specializes in unraveling fraud cases. He said he expected that Mr. Frankel would have to turn to organized crime to sell the diamonds at a steep discount. **********''Cash is a much better alternative,'' Mr. Lindquist said. ''But lugging around that much cash is a problem.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/04/business/company-news-founding-family-offers-520-million-for-st-john-knits.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-02-04", "snippet": "St John Knits Inc agrees to go private for $520 million under group led by company's founder; group including affiliate of Vestar Capital Partners, St John's chairman-chief executive Robert E Gray and his family will pay $30 a share for all shares...", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FOUNDING FAMILY OFFERS $520 MILLION FOR ST.

Wesley K. Clark, is advocating that the alliance begin soon to assemble 45,000 to 50,000 troops on Kosovo's borders, American and NATO officials said today. **********The force would be intended to increase pressure on Yugoslavia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, to accept NATO's terms for a settlement. **********It is one of three things -- including the use of Apache helicopters in Albania and tougher steps to cut off Yugoslavia's supply of oil -- that General Clark is seeking to bolster the military campaign and that still would require NATO or Pentagon approval. In conversations with American officials, he warned that NATO might not prevail with air power alone. **********''If you prepare for ground forces, among other things, you make Milosevic contemplate the consequences of not going along with the political objectives'' of NATO's campaign, one official said, describing a message General Clark delivered in a series of meetings with senior leaders at the Pentagon today. **********The discussions about whether to move ahead with the deployment  came at a time when diplomatic efforts to forge a solution were developing on several fronts. Russia's envoy to the Balkans, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met outside Moscow today with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. **********Mr. Chernomyrdin had just returned from talks with Mr. Milosevic in Belgrade, where Goran Matic, an influential Minister Without Portfolio, said, ''I think we can expect a political settlement in the next week.'' **********The diplomacy and General Clark's visit to Washington -- his first since NATO's summit meeting here a month ago -- followed this week's public divisions within NATO over the course of the war. In Washington and other capitals, political pressure has grown to end the conflict. Britain this week called on NATO to do basically what General Clark is considering: build up allied forces in Albania and Macedonia as a way to put pressure on Mr. Milosevic. After President Clinton declined to rule out ground troops on Tuesday, Germany's Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, bluntly and forcefully derided the use of ground troops and said his country would block NATO from fighting any war on the ground. **********The force General Clark is describing would be intended to enter Kosovo only after the bombing ended, officials here said. Deployment of the force, which would need the approval of NATO's 19 members, would also leave open the option of a ground invasion should the air campaign ultimately fail. **********Today Mr. Clinton said the alliance needed to stay ''focused and patient'' while it pursued its goal: allowing Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to return to their villages and live with a degree of autonomy. **********''I believe the campaign is working,'' he said. ''Each day we hear reports of desertions in the Serbian army, dissension in Belgrade, unrest in Serbian communities. President Milosevic should know that he cannot change the fundamental terms that we have outlined, because they are simply what is required for the Kosovars to go home and live in peace.'' **********Mr. Clinton spoke after meeting at the White House with his national security advisers to discuss NATO's progress. General Clark did not attend, nor did he appear in public. **********Instead he spent the day across the Potomac River in closed meetings at the Pentagon with Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton; the vice chairman, Gen. Joseph W. Ralston, and the senior officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. **********While NATO and the Pentagon have portrayed the campaign as a success, General Clark provided a more sober assessment, officials said. While General Clark said nearly two months of bombing had exacted a heavy toll on Yugoslavia's armed forces, he warned that it might not be enough to force President Milosevic to relent. **********''I can't guarantee that the objectives will be met by this strategy,'' one official said in paraphrasing the general's assessment. **********[NATO jets fired on fuel depots late Thursday in the north Serbian town of Sombor and in the capital, where the residence of the Swiss Ambassador was damaged, the independent news agency Beta said on Friday. **********[The warplanes unleashed four missiles at a Jugopetrol depot in Belgrade, and at least one struck. The blast shattered windows at the Swiss Ambassador's residence, where a reception was under way.  [Residents reported hearing two powerful blasts in the capital just after midnight along with heavy anti-aircraft fire.] **********General Clark did not propose using ground forces to drive Yugoslavia's military and police units from Kosovo. The officials said there is virtually no possibility that the alliance would approve a land war, especially given Chancellor Schroder's forceful remarks. **********General Clark's staff has also updated NATO's plans for the size of the force needed to repatriate refugees, to 48,000, from 28,000 estimated as the air war began. **********While the exact mission and composition of the force still must be approved by NATO's political leaders, General Clark has proposed starting to build up the force within the next few weeks, even before a diplomatic solution is reached, officials said. **********Although the force would not be designed to evict Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, General Clark and other NATO leaders are said to believe that the simple presence of thousands of allied ground troops, including as many as 7,000 Americans, would intimidate Mr. Milosevic. **********In his meetings today, General Clark emphasized that NATO needed to consider what steps it will take as winter edges closer, raising the specter of hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees in threadbare camps in Macedonia, Albania or, worse, still in the hills and forests of Kosovo. **********Among the NATO allies, Britain has argued most forcefully for ground troops, saying NATO needed to begin deploying at least a vanguard by June in order to be ready for either a settlement or the possibility of a ground war. **********General Clark's view, the officials said, was that ''preparations are more likely to bring the political solution you want.'' **********It is not clear whether NATO, let alone the Clinton Administration, will agree. **********And tonight Mr. Cohen released an unusual statement saying General Clark had ''made no request for the deployment of ground troops and no request for any change in NATO's policy.'' But Mr. Cohen did not address the general's proposals. **********However, General Clark has advocated a tougher approach before, only to have NATO or Washington overrule him or scale back his proposals. NATO's political leaders are still wrangling over the details of enforcing a naval blockade of oil. They have rejected General Clark's request to use force. **********The Pentagon has also withheld approval of using two dozen Apache helicopters and long-range rockets sent to Albania more than a month ago. On the early buildup of ground forces, one military official questioned the effectiveness of the threat to Mr. Milosevic. ''You don't pretend you are preparing to do something you're not going to do,'' the official said.

On June 2, the big, four-engine Russian Ilyushin IL-96T parked nearby became the first wide-body jet, other than ones made by Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Company, to meet F.A.A. safety standards. **********It was not easy. **********While Airbus and Boeing have the certification process for new models down to a science, often breezing through it in a year or less, Ilyushin struggled for five years to get approval. And even though it now has the certificate, making it easier for leasing companies and banks to finance sales of the IL-96T, the success of the cargo plane, or of a sister passenger plane that is in the works, is by no means assured. **********Ilyushin, founded in 1933 by Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin, who won the Order of Lenin three times for designing some of Russia's most famous military and civilian airplanes, has built only one IL-96T so far. The company, which was partly privatized in 1994, has orders for 19 more from Aeroflot International Airlines. But it cannot even deliver the first one because an agreement for loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank in Washington that would help pay for the planes has lapsed. **********But the Ilyushin team, in the best Russian tradition, knows how to live with adversity. ''We have overcome so much,'' Vladimir A. Belyakov, the company's deputy marketing director, said, ticking off the collapse of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a market-based economy that eliminated decades of fat government subsidies, and last summer's financial debacle. ''And we continue.'' **********The IL-96T was the inspiration of the late industrialist Armand Hammer, who in 1989 suggested combining the best of the Soviet and American aerospace industries. He convinced wealthy friends, including the publisher Robert Maxwell and the real estate executive Paul Reichmann, to invest in the project. **********But after Dr. Hammer and Mr. Maxwell died and Mr. Reichmann's Olympia & York went bankrupt, the deal fell apart. Mr. Belyakov said Ilyushin executives now joked that they should have taken $1 billion from Mr. Reichmann. ''What difference would it have made if he were $11 or $12 billion in debt?'' he asked. **********But the idea of building a Russian-American airplane survived. Eventually Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, agreed to supply the engines, while Rockwell-Collins, a unit of Rockwell International, furnished the cockpit instruments and controls. Other American suppliers also signed on. The result was the IL-96T. **********It was -- and is -- a bet on the future of the aviation market in Russia, a country that spans 10 time zones and desperately needs more airplanes. Arthur Kelly, the Rockwell-Collins executive who oversaw the company's role in the project, was a believer, making his final presentation to Rockwell-Collins's board of directors in the early 1990's, dressed in the uniform of a Russian Air Force colonel. **********''Arthur was passionate about getting Rockwell Collins into international markets,'' Karen C. Tripp, the company's chief spokeswoman, said. ''He would do things like that.'' Mr. Kelly, who died of cancer in 1996, got the board's approval. So far, Rockwell-Collins has invested $50 million in the airplane and Pratt & Whitney $80 million. Mr. Belyakov estimated that Ilyushin had spent $600 million. **********Sergei Ilyushin joined the young Soviet military as an aircraft mechanic in 1919 and began building gliders as a student at Russia's Air Force academy in the 1920's. During World War II, he developed the IL-2 attack airplane to support infantry. **********For most of its history, Ilyushin was simply a design center, creating airplanes that were built by factories around the Soviet Union as ordered by the central authorities. The system may not have been efficient but it was certainly productive: More than 36,000 of the single-engine prop attack planes were built, making it a mainstay of the war and the most widely produced model in the world. **********During the cold war, the Ilyushin Design Bureau, as it was then called, continued to create bombers and fighters but also branched into civil aviation. Hundreds of Ilyushin airplanes were produced each year and ''sold'' to Soviet allies in the East bloc and elsewhere -- the allies had little choice but to buy them. **********The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the cozy relations between the state and the aircraft industry. Government orders dried up. Designers like Ilyushin and the factories that produced its planes were told to make it on their own. While some airplanes, like the mighty Antonov, the world's largest cargo airplane, have found niche markets, most Russian airplane makers have fallen on hard times. The Antonov, for example, moved the Rockefeller Center's 73-foot Norway spruce Christmas tree to New York from Cleveland last year. And, because it was being leased, it did not need F.A.A. certification. **********Liberated East European countries dumped their Russian planes, opting for more modern and cost-efficient Airbus and Boeing jets. Even Aeroflot decided to buy Boeing 737's and leases Airbus A310's and two wide-body Boeing 777's. **********The Moscow-based Ilyushin teamed up with its factories in Voronezh and Tashkent to form a joint-stock company. (The Tashkent deal was delayed because the Governments of Russia and the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan first had to work out a two-way agreement.) In addition to the new IL-96, Ilyushin now makes the IL-114, a regional two-engine prop, the four-engine IL-76 cargo jet, and the IL-103, a small, single-engine private plane that in December was actually the first Russian airplane to receive F.A.A. certification. **********So far, business has not been good. A decade ago, 60 IL-76's were made each year; last year just 15 were produced. And while China bought three wide-body IL-86 passenger jets and one IL-76 freighter three years ago, most of the new Ilyushins now coming off the assembly line are flown by Russian airlines that lack the money to pay for them. **********Mr. Belyakov estimated that around 1,500 Ilyushins, ranging from the four-engine prop IL-18's of the 1950's to the wide-body, 350-passenger IL-86's of the 1970's, remain in service in Russia and places like China, Cuba, India and Vietnam. **********The new, Westernized version of the IL-96 is based on the all-Russian IL-96-300, which went into service in 1993. It is currently flown only by Russian airlines and serves as the official plane of President Boris N. Yeltsin. The IL-96M, which is the soon-to-be-introduced passenger version of the new airplane, can carry up to 436 passengers. **********The company says the IL-96T, which is the cargo version and the first of the planes to come off the assembly line, can carry as much as 92 tons more than 7,000 miles. **********That makes it smaller than the biggest Boeing 747 freighter, which can carry up to 140 tons. But Genrikh V. Novozhilov, Ilyushin's chief airplane designer since 1970, said the IL-96T's 16-foot-wide and nine-and-a-half-foot-high side cargo door, which is bigger than any competitor's, gave it a competitive edge. And at an asking price of $75 million, the plane is less than half the list price of a new 747, even though it has the latest high-tech American cockpit instruments and fuel-efficient American engines. Thus, its backers contend, the IL-96T could find a ready market, even a huge one, from cash-short customers that need cheap hauling capacity. **********That may be one reason why Boeing unsuccessfully lobbied the Clinton Administration in 1995 not to let the Export-Import Bank guarantee a $1 billion loan to pay for 85 percent of the Western content of the first 20 planes. Boeing said that it did not mind competing with Ilyushin but not when Russian Government subsidies enabled it to sell its planes at below market prices. **********''It's not a bad airplane,'' said Edwin Laird, the publisher of Cargo Facts, a monthly magazine that focuses on freight airplanes, as he watched the IL-96T lumber along the runway into take-off position for its demonstration flight here. But that is a just a small part of the equation, he explained. **********''The airlines are not worried about the engines or the avionics, which are all made in America,'' he said. ''They are worried about everything else. What do you do if it breaks down? Do you go out in the back yard and make a part?'' He said he doubted there would be much of a market for the plane outside Russia until it had proved itself. **********Mr. Belyakov said Ilyushin was prepared to offer airlines a global support network with the help of Pratt & Whitney and others. The real problem, he said, is that Ilyushin lacks the money to help customers finance the purchase of its planes. **********The F.A.A. certification will help with that. Uncertified planes like the IL-96-300 are allowed to fly back and forth between the United States and Russia but it is very difficult to sell airplanes in third countries without a stamp of approval from American or European safety authorities. Few banks and other financial institutions will lend money to finance the sale of an uncertified airplane. **********Mr. Belyakov said that Ilyushin was now looking for alternative ways to finance the Aeroflot sale to make up for the absence of the Export-Import Bank loan guarantees. Ilyushin's plan is to deliver the planes to the Russian airline as soon as it can, so it can show the world how well the IL-96 can perform in commercial service. But Ilyushin executives were busy entertaining prospective customers at the air show here and were said to have some interest from airlines in Europe and Asia. **********''There is a lot of opportunity for it in the C.I.S.,'' said Louis Chenevert, the president of Pratt & Whitney, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, the successor to the Soviet Union. ''But as the airplane builds credibility for itself, it will gain customers all over the world. The airplane will do well over the next couple of years.'' **********Not that Airbus and Boeing should really lose any sleep. Together, they will deliver more than 900 new airplanes this year, while Ilyushin will be lucky to deliver one of its IL-96's. **********''The F.A.A. certification will ease access to international capital for us and for our customers,'' Mr. Belyakov said. ''We are rising to the same level of competitiveness with the Western-made aircraft.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/09/business/international-briefs-bidding-under-way-for-polish-bank.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-09", "snippet": "Unicredito Italiano SpA says it and German insurer Allianz AG are bidding for 52 percent stake in Bank Pekao SA, Poland's number 1 bank by assets, which Government is selling; stake is worth $860 million (US) (S)", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bidding Under Way For Polish Bank", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Bidding Under Way For Polish Bank", "body_text": " **********Unicredito Italiano S.p.A., Italy's third-biggest bank, said yesterday that it and the German insurer Allianz A.G. were bidding for a 52 percent stake in Bank Pekao S.A., Poland's No. 1 bank by assets, which the Government is selling. **********Unicredito said the bid had been made to the Polish Treasury Ministry for 75.7 million shares, or 52.1 percent of the Polish lender, with Unicredito seeking 50.1 percent and Allianz 2 percent.

Then a decade later, in 1989, the doctor left Europe, its comforts, the predictable arc of a surgeon's career, his specialty's lucrative rewards, tossed all of that for a giant question mark. **********This young country had never had an elected leader, only successful coup plotters; it had never had a cardiac center, or a surgeon determined to forge one out of nothing, and for a $300-a-month salary. **********Today, Dr. Frimpong-Boateng, 49, is hard at work on expanding the National Cardiothoracic Center here in the capital. The center's reputation, as well as his own, has reached beyond Ghana's borders, to countries like Sierra Leone, where there is not even a single heart surgeon. **********Every day, letters mailed from other African countries land on his desk, imploring Dr. Frimpong-Boateng for help. **********''We may be poor, but the heart is the same everywhere,'' he said one recent morning as he returned to his office from an inspection of the construction site. **********He held the blueprint of the expansion that, among other improvements, will move patients from the current colonial-era ward, which has one toilet for 35 patients. **********''I don't believe in sub-Saharan standards,'' he said. ''I believe we have international standards. Heart surgery is like an airline. We're not a T.W.A. or Pan Am with a large fleet, but the one or two planes we have we must maintain at the same standards.'' **********Before Dr. Frimpong-Boateng returned, Ghana would send a ''minister or a key professor at the university'' overseas for heart surgery, said Dr. Issaka Tinorgah, director of medical services in the Ministry of Health, and what happened to those not included in this group, to those unable to travel on their own means, was better left unsaid. **********For a developing country with limited resources -- Ghana spends about $10 in health care a year per citizen, compared with a range of $7 to $15 in West Africa -- deciding which medical services to offer entails difficult moral choices, Dr. Tinorgah said. **********As harsh as it may seem to leave patients requiring heart surgery untreated, the hard reality is that the vast majority of people here die of everyday illnesses like malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhea. **********As a result, the Government focuses almost exclusively on primary care; to Dr. Frimpong-Boateng, it gives a location, and pays the utilities and most of his staff's salaries. **********Everything else, Dr. Frimpong-Boateng has paid for by raising money through his Heart Foundation. **********The Heart Foundation took in about $350,000 last year, mostly by running ads on local radio and television, by focusing on a particular group each month, cab drivers one month, small-business owners the next. He created the center, he said matter-of-factly, to treat the ordinary Ghanaian who would otherwise die of heart ailments. And so he views the foundation as a sort of social contract with the poor and expects most of his funds to come in $1 or $2 donations. **********''To a large extent, he's like a missionary,'' said Dr. Tinorgah, who, asked whether Ghana would have a heart center today without Dr. Frimpong-Boateng, answered simply: no. **********Dr. Frimpong-Boateng has had many surprises through his years as the country's only heart surgeon. **********''This voice sounds very familiar,'' he recalled thinking when he received a phone call a couple of years ago. Then he realized it was the country's longtime President, Jerry J. Rawlings. **********''Oh, I thought, my God, what have I done?'' he said. But the President was calling for help: a foreign dignitary had suffered a heart attack. **********And he has also learned some diplomacy. Keeping the center operating means dealing delicately with the politically connected, as well as with his own resources. **********On a recent afternoon, two relatives of an 85-year-old man -- a traditional chief in a region where cocoa, Ghana's main export, was grown -- entered the doctor's office. The old man needed a pacemaker, an operation that costs about $5,000. The relatives clearly hoped the Heart Foundation would pick up the bill. **********Dr. Frimpong-Boateng, on hearing that they had never donated to his foundation, shook his finger at them. ''When you heard about the Heart Foundation,'' he said, ''you thought it's far off. Now it's come home.'' **********The doctor noted the patient's age. Who knows how long he would live with the pacemaker anyway? ''It's a moral question,'' he said. **********''You can't say so,'' one of the relatives said. **********A few days later, the old chief lay on a bed in the doctor's ward; his family had persuaded the local cocoa association to pay for the operation. **********Judging from the 17 other patients there, however, most of his patients are dependent on the foundation. On one bed lay a small boy who had swallowed a metal pipe that had been lodged in his chest for some time; his older sister had brought him here from the bush and then disappeared. In the operating room was a woman badly hurt in a car accident the night before; no one knew who she was. **********The doctor asked one of the nurses for some X-rays. When she could not find them, he flung his stethoscope in her face. ''Sometimes I get so upset with the nurses I don't want to see them for the rest of the day,'' he said. **********Later, he smiled at his own impatience, a smile that conveyed a belief that an individual can triumph over personal weakness, so long as the greater goal remains clear. **********He recalled that on his first day at Hanover Medical School he told his teachers that he had begun working toward his return to Ghana; in fact, he had avoided going to the United States because so many Ghanaian doctors had gone there and never returned. **********America, he feared, might prove too seductive, and he felt he had to return. While most of his five children were away in Europe or the United States, the rest of his family was here, including his aging mother, who had raised him alone. His father died just before his birth. **********''I also wanted to come back to be with her,'' he said. ''I grew up with the woman, and I have never regretted it.'' **********''Somehow,'' he added, and it was not clear whether his words meant mother or motherland, ''your presence alone is enough to make a difference.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/06/business/private-sector-making-scents-visible.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Dobrzynski", "pub_date": "1999-06-06", "snippet": "Eugene P Grisanti, chief executive of International Flavors and Fragrances, comments on his company's role in helping to defray marketing costs of Christie's auction of Marilyn Monroe's personal effects; photo (S)", "word_count": 275, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Making Scents Visible", "print_headline": "PRIVATE SECTOR; Making Scents Visible", "body_text": " **********Eugene P.

Hundt was asked Tuesday evening to comment on the Federal Communications Commission's imminent approval of the application by Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services in New York State, his first words  were, ''Talk about a better-late-than-never situation.'' **********As chairman of the F.C.C. from 1994 to 1997, Mr. Hundt was hardly a champion of the long-distance aspirations of the Baby Bells. He seemed to believe, in fact, that the local offsprings of Ma Bell had not opened their networks enough to merit approval. **********But by the time the commission formally approved Bell Atlantic's petition yesterday, Mr. Hundt, like many others in government and industry, had come to think that the time was right to allow the first Bell to enter the $80 billion long-distance market since the breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph in 1984. **********Bell Atlantic, the second-largest local phone carrier, behind SBC Communications Inc., clearly went an extra mile beyond earlier, unsuccessful petitions by the other Bells. **********But beyond that, a host of political considerations in Washington -- led by the Bells' considerable lobbying heft and a general impatience with the pace of communications deregulation -- had all but ensured that Bell Atlantic's application would at least receive a sympathetic hearing. Had it been rejected outright, the very viability of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a complex framework for deregulation and increased competition, might have come into question on Capitol Hill. **********Now that the commission has got the Bell long-distance monkey off its back and now that Bell Atlantic has won, at least in one state, what all the Bells have been clamoring for, some new questions emerge about how consumers will reap the benefits of enhanced competition and how the telecommunications behemoths will align themselves to provide it. **********The obvious effect of Bell Atlantic's New York victory would appear to be increased long-distance competition. Last week, the company could not sell long-distance communications services to the 6.6 million households it serves in New York State. Now it can. Simple. **********One interpretation coming out of the F.C.C. yesterday was that the ruling was also an important validation of growing competition in local phone markets, the Bells' traditional bastions of monopoly power. The commission is supposed to evaluate long-distance applications largely on the basis of the companies' openness to competitors, so the argument about local competition is a bit circular. But it holds an important kernel of truth. **********Bell Atlantic's long-distance approval in New York will almost surely accelerate the pace of local competition, and as other Bells get approval in other states, the established long-distance giants -- AT&T, MCI Worldcom and the Sprint Corporation -- will feel even more urgency than they do now to counterattack in local markets. **********For consumers, that means more choices and, in theory, a competitive drive to lower prices and improve the quality of service. After years of false starts and hot air, AT&T and MCI Worldcom, the two biggest long-distance carriers, finally seem serious about signing up local phone customers in New York. If the Bells continue to make progress on the long-distance front, AT&T and MCI Worldcom may well accelerate their local efforts in other states. **********After at least 18 months of patient work with regulators, getting long-distance approval in New York was a big deal for Bell Atlantic, no doubt. But there is also little doubt that in some important ways the long-distance prize is less valuable now than it was in 1996, when the Telecommunications Act was passed. **********The act held out the long-distance market as the carrot that was meant to entice the Bells to open their networks to competitors. But since 1996, a number of vicious price wars have made the core residential long-distance telephone market much less attractive. Revenue growth has slowed (or, in AT&T's case, ended), and it has become more difficult to maintain profit margins as prices have continued to fall (though for the long-distance carriers that process has been offset somewhat by lower per-minute payments to the Bells for beginning and ending calls). **********From Bell Atlantic's perspective, it is next to impossible to argue with the company's regulatory strategy. Rather than throw a bunch of half-hearted long-distance applications at the F.C.C. and hope one might stick, as BellSouth did, Bell Atlantic chose a more patient, methodical path. And it worked. Bell Atlantic executives are thrilled at their victory, not least because New York is home to a disproportionate share of the lucrative international calling market. **********For Bell Atlantic, the New York process may well have gone as quickly as it could have. But it appears that the prize won at the end of the process was at least a bit less impressive than the prize coveted at the beginning. **********Executives close to Bell Atlantic have said the company does not want to set off an all-out price Armageddon in the long-distance market. But it may be difficult for the company to sign up the million long-distance customers it wants in New York by the end of 2000 without provoking a price-slashing response from AT&T and MCI Worldcom. **********For instance, executives close to Bell Atlantic have said that the company does not intend to charge monthly fees in connection with its plans that offer low per-minute rates. If the per-minute fees are competitive with the best plans from AT&T and MCI Worldcom, those two companies would be hard pressed not to eliminate or cut the monthly fees they already charge. **********One possible scenario lurking in the shadows is that the competition touched off by Bell Atlantic's entry could shave the profit margins in New York's domestic long-distance market so much that other Bells might decide not to invest the time and money needed to win such approvals in the first place."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/08/business/business-digest-329525.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-11-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 537, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Microsoft Findings Leave Some Feeling Ambivalent **********In Silicon Valley, the nation's high-technology capital, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's powerful findings in the Microsoft antitrust case have been received with a sense of vindication but also ambivalence. **********Yes, the judge found, there is a ''Microsoft problem'' in the computer business, and the company's tactics hurt consumers and undermine innovation.

Nearly every wall is freshly painted with slogans from the 1960's like ''Put Ideology First'' and ''Let Chairman Mao Thought Radiate Forever.'' **********In an age often marked by an economic free-for-all, the village of Nanjie is a dinosaur: its farm, its factories, its housing are all collectively owned and managed. **********Residents must attend regular study sessions of Mao's teachings, and their take-home pay does not exceed $30 a month. But each family receives the needs of life free, including identical homes, television sets, flour and eggs, busts of Chairman Mao and a daily bottle of beer per person. **********Billed as a socialist success, Nanjie, in the central province of Henan, is often cited as a paragon by China's ''leftists'' -- the dwindling, old-guard Communist critics of China's rush from ideology and state planning. As one admirer recently wrote, Nanjie is a place of ''truly shared prosperity,'' where people ''uphold what is public and spurn what is private.'' **********But the very fame of this strange showcase suggests just how anomalous it is today -- and how far those leftists have fallen as President Jiang Zemin leads the country toward a market economy. China remains under authoritarian one-party rule, led by people who do not hesitate to arrest anyone who threatens the primacy of the Communist Party, but who have jettisoned most of Communism's economic principles, leaving the remaining ''leftists'' in despair. **********''The fundamentalist left has lost any influence over Chinese politics and society,'' said Xiao Gongqin, a historian at Shanghai Normal University. **********Unlike the case in Russia, where the economy collapsed and nostalgia for the cocoon of Communism is powerful, China's economic boom has largely diluted popular demands for old-line solutions. **********But even as the old left fades, new social critics are emerging who are more democratic in their politics but share many of the left's social ideals and are appalled by the inequalities and corruption of China's ''market socialism.'' **********Unlike the beleaguered democracy dissidents, these new critics, sometimes called ''new populists'' or ''new leftists,'' have not run afoul of the law. They spend more time dissecting the economy than political trends, and they are more suspicious of free markets and global capital. **********But if the rapid growth that has been China's universal solvent should stall for long, these critics believe, their ideas -- speaking to everyday complaints of the common people -- could have a broad and explosive appeal. **********The Old Left **********Marxist Elders Vs. Bourgeoisie **********The old leftists, in Chinese terms, are a mostly elderly group of Marxist intellectuals and retired officials who remain deeply committed to state ownership of key sectors and strong party control over society. They still worry about threats like ''bourgeois liberalization'' and China's ''peaceful evolution'' into a capitalist society -- code phrases for a steady erosion of Communist principles, abetted by the West. **********From the beginning of the reform started by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 until recently, the leftists' influence undulated, but they remained a key balancing force in Beijing politics, supported by powerful party elders. **********A powerful leftist bloc came in handy for Deng, for example, when he squelched the rising liberal tide associated with the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989. **********Now those elder patrons have mostly died. The current leadership, led by President Jiang, is certainly committed to the party's monopoly on power. But especially with the program to drastically reshape or sell off state industries, party leaders have abandoned key tenets of socialism, the leftists charge. **********The left's chief patron in recent years has been Deng Liqun, a once-powerful confidant of Mao and then Deng Xiaoping who broke with the latter over ideology. **********Deng Liqun is now 83 and in poor health, and the Contemporary China Research Institute he founded in Beijing to propagate leftist views is kept at arms length by a wary Government. A journal associated with the institute, Trends in Contemporary Thought, remains a leading leftist forum, and its editor, Duan Ruofei, has gamely tried to carry on the battle. **********In a rare interview at the institute, Mr. Duan was careful to couch his objections to China's path in terms of the so-called Deng Xiaoping Theory -- the same vague catch-all that is used by Mr. Jiang to justify his new directions -- and did not attack leaders directly. **********''We are the real reformers,'' Mr. Duan said. ''The problem is that the upholders of Marxism have a different understanding of reform than certain liberals, who are trying to transform the defining role of public ownership.'' **********''A capitalist class has re-emerged in China,'' he said, threatening to undermine socialist achievements. **********Mr. Duan and his colleagues suffered a major rout in late 1997, at the 15th Communist Party Congress, when Mr. Jiang formally embraced the wholesale restructuring of state industries. **********Over the previous two years, in a last-ditch effort to drum up concern, Mr. Duan and other leftists had circulated four unsigned essays exposing the dire threats to socialism. **********The essays showed the anguish of people who felt their deepest beliefs were betrayed. One, for example, complained of a ''new-born capitalist class that has been raised on the blood and sweat of four decades of tireless labor by the whole people.'' **********The New Left **********Cultural Revolution Has Mixed Reviews **********Today, there is a broad consensus among senior officials and intellectuals that the path toward market economics is China's best hope. **********Many of these senior officials, Western-influenced economists and others accept that some hardships and growing inequality may be a necessary price. Corruption is seen as an unfortunate side effect that must be fought. **********But a growing minority, part of a new populism, assert that China's current course is inherently corrupt, enriching the powerful against the interests of workers and peasants. **********It is not a unified movement. Some have styled themselves part of a ''new left,'' but many others resist being pigeon-holed. Some say there are positive lessons to be gleaned from the disastrous Mao years -- and have even made pilgrimages to Nanjie in search of inspiration -- while others abhor that era. **********But they share many socialist ideals, and argue that capitalism and the opening to the global economy, as practiced here, have allowed an alliance of privileged officials and business executives to get rich at the expense of the little guy. **********''In the 1990's the economy has grown rapidly, but in terms of morality, things are really rotten,'' said Yang Fan, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He considers himself part of a growing ''moderate left'' movement, led by intellectuals in their 40's and 50's who spent time in the countryside during Mao's Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976 and share a special concern for workers facing layoffs as state industries are pruned and peasants whose incomes have lagged. **********Mr. Yang said in an interview that the country is in the grip of ''closet  rightists'' whose aim is ''to convert political power into personal wealth.'' **********Similar concerns have even been voiced by an outspoken senior economist at the central Government's think tank, the Development Research Center. In a recent newspaper article, the economist Wu Jinglian said China could be in danger of developing ''crony capitalism'' like that in Indonesia and Malaysia. **********While they call for stronger regulation of business, genuine worker participation in company management and greater sharing of wealth, these critics seldom offer detailed plans for curing the ills they describe. By and large, they have not delved deeply into strategies for political change, at least in public. **********But the potentially broad appeal of their critique, especially if the economy stalls, has been suggested by the attention given to a recent book, ''China's Pitfall,'' by the economist He Qinglian, who says economic reforms have been warped by the plundering of a new bureaucratic and financial elite. **********''The real struggle today is between reformers out for the people as a whole, and reformers out for themselves,'' said Cui Zhiyuan, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who remains active in intellectual debate inside China. **********Mr. Cui has been described as a ''new leftist'' in part because he has tried to find positive aspects of Mao's Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976 -- putting off many readers. He has also, like the old leftists, been entranced by Nanjie. **********In a 1997 book, Mr. Cui noted that most socialist experiments have foundered on the problem of incentives. But ''the practice of Nanjie village shows it can be overcome,'' he wrote, so ''the superiority of cooperation in a collective economy can be given free rein.'' **********The Collective **********A Model at Risk From Free Markets **********Nanjie itself claims to combine the best of both worlds. Its relative prosperity appears to reflect the astute exploitation of market opportunities opened in the 1980's: the village now runs 26 factories, including printing, plastic wraps, snacks and one of China's biggest producers of instant noodles. The farming that brings a poor living to neighboring villages has nearly disappeared. **********To run its factories, Nanjie employs thousands of outsiders as workers. Like the village's permanent residents, these workers must study Mao texts. They are paid a modest salary and given free housing in neighboring areas, though not the handsomely equipped apartments and lifetime benefits given to Nanjie's 3,100 official residents. **********''We were able to grab hold of the express train of economic reform, and at the same time adhere to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization,'' said Wang Hongbin, 47, who has been party secretary of Nanjie since 1977. **********From a guided tour it was impossible to determine how Nanjie may have avoided the usual pitfalls of collective enterprise. Mr. Wang said only that proper ideological study and the leadership of party cadres ''encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses.'' **********Mr. Wang also said the village -- which has spacious, well-equipped schools and gives its model workers free vacation trips -- receives no subsidies, only loans as needed. There is no way to verify the village's finances. **********The leftists who praise Nanjie seldom mention aspects that would be unacceptable to many Chinese today: the lack of opportunity to amass wealth, the rigid requirements for ideological study, the required group critiques of neighbors' behavior that are right out of the Cultural Revolution. **********Still, it appears that many residents are willing to trade certain freedoms for a modest prosperity. **********Yao Tonglin, 63, who has lived in Nanjie for 40 years and now shares an apartment with her husband, daughter and son-in-law, remembers how poor the village used to be. ''Our men couldn't even find a bride who would marry them,'' she said, standing in front of the giant Mao poster on her living room wall. ''Now, outsiders come running to marry the local people.'' **********Village officials admit that the national economic slowdown may hamper its industries. But as the rest of the country struggles with unemployment and debates the ethics of the free market, Mr. Wang, the village chairman, casts his eyes on the horizon. **********''What we hope for in the future is that the quality of our Communist neighborhood will be raised to ever greater levels,'' he said. ''Material conditions will be extraordinarily prosperous and in terms of spiritual civilization, life will be equally rich.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/18/business/world-business-briefing-asia-derivative-executive-arrested.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-11-18", "snippet": "Shinji Yamada, former head of Credit Suisse Group's derivative operations in Tokyo, is arrested and charged with tampering with evidence that was part of investigation earlier this year into Swiss banking giant's Japanese operations; criminal char...", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DERIVATIVE EXECUTIVE ARRESTED", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: ASIA; DERIVATIVE EXECUTIVE ARRESTED", "body_text": " **********Shinji Yamada, the former head of the Credit Suisse Group's derivative operations in Tokyo, was arrested and charged with tampering with evidence that was part of an investigation earlier this year into the Swiss banking giant's Japanese operations.

As air raid sirens sounded their own peculiar dirge through the lime and chestnut trees, his mourners tried to take courage from one another's public presence -- their refusal to be intimidated in a troubled time. **********Tears were mixed with wariness, as many of those who went to Novo Groblje, Belgrade's main cemetery, quietly wondered if the killing of Mr. Curuvija would be the last. **********''This was a political killing, aimed at independent journalism,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party. ''But it was also aimed at spreading fear across democratic Serbia.'' **********Mr. Curuvija, the publisher of the daily newspaper Dnevni Telegraf and the biweekly magazine Evro pljanin, was killed in front of his apartment building on Orthodox Easter as he was returning from lunch with Branka Prpa, a well-known historian. **********Two men in black leather jackets shot him in the back, pistol-whipped Ms. Prpa and then, as he lay face down on the ground, shot him again in the head. **********Mr. Curuvija, 50, was under a suspended five-month prison sentence for violating Serbia's draconian press law, passed in October, and the state television and the tabloid Politika Ekspres falsely accused him of favoring NATO's bombing of Serbia. **********The tabloid quoted the powerful wife of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, Mirjana Markovic, as saying that ''the owner of a Belgrade daily newspaper said he supports the United States in its desire to bomb Serbia.'' The writer of the article then continued, ''This is, of course, Slavko Curuvija.'' **********''These commentaries were like a death sentence,'' said a senior Serbian journalist at the funeral. Mr. Curuvija, who had become a man of means, was once close to Ms. Markovic. But he took his publications down an increasingly independent, serious and outspoken path. **********Veran Matic, the editor in chief of the once-independent radio station B92 -- taken over last week by the Milosevic Government -- said Mr. Curuvija's slaying ''was meant to be an example to anyone who intended to take the same road.'' **********Mr. Matic said he believed that the killing would boomerang, reminding Serbs that free speech can be easily lost. But the true effects can be known only when NATO's bombings stop, he said, because it is almost impossible to criticize the Milosevic Government while it is defending the country from outside aggression. **********''We're all collateral damage from NATO's bombs -- Curuvija, B92, the democrats,'' said another senior editor of B92. **********Mr. Curuvija himself, before he died, spoke against the bombing and bemoaned the inability of democrats and dissidents to speak out during what he called ''this war fever.'' **********Aleksandara Joksinovic, an official of the Democratic Party, said, ''I was concerned that many people would be too afraid to come'' to the funeral. ''It's a horrible, tragic moment,'' she said, ''but I'm glad people were not afraid to show their disgust at such brutality. This killing really was too much, to eliminate people with different opinions while the country is at war. **********''We are against the bombs, of course. But Serbs must be united against the aggression, not fighting one another.'' **********That is a point made with increasing urgency in the last few days by the most liberal member of Mr. Milosevic's Government, Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic, who has been the only official voice condemning Mr. Curuvija's slaying and the manipulation of patriotism for the political advantage of ultranationalists and leftists. **********Mr. Draskovic has also condemned Parliament's vote to bind Yugoslavia in an ill-defined union with Russia and Belarus, attacking those who would return Yugoslavia to the failed anachronism of Communism. **********But as this funeral took place, across town at his Presidential Palace, Mr. Milosevic was greeting the autocratic President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, with a red carpet and a big fraternal hug. **********It was the first time Mr. Milosevic had been seen in the flesh by journalists since the bombing began. After their meeting, Mr. Lukashenko said that Mr. Milosevic remained opposed to any foreign soldiers entering Kosovo under a peace settlement, and that Yugoslavia would accept civilian peacekeepers only under a United Nations banner, and only if none came from NATO countries. **********That suggestion is so far from NATO's demands for an armed international security force with a NATO core as to be a non-starter. **********Mr. Draskovic did not attend the funeral, but his wife, Danica, was there, along with other opposition party leaders like Vuk Obradovic of the Social Democrats and Vladan Batic of the Christian Democratic Party. **********Speaking at the small chapel, where wreaths of white calla lilies, tulips, jonquils and carnations were mounded around the coffin, Liljana Smajlovic, the foreign editor of Evropljanin, remembered Mr. Curuvija's last staff meeting on the day the bombing began, March 24, when he suspended publication. **********''I'll always remember two things Slavko Curuvija said: he would not publish newspapers for the censors and, second, that NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia was illegal, illegitimate and immoral,'' Ms. Smajlovic said. **********''He was a brave man,'' she said, ''braver than those who shot him in the back like cowards, and braver than those who bombed him from the air.'' **********Speaking over the coffin at Mr. Curuvija's grave site, as reporters and mourners jostled each other on the jumbled tombstones of others, Voja Zanetic, an editor of the Dnevni Telegraf, said, ''It is impossible to describe today's situation in a headline, or even in an entire newspaper.'' **********As he put copies of Mr. Curuvija's publications into the grave and weeping family members bent to toss clods of earth onto the coffin, Mr. Zanetic called the spot ''holy ground.'' **********Then workers in blue overalls, with ''Public Enterprise, Belgrade Cemeteries'' embroidered on their pockets, filled in the grave, their shovels clanging against marble and granite. As some sobbed and others turned away, the workers heaped the memorial wreaths and bouquets for Mr. Curuvija on top of the raw grave, until the pile of flowers rose above the headstones. **********Another senior Serbian journalist noted as he walked along that few of the mourners were wearing the bull's-eye logo that has become de rigueur at anti-NATO rallies. ''This is normal Belgrade,'' he said, gesturing to the crowd. ''In a way this is a funeral for normal Belgrade.'' **********The war was not far away. On the outer wall of the cemetery, next to Mr. Curuvija's death notice, there was another, announcing the death of Bandur Mihajlo, known as Miki. **********Mr. Mihjalo, the notice said, died on April 8, at 25. ''You died bravely defending the homeland, our dear and beloved son,'' the notice read. It was signed by his father, Stevan, and his mother, Milka, and it bore a picture of a baby-faced Mr. Mihjalo, his hair shorn, in his uniform."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/17/your-money/IHT-drips-give-neophytes-a-painless-introduction-to-investing-in.html": {"writer_name": "Mitchell Martin", "pub_date": "1999-07-17", "snippet": "IT WAS Mao Zedong who said that the longest journey begins with a single step, but the founder of Chinese Communism obviously did not know much about investing in stocks that first step is a doozy..

The stock market would be a daunting place for anybody lacking experience, and most brokerage houses want you to deposit at least $1,000 to open an account. Should rational people, especially those in their 20s or early 30s, plunk down that much money for something they do not know much about? **********From the novice investor's point of view, it would be far more sensible to invest $100 or $200 to get started, and even better if they could buy several different stocks. **********In fact, there are several ways to get into the U.S. stock market for less than $500, and it is getting easier all the time as new plans are developed and new sources of information become available to investors around the world. **********One of the keys is dividend-reinvestment plans, or DRIPs, which allow investors to plow their quarterly payouts back into shares of companies in which they already own stock. Most plans also allow investors to make additional purchases of stock for as little as $10 even if you only buy a fraction of a share, so you can use the accounts to build up stakes in a small portfolio of companies, including many non-U.S. companies with American depositary receipt programs. **********In effect, you would be running your own low-cost mutual fund, one that would not require you to pay management fees and expenses, which typically take 1 percent a year from your assets even in a well-run fund that does not have a sales commission. Another advantage over mutual funds is that your portfolio would not generate capital-gains taxes until you sold the stocks. Dividends, however, are taxed, and overseas investors have to fill out forms to minimize the U.S. withholding. Some or all of that could be recouped as deductions from your home taxes. **********Traditionally, dividend-reinvestment plans were popular with utility companies seeking to raise capital. George Fisher, who publishes a newsletter called Power Investing With DRIPs, said the utilities used them to sell new shares to investors. Rule changes by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the mid-1990s, however, made it easier for other kinds of companies to offer their shares to investors, and they can now buy them on the open market so they do not have to get permission to issue new stock. **********One thing the companies are not allowed to do, however, is advertise these plans, Mr. Fisher said. That would be construed as making a securities offering without sending out a prospectus. In fact, one reason these plans are relatively unknown is that those who have a vested interest in publicizing them are not allowed to do so. It requires third parties to provide information and, often, assistance to investors to get them started. **********Still, as a result of the new rules has been an explosion of companies offering dividend-reinvestment plans, which this week stood at 1,272, according to Vita Nelson, editor and publisher of the Money Paper, another newsletter and one associated with a company that helps investors buy shares in these companies. Investors outside the United States can participate in 986 of those plans, she said, and there are growing numbers of foreign companies whose American depositary receipts offer DRIPs. **********It is hard to get into DRIPs in a small way through a regular broker. Shares held in a brokerage account are registered in the broker's name, so to participate in a dividend-reinvestment plan you would have to pay about $15 to get a certificate mailed to you **********The costs may not end there. Most DRIPs allow you to reinvest dividends and to buy additional shares for free, and many of them charge little or no brokerage commissions when it comes time to sell. But there has been a move by some companies to levy higher fees. AT&T Corp., for example, charges 10 percent of each dividend reinvested, with a maximum of $1, which is relatively modest. But it also charges $5 for direct cash purchases, according to Evergeen Enterprises, which publishes an annual guide to companies offering these plans. **********The fixed charge reduce the attractiveness of investing small amounts \u2014 you wouldn't want to invest $10 and have $5 taken right away **********Some companies go the opposite route and actually pay you to buy their shares. Pennsylvania Enterprises Inc., an energy, construction and real estate company, offers a 5 percent discount to the stock-market price on reinvested dividends and direct cash purchases. **********To avoid brokerage-house commissions and the hassle of getting a certificate mailed, there are several organizations that will help you buy initial shares in companies with DRIPs. Investors will need to send funds in dollars, but they can easily do so by purchasing travelers' checks. Foreign-currency checks and bank drafts are other options. **********Ms. Nelson's Temper Enrollment Services will buy shares in most of the U.S.-listed companies with DRIPs and plans to extend that to all of them soon. **********Temper charges a service fee of $20 for each stock plus a brokerage fee of 5 cents a share (with a minimum of 50 cents for one share or $1 for two to 20) for up to 100 shares of a DRIP company. The service fee falls to $15 for subscribers to any of its several investment publications or to its members who pay $49.50 a year for various benefits, including access to its on-line newsletter about DRIPs, Direct Investing. **********Alternatively, investors can buy a one-day membership for $10 and get the $15 rate, which makes sense if you invest in at least three stocks. **********Here is how an investor could start a mini-portfolio with four different stocks: **********Ms. Nelson said she was currently recommending Coca-Cola Co., whose price has been depressed by its problems with tainted drinks in Europe. This is the kind of situation that DRIP investors like to take advantage of, buying shares in companies that are having what they hope are temporary troubles. She also likes Clayton Homes Inc., a builder of manufactured homes, a company she described as \"overlooked.\" **********To spice up that portfolio with some higher-tech companies, you might add two that she said were popular, Intel Corp. and Pfizer Inc. To buy one share of each, you would have to pay $10 for a one-day membership, $60 for the four service fees, $2 in brokerage fees, and, using recent prices for each of the stocks, $64 for Coke, $11.875, for Clayton, $67.6875 for Intel and $37.6875 for Pfizer. That comes to a total of $253.25 Temper also asks for a cushion of 10 percent in case the stock price rises while the order is being processed, but it returns unspent funds. **********None of those companies charges additional brokerage fees, according to the American Association of Individual Investors June 1999 Journal, which carries that group's annual listing of DRIPs, and subsequent purchases can be made for as little as $10 at Coca-Cola, $25 at Intel, $50 at Pfizer and $100 at Clayton. **********A similar service to Temper's is offered by the National Association of Investors Corp. though it only covers about 150 companies. The group's Low Cost Investment Plan is open only to members, so you have to join at a cost of $68 a year ($39 in the United States). Membership includes a one-year subscription to the group's publication, Better Investing. **********Some of the NAIC companies require higher initial investments than one share. Clayton, for example, has a 25-share minimum. **********On the other hand, NAIC's $7 set-up fee is lower than Temper's. It also has a fluctuation fee that is usually $10, though some companies ask for more. Clayton requires $50. **********A third group that will help you is the First Share cooperative, which has a DRIP program and on June 1 started a partnership called Personal Portfolio Service that will buy shares in any listed company that its members request. That service will be attractive to investors who do not wish to be bothered with the record-keeping required of most DRIP plans because it will track each position on a comprehensive statement. **********First Share's established service lets members buy shares from others who already have positions in companies with DRIPs. Members pay $10 a request \u2014 or $5 for selected, popular companies \u2014 and are directed to others who are willing to transfer a share from existing DRIPs. The selling member gets $7.50 plus the price of the stock and must arrange for the transfer, which requires a signature guarantee from a bank or brokerage house. Memberships cost $65 a year ($24 in the United States) **********You can skip the middleman entirely with about 250 companies that sell shares directly to investors. Interestingly, 13 of these companies do not pay dividends, according to the AAII. **********You would need a little more money to start a mini portfolio this way; most direct-purchase plans have $250 or $500 minimums. **********If this kind of investing appeals to you, you will need information on the plans available and on the companies. The first stop for any serious investor with access to the Internet should be Netstock Direct. Investors can sign up directly with some plans on the site, although this requires an American bank account. A Netstock spokesman said some overseas banks have U.S. subsidiaries that will provide their customers the necessary routing numbers to tap into their home accounts, and this neatly takes care of currency conversions. **********A U.S. account is also necessary for a twist that lets investors ease in slowly: some companies waive their minimums if you promise to make automatic investments for several months. **********International Business Machines Corp., for example, has a $500 minimum but will allow investors into its plan if they agree to invest $50 for 10 months. There is also a $15 set-up fee for the account, a $1 fee for each automatic transfer or a $5 fee for cash purchases. If you want to sell, it costs $15 plus 10 cents a share **********Netstock Direct also offers advice for buying specific DRIPs, going beyond the guide books, according to Mr. Fisher, who writes for it as well as his own newsletter. Right now, he said, his favorite DRIPs include Equifax Inc., Federal Signal Corp., Intel Corp., Motorola, Corp., and Raytheon Co. **********For further information: **********AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS.

The panel plans to explore how billions of dollars in Russian money flowed through the Bank of New York and how it was used. **********At his request, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers will be the  first witness. He is certain to face stiff questioning about what the Administration knew about a Federal criminal inquiry into the reports of money laundering before they became public and what steps it took to compel Russian leaders to crack down on corruption. **********On Wednesday, the panel is to hear from the chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New York, Thomas A.

That debate, and the problems that the panels face, is reflected in a cable that the American Embassy in Moscow sent to Washington this month. **********The cable, stamped sensitive and not for distribution to foreign governments, outlines the schemes used by Russians to skirt Russian laws in  sending money out of the country and converting it into United States dollars. The schemes are used by many, from individuals who want to help relatives abroad or have a nest egg just in case to large companies that use offshore shell companies to hide the sources of the money, the embassy reported. **********But, the embassy continued, criminal groups also use the schemes to disguise and launder illegal proceeds. And it cites a Russian study that 33 percent of the so-called capital flight was illegal money and that 37 percent was questionable. **********Lawmakers are also hoping to get to the bottom of what happened at the Bank of New York, a highly sophisticated operation that involved tens of thousands of electronic transfers and layers and layers of companies, many registered on offshore islands. One investigator said last week that there may not even be the traditional paper trail. **********Even as lawmakers dig into their inquiries, the Administration is searching for measures to address the problem. **********The options under consideration include requiring American banks to take a hard look at all their Russian customers and putting pressure on President Boris N. Yeltsin to enact legislation to counter laundering, or perhaps even to deny visas to Russians who are implicated in siphoning of assets, Administration officials said. **********''We would like to appear active before Congress hits us with a sledgehammer,'' said one Administration official. **********The strategy to combat laundering, due this month, is being amended, the official said, to have it go beyond the traditional blue-collar laundering by drug dealers and to include what he described as white-collar laundering. Those involve the electronic transfers, from a variety of sources including Government funds and corporate assets, that have been found in the Bank of New York case. **********But officials are not sanguine that the problem can be easily fixed. American banks have steadfastly lobbied against laws that would require them to investigate customers' backgrounds, and pressure on Mr. Yeltsin could serve to fuel his political enemies, who are even more resistant to reforms."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/26/business/the-walleye-war-a-trade-dispute-roils-the-us-canadian-border.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1999-11-26", "snippet": "Trade dispute between US and Canada is developing over North American Free Trade Agreement mechanisms that force Ontario to drop two-year-old regulation that says that non-Canadian anglers can keep walleye and sauger fish caught on Canadian side o...", "word_count": 1322, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The Walleye War; A Trade Dispute Roils the U.S.-Canadian Border", "print_headline": "The Walleye War; A Trade Dispute Roils the U.S.-Canadian Border", "body_text": " **********Just beyond Wolf Island, Donna Hanson was closing her fishing camp for the season, locking up tourist cabins before the ice reached across Lake of the Woods. With the ice, 14,652 islands turn into one vast winter wilderness empty but for wandering deer, moose and bears. **********But as the late autumn light fell on faded photos of happy American anglers holding up fat trophy fish, her mood soured as she talked of her bucolic world being drawn into an international trade vortex -- spun by Nafta, the World Trade Organization and the muscle politics of the governor of neighboring Minnesota, Jesse Ventura. **********''We are not going to have a trade person in Washington, D.C., tell us how to run our lake,'' fumed Ms. Hanson, whose family built the first peeled-spruce log cabins here on King Island in 1926. **********In a pique over pickerel, the United States has used conflict-resolution mechanisms set up by the North American Free Trade Agreement to force Ontario to drop a two-year-old regulation that said that non-Canadian anglers could keep walleye and sauger fish caught on the Canadian side of this border-straddling lake only if they were staying in an Ontario lodge. The Canadians said the fight was over conserving walleye, a buttery-tasting sport fish often known here as a pickerel; the Americans said the fight was over fishing dollars. **********In early November, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, took time out from preparing for trade trips to Beijing and Seattle to release a victory statement about this obscure fish fight. The headline: ''U.S. prevails in dispute with Canada over sport fishing and tourism services.'' **********To some Canadians, it was a familiar story of the United States bullying Canada on trade issues, whether it is walleye or television programming or magazine advertising. **********''We appear to be losing more than we should,'' said Peter S. Bleyer, executive director of the Council of Canadians, a nationalist group. ''Every time our government hears any threatening noises from south of the border, they back down.'' His Ottawa-based group is sending a ''protest train'' across Canada to swell the ranks of protesters at the World Trade Organization meeting that opens on Nov. 30 in Seattle. **********To the Americans, it is a case of Nafta rules giving speedy relief to the little guy. ''When it is your livelihood, it is very big potatoes,'' said Celeste Colson, owner of Jake's Northwest Angle, one of 14 fishing lodges in Angle Inlet, Minn., an American enclave on the western shore of the lake. Canadian tourist maps have traditionally used fish photos to blot out this American presence on the lake. Escalating the walleye war, Ontario's 1998 lodging rule promptly cut the Angle's business in half. ''We were pretty sure it was basically illegal,'' Ms. Colson said, ''but they were getting away with it.'' **********Giving an international trade tour d'horizon from her lakeside lodge 300 miles north of Minneapolis, Ms. Colson predicted mayhem in Seattle, saying, ''There is an ugly kind of satisfaction at smacking around the United States.'' **********When American lodge owners in the Angle started talking about seceding from the United States and joining Canada, their plight drew the attention of Jim Southwick, a lawyer in Minneapolis who learned how to handle trade levers in the mid-1990's when he worked in Washington as the trade representative's lawyer for Nafta issues. There are fewer than a dozen United States-Canada trade issues in the Nafta resolution pipeline, a tiny amount for the $1 billion a day in goods that cross the border every day in the world's largest trading relationship. **********''The process really worked -- in nine months we went from a start to a resolution of the matter,'' said Mr. Southwick, calling the fish fight a textbook case for speedy resolution of trade disputes through the five-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. ''It is not very often that small-business owners are in position to take advantage of the trade machinery.'' **********Ms. Barshefsky's office started the Nafta process last April with a formal investigation. Ontario's overnight lodging rule had already damaged Minnesota's $70 million tourism industry on the two international lakes affected, Lake of the Woods and nearby Rainy Lake. Then, last fall, Ontario threatened to extend the rule to all international waters along Minnesota's northern border, potentially harming a $700 million tourism industry. **********Mr. Ventura, the former wrestler turned governor, reacted with rage, warning, ''Canada shouldn't mess with Minnesota.'' To put authority behind the threat, Minnesota's legislature started debating a bill to tax freight trains rolling through a 43-mile Minnesota section of the Canadian National railway that links Manitoba and Ontario. **********The threat was not taken lightly on the Canadian side of this lake, where the most prominent landmark in Kenora, the largest town, is a 40-foot high statue of ''Husky the Musky,'' a two ton, steel and fiberglass rendering of a muskellunge fighting fish. With more than 10,000 tourist beds to fill on the Canadian side of the lake, Kenora has polished its tourist image ever since 1905, the year it dropped its Indian-derived name, Rat Portage. **********''Their new governor down there is trying to prove he can do the job, that he can get a victory,'' said Mal Tygesson, owner of Evergreen Lodge and past president of the Kenora District Camp Owners Association. ''The thing we find very scary is that a trade deal on tourism gives them unfettered access to a resource.'' **********Although Evergreen Lodge is on Eagle Lake, a completely Canadian lake, Mr. Tygesson said that the new ruling allowed busloads of Minnesotans to come up to his lake, fish the local limit -- two walleyes -- and then go back down to Minnesota without spending a Canadian cent in Ontario. ''They take their fish, put them on the bus and then take them home at night,'' said Mr. Tygesson, whose lodge is 50 miles north of the border. ''If one country has the right to do that with the resources of another country, then they have the right to do that with the water, with the trees. The U.S. is a mammoth, a giant. It's hungry, and it's looking for resources all around the world.'' **********In Lake of the Woods, an island-dotted liquid expanse that stretches over an area larger than Rhode Island, Canadian resort owners contend that Americans control only a third of the lake but stuff their creels with more than half of the annual catch. They say that Canada largely froze the development of new lodges in the 1970's. In contrast, they say, Minnesota continues to build lodges that can only make money if they have access to game fish, which are more prevalent in the deeper waters of the Canadian side. **********''We are saying, 'We don't want you to have our fish,' '' said Tom Pearson, owner of Camp Narrows Lodge on Rainy Lake. ''We have lost control of our waters.'' **********When Pierre Trudeau was Canada's prime minister, he once lectured provincial premiers who wanted control of international fishing policy: ''Fish swim.'' But today many Canadian lodge owners cite studies by Canadian biologists to show that some of the lake's walleye populations are Maple Leaf nationalists from gills to tails, rarely venturing into American waters, where there are few sheltering islands. **********Minnesotans respond that Canada's conservation plan meant forcing anglers to spend dollars in Canada to catch the same fish. **********''We, too, are concerned with conservation,'' said Ron Payer, chief of fisheries for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Immediately after Ontario abandoned its lodging rule, Minnesota cut its summer limit of walleye and sauger to 8 from 14. In turn, Ontario has raised its total summer limit to 4 from 1. **********Now, in the hiatus between summer fishing and ice fishing, tourism operators hope the two countries can converge on their limits. **********Erick Bennett, owner of the Maple Leaf Motel in Sioux Narrows, recently savored a relaxed, off-season Sunday lunch. Perhaps inadvertently, he spun a Nafta-esque scenario for walleye limits: ''I would like one day to see equal rules -- one lake, one rule.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/12/world/wide-power-failure-strikes-southern-brazil.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-03-12", "snippet": "Brazil's three largest cities are plunged into darkness by a power failure that affects most of southern third of the country; residents of Rio De Janeiro and Sao Paolo are urged to remain in their homes or their places of business until power is ...", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Wide Power Failure Strikes Southern Brazil", "print_headline": "Wide Power Failure Strikes Southern Brazil", "body_text": " **********Brazil's three largest cities were plunged into darkness tonight by a power failure that the authorities said affected most of the southern third of the country. **********Residents of Rio and Sao Paolo were urged to remain in their homes or their places of business until power was restored.

During a long job search -- more than  three years -- I have suspected that one of my references is giving a poor recommendation of me to potential employers. Despite good qualifications and good interviews, I  am rarely offered a position. After rejections, I often ask if my references might have affected the outcome, but I never hear any specifics. How can I know if a reference is chilling my prospects? How should I respond if my suspicions prove true? **********A. For starters, don't assume that someone is out to get you. Even if your job search is being undermined at the reference-checking stage, the problem may be nothing more than human error. **********Corporate human-resources departments can wipe out people's careers by providing incorrect information, said Terra Dourlain, managing director of MyReferences.com, an employment verification and reference-checking firm in Jamestown, N.Y. If what you are saying doesn't jibe with what your interviewer is hearing from those offices -- about job titles, salary or your reason for leaving the company -- it can make you look like a liar, she said. **********When starting a job hunt -- or even at this late stage -- it's a good idea to call the human resources departments of previous employers, Ms. Dourlain advised: ''Say, 'I'm putting together my resume and would like to confirm the information you have.' '' **********Finding whether a particular co-worker or supervisor is casting you in an unflattering light, however, can be trickier. ''You will not get feedback from any potential employers, nor should you put them in that kind of position,'' said Dale Winston, chief executive of Battalia Winston International, an executive search firm in New York. **********Many people hire outsiders like reference-checking firms to call around to their references, particularly when the split with a former employer was less than amicable. Even if you had a good relationship with employers and co-workers, Ms. Dourlain said, ''not everyone has the ability to give other people credit.'' **********Another path is to approach your references directly -- not to make accusations, but to get a sense of how they view you and your work. **********''Have a meeting,'' Ms. Winston suggested. ''Say to them, 'What kind of a job do you think is appropriate for me now? What do you think some of my strengths and weaknesses are?' '' **********Once you have a better sense of what -- or who -- the problem is, you can build a strategy for future interviews, Ms. Dourlain said.

Less well known is how concentrated other parts of the economy are, often in those same few, wealthy hands. **********While Hong Kong was voted for four years running as the world's freest economy by the conservative Heritage Foundation of the United States, partly because it has one of the world's lowest tax rates and few trade barriers, the reality of its domestic economy is another story. It features a rash of anti-competitive restrictions and one of the weakest competition regimes in the developed world. **********Calls by Hong Kong's independent Consumer Council for a competition authority to monitor the government's handing out of licenses and contracts have been rebuffed by government officials, who contend that they are well able to police industry themselves. Yet, the dispute continues. **********\"In the course of discussions with trade bodies and businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, the Consumer Council has been made aware of the lack of a level playing field and a vulnerability to monopoly practices in some sectors of the economy, such as anti-competitive cross-subsidization, exclusive dealing, price discrimination, resale price maintenance and price-fixing,\" the council said in a recent submission to the legislature. **********\"Due to the fact that some very large and powerful businesses have involvement across different sectors, it may be difficult for the various government agencies to monitor market conduct,\" it added. **********In earlier studies of key sectors of the Hong Kong economy, the council has found a low level of competition in several sectors, including bank deposits, supermarket sales and the supply of gas. Today, only interest rates on deposits of less than a week are still set by a banking cartel, but until a few years ago, all interest rates were set this way. **********\"While free and open competition has long been the case in the traded sectors of the Hong Kong economy, this has not been the case in some nontraded sectors,\" said the Vision 2047 Foundation, a nonprofit organization, in a 1996 report, \"The Hong Kong Advantage.\" **********This is hardly anything new. Since the handover to China in 1997, the traditional colonial practice of Britain \u2014 the striking of lucrative deals with large business interests in secret \u2014 has continued. **********The latest example to elicit sharp protests came in the budget presented March 3, Then, contrary to normal procedure by which land is auctioned or tendered to the highest bidder, the government awarded a massive amount of prime land to the son of the tycoon Li Ka-shing, Richard Li, to develop a $1.7 billion \"cyberport,\" part of Hong Kong's recent push into high technology. **********About half of the money will come from Mr. Li's company, which will be allowed to develop one third of the site for expensive, residential property. Critics say the cyberport is simply another mixed use real estate development, dressed up to camouflage a secretive deal that benefits Hong Kong's leading commercial family. **********\"Has the government suddenly changed the rules of the game\" from open tender? asked Emily Lau, an opposition legislator. \"Are there going to be more and more such secret deals in future?\" **********\"Auctions and tenders have always served us well in bringing us the best possible prices\" for land, wrote Jake van der Kamp this week in his column in the South China Morning Post. \"Others should have had an opportunity to submit their proposals for a project this big.\" **********Speaking Wednesday at a seminar on the cyberport, Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, insisted that the cyberport had been created in \"a highly competitive environment,\" adding: \"Cronyism is never in Hong Kong's dictionary.\" Hong Kong, he added, prided itself \"on being transparent and we always maintain a level playing field.\" **********Companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo! Inc. have signed on to lease space in the cyberport, though it is unclear what if anything they will do once there that they could not already do in other premises in Hong Kong. **********The government defended its conduct, saying an open tender would have delayed the start of the cyberport by six months or more. \"Six months is a century in the development of information technology,\" said the information secretary, K.C. Kwong. \"We are competing with the whole world.\" **********Other areas in which the Consumer Council alleges sluggish competition include the oil industry in Hong Kong. The council has begun an investigation into retail pricing of liquid petroleum gas, after the handful of service station companies were allegedly slow to lower the retail price of their product even though import prices were plunging. **********This \"points to a lack of competition in the retail supply,\" the council said. **********Another area of controversy is telecommunications, where legislators and companies that are not owned by tycoons are alleging that the government is backtracking on plans to liberalize the fixed-line telephone sector. **********After Hongkong Telecom's phone monopoly was broken in 1995, the government licensed three companies to provide fixed-line service. All three companies were controlled by three of the largest property empires in the city. **********Now, the three-year moratorium on new competitors has passed, but the government is being accused by other phone companies of buckling under to statements by Li Ka-shing, who said that he would make fewer investments in his phone network if he had to face more competition."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/21/jobs/some-head-south-and-some-head-back.html": {"writer_name": "Jon Nordheimer", "pub_date": "1999-03-21", "snippet": "Tens of thousands of retirees move to Florida, but for some of them the dream of Sunshine State turns out to be illusion that is costly financially and emotionally; decision to retire and move far from family, friends and other social support syst...", "word_count": 1350, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Job Market", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Some Head South, And Some Head Back", "print_headline": "Some Head South, And Some Head Back", "body_text": " **********FOR Patricia DiFiore, the moment of truth came when none of her new neighbors could identify Donald Trump or the QE2.

But when mention of the New York tycoon and the luxury ocean liner drew only blank stares, the DiFiores concluded that they had settled in the wrong place. **********But what really got to them was the heat. ''For about three months in the winter Florida weather is great,'' Mrs. DiFiore said. ''But we couldn't go outdoors in the summer because it was so hot. We were miserable.'' **********The DiFiores, like tens of thousands of other retirees, dreamed for years about giving up their jobs and moving to the Sunshine State. The dream turned out to be an illusion that was costly financially and emotionally. After several years they returned to New Jersey, settling in one of the scores of retirement villages near the Jersey Shore in Ocean County, which has the highest concentration of retirees in the Northeast. **********The decision to retire and move far from family, friends and other social support systems is a momentous one. But according to experts it is often made without due consideration beforehand. Thousands of older Americans move to Florida, or to Arizona or Southern California, happily leaving behind snow drifts to embrace a new climate, surroundings and people from other regions eager to start a new life. Once there, however, they find that their new life is not what they expected. **********''Some people move down here on the basis of one or two trips to Disney World in March,'' said Marilee Tihen-Sarchet, a counselor with a regional agency on aging in Fort Myers, on Florida's southwest coast. **********She noted that in many cases these newcomers don't know who their neighbors will be, what social services are available or what help is available if they need it. ''They discover that living here is different from being on vacation here,'' she said. ''They can end up with too much time on their hands and nothing to do. When that happens, we see a lot of very lonely people.'' **********Florida attracts an estimated 150,000 retirees a year, according to state records. About 23 percent of all Americans over age 60 who move out of state when they retire move to Florida, said Dr. Charles Longino Jr., a professor of sociology at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. The rate has slipped from a peak of 26 percent in 1989, a period that also coincides with lower numbers of Depression-era babies entering the retirement market, said Dr. Longino, who is an expert on demographic patterns among retirees. **********What many Florida-bound retirees do not consider is that, despite its obvious attractions, the state has experienced a significant rise in population, up to 14.5 million from 6.8 million in 1970; its cost of living now rivals that of some Northern states, and crime, congestion and other social concerns obstruct carefree living, a consequence of growth also seen in retirement havens like Arizona and California. **********The sense of dislocation can be exacerbated by the onset of old-age afflictions, because there is no built-in support system. Ms. Tihen-Sarchet said that on a daily basis, she sees people who uprooted themselves to move to Florida and then are stricken by a debilitating disease and have no one to fall back on for help. **********''If they can afford to hire private agencies they can have a lot of help, but we don't have the funding in Florida to help those without the assets,'' she said. Many retirement communities offer assisted-living arrangements for those who need it, and such communities tend to have built-in social supports. But not everyone moves to retirement communities, or thinks ahead to a time when such arrangements might be necessary. **********The numbers of retirees who return home from Florida or relocate elsewhere are not available, demographers say. But enough people are leaving that state policy experts are conducting a study of out-migration, which they expect to complete within six months. Dr. Larry Polivka, the director of the Florida Policy Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida, said that people who reach age 80 and become more medically fragile often move closer to their children. **********Fred Stroup and his wife, Beverly, did not wait that long. They moved to Orlando from Indiana in 1986 and were content as Mr. Stroup, who is now 69, continued to work three days a week as a consultant for a firm that manufactures fire trucks. But when he fully retired in 1993, he said, they felt increasingly oppressed by the hot summers and traffic snarls generated by nearby Walt Disney World. **********Five years ago they relocated to Tupelo, Miss., where a son and his family live. ''It's still too hot and wet to play golf in August,'' Mr. Stroup said. ''But when I do play, it's at the No. 1 public course in the state and green fees, cart and lunch cost me $34.50, about half of what it would cost in Orlando.'' **********He said his utility bills are more than $1,000 less annually than they were in Orlando, and his city and county taxes add up to less than $500 a year for a house similar in size but on a larger lot than his former home, where his annual tax bill was $2,000. Neither state taxes retirement income, he added. **********If Florida is losing ground among retirees, other states, from the Carolinas to New Jersey, are gaining. Here on the Jersey shore, where the DiFiores resettled, adult residential communities are burgeoning. Local boosters tout the weather (winters are warmer and summers cooler than inland, they say), the semirural location and the proximity to New York and Philadelphia, both about 60 miles away. House costs run from $60,000 for two-bedroom cottages to $200,000 for gated private golf course residences. **********Nearly 100,000 people live in the 70 different adult communities that dot Ocean County, said Philip Rubenstein, the director of the local Office of Senior Services. That number is about equal to the county's total population in 1960, when it began attracting retirees leaving the New York area, Mr. Rubenstein said. **********''Most come from cities and suburbs within 100 miles of here, so there are not a lot of adjustments to make,'' said Dolores Pipoli, the director of the county's Visiting Home Care agency, which provides housekeeping aides to the elderly. **********Eva Eicher and her husband, Patrick Doran, residents of Lake Ridge, an adult community outside Lakewood, N.J., followed an unusual route, moving from the Middle West to the Northeast. They had spent two years studying possible retirement locations, nearly opting for North Carolina. The pull of family was the clincher that brought them from their home in Chicago. **********''Pat has five girls and I have three sons from previous marriages,'' Ms. Eicher, 61, noted. ''All of them live somewhere between Delaware and Connecticut, so this part of New Jersey puts us within a few hours drive of all of them.'' **********Ms. Eicher said she has friends who moved far from their families when they retired and now regret it, or who had chosen remote localities and hungered for an occasional taste of city life and culture. **********FOR those who are drawn to warm weather and their families, and who can afford it, there is the two-home solution. Two such snowbirds, Shirley and Sidney Sprung, live from May through October in Lakewood Township, N.J., where Mr. Sprung ran a furniture business until he retired in 1985. The Sprungs, who are in their 70's, spend the other six months in a similar community in Delray Beach, Fla., not far from friends, also from New Jersey, whom the couple have known for nearly a half-century. **********''We wanted to stay up North to be near our children,'' Mrs. Sprung said. ''Being able to go to Florida in the winter gives us the best of both worlds.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/06/business/company-news-springs-industries-to-sell-a-unit-to-management-group.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-01-06", "snippet": "Springs Industries agrees to sell its Springfield division, which makes woven fabrics for apparel industry, to management-led group for about $46 million; new company will be called Springfield LLC (S)", "word_count": 76, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPRINGS INDUSTRIES TO SELL A UNIT TO MANAGEMENT GROUP", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SPRINGS INDUSTRIES TO SELL A UNIT TO MANAGEMENT GROUP", "body_text": " **********The home-furnishings concern Springs Industries said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Springfield division, which makes woven fabrics for the apparel industry, to a management-led group for about $46 million.

Although few details of the agreement have been disclosed, officials said it would open China's telecommunications, banking and insurance industries to American companies. **********''If China joins the trading world, its companies are going to be forced to change,'' said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter here. **********Such optimism is far from conventional wisdom in mainland China. Indeed, a main reason this trade agreement took so long to reach was that some Chinese government officials feared that the country's state-owned corporations -- many of them bloated relics of a command economy -- would be thrashed by more nimble rivals from the United States or Europe. **********Those fears have not gone away. But Mr. Xie said they were outweighed by the prospect that foreign companies could help Chinese companies as partners or investors. One of the oft-mentioned candidates for such a partnership, China Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd., recorded an 8.5 percent increase in its shares. **********China Telecom is a prime example of a company that could be transformed by China's entry into the World Trade Organization. As the dominant player in China's burgeoning mobile phone business, it would be an instant candidate for an alliance with a European or American cellular carrier, when outsiders are allowed to own stakes in Chinese telecommunications providers. **********As if to dramatize that point, one of Hong Kong's leading telecommunications providers, Hutchinson Whampoa Ltd., announced a $1.2 billion joint venture today with Global Crossing Ltd., the operator of a worldwide fiber optic network. The new venture, to be called China Crossing, will build a high-speed fiber optic voice and data network, initially in Hong Kong but later aiming at the mainland China market. **********Some analysts contend that Chinese fears of foreign competition are overblown. American companies have stumbled in China in businesses as diverse as insurance and beer, and not always because of trade barriers. **********''The obstacles to making money in China are not just those that have to be removed as part of W.T.O. accession,'' said Richard Margolis, a regional strategist at Merrill Lynch here. He cited issues like pricing and marketing. **********Not all the Chinese companies that benefited from today's announcement are on the frontier of technology or communications. Two old-style shipping companies, Cosco Pacific and China Shipping Development, recorded 12 percent and 13.69 percent increases in their shares, respectively, because of hopes that the trade pact would expand the amount of cargo flowing between the United States and China. **********Mr. Xie said the agreement also raised the odds that several big Chinese state-owned companies would be able to issue shares in the Hong Kong market the next year. Beijing hopes to raise more than $20 million by offering shares in companies like China National Petroleum and the Bank of China."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/20/business/company-news-southern-tells-of-efforts-to-buy-gas-pipeline-company.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-10-20", "snippet": "Southern Co's chief financial officer William Westbrook says company has tried unsuccessfully for a year to negotiate buyout of natural-gas pipeline company, including El Paso Energy Corp or Coastal Corp (S)", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTHERN TELLS OF EFFORTS TO BUY GAS PIPELINE COMPANY", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SOUTHERN TELLS OF EFFORTS TO BUY GAS PIPELINE COMPANY", "body_text": " **********The Southern Company, the largest United States power generator and owner of Atlanta's electric utility, has tried unsuccessfully for a year to negotiate a buyout of a natural-gas pipeline company, including the El Paso Energy Corporation or the Coastal Corporation, Southern's chief financial officer said yesterday.

Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican, said in a statement that the changes taking place were the kind of transitory issues that should be expected when an agency is undergoing a major transformation. **********The number of audits in the fiscal year that began this autumn will be cut by 30 percent to 40 percent from the record low number of two years ago, the latest for which data are available, the I.R.S. commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, said. Fewer than one in 300 tax returns will be audited this fiscal year, down from one in 217 two years ago and one in 63 in 1981. For wealthy individuals with gross income of $100,000 or more, fewer than an estimated one in 150 returns will be audited this year compared to one in 33 in 1992. **********The I.R.S. plans to continue giving its highest priority to auditing the 1,600 largest corporations. But it will sharply reduce audits of the other 16 million businesses in America, the vast majority of them privately owned, and of the rapidly increasing ranks of high-income Americans, who tend to file complex returns. The percentage of corporate returns that are audited is expected to fall to just above 1 percent for the current fiscal year from just under 3 percent in 1992. **********The effort to find tax cheating is being reduced even more than these numbers suggest, according to more than four dozen I.R.S. employees. In interviews they described pressure from managers to avoid upsetting taxpayers, to overlook complex issues and to close audits quickly. Some agents have coined a term for these once-over-lightly examinations of tax returns: audit lite. **********Despite these sharp cuts in personnel to enforce the tax laws, the tax agency is planning a new assault on abuse of the Earned Income Tax Credit, in which the working poor can collect up to $323 for single people and up to $3,556 for a family of four. The credit was created to offset the sharp rise in Social Security tax rates that began two decades ago. Some people make false claims to increase their payment from the government. The credit has been a target of Republican Congressional leaders for the last five years. **********The I.R.S. also plans a major new hunt for people who failed to file tax returns. Tax workers said the last such search, early in this decade, focused on people of modest means, and they expect the same this time. The I.R.S. says it intends to focus this search on people who owe substantial amounts. **********More than one-fifth of I.R.S. employees, the equivalent of 21,000 people working full time, will be assigned to customer service, up from 12,000 four years ago by one measure and nearly 18,000 by another. By either measure there are thousands fewer workers available to conduct audits and collect overdue taxes. **********The tax agency plans one new initiative aimed squarely at the wealthy, an attack on the creation of improper trusts to avoid estate taxes, but this program will not begin until 2001. **********Except for the crackdown on abusive trusts, these changes all grow out of a series of new tax laws sponsored by the Republicans who control Congress. The most significant of these laws, the I.R.S. Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, was passed after Senate Finance Committee hearings in which the I.R.S. was described as out of control and routinely abusive of taxpayers. Much of the most explosive testimony has since been discredited and a subsequent General Accounting Office report found no evidence of systematic mistreatment of taxpayers. **********The hearings, the new laws and Mr. Rossotti's policies together have had a profound effect on the agency's employees, especially the low-level managers whose daily decisions determine how the tax laws are administered. Many of these managers have concluded that they are supposed to wilt before the rich and powerful, especially those who can get a politician on the telephone. **********''Don't aggravate taxpayers --  that's what our managers are telling us,'' said one longtime revenue agent in New York. As he spoke six colleagues nodded in agreement and offered similar comments from their bosses. **********A revenue agent in Florida said his manager told him: ''Don't probe deeply. Just find three or four obvious items and close the case.'' **********An I.R.S. worker in Nashville said anyone there could get a tax case resolved favorably if the taxpayer had enough influence to get a senator or congressman to complain to the I.R.S. ''We just collapse,'' the 14-year veteran said. **********''Please don't call us tax collectors in the newspaper,'' one longtime revenue officer in New York said. ''We don't collect taxes anymore. We aren't allowed to.'' **********The chief of I.R.S. operations, John Dalrymple, said ''none of these comments shock me.'' **********He was given a synopsis of comments from interviews with I.R.S. workers in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Tennessee, Texas and Washington, nearly all of whom spoke on condition that they not be identified. **********''I also am hearing things that have the same general tone,'' he said, adding that he would characterize their comments this way: ''Hey, what is the service's policy going to be around compliance and enforcement? And how are we going to balance the need for good customer service on an individual basis with our responsibility to make sure that people are paying their fair share?'' **********''Frankly, it is a discussion that we have been having at the highest levels of the organization,'' he said. **********Mr. Dalrymple said he and other leading agency executives had traveled the country telling I.R.S. workers that enforcement was important and that all taxpayers were to be treated alike, without regard to their economic or social standing. He said that this message was not getting through and that efforts had failed to stamp out the mistaken belief that policy favored the wealthy. **********''Charles and I have been talking about this for quite some time,'' he said, adding that Mr. Rossotti agreed with him that the only way to change such a widely held belief was for the commissioner to personally make repeated, clear and forceful corrective statements, which he said Mr. Rossotti began doing in May. **********''Managers and employees are looking for some definitive statements from Charles about what to do in certain circumstances that are fairly egregious in terms of not complying with the law,'' Mr. Dalrymple said. **********Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement responding to questions about the changes:  ''Without question, it will take time for I.R.S. agents who have done things one way for the past 40 years to learn the new approach, which is built on better serving taxpayers.'' **********The emphasis on serving customers, as taxpayers are now called, comes not only from Congress but also from Commissioner Rossotti, a management and computer systems expert who was brought in two years ago to modernize the agency. **********Mr. Rossotti has said that for decades the I.R.S. has relied too heavily on audits and on pursuing tax cheats and that the key to increasing tax revenues and maintaining popular support is to help taxpayers meet their obligations through better service delivered by a better-trained staff and improved technology. **********In his first and so far only mission statement for the agency, which focused on helping people pay their taxes, Mr. Rossotti made no mention of enforcing the law or collecting taxes, omissions that have been viewed widely within the agency as reflecting a decreased emphasis on enforcement. **********But now even Mr. Rossotti is worried that enforcement has slipped too far. He told a Senate subcommittee in October that such a low audit rate ''poses the risk of increased unfairness in administration of the law, and, ultimately, undermining our entire system of voluntary tax compliance.'' **********Mr. Rossotti has had to strip down audit units to obey Congressional dictates to expand customer service and resolve a deluge of so-called innocent spouse cases, most of which involve divorced women who say their former husbands cheated on their taxes and left them holding the tax bill. Whole audit teams in Brooklyn, Seattle and elsewhere have been reassigned to innocent spouse cases,  and corporate audit teams across the country that once had as many as 12 highly trained examiners have shrunk to as few as 4 people, tax workers said. **********Highly trained I.R.S. auditors who are paid up to $77,000 annually to examine corporate tax returns have been detailed to answer telephones and greet people at I.R.S. offices, even though their years of specialized work have left them ill equipped to handle mundane questions from the public. One I.R.S. customer service clerk said these auditors needed so much time to research answers to questions that when she was away, it took five of them to do her job. **********Across the country, revenue officers, whose job is to collect taxes past due, said they were having difficulty getting supervisors to approve enforcement actions, like foreclosing on property, because of a perception by managers that they were not to upset customers, even if they are major tax cheats. In the year ended Sept. 30, the I.R.S. seized property 161 times, down from 10,000 two years earlier. Levies on bank accounts and paychecks fell to 504,000 from 3.1 million two years earlier. **********Two revenue officers outlined cases they had built against individuals who each cheated the Government out of millions of dollars in taxes, only to be frustrated by the refusal of their superiors to back them up. These officers described elaborate schemes to place assets in the names of relatives to thwart tax collection and, presumably, hide money from creditors. ''Every badge of fraud was there, but Criminal Investigation Division told me the U.S. Attorney was not interested,'' one of these officers said. **********The revenue officer said that because the case was rejected for prosecution, requests for permission to force the taxpayer to pay, which Congress now requires be approved by high-level managers, have been ignored. ''No one will do anything'' to collect the taxes, the officer said. **********Mr. Dalrymple said he had heard, fourth or fifth hand, similar tales of inaction and was troubled by them. He said he would like to hear directly from revenue officers who think their superiors are failing in their duty to enforce collection. **********The effect of the cuts in audits is amplified by other factors, including a steady rise in the number of tax returns and a very sharp increase in returns filed by high-income Americans, who are the most likely to have income and deductions from businesses and investments, which can involve complex audit issues. **********The number of returns reporting an income of $1 million or more jumped to 142,500 in 1997 from 87,000 two years earlier. These returns often include income from businesses the taxpayer controls, capital gains and other sources not subject to the mandatory reporting systems that apply to the forms of income reported by most people, like wages, interest on savings and dividends. **********But under tight budgets set by Congress, the full-time I.R.S. staff has shrunk to about 82,000 people, down 14 percent from 1995. When the growing number of tax returns, the increased volume of money and the 1,260 tax code changes that Congress enacted in 1997 and 1998 are taken into account, Mr. Rossotti calculates,  the I.R.S. has had its resources cut nearly 29 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/07/business/business-travel-airlines-travel-agencies-woo-small-businesses-with-perks-usually.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Levere", "pub_date": "1999-04-07", "snippet": "Small businesses are being wooed by travel agencies and airlines with perks usually reserved for bigger customers; National Business Travel Association executive director Norman Sherlock says airlines in particular are pursuing small businesses be...", "word_count": 673, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Business Travel; Airlines and travel agencies woo small businesses with perks usually reserved for bigger customers.", "print_headline": "Business Travel; Airlines and travel agencies woo small businesses with perks usually reserved for bigger customers.", "body_text": " **********TRADITIONALLY not beneficiaries of special discounts and other travel privileges like large corporations, smaller businesses are now being wooed with such perks by travel agencies and airlines. **********In recent weeks, British Airways has established a loyalty program for small businesses that offers travel and merchandise rewards, while American Express has set up a travel agency division focused on the needs of small and medium-sized companies.

He added: ''You can see that with Internet services and technology companies, which are growing rapidly.

The division manages travel and negotiates special rates for its clients.

Each of those companies lacks the size to compete with the giants like DaimlerChrysler A.G. or the General Motors Corporation. On top of that, they remain bogged down in brutally competitive markets for midsized and small cars. **********Today's agreement was a particularly big defeat for Fiat, which had openly courted Volvo and was reported to have offered about $7 billion for the entire company. Besides the car business, Fiat executives were also entranced by the idea of combining the two companies' truck and construction equipment businesses. **********''Needless to say, the bid failed,'' said a discouraged Fiat executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''Volvo decided to sell exclusively its car-making activity and to hold on to the other businesses, which were, I might add, of greater interest to us.'' **********But analysts said it also marked a setback for Renault and Peugeot, which remain heavily dependent on the French market and on lower-priced and less profitable mass-market vehicles. **********''Ford has taken a very appealing brand out of the market, and that is bad news for almost everybody else,'' said Chiara Tirloni, an automobile analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. **********Ever since Daimler-Benz and the Chrysler Corporation announced their $36 billion merger last year, European car manufacturers have been engaged in a frenzy of mixing and matchmaking. **********''In the European and in the global automobile market, it's not just fusion but also confusion that you're seeing,'' said Bernd Gottschalk, the president of the German Automobile Industry Association. **********Though Volvo is a small player, producing fewer than 400,000 cars a year, it has important strengths, the most important being its strong appeal to affluent consumers who are willing to pay comparatively higher prices for family cars. In addition, Volvo has a well-established distribution network in the United States. **********Europe's automobile industry is divided into several different camps that face somewhat different pressures. DaimlerChrysler is essentially in a league of its own, a goliath with a huge mass-market presence in North America and an equally strong base in high-priced luxury cars in Europe. **********BMW A.G. and Porsche A.G., meanwhile, have continued to be successful as smaller producers of more expensive sedans and sports cars. BMW has been the subject of repeated takeover rumors, but the company has adamantly denied any interest in selling. **********But most of Europe's other producers are struggling to bridge the gulf between mass and class. Thanks to global overcapacity and a reluctance by European consumers to spend money, competition has been brutal for the last several years among producers of midsized or small cars. **********Volkswagen A.G., which has cut costs and streamlined its production, has been one of the biggest sources of pressure for companies ranging from Fiat and Renault to G.M.'s Opel subsidiary. **********After a painful reorganization in the early 1990's, Volkswagen's sales and profits have surged in the last year. But even though its Audi subsidiary has been successful as a producer of upscale sedans, a few of which compete with DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes, the company is still searching for ways to move beyond mass-market sedans. **********Unlike most of its European peers, Volkswagen is already big enough to compete in today's environment. It produces more than four million cars a year and has about $11 billion in cash to make additional acquisitions. **********The situation is considerably grimmer for French and Italian car companies. Though Fiat has a significant international presence, it has far less cash than Volkswagen or Ford and has been under increasing competitive pressure. **********Fiat's profits were depressed last year by the end of Government-sponsored rebates in Italy, and weakening in two big overseas markets, Poland and Brazil. **********And after announcing its intention to invest $400 million in Russia, the company had to put plans on hold when that nation's economy collapsed last summer. **********Fiat had at least a half-dozen meetings with Volvo officials, most of them near Fiat's headquarters in Turin. **********But Fiat executives said their real target was Volvo's truck-making unit, which produces heavy trucks that might have complemented Fiat's line of smaller trucks. **********Volvo surprised many of its suitors two weeks ago when it bought a 12.8 percent stake in a rival Swedish truck maker, Scania A.B., and said it wanted the two companies to merge their truck operations. But the relationship is still in doubt because it has provoked strenuous objections from Scania's majority shareholder, the investment firm Investor A.B. **********Renault of France had a strong year in 1998, thanks to the success of its new Scenic minivan in Europe. But it still produces fewer than two million cars a year, and Peugeot Citroen is only slightly bigger. **********Analysts say both companies are in a poor position to keep up with the accelerated pace of developing new models at low prices. The heightened competition means that all companies are under pressure to spread research and development costs over a much wider array of cars. **********While companies like BMW and Porsche can avoid the problem to some extent because they charge premium prices, mass-market producers like Renault and Peugeot have no such maneuvering room. And the pressure is intensifying: Toyota is building a $700 million factory in France to make its small Yaris car for the European market. **********But the French companies face political in addition to financial challenges. The French Government has traditionally blocked attempts by foreign companies to acquire major French corporations in almost any industry. The Government owns more than 40 percent of Renault and is not likely to relinquish control any time soon. **********To be sure, Renault has made its own overtures abroad. **********It has held talks about acquiring a minority stake in the Nissan Motor Company of Japan, which is in dire financial straits and needs a new partner. But DaimlerChrysler is also in formal talks with Nissan. **********Georg Sturzer, an automobile analyst at Bayerische Hypo-und Vereinsbank in Munich, said that the easiest solution for the French companies would be to merge them. **********''But I am not at all sure that would be sensible, in part because they are both in the same market and wouldn't gain that many advantages,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/03/business/company-news-dyckerhoff-deal-sends-lone-star-stock-up-42.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-09-03", "snippet": "Lone Star Industries agrees to be acquired by Dyckerhoff AG, Germany, for nearly $1 billion in cash, plus purchase of warrants and assumption of debt (S)", "word_count": 130, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DYCKERHOFF DEAL SENDS LONE STAR STOCK UP 42%", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; DYCKERHOFF DEAL SENDS LONE STAR STOCK UP 42%", "body_text": " **********Lone Star Industries, a maker of cement and ready-mixed concrete, agreed yesterday to be acquired by Dyckerhoff A.G. of Germany for nearly $1 billion in cash, plus the purchase of warrants and the assumption of debt.

The sudden resignation of all 20 members of the European Union's executive body, following allegations of corruption and incompetence, is the best thing that has happened to the cause of European unity in many years. **********For the first time, democracy is breaking through at the European level in a way that ordinary citizens can easily understand. The clash is not over olive oil prices or value-added taxes, the kind of complex and tedious issues so often associated with Brussels. **********The all-too-human failings of which the commission was accused by a committee of independent experts \u2014 sloppy management, cronyism and irresponsibility in administering public funds \u2014 are only too depressingly familiar in national, not to mention local, politics. **********And the resignation of the commissioners, when threatened with a vote of censure in the European Parliament, looks similar to the fall of a European national government that has lost its parliamentary majority. **********If this is a crisis, it is only so in the sense that Magna Carta was a crisis for King John (whose French name, Jean Sans Terre, bears an uncanny resemblance to that of Jacques Santer, the disgraced president of the commission). **********By engineering the downfall of the commission, the European Parliament has begun to answer one of the most powerful criticisms long leveled against the European Union \u2014 that it is run by \"faceless\" bureaucrats in Brussels, unaccountable to public opinion. **********Even many of the EU's stoutest defenders have been uneasy over the so-called democratic deficit in its institutional machinery. Democratic scrutiny of the decision-making process has been conducted either at one remove by national parliaments or by the hitherto relatively powerless European Parliament. **********The European Parliament has now been emboldened to eliminate some of that deficit \u2014 partly as a result of the incremental increases in its powers in recent years, with more to come in the EU's Treaty of Amsterdam, soon to enter into force. But the Parliament has also been provoked by the arrogance of some commissioners and the astonishing political maladroitness of Mr. Santer. **********The commission is not the huge bureaucracy of popular fable \u2014 it employs fewer people than the Rotterdam City Council \u2014 and most of its officials are talented and hard-working people dedicated to the European cause. Not all the commissioners are guilty of misconduct, and some, one hopes, will be reappointed. But there is no doubt that over the years many commissioners have become self-important and lax about accountability. **********They have failed to understand that they are living in an age of ever-increasing transparency that is affecting every international institution from the International Monetary Fund to the International Olympic Committee. **********The ultimate responsibility, however, lies not with the commission but with the member states. It is they who have consistently sent mostly second-rate politicians to Brussels, partly to get rid of them and partly in the hope that they will be able to boss them around more easily. **********It is to the governments that the Parliament's message is in fact primarily addressed. Those who worry that the Parliament's increasing authority will disrupt the Union's delicate institutional balance should remember that it has for far too long been skewed in favor of the member states. **********Now the governments are going to find themselves obliged to appoint better people to the commission or have them removed again by the Parliament. The show of political force should equally attract a higher caliber of candidate to run for the Parliament \u2014 also much to be desired \u2014 and enliven the Europewide elections due to be held in June. **********There is still a long way to go. The Parliament has asserted control over the commission's management functions, not over EU policies. Magna Carta it is not.

Albright's limousine left her Georgetown house just after 7 this morning to take her to a State Department building where her colleagues are torn between their admiration for her principled stand against a dictator and their remorse over the human repercussions of the Kosovo conflict. **********As the devastation from the war has mounted, Ms. Albright has found herself ever more defensive. She has  watched as diplomacy is overrun by military issues and her department is overwhelmed by anxiety about Kosovo and the fate of American efforts. **********Ms. Albright, described by aides as the champion of the idea that if diplomacy failed, force was necessary against Slobodan Milosevic, is now viewed by her colleagues as the most likely target in Washington's current round of assessing blame for a war whose progress is not what was expected. **********''There is a certain degree of finger-pointing going on,'' one of her closest advisers, James R. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said at a daily briefing this week. ''I don't think it is particularly appropriate in a time of crisis, but that is the nature of democracy.'' **********Many foreign service officers are dismayed because, as one explained in loyal defense of his boss, Ms. Albright's views seemed correct when she expressed them in the President's councils, but the consequences of their execution were unforeseen. **********''I'm convinced this is a good thing,'' said a State Department official who said he was emotionally wrenched by the condition of the refugees and the atrocities in Kosovo. ''I think destroying Milosevic is a worthy objective. But whether we can accomplish this is up in the air.'' **********Because Ms. Albright often argued that a lesson of World War II was to counter force with force and that Mr. Milosevic only understood force, she has been seen as the chief hawk on Kosovo. **********But one of the critics of the Administration's Kosovo policy, Ivo Daalder, a member of the National Security Council in the first Clinton Administration, and now an analyst at the Brookings Institution, said that the rising clamor among Washington's chattering classes about ''Madeleine's war'' was off the mark. **********''After all, Richard Holbrooke always thought he could negotiate with the threat of force,'' Mr. Daalder said, referring to the Administration's Balkans envoy. ''And then Clinton, Shelton, Clark and Solana based their arguments on that too,'' he said, referring to Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Wesley K. Clark, the commander of NATO and Javier Solana, the secretary-general of NATO. **********''The problem is that they misread Milosevic,'' Mr. Daalder said. ''They said the only thing he understands is force. They were wrong. The only thing he understands is maintaining power.'' **********Adding to the dismay at the State Department on the misreading of Mr. Milosevic is the fact that since the bombing began, Ms. Albright's role in the Administration has diminished. **********In any war, the military machine takes over, officials said. Any Secretary of State, they said, would find herself with less influence at the White House than, for example, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. **********But that is not an analysis that is likely to be shared by some of her predecessors, like Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker 3d, both of whom exerted powerful influence on the wartime policies of the Presidents they served. But Ms. Albright's star has dimmed. **********Her brief is to call many of the NATO foreign ministers on the phone every day, urging them to hang tough and not to waver, aides say. She has concentrated on keeping Italy on board, where the bases are critical for the air operation but the public mood could waver. **********She has been relatively sidelined within the inner circle on the big decisions at the White House, State Department officials said. **********Underscoring this was the White House decision this week to move chief responsibility for the ethnic Albanian refugees from Ms. Albright's purview at the State Department to a new council at the White House. **********At the White House morning meetings with President Clinton, his national security adviser, Samuel Berger, Vice President Al Gore, the head of Central Intelligence, George Tenet and the Pentagon chiefs, Ms. Albright's task is to announce the latest on what she has gleaned from the NATO capitals. **********She also reports on the attitude of the Russian foreign Minister, Igor Ivanov, who has been uncooperative. **********Ms. Albright and Mr. Ivanov usually end their conversation with the line that the Washington-Moscow relationship is ''bigger'' than the Kosovo crisis, one of her aides said. **********But after hanging up, a Russian foreign ministry official noted, Mr. Ivanov often steps before the television cameras in Moscow and denounces NATO's actions in Kosovo in the strongest terms. **********Ms. Albright's closest counselors on the conflict gather at 8 A.M. on the seventh floor of the State Department. Around the table are usually  the Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbot, Undersecretary of State, Thomas Pickering, her new special envoy to the Balkans, Ambassador James F. Dobbins, and Mr. Rubin. **********Most mornings, Ms. Albright has then headed to the White House for the meeting with Mr. Clinton and his foreign policy team. **********The Secretary has talked almost daily in speeches and on television of how Mr. Milosevic's brutality has solidified the NATO alliance, how determination to forge ahead is necessary and most frequently, how the United States position is morally correct. **********''I would rather be here answering these questions than answering your questions of why we stood by and watched these kinds of massacres take place,'' she said on a television talk show after being pushed on the question of why Mr. Milosevic had not been declared a war criminal. **********In her public explanations of the Kosovo policy, Ms. Albright has said that the accord devised at Rambouillet in France, where she spent days persuading the ethnic Albanians to agree, remained the basis of a future political settlement in Kosovo. **********But that agreement appears to be fading. **********This week, the French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, publicly questioned whether parts of the agreement were still viable. **********And the Administration, including Ms. Albright, have changed some of the key language, referring to an ''international security force'' instead of a NATO-led force. The label a ''NATO-led force'' is anathema to Mr. Milosevic, and a security force may be more to his liking, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/04/business/airlines-offer-discounts-through-web-sites.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-08-04", "snippet": "United States airlines are offering discounts of up to 10 percent to lure people to book tickets on airline Web sites, cost-cutting effort that is hurting travel agents (S)", "word_count": 183, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airlines Offer Discounts Through Web Sites", "print_headline": "Airlines Offer Discounts Through Web Sites", "body_text": " **********United States airlines are tempting bargain-hunters with discounts of as much as 10 percent to book tickets on the airlines' Web sites, a cost-cutting effort that travel agents contend is weeding them out of the process. **********Delta Air Lines , the No. 3 carrier, initiated the latest promotion, offering discounts to all United States destinations for tickets booked on Delta's Web site this week.

Under the deal, workers, who are expected to ratify the agreement later this month, would receive annual raises of 3 percent on top of adjustments for inflation, plus a signing bonus of $1,350. **********To clinch the deal, Ford was forced to agree that the 23,500 workers at its Visteon Automotive Systems unit would remain Ford employees -- with pensions and even paychecks from Ford -- even after the company was spun off, the people said. **********''It is like the janitors working in a commercial building -- they work for you but are paid by a different company,'' one of those briefed on the terms of the labor agreement said. **********Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the quirky compromise was necessary to prevent Ford's historically strong labor relations from disintegrating into strife that could cause costly strikes. ''Is it a perfect solution?'' he said. ''No, but it is probably the best solution they could've come up with. Effectively, Visteon will be renting employees from Ford.'' **********Ford has been eager to follow in the footsteps of the General Motors Corporation, which spun off its Delphi Automotive Systems unit in May. Ford had explored selling Visteon to Delphi or to another parts maker, the Lear Corporation, but is leaning toward spinning it off. **********Under the terms of the labor accord, a Visteon spinoff would create a giant manufacturing company -- Visteon has about $17.8 billion in revenue and more than two dozen factories in the United States alone -- with almost no blue-collar employees. **********While details remained unavailable today, and neither the union nor Ford would discuss them, those briefed on the contract terms said that new workers hired for Visteon factories would most likely be on Visteon's payroll, although they would have the same pay and benefits of current Ford workers. It is unclear whether Visteon would simply reimburse Ford for its payroll costs, or whether Ford might win price breaks on Visteon auto parts purchases that would offset the labor costs, or whether there might be some other arrangement. **********Ford wants to spin off its in-house supplier, in part because it thinks that Visteon could win more work from rival auto makers as an independent company. **********The terms of the agreement have left both sides frustrated. Ford executives are grumbling because they expected the union to allow them to spin off Visteon under the same terms that G.M. got after spinning off Delphi without consulting the union. **********Under a contract reached on Sept. 28, the 48,000 former G.M. workers who now receive paychecks from Delphi are paid the same rates and receive the same benefits and pensions as G.M. workers. They are allowed to switch back to G.M. jobs when such jobs become available, and are promised layoff pay and other benefits from G.M. in the event that Delphi fails or runs into financial trouble before 2007. **********But Ford could not get the same deal. The union found unexpectedly strong, emotional opposition to a Visteon spinoff from rank-and-file members and from some members of its bargaining team. Talks with Ford took longer than expected, and were clearly more difficult than either side had bargained on. Last week, the negotiations became so heated that they dissolved into shouting matches on several occasions, according to one person briefed on the negotiations. **********While local union officials had not been briefed today on the details of the agreement, some said they had heard that the deal would allow Ford to spin off Visteon, with workers remaining Ford employees. **********''That is still not acceptable to me,'' said Roger Caldwell, president of U.A.W. Local 845 in Plymouth, Mich., whose workers build heaters and radiators for the Visteon unit. **********Because the contract includes big raises, and because less than one-quarter of Ford's unionized employees work at Visteon, the union's rank-and-file is expected to approve the contract when it comes to a vote later this month. **********The agreement effectively completes the U.A.W's drive this autumn to negotiate fresh labor contracts for the nation's 400,000 unionized auto workers. On Sept. 16, the U.A.W. reached a deal with DaimlerChrysler A.G. DaimlerChrysler and G.M. workers won the same big raises as Ford's workers. **********The Canadian Auto Workers union has also been negotiating new contracts this fall.

Wasik (Henry Holt, $14.95). It is full of tips on rescuing yourself from spendthrift ways and on investing more intelligently. Cash in life insurance policies if you have no dependents, the book advises, and get rid of one of your cars or buy a used car instead of a new one. **********Then take the money you save and invest it, Mr. Wasik says. He describes various investment options clearly, explaining the risks and rewards of each. A chart shows that if you could save just $100 a month at an 8 percent rate of return, compounded monthly, you would have $18,417 in 10 years (or $48,329 in 18 years). Now if you could just save  $500 a month . . . . **********''Retire and Thrive,'' by Robert K. Otterbourg (Kiplinger Books, second edition, $22.50), addresses some nonfinancial issues of retirement, like what to do with yourself when you quit working. The book is most illuminating in its dozens of short profiles of people who have happy and fulfilling retirements through volunteer work, teaching and the like. **********FUTURE VIEW -- ''Age Power: How the 21st Century Will Be Ruled by the New Old,'' by Ken Dychtwald (Penguin Putnam, $24.95), will arrive on the shelves later this month. It  sees the aging of the population as a series of train wrecks that can be prevented only through measures like postponing the age at which people can collect Social Security -- and means-testing for recipients. Dr. Dychtwald, a psychologist and gerontologist, uses statistics for his forecasts that may underestimate economic growth. **********A better look at the same subject is last year's ''America the Wise: The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of Nations,'' by Theodore Roszak (Houghton Mifflin, $25).

Club Monaco has annual sales of about $90 million. **********Mr. Lauren said he believed the chain, which offers fashion basics with a European flair at prices well below name designer wear, would experience explosive expansion in the next decade. ''It has a real sense of style at a good price,'' he said. ''I see it as a very large company, like Banana Republic or even Gap.'' **********Polo Ralph Lauren will pay $13 (Canadian) a share, or $8.62 (United States), for approximately 6.5 million shares in Club Monaco common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis. That price represents an 18 percent premium of Club Monaco's closing price of $11 (Canadian) on Friday. Club Monaco shares closed yesterday at $12.65. Polo Ralph Lauren will also assume $25 million to $28 million (United States) in debt. **********Club Monaco's stock has been soaring since its low of $3.25 (Canadian) on Oct. 30. But it is still below its all-time high of $16.50 in November 1997. The stock went public in March of that year. **********Many retail analysts see the acquisition as a way to capture customers not normally attracted to the clean all-American look of the Ralph Lauren line, without alienating his loyal base of supporters. Jennifer Black, executive vice president of Black & Company, said, ''He is trying to create a venue for that hip customer age 15 to 25, so that it doesn't send mixed messages'' to his customers with more classical tastes. **********Still, it is highly unusual for a design house to purchase a retail chain devoted to selling clothes that are not its own, and the news seemed to make Wall Street queasy. Shares of Polo Ralph Lauren declined 43.75 cents, to $19.50 yesterday. ''The stock is down because people view this as an admission that they have to look for other growth vehicles'' beyond their brand, said Faye Landes, a retail analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners. **********Club Monaco will be managed as a stand-alone subsidiary, the companies said. That means Polo Ralph Lauren will not design Club Monaco merchandise or try to improve the bottom line by combining back-room operations like distribution or purchasing, although Mr. Lauren did say executives at his company felt Club Monaco would benefit from their experience in sourcing overseas and in brand building. **********Michael J. Newman, vice chairman and chief operating officer, said, ''This is not about cost savings or synergies; this is primarily about growth.'' **********Joseph Mimram, the founder and chief executive of Club Monaco, has signed a five-year contract to remain with the company. The deal was approved by the boards of both companies, but is still subject to Canadian regulatory review. **********The merger also nearly doubles the number of stores in the Polo Ralph Lauren stable. The company currently manages some 30 stores. It also operates 100 outlet stores. Club Monaco has 59 stand-alone stores in Canada and 13 in the United States. **********Polo Ralph Lauren's aggressive expansion of retail operations comes at a time when the company has been struggling to repair operations in its own stores.

After more than a decade of reform that has modernized and transformed the economies of the region, Latin America is gripped by a downturn that is still spreading and that portends at least a year of slow growth and recession. Led by Brazil, the overall regional economy could decline by 1.5 percent to as much as 3 percent. Yet, the very extent of reform means that the region is in much better shape **********economically and politically \u2014 to weather the storm and get back on a growth track than would have been the case in the past. **********The trigger for the downturn was the financial contagion that began in Asia, which led investors to dramatically recalibrate risk and pull back their investment. This turned Brazil's chronic fiscal problem into a painful crisis that threatens the rest of the Continent. **********Latin America's prospects are being made worse by the collapse in the price of commodities \u2014 beginning with oil and copper \u2014 that remain a leading source of export earnings for many countries. This has hit Venezuela particularly hard. The region is also now experiencing a growing credit crunch. International credit lines have either been greatly restricted or eliminated altogether. In response, local banks have slashed their domestic lending, which is hitting businesses across the region hard. **********Once again, both business and government are asking what has gone wrong. After all, in response to the debt crisis that turned the 1980s into Latin America's \"lost decade,\" a new consensus took hold. Government domination of economies had gone much too far, and a new frontier needed to be drawn between the overweening state and the private sector. This amounted to a decisive break with tradition. State ownership of large sectors of the economy, combined with protectionism, had been the typical formula. But the debt crisis demonstrated the bankruptcy of that approach. Countries simply could no longer foot the huge bill. **********A massive process of second thought led to a sharp change of direction \u2014 toward fiscal discipline, privatization, deregulation, and an opening up toward trade and investment. **********All this added up to a far-reaching shift in thinking. \"I would never have imagined this much change,\" said Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank. \"For 40 years following the Great Depression and the second world war, we looked to government to take on the task of reviving our economies. We asked the state to deliver the goods. We asked too much of government, for too long. We had to make a choice. Now, we have taken the sharp turn back to the market economy.\" **********The change was driven not just by intellectual conviction, but also by stark necessity. When Carlos Saul Menem came in as president of Argentina, inflation was running at 20,000 percent a year, the economy was contracting, and food riots were taking place in the street. **********Stabilization has brought efficiency and dynamism to Latin American business, as well as a great inflow of foreign investment \u2014 though a flow that few figured could change direction so rapidly and with such fury. **********Still, the region was not prepared for the lacerating effects of the current global contagion. At the center is Brazil, which appeared poised to live up to its great potential. But Brazil's great vulnerability was \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 its fiscal deficit, which has led to the huge public sector debt. The contagion turned a bright searchlight on the debt, which amounts to close to 50 percent of GDP. And both Brazilians and international investors and lenders, fearful of devaluation, started heading for the door. **********The consequences of Brazil's fiscal deficit are economic. But the reasons for Brazil's inability to deal with it are political: the weakness of the party system, the weakness of the presidency versus the congress, the weakness of the federal government versus the states. The result is an inadequate capacity to restrain spending in the face of political stalemate. The social security system provides a particularly dramatic case study. The pension pay-out in 1999 is projected to be $42 billion, while contributions will amount to only $7 billion. **********With interest rates at 45 percent, Brazil is certainly in for a tough time. \"There are two clear paths ahead for Brazil,\" observed Miguel Bachrach, a partner in Pareto Latin American Partners and a former economist at both the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. \"One is to slide back into entrenched high inflation, which will result in lower growth, greater inequity, and political instability.\" **********\"The other path,\" he said, \"is to take the bitter pill and fix the structural problems in public finances \u2014 from the social security system to the oversized state bureaucracies. Two or three years from now, you would see an economy growing strongly on a sustainable basis.\" **********The public finances in Mexico, the other major economy in the region, are in much better shape despite the fall in the price of oil. Although oil was providing 40 percent of government revenues before the price collapsed, Mexico has done a remarkable job of diversifying its exports away from oil, on which it had been so dependent at the time of the 1980s debt crisis. Domestic consumption has been one spur to growth. But Mexico is also getting a big boost from geography. **********\"Poor Mexico,\" President Porfirio Diaz is supposed to have said a century ago. \"So far from God, and so close to the United States.\" **********What was a curse is now a blessing, for Mexico is also benefiting from NAFTA and from its integration with the U.S. economic machine. Mexico is expected to register lower but still positive growth in 1999, and it could do even better if the United States continues its stellar performance. As the Mexican economist Fausto Alzati summed it up, \"We pray for Alan Greenspan every day.\" **********Those prayers seem to be spreading, as some people's second thoughts turn to \"dollarization\" as the antidote to contagion. Some countries, such as Peru and Argentina, are already part-way there. But Mr. Menem is now campaigning for Argentina to go beyond its currency board and give up its own currency altogether and simply use the dollar for everything. That would make the U.S. Federal Reserve the de facto central bank for Argentina and severely restrict Argentina's own ability to manage its way through the business cycle. **********The other major response to contagion is to search for some way to modulate panicky and highly destabilizing waves of capital outflow, without deterring investors, who do want the option of taking their money out when they want to. **********The downturn adds to the urgency for the critical issues of equity and social safety nets. Latin America still faces great challenges in assuring that the broad population shares in the benefits from the move toward the market and that sufficient investments are made in health and human capital. Yet, what is remarkable in this renewed process of second thoughts is that hardly anyone is talking about backing away from market reform itself. That demonstrates how much progress has been made since Latin America pulled itself out of the lost decade. **********DANIEL YERGIN is co-author with Joseph Stanislaw of \"The Commanding Heights: the Battle Between Government and Marketplace.\" He is chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/02/business/company-news-lucent-gets-ccom-information-for-undisclosed-terms.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-07-02", "snippet": "Lucent Technologies Inc acquires closely held CCOM Information Systems for undisclosed price (S)", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LUCENT GETS CCOM INFORMATION FOR UNDISCLOSED TERMS", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; LUCENT GETS CCOM INFORMATION FOR UNDISCLOSED TERMS", "body_text": " **********Lucent Technologies Inc. said yesterday that it had bought the closely held CCOM Information Systems, giving it software that makes it easier to move data on computer networks.

Back-to-back zeroes (or outright declines) have shown up just twice in the post-World War II era: once in the spring of 1986, amid a stunning collapse in world oil prices, and the other time in the winter of 1962, long before Americans learned to regard inflation as one of life's fixtures, like death and taxes. **********''In some sense, we're back to the 50's,'' said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. **********The underlying trend in prices is still up slightly. Prices are 2 percent higher today than they were a year ago. But that is actually a slower inflation pace than earlier. **********Some important items, notably oil, have become more costly. After falling for four consecutive years, energy prices jumped more than 24 percent in the first six months of 1999. **********Most important, the ''core'' inflation rate -- which excludes the volatile food and energy prices -- has risen more slowly in the first half of this year than it did in 1998, at an annual rate of 1.6 percent versus 2.4 percent. The core rate edged up just a tenth of a percent last month. **********''It's hard to search back and find a time when things were this good,'' said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the Labor Department who supervises the Government's monthly survey of retail prices. **********Yesterday's inflation news cheered stock and bond investors, who have lately been worried that the Federal Reserve was about to turn down the party music -- as it did in 1994 and 1995 when it engineered an increase of three percentage points in short-term interest rates to take the edge off the country's exuberance. Although the Fed did nudge a key rate up a bit last month, investors are now more optimistic that the central bank will leave it at that. **********Separately, the Government reported yesterday that jobless claims increased 11,000, to 310,000, for the week that ended on July 10. That was the highest number in a month, but still a level indicating a healthy job market. **********The good news on inflation has inspired a fascinating conundrum: not so much why inflation drifted down in the 1990's as why it has not crept up recently as unemployment has remained at its lowest level in decades. **********''Before the last six months, prices were behaving the way that the conventional wisdom said they should,'' said Alan S. Blinder, an economist at Princeton University who was vice chairman of the Fed in the mid-1990's. ''But now we really have some explaining to do.'' **********To see why, consider a bit of history. In the early 1980's, inflation fell to 4 percent from 10 percent the old-fashioned way, squeezed out of the economy by tight money and a deep recession engineered by the Fed, whose chairman then was Paul A. Volcker. By the end of the 1980's boom, it had moved back up to a 6 percent rate. That is when Alan Greenspan, who became Fed chairman in 1987, administered a smaller dose of castor oil, pushing rates higher and helping send the economy into a brief, relatively shallow recession that ended in early 1991. Inflation fell to 3 percent. Tighter money in 1994 and 1995 knocked another point off the rate. **********No mystery there. **********At that point, most experts expected inflation to pick up as unemployment kept dropping. But then came a shower of good luck. The dollar strengthened, making imports cheaper. Energy prices fell. The relentless rise in health care costs was interrupted as many employers shifted to health maintenance organizations. Computer prices, which had been dropping 10 to 15 percent a year, suddenly began declining at twice that rate. **********At the same time, the Government made changes in the way it measures consumer prices. In particular, it began to do a much better job of picking up improvements in product quality. That alone knocked more than half a percentage point off the official inflation rate. **********In other words, still no mystery. **********Today, however, most of the factors that held inflation down -- falling energy prices, for example -- are no longer in force. Yet inflation continues to shrink. Most remarkably, pay increases -- typically the most important ingredient in any lasting upturn in inflation -- have moderated in recent months in the midst of the tightest labor market in memory. **********One explanation for the apparent absence of inflation is a surprising burst of productivity growth at a point in the business cycle when bottlenecks typically start to appear and companies get sloppy. **********Nobody knows for sure if the situation will last. Allan Meltzer, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, is not alone in arguing that inflation will turn up as soon as the rest of the world's economies are back on track. **********But there is another possibility -- perhaps Americans have finally stopped believing that inflation is inevitable. In the 1970's, Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate, made the radical suggestion that if the Fed could quell expectations of inflation by announcing a credible game plan, inflation might disappear painlessly, without high unemployment. His conservative theory did not fare well in the initially painful unwinding of inflation. **********But now it looks as if, at long last, Mr. Greenspan's credibility and America's trust in him may be turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/04/business/international-briefs-renault-to-lay-off-argentine-workers.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-02-04", "snippet": "Renault SA will lay off 1,200 workers from its Argentine plant as sputtering economy in neighboring Brazil forces company to slash output by more than one-fourth; workers will be suspended for at least four months (S)", "word_count": 119, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Renault to Lay Off Argentine Workers", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; Renault to Lay Off Argentine Workers", "body_text": " **********Renault S.A., France's second-biggest car maker, will lay off 1,200 workers from its Argentine plant as a sputtering economy in neighboring Brazil forces the company to slash output by more than one-fourth. **********Renault said the workers would be suspended for at least four months as the car maker reduces its plant's shifts from two to one, said Juan Manuel Lardizabal, Renault's director of industrial relations.

Clark, said at the alliance headquarters that the the strikes had already caused ''substantial damage'' to the armed forces involved in the crackdown against ethnic Albanians, who made up 90 percent of Kosovo's population. NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, said that while NATO's raids have been hampered, they were having a cumulative impact on the forces of the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic. **********''The ring is closing around the Yugoslav armed forces,'' he said. **********A senior NATO diplomat said that after nine days of bombardments there were indications that the Yugoslavs were having problems receiving ammunition and fuel, though refugees continued to leave their villages and head for Kosovo's borders with Macedonia and Albania. American and NATO forces have struck several depots where supplies are stockpiled, including another fuel depot in Kosovo today, said the Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon. **********As he emerged from a briefing on Capitol Hill, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner, said that in the last 48 hours there had been ''positive signs that this air campaign is causing problems for Milosevic's deployed troops conducting ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. **********''The tanks and other military vehicles are running short on fuel,'' the Virginia Republican said. ''Food and ammunition is running short. And we're having, I think, a considerable success rate in destroying their supply depots.'' **********General Clark, the NATO commander, said the air war now included ''a slightly larger array of targets,'' including some civilian structures that have nominal military uses. He dismissed Serbian charges that NATO was targeting civilians, but said NATO's forces would pound any target thought to aid Yugoslavia's military. **********''Insofar as it's drawing reinforcements and supplies and extra materiel and so forth from throughout Yugoslavia,'' he said, ''the routes throughout Yugoslavia are legitimate targets. And when we deem it appropriate, then they will be struck.'' **********The bridge over the Danube, Europe's longest waterway, was struck before dawn in Novi Sad, far from the Serbian crackdown in Kosovo. The steel suspension span lies near the city's second bridge. Both cross the river near the city's center. A squadron of American F-15 fighter jets left the first bridge a crumpled mass in the river. **********It was not clear tonight why NATO forces did not attack the other bridge or major transit points in other parts of Yugoslavia, though officials said much of the decision making on striking targets swung with the fickle Balkan weather. They did not rule out that the other span, which is older, could be struck. **********Senior NATO and American officials said the expansion of targets would accelerate as the weather cleared, which forecasters predict will happen by the weekend. They said other bridges would be targets. **********Although NATO officials have repeatedly said they have the forces they need to wage the air war against Yugoslavia, the United States and other NATO powers, including Britain and France, have increased the number of aircraft in the region. Earlier this week the United States dispatched five B-1 bombers. **********Today, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen ordered 13 more F-117 stealth fighters to Italy. They will join 11 of the initial deployment of 12 that have been taking part in the raids. The 12th F-117 crashed in Serbia on Saturday. **********Two more Navy warships -- the Ross, a destroyer, and the Vella Gulf, a cruiser -- entered the Mediterranean today loaded with cruise missiles and are expected to join the assault soon. The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is expected to arrive by the weekend, bringing with it some 75 aircraft, 50 of them combat jets. **********The question remained: would they arrive soon enough? A senior Pentagon official said Mr. Milosevic's forces, although pummeled, appeared to be wrapping up a campaign to carve out a Serbian enclave in Kosovo, having cornered the last remnants of ethnic Albanian rebels known as the Kosovo Liberation Army, or K.L.A. **********''He's basically got every objective he wanted,'' the official said, citing intelligence reports from Kosovo. ''He's destroyed the K.L.A. and chased everyone else out.'' **********American warplanes have flown 60 to 70 percent of the strikes, largely because the United States has more aircraft suited to foul weather and able to evade radar, a Pentagon official said. The allies have flown at least half the total missions, combat and otherwise. **********NATO has repeatedly refused to quantify how many missions have been flown in the air war, break them down by country or distinguish between bombing runs and support activities, like refueling. **********Today's raids were overshadowed by the seizure of the Americans, something that the White House and the Pentagon, recalling the capture of American troops in Somalia in 1993, had deeply feared. **********Mr. Cohen, in Norfolk, Va., initially described the three soldiers as ''illegal detainees'' rather than prisoners of war, but by the end of the day, the Pentagon described them as P.O.W.'s and demanded that they not be brought before a military court in Kosovo, as the Yugoslav authorities threatened. **********Mr. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said tonight that depending on the circumstances of their capture -- namely whether they were inside Macedonia or had strayed into Serbia -- the three ''may be'' entitled to immediate release. **********He said that, pending an investigation and, ideally, the direct questioning of the three, ''our belief'' is that they did not violate the Yugoslav border. ''The soldiers should be released immediately,'' he said at another point, contending that ''at a minimum'' they were entitled to the protections of the Geneva Convention, which calls for the humane treatment of the enemy. **********Given the border tensions of the situation, some critics questioned whether the three soldiers observed regulations and should have been better protected by operating within some larger formation better able to defend itself. **********''I'm astounded,'' said a retired senior Army officer familiar with the Balkans. ''In Bosnia, we figured one of our vulnerabilities was a hostage snatch or an ambush. We operated in a platoon formation -- that's normally four vehicles. When tensions went up, one of those had to have an automatic weapon. The idea of patrolling is excellent, but, good God, it was a mistake they got separated. You don't go poking around.'' **********Senator Warner said their capture raised questions. He said the United States had been on ''full notice'' that the Serbs ''would like to seize'' a NATO serviceman. ''And that's precisely what happened,'' he said. **********Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said a possibility was that the Americans inadvertently crossed the border while fleeing a ambush by Serbs. **********Scores of troops and several helicopters, Mr. Bacon said, were dispatched in a ''massive'' search in poor weather, without result. The Americans' armored vehicle -- a Humvee -- remains missing. **********Mr. Bacon said three Humvees had been on patrol, then split up ''to do some individual training exercises'' that he did not otherwise describe. **********General Clark said he would hold the Yugoslav authorities responsible for the soldiers' well being. ''We don't like it,'' he said. ''We don't like the way they're treated. And we have a long memory about these kinds of things.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/30/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-the-refugees-a-minefield-is-crossed-but-at-what-sad-cost.html": {"writer_name": "Barry Bearak", "pub_date": "1999-04-30", "snippet": "Group of Kosovo Albanians make perilous flight across minefield to Macedonia; five refugees die when mine explodes; photos (M)", "word_count": 1126, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Minefield Is Crossed, But at What Sad Cost", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE REFUGEES; A Minefield Is Crossed, But at What Sad Cost", "body_text": " **********When they came upon the minefield in the rugged mountains near the border, the 64 Kosovo Albanian refugees were warned to stay in single file and not stray from the narrow path or stumble on a branch or rock in the predawn gloom. **********Twenty people trod through the  mud without a problem, and that is perhaps what made the tired old farmer, Osman Jezerci, less wary. **********''Osman, don't go so far over there,'' someone called out to him. **********Mr. Jezerci looked over his shoulder, possibly to see who was speaking. And that is when he drifted a few more feet to the left, those near him said. The explosion lifted his body off his legs. The man beside him died, too. So did a young woman, Selvete Kukaj. **********Within an hour of the blast on Wednesday, two others died from their wounds. These two -- a 12-year-old girl named Zyjnete Avdiu and an 18-year-old woman, Miradije Kukaj,  -- were buried here today in a solemn ceremony attended by a large crowd of people who did not know them. **********This has become the habit in Blace, a Macedonian border village of 100 homes. In the last five weeks, since NATO began bombing and throngs of Kosovo Albanians started fleeing, people from here have laid 12 strangers to rest in their cemetery. **********Liman Jashari, the village hohxa, or holy man, said the ritual Muslim prayers in Arabic and then switched to Albanian to soothe the mourners at the funeral. **********''Before us, we see two bodies,'' he said. ''It is fate that they died close to our homes before proceeding to heaven. We must remember that everything that comes before us is the will of God.'' **********He surely believed this, though it did not stop him from weeping as the bodies were taken from coffins and laid into the earth. The two young women wore white sheets as they were lowered into the ground. Their heads were placed on pillows of sod. **********Each day, Macedonia awakens to a new tale of refugee misery as if this part of the world were keen to outdo itself with affliction. The day before, a 10-year-old boy, near death with a bullet wound and two open leg fractures, had been brought across the border in a wheelbarrow. Then came the horror of a minefield on a moonlit night. **********''Fear made us leave our homes, fear of the Serbs,'' said Ibrahim Avdiu, 39, Zyjnete's father. ''My whole life has been turned upside down with fear.'' **********As with most stories told by the ethnic Albanian refugees, Mr. Avdiu's starts with being ordered by Serbs to leave Kosovo. His family's home was in Kacenik, a small city only 10 miles from Macedonia. Fighting has been fierce there between Serbian forces and the rebels of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army. Some put the death toll at more than 100 in the last month. **********Mr. Avdiu, a day laborer, took his wife and four children to the nearby village of Llanishte. From there, they could see some goings-on through binoculars. Bulldozers, he said, were pushing bodies into mass graves. He and hundreds of others plotted their escapes. **********People set out for the border in various groups. The journey, while short, was hard. The welcome cover of darkness was accompanied by the unwelcome distress of frost. Gullies had to be crossed, rocks had to be climbed. Very early on Wednesday, Mr. Avdiu led a horse through the heavily wooded terrain. Clutching the saddle was his invalid mother-in-law. **********The group had accepted guidance from six members of the Kosovo Liberation Army. These were the men who cautioned them about the minefield and pointed the way up the narrow path. **********When the mine exploded, the blast shook the ground and turned dirt and stones into projectiles. People were wailing, unsure whether to run or stand still. They wiped their faces with their hands and smelled their fingers, trying to determine if the wetness was sweat or blood. **********Arsim Kukaj, 20, was the only son in a family with five daughters. Two of his sisters had been walking at his side, trying to protect the sole male heir by standing in the sight line of any snipers the family might encounter. **********''My sisters were afraid I would be shot, but instead of getting in the way of a bullet they died because of the shrapnel,'' he said, bereft, unable to say much more. **********Ibrahim Avdiu's wife and sister were injured. As he tended to them, he said, he could hear 12-year-old Zyjnete, his oldest child, crying out, ''Daddy, I'm dying.'' **********Mr. Avdiu's younger brother, Izet Asutiqi, scooped the girl up and draped her over his back. He began running. ''I did not know where I was going, but I just started down a road and hoped it would lead to somewhere,'' he said. **********He carried her for two hours, though she was dead long before that, he said. His shoulders and back ached from the weight. Finally, he put her on the ground and looked for landmarks to remember. He continued down the road. **********In Blace, Mr. Asutiqi staggered into a small grocery. He drew a map on the ground with a stick. Villagers then risked Macedonian border guards and Serbian troops to search for the body across the border. They carried both dead girls up and down the trails in shifts. They did not chance more time to locate the other dead. **********This morning, the hoxha did the ritual cleaning of the bodies. The girls' bloody clothes were replaced by the white sheets. The village men prayed in the mosque and then passed the coffins hand to hand down a road and then up a hill to the cemetery. Three mules grazed among the tombstones as the mourners went past in the early afternoon. **********Once in the ground, the bodies were covered with wood planks and then dirt. With six men at work with spades, it took less than two minutes to fill the graves. **********Except for the dead, only men attended the ceremony, as is the custom. But as the funeral ended, one of Miradije Kukah's older sisters wandered in a daze toward the mound. She collapsed and kissed the dirt, laying her cheek against the grave as if listening for a pulse. When men lifted her up, she searched about for flowers, but found only a single violet blossom. It was wilted and she threw it down in despair and bawled. **********''Don't cry,'' people said, attempting comfort. ''Crying will not awaken your sister.'' **********As the villagers of Blace returned to their homes, several pointed to  smoke not too far off in the mountains. The Serbs had set fire to the village of Gorance, the hoxha said, just as they had set a place called Rozhance ablaze the day before. **********More refugees would soon be coming through the mountains."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/15/world/world-briefing.html": {"writer_name": "Terence Neilan", "pub_date": "1999-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 931, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "World Briefing", "print_headline": "World Briefing", "body_text": " **********EUROPE **********NORTHERN IRELAND: URGENT PEACE TALKS -- Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland scheduled urgent talks in London today after two days of negotiations in Belfast failed to resolve the impasse over guerrilla disarmament that is blocking formation of a new government in Northern Ireland.

For the German Government, back in Berlin 54 years after the collapse of Hitler's Reich, Mr. Barak's presence is welcome evidence of the democratic credentials of the new ''Berlin Republic.'' For the Israeli Government, it is a demonstration of good will to a country that has become an important ally. **********Noting that he was born in 1942, the same year that ''not far from here, the Final Solution was decided'' by the Nazis, Mr. Barak said his visit to Berlin stirred ''deep emotions.'' The plan for the annihilation of EuropeanJews was put into force on Jan. 20, 1942, at a meeting in Wannsee in what are now the southwestern suburbs of Berlin. **********But the Prime Minister, on his first trip to Europe since taking office in July, added that his presence was evidence of the close ties now linking ''the new, democratic Germany and the state of Israel that emerged from the ashes of the Holocaust.'' **********Since the move to Berlin, the German Government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder has been trying to strike a balance between a new assertiveness -- the Chancellor described Germany this month as ''a great power in Europe'' -- and expressions of commitment to the values of the postwar Bonn Republic. **********This tone was evident again today. Mr. Schroder said that times had changed and the ''generation of the perpetrators'' was no longer in power. But he added that the Holocaust was an event that ''every generation has the duty to remember.'' **********The two leaders spoke in the former Council of State of the East German leader Erich Honecker, which has become the temporary Chancellery of Mr. Schroder pending the completion of a new building. **********They stood beneath stained-glass images of worker-heroes bearing a message that Communist doctrine would bring well-being to all mankind. This bizarre setting was further evidence -- if any was needed -- of Berlin's turbulent history. As a result of this past, Mr. Barak was greeted without any elaborate ceremony: no German or Israeli flags fluttered in the Tiergarten. **********Before coming, the Israeli leader had offered the endorsement for the Government's move that Mr. Schroder has clearly sought. In an interview published in this week's edition of Der Spiegel, Mr. Barak said: ''I have no reservations about the move to Berlin. Despite the evil that emanated from there, we respect the decision of the German people that Berlin once again become its capital.'' **********Mr. Barak has chosen to make memory a central theme of his two-day stay, declining a meeting with German business leaders in favor of a visit Wednesday to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, just north of Berlin, where over 200,000 prisoners were held between 1939 and 1945. About half of them were killed or worked to death. **********A few survivors of the camp and their grandchildren arrived here with Mr. Barak today. One, Eli Carmel, 82, said, ''This means the circle is closing, the circle of having been a homeless, stateless Jew incarcerated, and to come back with the Prime Minister of our Jewish state.'' **********Jews formed a relatively small proportion of those held in Sachsenhausen. The prisoners included Communists, Social Democrats, members of labor unions and others viewed as enemies of the Reich. **********In an interview published today in Bild Zeitung, Mr. Barak said the visit to the camp was a ''moral necessity.'' Certainly, it will focus attention on strained talks on compensation from German corporations for slave laborers and others put to work by the Nazis. **********Negotiations have stalled over money, with tens of billions of dollars separating the companies' offer and the demands of lawyers representing the forced laborers.

Mr. Gamang was the handpicked choice of the Congress Party president, Sonia Gandhi. The party replaced him with another tribal leader, Hemananda Biswal.   Celia W.

Mr. Suharto, 78, has been accused of amassing a multibillion-dollar fortune while in office, which he has denied.

Six of Mr. Soong's top aides were thrown out with him. Mr. Soong's expulsion neither harmed his lead over Mr. Lien in opinion polls nor scared many politicians who had allied themselves with the front-runner, prompting a second round of expulsions.

The goods, delivered by the United Nations World Food Program, are intended for distribution in the Panjshir Valley, where tens of thousands of displaced people are sheltering with rebels opposed to the Taliban.

About two dozen members of Congress decreed the way most issues were decided, and an effective lobbyist had to cultivate a personal relationship with at least one of them to have any real influence. **********But now lobbying has turned into a well-ordered global business, with the influence game taking on a decidedly corporate look. **********Congress and the rest of the government have changed in myriad ways in a quarter-century, and the transformation has only accelerated with the more recent explosion of information and technology. The capital's government affairs and public relations businesses are changing, too, suddenly engaging in a flurry of consolidations and mergers. **********A handful of huge firms are being born, offering clients a full buffet of services under one roof -- everything from public relations, traditional lobbying, research, polling, and direct-mail canvassing to specialists who deal in drumming up ''grass roots'' support for issues. **********The latest and most significant acquisition came this month, when Shandwick USA bought the Cassidy Companies, one of Washington's largest and most successful public affairs groups. The acquisition, which was valued at $70 million to $80 million, instantly gave Shandwick a big presence in Washington, where it was virtually unknown only a few years ago. **********This and the other giant firms being created have a foothold not just in Washington, but in London, Brussels and elsewhere, reflecting the new global character of regulation and legislation, especially in the area of trade. **********''What's going on is akin to an arms race, with everyone trying to beef up their arsenals,'' said Anthony T. Podesta, who is chairman of podesta.com, a medium-sized lobbying firm that specializes in high-technology clients and is being eagerly courted by some larger firms. ''The trend toward consolidation is a very strong one, as public relations and advertising have come to realize the benefits of adding a government relations component.'' **********Some acquisitions have already been made and others are in the works in what is known here as K Street, a designation that connotes the whole industry of public affairs much the way ''Wall Street'' is shorthand for the financial trade. **********Shandwick, strictly a public relations company, is owned by the Interpublic Group, a huge New York-based advertising company. Interpublic and two other global advertising companies, the WPP Group and the Omnicom Group, now constitute the three giants hoping to offer one-stop shopping in Washington for corporations and interest groups wanting coordinated lobbying and public relations campaigns. Omnicom and WPP have been steadily making acquisitions and are said to seek more. **********Cassidy's founder, Gerald S. J. Cassidy, a Washington lobbyist for more than 20 years, has seen changes both sudden and gradual. In the early days, the barons of lobbying were individuals like Thomas Corcoran, a New Deal-era adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Clark M. Clifford, who began as an aide to Harry S. Truman and went on to serve as Defense Secretary in the Johnson administration. **********''The whole system revolved around 25 people who had the power to get things done,'' Mr. Cassidy said in an interview in his office -- not on K Street but three blocks south on 13th Street, near the White House. ''You had to know those people and establish your credibility.'' **********But in 1974, in the wake of Watergate, the caste-ridden seniority system was scrapped in response to the demands of the flood of newly elected reformers in Congress. **********''There was suddenly a diffusion of power,'' Mr. Cassidy said. ''The power moved away from the chairmen. At the same time, more issues were being decided in Washington, and that was accompanied by an explosion of staff here.'' **********With the election in recent years of increasing numbers of legislators who vowed fierce resistance to the Washington culture, public affairs professionals learned that they could influence lawmakers more effectively by whipping up sentiment beyond the capital. Public affairs and lobbying began to merge in campaigns back in lawmakers' home districts -- campaigns that mobilized prominent citizens, editorial writers or simply those affected economically to weigh in on an issue. **********As an example, Mr. Cassidy recalled a campaign his company waged starting in 1992 to keep the Seawolf class of nuclear attack submarine alive. After President George Bush canceled the project, Cassidy was hired by the manufacturer, General Dynamics, whose Electric Boat Division built the submarine. **********''We set out to change the debate,'' he said. ''At one point, we identified every single supplier from around the country and brought them all to Washington for a meeting.'' **********Those suppliers were then sent directly to their members of Congress, not the committees that dealt with military appropriations. **********The Cassidy company also sought support from unions and oversaw letter-writing campaigns, paid retired admirals to speak in local districts and arranged meetings with as many editorial boards as were willing to listen. **********The first tangible result was that Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate, came out in favor of the Seawolf. The project was saved and is still alive, in spite of periodic raids by Congressional budget-cutters who contend that it is superfluous. **********Last year, Cassidy was ranked first among Washington lobbying and public relations firms in the amount of business it did, edging out the law firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand. Verner Liipfert is one of a handful of firms that specialize in lobbying and constitute the other major wing of this business. **********Two other big ones are Patton, Boggs, whose partners include the well-known lobbyist Thomas H. Boggs Jr., and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, home to Robert W. Strauss, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, and Vernon E. Jordan, a prominent friend of President Clinton. Corporations and interest groups that use such law firms find they usually have to assemble a team of other agencies to handle public relations, polling and the like. **********It is a matter of debate whether that is better or worse than the all-under-one-roof approach. But Verner Liipfert, with high-profile partners like the former senators Bob Dole and George Mitchell, led the successful campaign to persuade Congress to block federal anti-tobacco legislation. **********In acquiring Cassidy, Shandwick gets a collection of companies that billed more than $40 million in 1998, as well as a group of prominent political figures, including Jody Powell, President Jimmy Carter's press secretary, and Michael Boland, a former aide to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott. **********It was once customary for Democrats and Republicans to lobby separately, but that custom first broke down when Ronald Reagan was elected president while the House was still ruled by Democrats. It has  pretty much vanished with the advent of a Republican Congress and a Democratic White House. The Cassidy group, carefully cultivating its bipartisan influence, has become a model for other Washington firms that combine prominent Democrats and Republicans under one roof. **********The umbrella of Cassidy companies includes the Cassidy lobbying operation; Boland & Madigan, another lobbying firm; Powell Tate, a public relations firm; Frederick Schneiders Research, which offers opinion and polling services; and Bork & Associates, which does law-related public relations. **********While Interpublic is now an instant Washington presence, Cassidy is suddenly connected with a company with offices in 52 countries. The newest development in lobbying, experts say, is the expansion of the European Union's effect on issues. **********To Howard Paster, the Shandwick-Cassidy merger is only the latest round in a trend that began a decade ago, when Hill & Knowlton gobbled up the lobbying firm Gray & Company. Mr. Paster, a former head of Congressional liaison for the Clinton administration, now heads Hill & Knowlton, the second-largest public relations firm both in the nation and in Washington. **********Hill & Knowlton is owned by WPP, which also owns the advertising giants Ogilvy & Mather and J. Walter Thompson. **********In 1990, Hill & Knowlton acquired the Wexler Group, a lobbying firm with a Democratic heritage, a year after it took over Timmons & Company, a Republican-oriented lobbying firm. **********Omnicom has acquired such Washington public relations outfits as Fleishman-Hilliard, Porter Novelli and Ketchum. Omnicom is looking to bolster its lobbying capabilities through acquisitions, industry experts said. **********In addition to podesta.com, another firm sought for acquisition in Washington is Barbour, Griffith & Rogers, a Republican lobbying firm headed by Haley Barbour, the former head of the Republican National Committee. **********Mr. Paster, who spent several years trying to sway Congress as the chief lobbyist in the Clinton administration, said that ''while having real smart Washington people still helps greatly, it's important to understand how changes have driven influence away from the center.'' Lawmakers are moved, he said, by plausible coalitions put together by professionals. **********Victor Kamber, head of the Kamber Group, which has special expertise with labor-related issues, said the future probably means more and more mergers. Companies have to grow to please their stockholders, he said, and ''realistically what's happened is that the easiest way to grow is acquire someone with clients; it's much faster than building up new clients.'' **********Mr. Kamber said that in the current atmosphere of mergers, he constantly asks himself if he can thrive as an independent or merely survive, which means he would be looking to merge his 50-person firm with another. **********''Right now, the answer is really unclear to me,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/27/business/world-business-briefing-europe-travel-profit-drops.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-07-27", "snippet": "Thomson Travel Group PLC reports first half pretax profit fell; says chief executive, Paul Brett, is leaving company; shares fall 11.5 percent; graph (S)", "word_count": 62, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TRAVEL PROFIT DROPS", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; TRAVEL PROFIT DROPS", "body_text": " **********Britain's biggest package-tour operator, Thomson Travel Group P.L.C., said that its pretax profit dropped in the first half as competition ate into earnings and that its chief executive, Paul Brett, was leaving the company.

There was the executive who routinely took her shoes off under the table, then lost one. The man who sneezed directly over the soup course. The woman who wiped her mouth with a piece of pita bread and then ate it. (Economical, perhaps, but not socially savvy.) **********While her anecdotes did not exactly strike fear into her guests, they did remind the 11 men and women why they paid $275 apiece to attend her business etiquette class at the Ritz-Carlton on a recent evening. **********''Ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about breaking bread with your clients,'' said Ms. Re, an etiquette consultant who has cured many corporate executives of bad table manners. ''We're talking about turning that restaurant into your board room.'' **********Ms. Re, who has taught manners to children at the Ritz-Carlton for 12 years, began the one-night executive etiquette classes this year to help the increasing number of adults who come to her with questions about business meal propriety. **********''The economy has become very full, and because of that, the people are doing a lot more entertaining,'' she said. ''People want to sharpen their entertaining skills. What's happening is, people know everything there is to know about their business. That's what they've done well; they've learned their skills, and they're great at it. Now they want to master this. They want to make sure they're putting their best foot forward.'' **********''In the 80's, people didn't have the same kind of feeling,'' she said. ''They'd say: 'You must be crazy, Judith. We just have money and that's all that counts.' '' **********It pays to have the gift of manners these days. Corporations are seeking out consultants in savoir-faire to train their employees. Etiquette schools that once catered only to children and diplomats have started offering courses with such titles as ''Business Etiquette for the New Millennium.'' One five-year-old consultant group in California, called the Workshoppe, finds a wealth of clients in the socially awkward executives of Silicon Valley. **********M.B.A. candidates at Daniels College of Business at the University of Denver are required to attend an etiquette dinner, while the Massachusetts Institute of Technology runs a not-for-credit charm school each January. Ms. Re, who learned her manners at her parents' dinner table, says graduate students whose parents came of age in the 1970's had things other than p's and q's to mind, like the Vietnam War and the sexual revolution. **********Modern times demand new rules, too. As Ms. Re's class supped on olive-crusted sea bass and filet of beef with caramelized shallots, the director provided lessons in pager protocol, cell phone etiquette and avoiding liability. **********Paul Sullivan, a investment company director, said he took clients out to dine three or four times a week but still has shortcomings at the table. **********''I still get confused about whether my salad fork is the one to the left or the right,'' he said as he practiced  setting a table in a class exercise. **********Anne-Marie Maguire, who works at Charles River Ventures, a venture capital firm, managed to prop her serviette into an M-shape, proclaimed it ''good enough,'' and marched off to the soup course. **********Ms. Re started her instructions with the basics. A Madeira consomme with truffle shavings is eaten by swiping the spoon from the 6 o'clock position to 12 o'clock. (''Seven to 1, that doesn't work?'' Mr. Sullivan joked.) No blowing or slurping, please. **********What to do when a dessert fork hits the floor? Or a glob of black tapanade plunks onto the white table linen? Mercifully, much of the success of the meal rests on the white-gloved servers, who quickly retrieve and replace the fallen fork and immediately swipe clean the mess with a sterling table scraper. **********All pretty standard, right? Even those who think themselves well mannered were taken aback when the teacher advised against ordering alcohol at a business lunch. **********''Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry,'' she said. ''You don't drink wine on someone else's clock.'' **********If a client has a questionable amount to drink, she said, ''Please make sure that when the server is right next to you, turn to that person and ask, 'Would you like me to get you a cab?' '' In acknowledgment, the word ''liability'' was murmured around the table. **********(This being a dinner, and the Ritz being the Ritz, wine is served with each course.) **********As the intermezzo of cassis sorbet was served, Ms. Re reminded her students to turn their beepers to silent at a meal and excuse themselves if they must return a page. Cell phones should be left behind, she said. If the client decides to take a call during the meal, she suggested continuing to eat, but more slowly. If the call continues for 10 minutes, ''then you know you're in trouble,'' she said. ''You've lost them.'' **********''Do you eavesdrop?'' she asked devilishly. ''Of course.'' **********Ms. Re's adult students can be even more nervous than her preteen pupils, timidly asking things such as  whether it is all right to eat the entire spear of asparagus, or just the tip. (Ms. Re loves the whole thing.) But by the time they sipped the dessert wine (the fourth of the evening) the students had begun to rattle off questions. Is it allowable to switch between the American style of eating and the European style? **********''I still feel like I'm eating upside down,'' Ms. Maguire said, as Ms. Re showed her how to use the knife to ''escort'' some garlic potatoes onto the back of her fork. Either style is acceptable, but no switching back and forth. **********Are there certain foods that should not be ordered at a business lunch? **********''I wouldn't order the 12-ounce burger with the au jus dripping off it,'' Ms. Re said. Linguine with clam sauce is her own nemesis. **********Tonight's dessert, peach a la Ritz, was a challenge all its own: a mousse garnished with a foot-high triangle of chocolate lace. Rather than risk toppling the tower off the plate, most guests ate around theirs. **********Although corporate attire had been requested, Ms. Re, dressed in a long-sleeved, toe-length black dress accented with a gold pin, was not out of place. **********''I set the rules,'' she said when asked where she finds her etiquette knowledge. ''I also listen to the pulse, everything from riding the metro trains to when you're traveling on an airplane. You're very visual, and you ask people questions, and that's what I do.'' She does not do color analysis or grin-and-greet classes, and no, she does not read Ann Landers. **********A successful business lunch, she said, is all about making the client feel taken care of. If a client suggests a particular restaurant, go there in advance to choose the best table for conducting business. You can present your credit card to the maitre d' in advance, to save any confusion about who gets the bill later. Choose a seat that allows you to keep eye contact with the server, but gives the client the best view. If the guest has a coat or valet ticket, ask for it and pay the tip. Don't discuss business as soon as you sit down, but let the conversation flow naturally. **********Many people say the time of the power lunch is past, that people are too busy to have lunch outside the office. For Mr. Sullivan, the business meal is a way to break through the ''wall of technology.'' **********''If it's just voice mail and just phones and our product is a little better than their product,'' then there's little to set the company apart, he said. ''But if I can make that personal contact. . . .'' **********Ms. Re added: ''Out technology is growing at such a fast pace that I don't think people have time to think. And I don't blame the people. I blame the technology.'' **********''There's just got to be a choice about what you bring over into the millennium,'' she said. In fact, she mused, the Internet could be a good way to spread the gospel of etiquette. **********For now, she sends each student off with a booklet of her rules. In it, she reminds them not to use long words when short ones willdo, and if they do not know how to pronounce the name of a wine, it is fine to order it by its number on the menu. **********''The only way in which you can overdo it, ladies and gentlemen,'' she said, ''is when you're pretending you're something you're not.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/19/business/company-news-allied-waste-cancels-deal-with-waste-management-inc.html": {"writer_name": "Dow Jones", "pub_date": "1999-05-19", "snippet": "Allied Waste Industries ends agreement to purchase certain solid-waste handling assets from Waste Management Inc in deal that had been valued at about $85 million; Allied says approval from Justice Department would have taken longer and had been m...", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ALLIED WASTE CANCELS DEAL WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT INC.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; ALLIED WASTE CANCELS DEAL WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT INC.", "body_text": " **********Allied Waste Industries said yesterday that it had ended an agreement to purchase certain solid-waste handling assets from Waste Management Inc. in a deal that had been valued at about $85 million.

Whenever that information moves from one computer or network to another, it runs into an electronic bottleneck. The switches that route the information are not based on optical technology, but instead use electrical components. To move through the switches, the signals carried by photons must be converted into electronic signals and then converted back to photonic signals to continue along the fiber. **********''Every time you convert backward and forward, you lose information, and it costs money,'' said Lawrence Gasman, president of Communications Industry Research, which follows fiber optics trends. ''The goal of everyone now is the all-optical network.'' **********Telecommunications companies have been working for years to create switches that will make that all-optical network possible at low cost. Getting light to change direction precisely and without losing energy is one of the technical hurdles. Size and scale also pose problems. Creating a switch that moves light from one channel to another is easy compared with the challenge of switching light at different wavelengths through thousands of different channels. **********Lately, however, new technological breakthroughs appear to be bringing researchers closer to a practical solution. Bell Laboratories, the research arm of Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, N.J., is using microelectricalmechanical systems, known as MEMS. Its optical switches use silicon chips tiled with micromirrors, each one small enough to fit on the head of a pin. When a voltage is applied to the chip, the mirrors are pulled up or down in response. The result is a tilting motion that can redirect light in three dimensions. **********''You can steer the light from any input fiber to any output fiber,'' said David Bishop, head of MEMS research at Bell Labs. The device carrying the switches, Dr. Bishop added, could be the size of a grapefruit. **********Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., is also developing optical switches. Its prototypes include liquid crystal displays that can be turned on and off to route light from one fiber to another. ''Liquid crystal technology has no moving parts, which is big advantage,'' said John Bayne, the product-line manager for optical switches at Corning. In September, Corning demonstrated a device based on this technology that could route information between as many as 80 channels at a time. **********Last week, a new company called Nanovation stepped into the ring. It introduced a line of optical-switching components that are based on research conducted at Northwestern University. Its switches, it says, are the smallest yet. **********''We're talking about devices the size of a human hair,'' said G. Robert Tatum, the company's president and chief executive. **********Microscopic switches could be created in bulk at very low cost, Mr. Tatum said, because only small specks of material would be used in manufacturing each one. **********''Our devices will allow immediate access to the fiber at much faster speeds,'' Mr. Tatum said. **********Nanovation's technology has prompted some skepticism, however. Engineers for other companies say privately that they will believe it when they see it; they are not convinced that the wave-guide technology will actually work. Nanovation has not given any public demonstrations, its officials say, because the switches are too tiny to see without specialized equipment. But they add that the company has given demonstrations to clients and investors in its nanofabrication laboratory at Northwestern. **********The technology behind the switches is based on channels for the passage of photons called wave guides. In the laboratory, Nanovation engineers use an electron-beam lithography system to etch these wave guides onto tiny wafers made of indium phosphite or gallium arsenide, materials that are commonly used in optical technology. The wave guides look like deep ravines arranged in patterns of circles and straight lines. The circles act as exit ramps that redirect the light and create, in essence, an optical switch. **********One critical element of these wave guides, Nanovation's engineers say, is the smooth surface of the walls. As long as the surface is smooth, light is not deflected in the wrong direction and lost during its movement through the channel. **********Two researchers at Northwestern -- Seng Tiong Ho, a engineering professor, and Mee Koy Chin, who is now Nanovation's director of technology -- invented this approach, which they call ''strongly guided'' wave-guide technology. **********Nanovation licensed the technology and produced its first optical chip in April. The chip includes 16 switches etched upon a wafer that measures less than 250 microns, or about the size of a few strands of human hair, on each side. Since these switches are so minute, thousands of them can be integrated within a chip the size of a thumbnail. **********Regardless of which approach wins in the battle for the best optical switch, consumers may be reaping the benefits in the next few years, analysts say. Bandwidth may become wide enough and fast enough to make Internet multimedia, like video teleconferences, readily available. **********''Five years from now, we'll be switching huge amounts, mind-boggling amounts, of bandwidth,'' said Dr. Bishop, of Bell Labs. ''There are untold riches to be made for the company that figures out how to do it.'' **********The advent of optical switches could also clear vast amounts of space in the equipment closets at traditional phone companies. Currently, phone companies are saddled with cabinets full of equipment to switch signals among copper wires. Eventually, they may be able to go to completely optical networks, depending instead on devices no bigger than breadboxes. That is, once they are willing to dispose of the bulkier switches they have relied on for decades. **********''This will cut down on costs,'' said Sean Buckley, an editor of optical newsletters published by the Information Gatekeepers Group. But Mr. Buckley said it might not happen right away because ''local phone companies don't just want to rip out what they have.'' **********Mr. Tatum of Nanovation is more optimistic. In a few years, he said, the all-optical network could be a reality, with fiber running straight into homes and onto desktops.  ''We're making it efficient enough,'' Mr. Tatum said, ''to have fiber optics go straight to the PC.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/02/business/the-markets-commodities.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-04-02", "snippet": "Sugar prices fall more than 5 percent on persistent concern that global glut will overwhelm weak demand; in New York, sugar for May delivery falls 0.32 cent, to 5.59 cents a pound; graph; chart (S)", "word_count": 36, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES", "body_text": " **********SUGAR DROPS.

Mr. Levitt made clear that his agency would step in if the exchange did not abolish the rule on its own. **********In addition to abolishing Rule 390, Mr. Grasso said the Big Board was intent on providing electronic communications networks access to the Intermarket Trading System. That system provides electronic links among the nation's stock markets, allowing specialists and dealers to route orders for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq stock market and regional exchanges. **********''Repealing Rule 390 is not that big a deal,'' said Gregory Smith, an analyst who follows electronic brokers for Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco. ''But giving other parties access to I.T.S. will be a big change. Once that happens, all the E.C.N.'s will be licking their chops. It does open up the New York Stock Exchange to a more competitive environment.'' **********Pressure to continue down that path is likely to intensify. Reacting to the Big Board vote, John A. Thain, president and co-chief operating officer at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said in a statement that while the firm supported the move to eliminate Rule 390, ''we view this not as an answer but as a positive step toward important changes necessary to maintain competitiveness and insure the deepest and best markets for all investors.'' **********Doug Atkin, president and chief executive of Instinet, the subsidiary of Reuters P.L.C. that is the oldest private electronic trading network, said: ''I really believe Mr. Grasso wants to do the right thing. And reforming I.T.S. is the key to true competition. Then and only then will the New York Stock Exchange dramatically reform.'' **********Electronic trading networks like Instinet and Island, a subsidiary of Datek Online Holdings, now account for as much as 30 percent of daily trading on the Nasdaq stock market, according to industry estimates. By contrast, they handle less than about 5 percent of the volume of shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange, in part because of their inability to participate in the Intermarket Trading System."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/04/business/world-business-briefing-europe-british-phone-rates-cut.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Sorkin", "pub_date": "1999-09-04", "snippet": "British Telecommunications PLC announces new initiative to cut residential phone rates for British customers (S)4", "word_count": 94, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITISH PHONE RATES CUT", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; BRITISH PHONE RATES CUT", "body_text": " **********Bowing to competitive pressures, British Telecommunications P.L.C. announced a new initiative to cut residential phone rates for British customers.

To the entrepreneurs who were the first to make E-commerce pay and whose businesses are still the most profitable sector of the Internet: the on-line pornographers. **********Not only does the cyberskin game hold lessons for all sorts of on-line businesses, experts say, but pornography sites have pioneered technical and marketing developments that are at the heart of the business plans of many enterprises that would not be caught dead on the same server. **********''There are a lot of lessons to be had from the on-line porn's success on the Web,'' said David Zinman, the vice president for marketing of Adknowledge of Palo Alto, Calif., which charges site owners to gauge how well their on-line advertisements generate leads and sales. **********Mark Tiarra, whose on-line company, the Tiarra Corporation, creates advertisements and strategies for sex-oriented Web sites, said that compared with his clients and their competitors, ''the nonadult side of the Web has always been a year behind the curve in marketing strategies.'' **********This innovative streak has been shaped by two realities: unlike many other Web businesses, sex sites have a product that people are willing to pay for but that almost anyone can produce. **********There would be no sex sites if sex did not sell. **********''Unlike major mainstream companies, sex sites had no off-line revenue stream,'' said Mr. Tiarra, who is also president of United Adult Sites, a trade organization of 500 on-line sex companies. ''You have to make it on your own.'' **********Early on, visiting sex sites meant long downloads and slow video clips, but operators found ways to transmit large pictures despite narrow bandwidths. **********As the Internet became awash with sex sites, the operators scrambled to develop a way to use existing on-line technology to get pictures to Web surfers for the few moments they would land on a site. **********With income essentially based on speed of content flow, Web site designers began writing programs that tweaked technology to make pages and photos load more quickly to grab their share of the market. **********The resulting sites were not always coherent and flowing, but they delivered the product quickly, and that drew browsers and kept them from skipping to the next sex site. **********Creators of sex sites used tips and tricks in writing Web page scripts so that sexy selling points loaded onto the screen first before less appetizing elements, like sign-up fees. **********Most of the Web's sex sites make money by charging for entry to a video gallery, usually by a membership bought with a credit card. Many also carry paid advertisements for larger sites. Free sites profit by carrying links to other sites, which pay fractions of a cent each time a customer clicks through. **********With profits tied to traffic on the site, the battle for the most clicks was on. Some site operators designed tricks to lure casual surfers to accidentally visit sex sites. Some devised loops to repeatedly click onto sites, including manipulation of the back key to keep reloading a page. **********Stealth redirection techniques cropped up, including writing programs to create pop-up browsers that emerged as users left sites, creating a ''no exit'' barrage of windows and prompts. Web sites began feeding encoded key words for sites unrelated to sex into search engines, drawing unsuspecting browsers and causing pop-up advertisements to appear when certain key words were entered. **********They bought rights to commonly used names of Web sites with altered suffixes. For example, browsers seeking the Presidential Web site at www.Whitehouse.gov/ got a sex site if, by mistake, they typed in www.Whitehouse.com. **********Some sites began requesting credit card information as proof of age for ''free trials,'' adding in fine print that membership charges automatically would begin afterward. **********Early on, Mr. Tiarra said, mainstream Web site owners were more complacent. ''They were coming into this saying, 'Is this going to work?' '' he said. ''We came in saying, 'How am I going to make enough money to quit my job.'' **********Now, he said, mainstream companies are hiring designers of sex sites. ''They're looking for successful strategies, so they're going to get the guys who had the most competitors,'' he said. **********Jane Duvall, who assesses sex-oriented sites, said there was a limit to what mainstream sites could copy from the pornographic ones. ''The problem with copying porn sites is that sex is the compelling content, and you can never really compete with that,'' Ms. Duvall said. **********But for all the field's ferocious rivalry, sex sites offer lessons in the benefits of cooperation, too, said Ms. Duvall, a former newspaper advertising saleswoman who two years ago used $500 and an old Power Mac to set up her own Web site, Jane's 'Net Sex Guide, which reviews and rates sites. ''We call it co-opetition, and you don't see it much on the nonadult sites,'' she said. ''Even a link trade is a big deal. You're only sending away a user that is leaving anyway.'' **********Mainstream companies using click-through referrals should research the sex-site industry to learn how to avoid getting cheated, she said. **********The smaller on-line pornography sites formed larger networks offering comprehensive memberships and then splitting the profits -- resembling America Online's more recent decision to develop an electronic network that would allow members to shop at many retail Web sites with one credit account. **********They also formed large, free supersites, where each company would post its own click-through banner. **********Another example of the strategy of cross-linking or link-swapping was the formation of referral rings, networks in which sites refer customers to one another. Sophisticated tracking systems were then designed to count the referrals that became paying customers, so sites could reward one another with a percentage of the sign-up fee. This practice has been adopted by many mainstream sites, like Amazon.com and Beyond.com. **********''The on-line porn industry has driven Web technology just as it has with all new media,'' said Seth Warshavsky, the chief executive of the Internet Entertainment Group, a sex-oriented on-line company based in Seattle. **********''The adult industry entrepreneurs have been a lot more aggressive developing marketing strategies because they see a direct return on everything they put out,'' he said. ''They're all players willing to take a risk to develop new marketing strategies, and only now are a lot of the mainstream on-line companies applying those concepts. We began working video into Web browsers in 1995. Now it's being used all over the Web.'' **********CAITY McPHERSON, the president of Bay Area Adult Sites, a coalition of 100 people who work in the sex-oriented Web site industry, created the sex site, Juicymango.com in 1997. Now she auditions strippers for Rouze.com, a Web site introduced this month that offers editorial material on subjects aimed at affluent men, like martinis, cigars and etiquette. It also offers erotic content, but its editors do not use traditional Internet pornography marketing strategies, Ms. McPherson said. **********''I suggested we use some synergy links to create partnerships with other sites and increase traffic,'' she said. ''But the editors said, 'Why would we want to get rid of our traffic?' **********''They don't understand the sex sites are like a loop that generates more traffic, and the mainstream sites are like a rope where you just fall off when you exit. Playing by the mainstream rules means keeping your Web site an enclosed little world.'' **********''I live in Silicon Valley,'' she said, ''and when I tell people at meetings I'm from the adult industry, everyone sort of gets all uptight, but afterward a few always give me a card and say, 'Please call me to talk about marketing strategies.' '' **********Many experts agree that most mainstream sites will never be able to match the pure profit potential of sex sites, which have little overhead and an eager audience. **********''One thing that pornography has been more successful at is tapping into two revenue streams, advertising and selling subscriptions,'' Mr. Zinman said. ''Only sites offering incredibly high-demand content can get both. Most nonadult sites have advertising, but few can sell subscriptions because you can get the content somewhere else.'' **********He added: ''In the porn industry, you have a tremendous demand for the material product. Nonadult industry has to acquire the kind of information that consumers will want to pay for to make a profitable business model. Until then, profitable mainstream Web sites will continue to be an oxymoron.'' **********Keeping It Out of Your House **********AFTER the United States Supreme Court overturned a 1997 Federal law that prohibited the dissemination of sexually explicit material over the Internet in a manner available to children, the market became flooded with software filters for blocking pornography from personal computers. **********Most Internet service providers and some Web browsers also offer optional built-in filter services for customers who want to censor Internet material. **********Here are some of the filters endorsed by the Federal Communications Commission: **********AMERICA ONLINE -- (www.aol.com) offers as part of its membership fee optional parental controls that block E-mail messages from specific senders and confine access to certain sites.

But there also were some manufactured goods, like mopeds and smaller motorcycles by Bianchi of Sweden. **********The announcement came in response to European Union statements that it would not be able to comply with a ruling from the World Trade Organization to end its ban on hormone-treated beef by May 13. The organization concluded that Europe's rules against the beef were based on faulty science. **********European trade officials have long argued that there could be long-term harmful health effects to humans from treating beef with hormones, and that the effects may not be known for years. The United States counters that Europe's motivation is essentially protectionist, to the point of citing unreliable studies to keep the market closed to competition. **********The issue has become a heated political topic in Europe, along with the arguments over whether European rules on banana imports are intended to discriminate against fruit handled by two American companies, Chiquita Brands International and the Dole Foods Company. The United States has begun to impose 100 percent tariffs on $500 million in European luxury good imports in retaliation for Europe's refusal to comply with the trade organization's rulings in that dispute. **********Like the banana arguments, the battling over beef hormones has been going on for years, and, as in the banana case, the United States is moving quickly to threaten retaliation. The punitive import fees are intended to create pressure on European politicians from companies that will find themselves virtually unable to ship goods to the United States -- unless they pay a 100 percent tariff, doubling the wholesale price. **********While the United States Trade Representative's office published a ''target list'' of $900 million in goods subject to retaliation, including Swedish hams, that list will be pared significantly before any tariffs go into effect. American beef farmers have put their losses from the hormone ban at several hundred million dollars. The final list is expected to contain about $300 million in European goods sold here. **********Before the high tariffs are imposed, the European Union could negotiate some form of compensation for American beef farmers. But today Peter Scher, who heads agricultural negotiations for the Trade Representative's office, said that ''compensation is meant to be a bridge to ending the ban, and the E.U. has never made it clear it will comply with the ruling.'' **********Mr. Scher said that negotiations were under way to allow for the hormone-treated beef to be clearly labeled for European consumers, giving shoppers the option to avoid buying it if they chose. But Mr. Scher emphasized that ''there is no evidence of any health risks'' related to consumption of the beef. **********For the Clinton Administration, more is at stake in these battles than beef and bananas. Mr. Clinton has argued that the European Union has to be taught to abide by W.T.O. rulings. The Europeans counter that the United States is jumping the gun, imposing retaliation before the appeals process is complete."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/23/business/world-business-briefing-europe-laura-ashley-sees-light-ahead.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Sorkin", "pub_date": "1999-09-23", "snippet": "Laura Ashley Holdings PLC reports that losses in first half of year widened to 7.2 million pounds, or $11.75 million, compared with loss of 2.6 million pounds in year-earlier period; Ashley is in midst of major redesign of its stores, move analyst...", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LAURA ASHLEY SEES LIGHT AHEAD", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; LAURA ASHLEY SEES LIGHT AHEAD", "body_text": " **********Laura Ashley Holdings P.L.C., the troubled clothing and home-furnishings retailer based in Britain, reported that losses in the first half of the year widened to 7.2 million [Pounds], or $11.75 million, compared with a loss of $:2.6 million in the period a year earlier.

There, both Wall Street investment banks have flourished, riding the wave of dot-com companies that have enriched themselves by offering shares to a rapacious public or selling out to each other. **********But in recent years, another big Wall Street name has been conspicuously scarce in the Silicon Valley gold rush: Merrill Lynch. The firm's sideline status has been puzzling, given that as much as one-quarter of the revenue generated by investment banking departments these days comes from advising technology companies on mergers and public stock offerings. **********So why has Merrill largely missed out on technology bankers' big bull market? **********To hear Merrill Lynch explain it, the firm has not missed out at all; it simply got a late start. Tom Davis, executive vice president of Merrill's corporate and institutional client group, said the company was only three years into a multiyear effort to expand its technology presence worldwide. **********''We are at the beginning of what is a long secular shift in the economy,'' Mr. Davis said. Of Merrill's strategy, in particular, he said, ''I think we are at the early stage of this game.'' **********Of course, technology executives have heard that before. When Merrill set up an office in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1996, it was the third attempt to crack Silicon Valley's clubby community, after abortive efforts in the 1980's and early 1990's. Mr. Davis said the company had been too busy expanding other departments to focus much on technology in those days. **********Given its relatively late start, Merrill has made a respectable showing this year. According to Thomson Financial/Securities Data, Merrill ranked fourth in taking new technology companies public in 1999, as measured by the amount of money raised. That is a far cry from 1997, when it did not even rank among the top 20. **********Merrill's total of $2.2 billion in technology underwriting this year, as calculated by Thomson, gave the firm a market share of 7.8 percent through Dec. 22. Those numbers do not tell the full story, though. That is still only about half the market share of more influential rivals like Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs -- which rank first, second and third, respectively, in Thomson's lineup. **********And with the exception of the Internet Capital Group, a Merrill loyalist that invests in Internet concerns and which Merrill took public in August, Merrill has yet to attract the roster of superstar companies that their larger competitors have. **********Investors in Goldman and Morgan have been handsomely rewarded this year, in part, because of their prowess in the technology sector. Goldman's share price is up 53 percent since the firm went public in May; Morgan's is up 85 percent for the year. Merrill's share price, though, is up only 17 percent. **********''It is not clear to me that they are going to make strides quickly enough,'' Steven Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said of Merrill. The concern, Mr. Galbraith said, is that by the time Merrill might catch up in technology, the market will have moved on to the next hot sector. **********Some analysts have said that when merger talks between Merrill and the technology investment boutique Hambrecht & Quist broke down two years ago, Merrill missed a ripe opportunity to increase its presence in technology underwriting. **********Merrill suffered blows, too, with the loss of high-profile executives like its president, Herbert M. Allison Jr., a favorite in Silicon Valley who left the firm earlier this year and joined the ranks of political fundraisers, and, more recently, Scott Ryles, head of technology investment banking, who had helped build that practice. Mr. Ryles left last month to become chief executive of a new online investment bank backed by Charles Schwab. **********What is more, Merrill has not been a believer in the ''star system,'' Mr. Galbraith said. Having a name-brand stock picker, like Mary Meeker, the celebrated Morgan Stanley analyst who helped put that Internet practice on the map, is essential, he argues. **********On that count, though, Merrill may now be trying to cultivate a rising star. In February, it hired a 33-year-old CIBC Oppenheimer analyst, Henry Blodget, who went way out on a limb last year by predicting that Amazon.com would hit $400 a share -- a target the stock not only reached but surpassed. Hiring Mr. Blodget, who has quickly gained a Silicon Valley following, is simply one indication of the way Merrill Lynch has expanded its technology research effort, said Steve Milunovich, the firm's global team coordinator for technology research. **********''I'm a big believer that changing perception is hard,'' Mr. Milunovich said. ''Our perception is probably better outside the valley than in the valley.'' **********Certainly, Merrill's perception problem was not helped by comments one of its top executives made about the Internet last year. A Merrill vice chairman, John Steffens, was criticized after newspapers quoted him as saying that online trading was akin to gambling and a ''serious threat to Americans' financial lives.'' Some in Silicon Valley took umbrage, suggesting that if Merrill did not understand the impact of the Internet on its own business, how could it understand theirs? **********When Mr. Steffens, who is known as Launny, subsequently began extolling the Internet, the perception that he was scrambling to recover from a faux pas only seemed to make matters worse. **********Mr. Davis said that Merrill had not lost a piece of business because of Mr. Steffens's comments. But others at the firm wonder how much potential business landed elsewhere. ''We got tarred for that,'' Mr. Milunovich said. ''There's no question that Launny's comments hurt.'' **********One of Merrill's best technology credentials has been serving as a mergers-and-acquisitions banker to the networking giant Cisco Systems. Merrill got the job because it is one of Cisco's largest equipment customers. Cisco has an in-house team that does most of the heavy lifting on its transactions, but Merrill has retained the client on merit. **********''They do a nice job and we've been pleased with the level of service,'' said Mike Volpi, Cisco's senior vice president for business development. **********Still, Merrill's career as a merger adviser has hit some snags. Merrill had a very close relationship with the At Home Corporation, a provider of high-speed Internet service for cable television subscribers. Merrill had helped take At Home public and arranged for subsequent financings. So it was not surprising the firm was tapped to advise At Home on its $6.7 billion stock-swap merger in January with Excite Inc. **********But the night before the Excite@Home merger was to be announced, executives at Excite noticed a problem: the total that At Home would pay in stock was lower than the agreed-to price. In effect, a miscalculation had been made in the documents, and At Home's board of directors had to be reconvened to vote again on the correct amount, according to George Bell, president of Excite@Home and the former chief executive of Excite. **********''We were up until 4:30 a.m., they fixed it, and we announced that morning,'' Mr. Bell said. ''Because it wasn't our company, I can't say it was the bankers' fault.'' **********Whoever was to blame, industry executives say such last-minute mishaps are rare. **********Thomas Jermoluk, who had been At Home's chief executive, could not be reached for comment. But people involved in those talks say he and executives from the AT&T Corporation, which owned a large stake of At Home, were enraged at the time. And when the merged Excite@Home, led by Mr. Jermoluk, announced its acquisition of BlueMountain.com recently, it was not Merrill that was hired to advise on the deal. **********Mark Shafir, who is in charge of Merrill's technology merger department in San Francisco, was hard pressed to comment on the mixup with Excite and At Home except to say the terms were ''discussed and vetted'' with executives and their lawyers.

Now Woodstock.com, an Internet music start-up, is about to raise the semantic stakes. The company has announced what it bills as the first pay-per-view Webcast of a live event -- even if the concert in question did take place last year. **********On Friday, at 9 P.M. Eastern daylight time, the company will offer a pay-per-view Webcast of a Sarah McLachlan concert, offered simultaneously via pay-per-view cable television in many cities through Spring Communications. The performance was recorded in April 1998 in Portland, Ore., at the end of Ms. McLachlan's ''Surfacing'' tour. **********The Webcast is apparently aimed at people who are such zealous McLachlan fans that they would be willing to watch her performance in a small portion of a PC screen in the choppy video still characteristic of Webcasts. Or maybe it will attract viewers who do not subscribe to cable or do not live in the right cable markets. **********Or maybe the Web viewers will be drawn by the discount: $7.95 for the nearly two-hour concert, compared with $14.95 for the television version. **********''Fans are not going to be having a broadcast-quality experience, so we didn't want to charge them for one,'' Rand Bleimeister, chief executive of Woodstock.com, said. **********Even if the show does not draw a large Web turnout, Mr. Bleimeister predicts that pay-per-view Web concerts will eventually be a big business, as the technology improves. **********Woodstock.com says that the Webcast will be the first to use new video-streaming technology from Microsoft that allows a user's password to work only at a single location. This feature is a breakthrough for Internet vendors because it prevents multiple users from dodging the pay-per-view fee by sharing the same stream. **********The Woodstock.com name comes from Woodstock 99, the rock music festival to be held in Rome, N.Y., July 23 through 25; Woodstock.com is the official site of that show, which will mark the 30th anniversary of the original concert. The company plans to Webcast the festival live -- in this case, as it is actually taking place.   LAURIE J.

Then they plan to go public. **********The still-secret registry includes the names of about 300 Jordanians who the list makers say consort with ''the enemy'' -- Israel, the country with which Jordan signed a landmark peace treaty five years ago. **********Within a month, they say, they will begin naming names, starting with those involved in what they consider the 40 or so most egregious cases. These include politicians and journalists who have openly visited Israel, artists who advocate across-the-border cultural exchange, academics engaged in research with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and a handful of local entrepreneurs in American-encouraged ventures with Israeli partners. **********This preliminary blacklist is the latest project of Jordan's increasingly visible ''anti-normalization'' movement, which seeks to ostracize any Jordanians who have cordial or collaborative relations with Israel. The self-proclaimed anti-normalizers say they want to boycott the products of the accused, scare away their clients, force them out of Government and strip them of the guild memberships they need to practice their professions. **********Many take the threat seriously. **********The anti-normalizers are not marginal figures: Their backers include such bastions of the establishment as the national bar association. A gathering of anti-normalization forces in September drew more than 400 representatives of leading unions and business associations, and 13 of Jordan's 20 registered political parties. **********This may seem out of character for a country that has distinguished itself by embracing the cause of peace. That is certainly the view of King Abdullah; since assuming the throne in February, he has continued the peacemaking efforts of his late father, King Hussein, and worked to strengthen Jordan's still minimal trade and investment with Israel. **********[King Abdullah met with President Clinton in Washington on Oct. 12 to discuss Jordan's efforts to promote Israeli negotiations with Syria and the Palestinian Authority.] **********''I am uncomfortable with the way that certain groups in the country try to put their views on the majority and try to intimidate people,'' King Abdullah said when asked in a recent interview about the anti-normalization campaign. ''I do not think that this is the Jordan that His Majesty King Hussein wanted, or that we want for ourselves.'' **********But the leader of the country's biggest political party, a vocal advocate of the anti-normalization drive, contends that he represents the majority viewpoint. Jordan's relationship with Israel ''can never be normal,'' the official, Abdel Majeed al-Dhniebat, chairman of the Muslim Brotherhood, asserted in an interview, ''because they are not a peaceful people, the Jews -- they are not civilized.'' **********Israel's 1994 treaty with Jordan ''was the peace of the victorious against the vanquished,'' he said. **********Though the anti-normalization campaign began in the last years of King Hussein's reign, it has become increasingly strident and public under King Abdullah, who seems more tolerant of vocal dissent. **********Ali Abu Sukar, the energetic coordinator of the drive, says at least 20 people on the list have already approached him, promising to cease activities to which the group objects in exchange for keeping their names unpublished. **********Mr. Sukar says he embraced the cause for one simple reason: ''I am a  Muslim man, and the Jewish people are our enemy.'' **********In his newly remodeled downtown offices, with his meticulously trimmed beard, crisply starched shirt and fashionable tie, the 38-year-old Mr. Sukar is the very picture of the successful young Jordanian urban professional. He is president of the national association of civil engineers and is a leading force in the umbrella organization of professional groupings to which lawyers, doctors, architects, journalists and others are obliged to belong. **********These associations have all endorsed his campaign against ''normalization,'' defined in a joint resolution as ''any activity that would break the psychological barrier of hostility between Arabs and the Jewish state.'' **********[A clash between Israelis and Jordanian lawmakers on Oct. 9 provided fuel to those who object to normal relations with Israel. A band of Jewish settlers attacked a Jordanian parliamentary delegation visiting Hebron, a West Bank city under Palestinian governance but Israeli security control. Instead of protecting the Jordanians, Israeli soldiers subjected them to body searches, according to the speaker of the House, Abdul Hadi Majali, who called the experience ''humiliating.'' Jordan protested the incident.] **********Enmity toward Israel is strongest among the more than a million Palestinians still in refugee camps here, but analysts say their attitudes are shared by much of the educated middle class, which is also predominately Palestinian. **********Mr. Sukar's family history is typical, as is his inherited resentment. His Palestinian father was born in Lod, once a quiet Arab village and now the site of Ben-Gurion International airport in Israel. He fled to Jordan as a destitute refugee during the 1948 Israeli war of independence, never to return. ''Israel is our enemy, because it usurped our land,'' Mr. Sukar said in an interview. **********Abdullah Hasanat, editor of the state-owned Jordan Times, is among those who expects to appear on Mr. Sukar's blacklist. For traveling to an academic conference in Haifa, Israel, he already faces expulsion from the Jordanian journalists union. **********Mr. Hasanat is hopeful that his Government-appointed superiors will not make his continued employment contingent on union membership. But for rank-and-file reporters in most publications, the loss of a union card would mean instant dismissal. **********''It is absurd,'' he said, noting that Israeli reporters travel frequently and freely to Jordan. ''We have to engage the Israelis somehow.'' **********Mr. Sukar disagrees. He opposes not just Government or corporate ties between Jordan and Israel, but any Arab-Israeli fraternization. He says Palestinians who live intermingled with Israelis in East Jerusalem and the West Bank should take special care to avoid voluntary dealings with Israelis -- as business partners, or even as tennis partners. **********''Our sons, our children will look upon the Israelis as friends if we have a normal relationship with these people,'' Mr. Sukar explained. ''That is the danger: When they grow up, when their generation becomes strong, they have to be ready to fight for what is rightfully theirs.'' **********Increasingly, Mr. Sukar's public targets have included Palestinians visiting from the West Bank, most of them fervent nationalists. In the past year the anti-normalization forces protested appearances by a Palestinian playwright who has worked with Israeli actors and an Israeli Arab poet who publishes a magazine that like most literary publications in Israel, receives state subsidies. **********In September Mr. Sukar's group persuaded the Jordanian Artists Association to revoke the membership of the director of Amman's annual theater festival because he had invited a repertory troupe from Jerusalem -- Arab East Jerusalem, to be sure, and wholly Palestinian in ethnicity and outlook, but including a few performers who hold Israeli passports. **********Passing Mr. Sukar's litmus test can be tough. At September's convention, organizers tried to silence representatives from the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a faction responsible for devastating terrorist attacks against Israel. The complaint: the group's leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, had shaken the hand of Israel's President at King Hussein's funeral. **********Others singled out for reprisals are groups supported by the Ford Foundation, an institution Mr. Sukar says is permeated by ''Israeli and Jewish influence.'' He considers grants from the Frederich Eibert and Konrad Adenauer foundations equally objectionable. ''They are based in Germany, but there is also influence from Israel,'' he said. **********Such sentiments make liberal Jordanians cringe. Even for those who adamantly reject detente with Israel, the anti-normalization strategy ''makes no sense,'' Mr. Hasanat said. ''If they are the enemy, go and study them. Know thine enemy. The Israelis have been doing this with us for 50 years.'' **********King Abdullah says confidently that the anti-normalization movement should evaporate once the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel complete their peace negotiations. **********''We have to get the Palestinians and the Israelis to sit down so that in a very short period of time, these people will have no case,'' he said. ''If there is normalization between Palestinians and Israelis, it will be very difficult for Jordanians to have any gripes about it.'' **********But Mr. Sukar is almost as opposed to Mr. Arafat as he is to Israel, and he vows to continue the campaign until Palestinians reclaim all their ancestral lands. ''If there are two teams, the winners and the losers, those who happen to be on the losing side should not be forced to have normal relations with the winners,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/business/business-grass-roots-business-bosnia-s-loss-is-an-american-city-s-gain.html": {"writer_name": "Joel Kotkin", "pub_date": "1999-04-25", "snippet": "Bosnian immigrants have become hard-working element in St Louis, reviving sagging old neighborhoods, boosting economy and balancing out-migration from city and region; Steve Hrdlicka describes revival of Southern Commercial Bank branch he manages ...", "word_count": 1049, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bosnia's Loss is an American City's Gain", "print_headline": "BUSINESS: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; Bosnia's Loss is an American City's Gain", "body_text": " **********AN unexpected side effect of the turmoil in the Balkans has Steve Hrdlicka hopping. **********For most of the 1990's, the Southern Commercial Bank branch on Gravois Avenue, where Mr. Hrdlicka is a loan officer, was a forlorn place, stuck in an aging neighborhood in a shrinking city. New accounts were few, and the shuttered businesses along Gravois and other once-bustling streets in the Bevo neighborhood of south St. Louis suggested little hope for the future. **********All that changed when a stream of new immigrants, largely Bosnians leaving behind the ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, began settling in this unlikely patch of the Midwest. ''Eight years ago when we opened this branch, we sat on our hands most of the time -- we used to sleep quite a lot,'' recalled Mr. Hrdlicka (pronounced HERD-lick-a), now 39, who grew up in predominantly white, working-class south St. Louis, the great-grandson of Czech immigrants. ''Then this place became a rally place for Bosnians. They would come in and ask for a loan for furniture. Then a car. Then it was a house, for themselves, their cousins.'' **********Largely thanks to the Bosnian newcomers, who have developed a reputation for hard work and thrift, Mr. Hrdlicka's branch has doubled its deposits in the last two years. **********For greater St. Louis, an unexpected opportunity for revival is seen in the arrival of an estimated 15,000 Bosnian immigrants in the 1990's -- a concentration second in size only to Chicago's -- along with smaller groups of newcomers from Mexico, Vietnam, Ethiopia and Somalia. **********This kind of story, of a critical mass of hard-working immigrants revitalizing a sagging urban neighborhood, is a familiar one in immigrant havens like New York or Houston. But it is big news in St. Louis, which has largely been starved of fresh immigration for half a century. **********In the late 1800's, new arrivals from Germany, Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe were building St. Louis into an industrial and commercial metropolis to rival Chicago. But after World War II, the city lost its appeal to ambitious newcomers. **********Since 1950, the population of the city has shriveled from 857,000 to roughly 350,000, proportionally the sharpest decline of any major American city. The vast surrounding suburbs, home now to roughly five times as many people, at first grew rapidly but have since also ebbed. In the 1990's the region has lost 63,000 people to other parts of the country and has ranked among the slowest-growing in the nation. **********One important reason is that domestic migration out of St. Louis has not been balanced by immigration from abroad, as it has in New York or Los Angeles. According to William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan, the St. Louis metropolitan area, now the nation's 18th largest, ranked just 35th in the number of immigrants who settled there between 1990 and 1998, below much smaller cities like Hartford. **********The paucity of immigrants locked St. Louis into what Mr. Frey calls a Rust Belt pattern of decay, which was easy to discern on the south side, historically an immigrant district. Old brick owner-occupied homes were gradually becoming rentals, and thriving commercial districts were slowly being abandoned. Prices for homes, stores, factory buildings and warehouses plummeted. **********But those depressed conditions have made possible the current upsurge in Bosnian immigration, according to Ann Crosslin, president of the International Institute of St. Louis, a nonprofit group that aids refugees and promotes international cultural programs in the city. She said the small first wave of refugees, in the early 1990's, found housing costs so low -- a two-bedroom apartment in Bevo rents for roughly $400 a month, and $50,000 buys a decent house -- that the area soon attracted fellow Bosnians who had first landed in other places. **********''St. Louis is seen as a cheap place to live,'' noted Jasna Mruckovski, a refugee from Banja Luka, the Bosnian Serb capital, who arrived in St. Louis in 1994. ''People come from California, Chicago and Florida, where it's more expensive. Bosnians don't care if they start by buying the smallest, ugliest house. At least they feel they have something.'' **********Ms. Mruckovski (pronounced muh-ruh-KOV-ski), 25, should know. By day a translator in Southern Commercial's Bevo branch, she moonlights as a real estate agent and has helped sell 33 homes in the area over the last year, all but one to Bosnian buyers. In many cases, she said, whole families including children pooled wages to buy those homes. **********THE willingness of Bosnian immigrants to work hard at two or even three jobs is becoming legendary among local employers. With unemployment in the region only slightly over 3 percent, opportunities abound. At Willert Home Products, a local maker of mothballs and potpourri, a third of the 320 employees are immigrants. **********''You want to find employees with a good work ethic, and the refugees are about the best,'' said W. D. Willert, president of the company. ''We now have 12 nationalities here, and when we need more workers we know the Bosnians will call their cousins.'' **********Almost no immigrants in the St. Louis area are on welfare. Of the estimated 17,000 families receiving benefits through Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the largest welfare program, just 40 are foreign-born, according to Ms. Crosslin. **********Like many other immigrant groups before them, the Bosnians will probably have an increasing impact on their new home as business owners. Bosnian immigrants have already started a trucking company and dozens of Bosnian restaurants, shops and grocery stores, Mr. Hrdlicka, the banker, said. **********One of these new entrepreneurs is Alem Boric, 27, who came here from Sarajevo in 1995. He started as a laborer, first at a pipe company and later at a battery maker. Using his savings, he opened Europa Market last year, selling mainly Balkan specialties to local customers. But Mr. Boric (pronounced BOW-rick), who owned a casino in Sarajevo and left only when Bosnian Serbs began shelling the city, has bigger plans: video distribution and wholesaling. **********''This is a great place to start a business, because it's cheap and there's a lot of opportunity,'' he said. ''St. Louis is also going to be a great place to make a lot of money.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/01/business/prices-of-gasoline-steady.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-09-01", "snippet": "Energy Department survey shows regular gasoline prices averaged $1.233 a gallon last week, little changed from week earlier; says average price for regular self-serve gasoline fell 0.1 cent from week before (S)", "word_count": 73, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Prices of Gasoline Steady", "print_headline": "Prices of Gasoline Steady", "body_text": " **********Regular gasoline prices averaged $1.233 a gallon last week at the pump, little changed from a week earlier, as the busy summer driving season winds down, a Government survey showed.

Pervez Musharraf, refused today to be pinned down on when he would restore democracy as he faced more than an hour of questions at his first news conference since he seized power in a coup three weeks ago. **********Though he fielded questions with the ease and finesse of an old political pro, the general left no doubt that he was running Pakistan, a nuclear power with a population of 150 million, and that he alone would decide when the people would be allowed to pick their own leaders again. **********Will the return to democracy be achieved through elections or a revival of Parliament, he was asked. ''Frankly, I haven't decided,'' he replied. **********Will he allow voters to register their support or disapproval of the coup in a referendum? I'll talk it over with my council of advisers, he said. **********Is it possible that he will stay in power for a decade or more? General Musharraf ducked the question, saying only that he was determined to revive the country's economy, wipe out public corruption and disentangle the bureaucracy from politics before stepping aside -- an agenda that some political analysts say will take years, if not a lifetime. **********''I will go according to the needs and requirements of Pakistan,'' he said. ''That will be supreme in my mind, and not international demands.'' **********He said the new leadership would set up a National Accountability Bureau to go after corruption, starting from the top down. ''N-A-B,'' he said, spelling out the new agency's initials. ''We will nab everyone.'' **********General Musharraf has already indicated that Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister who was toppled on Oct. 12 when he tried to fire the general, was at the top of the list of high-level officials to be prosecuted on corruption charges. Mr. Sharif has been under house arrest at an undisclosed location since the coup. **********General Musharraf also suggested that Mr. Sharif may be charged with conspiring to destabilize the armed forces -- a crime of high treason in Pakistan. Whatever the charges, the general said today, Mr. Sharif will have a chance to tell his side of the story at his trial. **********Perhaps more remarkable than any of the specific statements was the general's obvious relish for the spotlight on a set in the state-run television studio. **********With more than a hundred reporters shouting sometimes difficult questions at him, he displayed an ability to evade unwanted queries, offering quotable maxims as substance and occasionally giving off a flash of steely, soldierly resolve. He spoke in a fluid mix of English and Urdu, often starting a sentence in one language and ending it in the other. **********On Pakistan's relations with its bigger neighbor and archrival, India, General Musharraf diplomatically insisted that he wanted peaceful coexistence, but also said the countries' rancorous dispute over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir -- a conflict that flared violently this summer -- was still the paramount issue for him. **********He warned India: ''Hostility will be met with hostility. Peace will be met with peace. I will defend the honor of this country. No one threatens us without getting a threatening response.'' **********The general also made clear that he had no intention of spending any of his own political capital to sign the nuclear test ban treaty that American diplomats had been pressing for but that the United States Senate recently rejected. **********He said he would encourage a national debate, but described the treaty as a contentious issue that could stir up anti-government feeling. **********''For me to get involved in the C.T.B.T. would be unfair,'' he said of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. ''I would not want to do that.'' **********The general reserved his most scathing, wry comments for Mr. Sharif. The prime minister had announced that he was firing General Musharraf as the army chief of staff while the general was flying back to Pakistan from Sri Lanka, and the coup was well under way by the time he landed. **********General Musharraf said the armed forces' ''spontaneous'' decision to move against the prime minister had not set a precedent that could be used to justify a military takeover whenever a civilian leader tried to fundamentally change the armed forces. **********The Constitution, he said, did not give the prime minister ''a right to remove a chief as if he is a peon outside his office.'' Of Mr. Sharif's decision to hire General Musharraf a year earlier, the general remarked with an amused smile, ''He may be repenting now.'' **********After answering questions for more than an hour without so much as a sip of water, the general told the reporters that they were welcome to keep firing more at him -- but with deadlines rushing in, Pakistani reporters called it quits. **********He concluded by asking them, in Urdu, to deliver this message: Tell the poor we will always stand by them. Tell the rich: ''Stop bleeding this country. Stop your corruption.'' **********''It is time for us to come together to rebuild Pakistan,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/business/company-briefs-666335.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********FEDERAL REALTY INVESTMENT TRUST,  Rockville, Md., and Regency Realty Corp., Jacksonville, Fla., said they had ended talks on the sale of Federal's strip shopping center properties after being unable to agree on a price. **********S3 INC.,  Santa Clara, Calif., a designer of fast graphics software for PC's, said shareholders had approved the acquisition of Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., a maker of multimedia and connectivity products for PC's, for about $165 million in stock. **********GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.,  said it had eliminated about 60 jobs in its jet engine production operation in suburban Cincinnati and expected more cuts because of a slowdown in new orders and high costs. **********UNOCAL CORP.,  El Segundo, Calif., said it would revamp its West Coast fertilizer business as a separate company, Prodica L.L.C., to make it easier to sell, allowing Unocal to focus on finding and producing oil and gas."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/23/world/berlin-journal-an-american-jew-tries-to-knit-past-and-future.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Cohen", "pub_date": "1999-01-23", "snippet": "W Michael Blumenthal, director of new Jewish Museum in Berlin, says he wants museum to offer compelling narrative of rich Jewish presence in Germany that was shattered by Hitler; Blumenthal, former United States Secretary of Treasury, has come ful...", "word_count": 1306, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Berlin Journal; An American Jew Tries To Knit Past and Future", "print_headline": "Berlin Journal; An American Jew Tries To Knit Past and Future", "body_text": " **********W. Michael Blumenthal has a room with a typically disjointed Berlin view. In the foreground, the gracious 18th-century dome of the German Cathedral, the work of an imperial power that ended badly. In the background, a maze of cranes, symbols of this city's latest stab at inventing a glorious future. **********Past and future are everywhere in this town, where museums and vast construction sites abut each other awkwardly, but few people bear as onerous a responsibility in trying to reconcile them as this 73-year-old American whose life has come full circle to place him back in the city from which Hitler drove him. **********Mr. Blumenthal accepted a symbolic key to Berlin's new Jewish Museum from a city official today in a ceremony marking the building's completion. Designed by the American architect Daniel Libeskind, the museum amounts to an architectural sculpture whose disorienting form and towering empty spaces capture the vertiginous pinnacles and voids of Jewish life in Germany and of Berlin itself. **********The difficult task of filling this building in a way that tells the story of the 2,000-year Jewish presence in Germany now falls to Mr. Blumenthal, the museum's director. He was a Secretary of the Treasury under President Carter and is a retired chief executive of the computer company Unisys, but his qualifications for this arduous esthetic undertaking are by no means self evident. **********But in Mr. Blumenthal, many of the tensions that this city and its new museum must struggle to resolve exist. In this sense, he is a natural occupant of a building where it is very hard to draw a straight line from one point to another. **********Mr. Blumenthal's internal grappling -- memories of a sunny early childhood in Berlin, the Nazi cataclysm that took many relatives, success in his adopted American home and an unexpected desire to return and resolve some unfinished business -- is merely one version of the many dislocated stories that make it so difficult for Berliners to link past and future. **********''People here often say to me, 'You are really a Berliner,' and of course I could be German if I wanted,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''But I feel very strongly about the United States, which has been very good to me over 50 years, and I'd like to borrow my adopted country's message of building bridges.'' **********He smiled, a disarmingly open smile that breaks into a hard face and gruff manner with unexpected warmth. ''What really concerns me is whether remembrance can be brought to the point where there is harmony, or at least understanding, or will each side, Germans and Jews, remember in a way that brings resentments?'' **********More than 50 years after the collapse of Hitler's Reich, long after the former Chancellor Willy Brandt's moving genuflection in the Warsaw ghetto, in the wake of countless other official and personal German acts of contrition and remembrance, it may seem pretentious to talk yet again of the shaping of memory. **********But as Mr. Blumenthal has discovered, the theme is inescapable in today's Berlin. The cold war, Germany's division until 1990 and the lingering shame of Hitler's generation combined to produce areas of silence that the abrupt rebirth of Berlin as capital has shattered. **********In the immense tracts of land where the Berlin wall once stood and a new city is being born, in the former buildings of Hitler's Reich now set to become federal ministries once again, the question is endlessly posed by the silhouetted cranes: How should the past be remembered in a way that secures and solidifies the future? **********The question is there for former East Germans abruptly released from the confines of Communism into a Western world that has sometimes been less than welcoming, just as it is there for this Jewish American businessman who fled Berlin in 1939, who passed the war years in Shanghai and who arrived penniless in the United States in 1947. **********''Everything that was swept under the carpet is now coming out in the form of endless questioning by the Jews and also by the Germans,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''The stolen art. The stolen money. The forced labor. It is very hard, very tortured, sometimes very bitter, and perhaps we will need to wait a further generation for more sober reflection. **********''But meanwhile, we want to show what Germany lost.'' **********Mr. Blumenthal is working closely with Shaike Weinberg, the first director of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, on what he hopes will be a compelling narrative of the rich Jewish presence in Germany that was shattered by Hitler. The intention is not to show a host of Jewish artifacts, however splendid, but to tell a story. **********The last Jewish Museum in Berlin was opened on Jan. 24, 1933, just six days before Hitler came to power. It did not survive long. Since then, the German view of Jews, who now number about 80,000 in Germany, compared with a prewar total of 500,000, has inevitably come to be filtered through the overwhelming prism of the Holocaust. **********''I do not want young Germans to view Jews solely as victims,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''I want to show that their own history was linked to a flowering Jewish intellectual, professional and cultural presence for many years. I want to insure that Jews are seen as what they once were here: citizens.'' **********In this task, the museum director faces an obvious danger: The building -- fractured, destabilizing, troubling -- may overwhelm any exhibit with the force of a message that is in many ways dark. Another danger, now looming, is that Mr. Blumenthal may be overwhelmed by the sheer scale of what he has taken on. **********At the same time as the Jewish Museum develops -- it will be open to the public from next month but will not contain any exhibits until the end of next year -- another enormous project about remembrance is supposed to take form. This is the Holocaust Memorial, next to the Brandenburg Gate, and under proposals made this month, Mr. Blumenthal would oversee this project too. **********For him, the distinction between the museum and the memorial is clear. The former will tell a history of the Jews; the latter -- a vast field of stones, a 65-foot-high wall of books and a research center -- will be a place of remembrance and reflection. **********But already the Mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen, has objected, saying the latest plans for the memorial ''raise more questions than they answer.'' A prominent Christian Democratic politician, Uwe Lehmann-Brauns, said today that a new design for the memorial by the New York architect Peter Eisenman was ''repulsively functional.'' And some newspapers have begun to ask why the Jewish Museum and the proposed Holocaust Memorial are both designed and run by Americans. **********''The challenge is enormous,'' Mr. Blumenthal conceded. ''The German thirst to be 'normal' again is strong. I often hear from Germans that enough is enough and, in some ways, I understand. But the enormity of what happened demands that, even at this late hour, we find the right symbols of remembrance.'' **********His apartment with the view of the dome and the cranes occupies the place where a legendary 18th-century Berlin woman, Rahel Levin, held a literary salon attended by Goethe.

Warner, a Virginia Republican who has criticized the deal, which would put 80 percent of the Navy's shipbuilding capacity in the merged company, said over the weekend that the ''case against it is growing stronger every day.'' Senator Warner declined to comment further yesterday, although the stock of Newport News fell $3.0625 a share, or almost 10 percent, to $27.6875, a sign that Wall Street had lowered its expectation that the takeover would be approved. **********Mr. Warner's weekend statement was taken seriously in a community that was already skeptical of a proposal that would leave the nation with only one supplier of nuclear-powered submarines and put four of the six military shipyards in the ownership of one company. Not only is Senator Warner chairman of the committee that reviews all Pentagon spending, but he is also considered to be close to the Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen, formerly a Republican Senator from Maine, from the days when they served on the Senate committee together. **********''This deal may still have some life in it,'' said Charles A. Gabriel Jr., a Washington analyst for Prudential Securities. ''But certainly, there's a lot less room for optimism because Warner is the committee's chairman, and the fact that this emanated from his office shows he is still resistant to the marriage. Moreover, his pipeline to Cohen should be good. When Cohen was a senator, he and Warner dominated the location of shipbuilding resources.'' **********Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said yesterday that ''we're getting close, we're talking days away'' to a Pentagon announcement on the merger. ''We haven't made a final decision; the review and analysis continues,'' Mr. Flood added. A spokeswoman for Newport News said the company had not received any indication from the Pentagon of the deal's fate, and a spokeswoman for General Dynamics said the same thing. **********When it was announced last February, the General Dynamics bid stunned the military industry because of an evolving Pentagon policy discouraging such huge consolidations and because it complicated an existing friendly merger that had been announced between Newport News and Avondale Industries of New Orleans, a maker of amphibious transports, assault ships and cargo vessels for the Navy. Within days of General Dynamics' hostile bid, the Pentagon approved Newport News's $519 million takeover of Avondale. **********But the Newport News-Avondale deal, which would have created a merged company that could compete better with General Dynamics than either shipbuilder alone, has been put on hold while the Pentagon reviews the General Dynamics offer. If the General Dynamics deal is approved, Avondale would be left operating on its own. Avondale's stock rose $2.125 a share yesterday, to $31.375. **********Thomas M. Kitchen, Avondale's chief financial officer, said yesterday that his company had not heard anything yet from the Pentagon, but, if the Newport News-Avondale deal cleared Washington hurdles, it could close sometime this quarter. **********In Virginia, the home state of Newport News, members of the Congressional delegation have lined up against the General Dynamics takeover. Senator Warner and Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, wrote a joint letter to Mr. Cohen saying that ''the proposed merger is a matter of great concern to us,'' citing national security issues. Representative Herbert H. Bateman, a Virginia Republican, sent a similar letter to Mr. Cohen expressing ''staunch opposition'' to General Dynamics' bid and similar letters were written by three other Virginia representatives. **********There has been much speculation as to why General Dynamics would make such a long-shot hostile offer in an industry in which most mergers are transacted on a friendly basis. But one military industry consultant said that General Dynamics had little choice in the timing because it had to make its move before the Newport News-Avondale deal was completed. ''I don't think General Dynamics ever thought this was an easy thing to do,'' the consultant said.

It is part of a broader 18-month examination by the Justice Department's antitrust division of the steps that may have been taken by major airlines, including Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and United, a unit of UAL, to discourage lower-priced competition in cities they dominate. **********Following deregulation in 1978, the largest airlines have moved to strengthen their control of major metropolitan airports. While airlines have on occasion sued each other on antitrust grounds, the Government has rarely intervened beyond threats of fines from the Department of Transportation. **********But a growing chorus of consumer complaints about rising fares and declining service has led to a strong backlash against the industry in Congress, where lawmakers have introduced measures to force the airlines to disclose more about fares and delays, and offer compensation for inconveniences. In addition, the Transportation Department last year proposed punishing airlines that tried to stifle competition. **********Senior officials at the Justice Department said the American case was particularly compelling because company documents showed that American, the nation's second-largest airline, had deliberately embarked on a strategy of selling tickets below cost and incurring significant short-term financial losses in recent years to drive out three low-cost competitors -- Vanguard Airlines, Sun Jet International and Western Pacific -- from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. **********Executives and lawyers at American said the airline had not violated any antitrust laws but simply matched the fares of its competitors. **********In 1998, American flew 70 percent of the scheduled seats out of Dallas-Fort Worth, up from 60 percent in 1991. The Government presented evidence showing that after Vanguard announced in September 1996 that it was adding service to Dallas-Fort Worth from three cities in addition to Wichita, Kan., American responded by cutting prices and adding flights on nearly all of Vanguard's Dallas routes. Two months later, Vanguard abandoned its expansion plans. By June 1997, American had reduced capacity between Wichita and Dallas by 30 percent and raised the average one-way fare by more than 50 percent to more than $90 from about $60. **********''American quickly realized that these new carriers could be a significant competitive threat, estimating that as much as a billion and a half dollars of its annual revenues were at risk if they were to succeed,'' said Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division. ''To make sure that this didn't happen, American adopted a predatory responsive strategy, saturating the market in which the start-up carriers had begun service with as much new, low-fare service of its own as was necessary to drive out the start-ups.'' **********Attorney General Janet Reno said American ''invested in short-term capacity increases and fare reductions to maintain its monopoly -- an investment it was able to recover many times over once its smaller rivals had been driven away.'' **********American Airlines disputed the accusations by the Justice Department that it had priced its fares below cost or flooded the market with flights, and said the lawsuit was little more than sour grapes by smaller airlines, which, unable to compete, had persuaded regulators to bring the case. **********''Contrary to the Justice Department's lawsuit, this action today is very potentially anti-consumer,'' said Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the AMR Corporation, the parent company of American. ''It would have a chilling effect on the marketplace if companies felt they could not match prices of competitors. We simply matched the competition.'' **********The Justice Department complaint, filed in Federal court in Wichita, seeks an injunction barring American from cutting prices below cost and increasing flights as part of any effort to stifle competition. The case is being brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. **********Justice Department officials said Federal antitrust law does not permit them to seek any fines or monetary awards, but that smaller airlines that were harmed by American's conduct could file their own civil antitrust lawsuits for money. **********The complaint quoted from company papers describing its ''Dallas-Ft. Worth Low Cost Carriers Strategy.'' The Government said the strategy recognized that ''it could prove unprofitable in the short run.'' But, according to a company document, the strategy concluded: ''The short-term cost, or impact on revenue can be viewed as the investment necessary to achieve the desired effect on market share.'' **********The Government also quoted from internal American papers that suggested that the carrier intended to add flights to Kansas City to drive Vanguard from the market and that American decided to get Western Pacific out of the Dallas-Colorado Springs route before Western Pacific increased its service there. **********Company executives declined to answer questions about the American Airlines documents that the Government has called incriminating but defended them in general terms. **********''There is nothing wrong or illegal with tough talk about competition,'' Mr. Chiames said. **********Trey Nicoud, a senior lawyer at American, said, ''Looking at aggressive conversations in board rooms is very misleading.'' **********To win against any airline, the Government's evidence would need to be strong because predatory pricing cases are difficult to prove. But Justice Department lawyers have argued that it is relatively easy for a large airline to profit after undercutting a rival and driving it out of a market. In the past, the Government has distinguished between legitimate competition and predatory pricing when an airline cut its fares below its costs and added capacity in a strategy that only made economic sense if the smaller rival were forced to leave the market. **********Executives from the smaller rivals portrayed as victims by the Government praised the lawsuit. Of the three, Vanguard has since returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth market, Sun Jet no longer serves that airport, and Western Pacific has filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors and stopped flying in early 1998."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/22/business/business-digest-552046.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-11-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 572, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST", "body_text": " **********Class-Action Suit Based On Microsoft Antitrust Case **********Lawyers say they will file a class-action suit today against Microsoft on behalf of millions of Californians in the first of what could become a flood of lawsuits springing from the antitrust case against the company. **********The suit will accuse Microsoft of using its monopoly in operating systems software to overcharge buyers of Windows 95 and Windows 98.

But the Fed's warning about its possible next move -- in the form of a formal tilt toward a tighter monetary policy -- nonetheless jolted Wall Street and suggested that financial markets would remain jittery in coming weeks in anticipation of new data about the momentum of the economy. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been up over 100 points just before the Fed's announcement, plummeted immediately and was down around 125 points before rebounding.

''Nonetheless, the growth of demand has continued to outpace that of supply, as evidenced by a decreasing pool of available workers willing to take jobs.'' **********Under those circumstances, the committee said, the Fed ''will need to be especially alert in the months ahead to the potential for costs to increase significantly in excess of productivity in a manner that could contribute to inflation pressures.'' **********The committee said its adoption of a bias toward raising rates in the future ''did not signify a commitment to near-term action'' and that it would study economic data and the state of the financial markets in coming weeks before making a decision. **********After long keeping decisions to adopt a policy bias a secret, the Fed has been disclosing them immediately after each meeting since earlier this year, prompting considerable confusion in the markets as to whether a bias is all but a promise of a change in policy or just an alert. **********In this case, analysts said that if economic reports in coming weeks showed a decline in unemployment, an increase in wages exceeding productivity increases or signs of continuing robust demand in key sectors like housing, the Fed could push rates up as soon as its next meeting on Nov. 16. **********The Fed has already pushed its benchmark Federal funds target rate up twice this year in quarter- point steps, to 5.25 percent. Its more symbolic discount rate stands at 4.75 percent. **********Fed officials are likely to pay particular attention to the employment report for September, which will be released on Friday, and the report for October, which will be released on Nov. 5. **********''The implication is that if the numbers continue the way they have been recently and the stock market doesn't do anything dramatic, then the Fed will probably tighten again in November,'' said James F.

You are responsible for the fact that we are paying an annual interest burden of 82 billion marks'' -- $45 billion. **********It was a speech full of theatrical gestures and crescendos, a far cry from the normally inhibited style of the Chancellor, and it brought thunderous applause from most of the Social Democrats in the Reichstag. But whether the speech could reverse the plunge in Mr. Schroder's support in the country was far from clear. **********As the Chancellor spoke, tensions that surfaced from the electoral defeats were underscored when Rudolf Scharping, the Defense Minister, said reports that he had an eye on Mr. Schroder's job were baseless. **********The conservative daily Die Welt ran a front-page article today saying Mr. Schroder had been angered by Mr. Scharping's clear ambitions and by his support of soldiers who have been demonstrating against the military cuts that form part of the proposed austerity program. **********The report, not the first to suggest that the Defense Minister sees himself as a possible replacement for Mr. Schroder, said the Chancellor had decided to ''get rid'' of Mr. Scharping, as he disposed of Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine earlier. **********Mr. Scharping responded in a statement saying: ''My position is clear and dependable. Part of this clarity and dependability is that I support the Chancellor.'' But the minister is known to have rejected an offer earlier this year to become NATO Secretary General, in part because he sees opportunities at home. **********Mr. Schroder has been attacked by the Christian Democrats, unions and members of his own party for proposing to slash ministerial budgets by an average of 7 percent, to freeze pensions in real terms until 2001 and to hold down welfare payments. But he now seems determined to push for a less state-dependent economy. **********''Naturally, it pains me when friends from labor unions criticize me harshly,'' Mr. Schroder said. ''But even with close friends, the public good must sometimes take precedence over individual interests.'' **********The words reflected the Chancellor's clear decision that he must project the image of the responsible statesman after a year of policy zig-zags. He described the recent electoral defeats as ''very painful'', but said they would not deter him. **********Part of the country's vast debt, as most Germans are aware, stems from the enormous cost of unification, which any German government would have been obliged to pay, at least in some measure. **********But the budget crisis has also been fueled by Germany's failure to follow countries like the Netherlands and Sweden in reforming its social security system and rigid labor market. High unemployment -- still affecting over four million people and over 10 percent of the workforce -- has become a chronic scourge. **********Wolfgang Schauble, the leader of the Christian Democrats, rejected suggestions that his party should be blamed for the economic difficulties, describing Mr. Schroder's first year in office as ''a lost year, and not only for the unemployed in Germany.'' **********He went on: ''You reduce allocations for research, education and investment and you call that a program for the future? Savings are necessary -- that is unquestionable. But you have chosen the wrong way. You divide and destabilize and the result is stagnation and resignation, instead of courage to face the future.'' **********In truth, both politicians appeared to have a point: Helmut Kohl was no prince of fiscal rectitude, and Mr. Schroder's first year in office seems to have been largely squandered. As a result, the long-debated shift toward a more entrepreneurial, nimbler German economy has never occurred. **********Whether Mr. Schroder has the personal strength and party support to make such changes is unclear. What seems certain is that he will face more election pain in Saxony and Berlin in the next few weeks -- as well as criticisms from Mr. Lafontaine in a potentially explosive book to be published next month -- before any eventual revival of his fortunes."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/30/business/martha-stewart-selling-stake-in-her-company.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1999-07-30", "snippet": "Martha Stewart will sell $100 million in stock in her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc; company will issue class A shares; Stewart will own all controlling Class B shares; company, which had $180 million in revenues in 1998, reported n...", "word_count": 499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Martha Stewart Selling Stake in Her Company", "print_headline": "Martha Stewart Selling Stake in Her Company", "body_text": " **********For those who wish they could be Martha Stewart, now at least they can own a piece of her company. **********Ms. Stewart, the doyenne of domestic details, plans to sell $100 million in stock in her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., according to documents filed yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Investors will be able to buy stock in a company dominated by the monthly homemaking bible, Martha Stewart Living, but whose television, merchandising and Internet businesses are growing robustly. **********But even as Ms. Stewart sells a stake in her company, she is retaining control of an empire that had $180 million in revenue last year, slightly more than twice the sales it had two years earlier.

''It didn't make sense,'' said Kiyotaka Sasaki, who is in charge of inspections of international financial institutions at the Financial Supervisory Agency, Japan's financial watchdog. ''It showed a lack of controls.'' **********That question ultimately led to the arrest in the United States on Monday of Martin A. Armstrong, a show-boating investment manager who was well known among Japanese corporate investors for his persuasive sales pitches. **********Mr. Armstrong, 49, has been accused by United States prosecutors of defrauding Japanese investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. Two Republic New York Securities officials, William H. Rogers, the futures trading head, and James Sweeney, the unit's chief executive, have been suspended. **********Through his lawyer, Mr. Armstrong has denied any wrongdoing. **********But the sleuthing that uncovered the purported fraud is likely to help burnish the reputation of Japan's fledgling financial regulators, who began operations a little more than a year ago and have struggled under severe financial and personnel constraints, considering the size and complexity of the markets and institutions they must police. **********''We've had some concern about morale here,'' Mr. Sasaki said. ''We have few resources and lots of challenges.'' **********Mr. Armstrong's arrest is the second ''scalp'' the inspection department has collected this summer, coming roughly two months after regulators revoked the license of Credit Suisse First Boston's derivatives unit and imposed sanctions on the Swiss firm's other operations here for their role in helping Japanese corporations and financial institutions mask their huge losses. **********Indeed, what many have assumed was dumb luck on the part of the investigators from the Financial Supervisory Agency was at least in part a matter of weaving together bits of information gleaned in previous forays into the operations of other financial institutions. **********The investigators used information they uncovered during their audit of Credit Suisse First Boston and decided to take a look at Cresvale. They suspected that the brokerage firm, which was owned by Mr. Armstrong's Princeton Economics International Ltd., had sold similar financial instruments. **********What they found were a group of notes, known collectively as the Princeton notes, issued by an offshore investment company based in the Turks and Caicos Islands that did not fall under the purview of any financial regulator. The proceeds from the sale of those notes and the interest they generated were supposedly held in segregated accounts at Republic New York Securities, but the Japanese regulators suspected that accounts were in fact commingled to mask losses. **********Their suspicions no doubt were a result of the environment in which most of them grew up: the old, vague, opaque regulatory system administered by bureaucrats at the Ministry of Finance who were particularly sensitive to the strict maintenance of ''firewalls'' and boundaries between financial businesses. **********Indeed, the companies that were purportedly defrauded by Mr. Armstrong largely seemed to be in the dark until last week, when newspapers here began reporting that the agency had contacted United States regulators with questions about Princeton that ultimately led to Mr. Armstrong's arrest. **********Junsei Atarashi, a spokesman for the Yakult Honsha Company, which stands to lose several billion yen from its investment in Princeton notes, said Yakult scrambling to collect information in May, after news broke of the investigation into Cresvale. ''The people in charge of investments here bought these notes because they earned a good interest rate,'' he said. ''We never imagined they were going to become trash.'' **********The Amada Company and two of its affiliates could lose a total of 13 billion yen, or $125 million at current exchange rates. ''We received an explanation at the time we bought these notes that the principal was secured and the accounts were separately maintained by Republic,'' said Koshichi Kikuchi, Amada's head of accounting. ''Now we are finding out that the accounts were not separately maintained and the principal was not secured, so I can't avoid saying that we were cheated.'' **********It was the 10 percent return that Amada had made on a previous investment in Princeton notes that enticed it into buying another set of notes this spring, Mr. Kikuchi said. Mr. Kikuchi and other company officials denied that notes were purchased to hide losses, but regulators suspect otherwise and the Japanese Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a separate investigation into corporations that have purchased Princeton notes. **********Far from feeling sorry for the investors, many Japanese regard them as foolish, and in fact, Mr. Armstrong apparently did not try to sell Princeton notes to investors in any other country.

They will provide the full spectrum of financial products and services under one roof, or in the case of Citigroup, under one red umbrella. **********But once companies pay huge sums to acquire the heft needed to remain competitive in a global market, they will face the challenge of making those acquisitions pay off by selling more products and more types of products to their growing lists of customers, and they will do so in a market that is being redefined by the Internet. **********So far, the track record of cross-selling financial services is spotty, at best, and the growth of the Internet adds to the challenge, as new competitors spring up all over the World Wide Web, offering bargain prices. **********Some are well-disguised units of traditional players, like Wingspanbank.com, an online bank created by the Bank One Corporation. Bank One's management has taken pains to hide the connection, hoping to lure customers with higher rates on certificates of deposit without cannibalizing the bank's existing business. That strategy is not a proven winner yet, but online banking is just starting to catch on and analysts expect its use to increase rapidly as more online banks appear and customers of traditional banks switch over to the Internet. **********Widespread acceptance of the Internet as a medium for researching and shopping for financial services has complicated efforts to cross-sell. Consumers no longer need to rely on banks and brokers for information about financial services and prices. **********Insurance companies have succeeded at cross-selling different types of insurance by offering package deals, like selling auto insurance at attractive rates to customers who also buy a homeowner's policy. Citigroup and Merrill also claim to have had success in selling home loans to customers of their brokerage units. But, over all, there is no convincing evidence that people want to keep all their assets in one place or to buy a wide variety of financial products from a single source. **********''A lot of these big deals will fail ultimately because they're not generating the top-line growth,'' said Peter Davis, a financial services consultant with Cambridge Group in Manhattan. **********''They have to start cross-selling, and that cross-selling has to occur around an understanding of their customers. Cold calls and statement stuffers won't cut it.'' **********For examples, Mr. Davis pointed to the comparative records of banks that are the products of one or more mergers and those that are not. Both types of banks, he said, sell about 2.1 products, like certificates of deposit, per customer. ''There really is no difference in performance,'' he said. **********Once a merged organization cuts out overlapping costs, the only way to make a merger pay off is to increase revenue. So inevitably conglomerates will seek to do so by trying to get their customers to buy more from them or invest more with them. **********The problem is that consumers have easy access to lots of information -- some would say, too much -- about purveyors of financial services, their prices and offerings. In the future, they will be more likely to shop around, mostly online, before buying investing or borrowing money and will be less susceptible to unsolicited sales pitches of any kind. **********Wall Street is already adapting to the new times. Merrill Lynch; Salomon Smith Barney; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and other big brokerage firms are turning their sales forces away from stock promotion and toward money management. Most firms are concentrating their sales efforts on omnibus accounts that charge an annual fee based on an account's assets, instead of on the number of transactions executed. **********In theory, the rise of the fee-based brokerage account will allow the brokers to focus their attention on finding new clients and providing them with advice about how to meet their financial goals. The switch should also make the earnings of brokerage firms more predictable and make their stocks more attractive to investors. **********''The traditional broker, we think, is a thing of the past,'' said Ruediger Adolf, senior vice president at the American Express Company. ''The way you can add value, in our belief, is through understanding the goals of an individual customer in a holistic way and developing strategies of how they can get there.'' **********American Express and other financial services companies have accepted that a significant number of investors, not just young people with relatively few assets, want to handle at least some of their financial dealings themselves. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and others have introduced online trading services, with commissions as low as $29.95, to appeal to those people. **********That is the same basic price that Charles Schwab charges, but considerably higher than E*trade's low rate of $9.95. American Express undercut them all when it recently started offering free stock trades to customers with big account balances. **********Analysts see those moves as an acknowledgment that the execution of stock trades, once a core offering on Wall Street, is fast becoming a commodity. In essence, brokerage firms are saying, ''Let us manage your money for a fee, and we'll throw in the stock and bond trades.'' **********Forrester Research predicts that after the price war that is raging among dozens of online brokerage firms, about 75 percent of them will either be acquired or fail within five years. Now that the most aggressive traders have migrated to the Internet, online brokerage firms are all expected to suffer a significant decline in growth, although overall growth of online financial services will accelerate, Forrester predicts. **********Mr. Davis says the execution of simple stock trades is just one of many financial services that can be carried out electronically and yield only slim profits; others are basic term life insurance and the brokering of standard home mortgages. Consequently, he said, the livelihoods of thousands of people who now sell those services are threatened by the Internet. **********''Most existing players in personal financial services won't be successful online,'' Mr. Davis said, citing their expensive networks of offices and salespeople. **********Brokerage firms have taken to the Internet largely as a defensive measure. They found they were losing too much of their customers' money to firms that offered electronic trading, such as Charles Schwab, E*trade and Fidelity Investments. John L. Steffens, a Merrill Lynch vice chairman, told Merrill brokers recently that customers had moved $9 billion to eight leading online brokers. **********''The big thing becomes choice,'' Mr. Kenney, of Merrill, said. ''What had heretofore been a bundled product until Schwab came along is going to be unbundled and offered in multiple forms.'' **********Mr. Kenney said that wealthy people would continue to demand the personal attention of an adviser, or team of advisers, but they would expect many transactions, such as the paying of monthly bills, to be handled automatically. In exchange for a fee that amounts to a slim percentage of the assets they keep at the firm, they will expect sound advice and guidance delivered electronically, over the telephone and, occasionally, in person, he said. **********Other customers will purchase one or more of the firm's services a la carte, paying only for research on certain industries or advice on how to allocate their assets. But firms will offer the best value to people who keep at least $100,000 in a fee-based account. **********''That is the cutoff everybody is using, and they're not raising the amount,'' Mr. Kenney said. ''Five years from now, it's still going to be $100,000. For a middle-class income plus some assets, there's going to be an extraordinary amount of services available from the best firms for a reasonable amount.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/27/business/world-business-briefing-americas-internet-access-expanded.html": {"writer_name": "Simon Romero", "pub_date": "1999-11-27", "snippet": "Brazil's government will allow pay-television companies to provide Internet access; authorization is likely to shake up Brazil's fast-growing Internet industry (S)", "word_count": 64, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNET ACCESS EXPANDED", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: AMERICAS; INTERNET ACCESS EXPANDED", "body_text": " **********In a move that advances the plans of companies like the Microsoft Corporation and Organizacaoes Globo, Brazil's government will allow pay-television providers to provide Internet access.

Investors have dumped bonds over the last four months, and Japanese politicians have been watching with trepidation as the yields on long-term Japanese bonds have tripled, threatening to snuff out any early recovery from the worst recession since the end of World War II. **********The Government's move today failed to quell general concerns over the bond market and rising long-term interest rates. **********''It's a token gesture in the face of political demand,'' said William D. Campbell, fixed-income analyst at J. P. Morgan here. ''But we don't see much impact on the economy.'' **********Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond settled slightly lower today, falling 15 basis points, or hundredths of a point, to 1.99 percent. **********The yen noticeably weakened, partly on remarks by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa that an agency that manages public pension funds would buy bonds. And the influential Vice Finance Minister Eisuke Sakakibara seemed to reverse position when he said late Monday that he would support a weaker yen. Mr. Miyazawa also endorsed a weaker yen, which touched 117.50 to the dollar at one point here today. The yen declined further in New York trading, settling at 118.74 to the dollar, a sharp fall in value from 114.21 on Friday. **********Although Japanese interest rates are very low by world standards, their recent rise makes borrowing more expensive at home, further depressing an already feeble economy. Rates shot up last fall when Mr. Miyazawa said the Government would stop using the pension management agency to buy bonds. In December and in February, investors dumped bonds -- sending their prices down and their yields, which move in the opposite direction, soaring. **********Worries over interest rates have also affected the bond market in New York, sending their prices on Friday down sharply, though Treasuries reversed course and rose today. **********Higher rates in Japan could lure capital from United States Treasury debt, as Japanese investors see increasingly attractive returns at home and become skittish about taking risks that the yen will strengthen and reduce the value of their dollar-denominated investments. **********Some of that began happening last month as investors here sold bonds and other holdings in the United States and elsewhere to bring profits back to cover losses in preparation for settling books at the end of the fiscal year on March 31. One of American officials' worst nightmares is a selloff of United States Treasury bonds by cash-needy Japanese corporations. **********''Japan is a natural exporter of capital, and any hiccup in outflow can have a disruptive effect,'' said Jeffrey D. Young, economist at Salomon Smith Barney here. ''We see the U.S. Treasury yields rising and the yen strong.'' **********By some measures, Japan's bond market is set sometime this year to become the world's largest, surpassing that of the United States -- though much of that reflects the yen's strength. By most accounts, the United States bond market is still the largest, but the trend seems clear. Budget surpluses in Washington would reduce the amount of bonds the Treasury has to issue, while growing burdens in Japan mean several more years of money-raising and a swelling bond market. **********Today's move caught the markets off guard. When word leaked out early this morning of the impending announcement, buyers lined up before the bond market opened. But the buying spree was short-lived as investors learned that the purchases would last only until March and amount to 200 billion yen, or $1.7 billion, a month -- less than one-sixth of the Government's monthly purchases last year. **********Analysts said the move appeared aimed at appeasing financial institutions and companies sitting on huge bond losses that they will have to absorb at the end of the fiscal year. **********Japan's policy makers have grown increasingly worried about the nation's public finances. The budget deficit this year is rising to 10 percent of output, and its accumulated debt is expected to exceed the total size of the economy. As early as 2000, the Government will have to pay back a portion of postal savings deposits worth 100 trillion yen, now about $850 billion. Officials say that about half of those deposits will be renewed, leaving roughly $425 billion to be repaid in the first two years of the new century. **********To pay for all this, analysts say the Government has to turn to the bond markets to raise money, and the idea that Japan this year has to raise more than $500 billion has roiled the markets. Another way to raise money is to sell part of its current bond holdings, but that could roil the debt markets further. **********On Friday, the nation's central bank said it would bring the overnight lending rate down to a thread above zero. The bond markets did not settle down, however, and the Finance Ministry began to worry, analysts say. Some are calling the purchases a ''price-keeping operation,'' or P.K.O., an attempt to support the market with Government money. **********''We've entered the silly season,'' Mr. Campbell of J. P. Morgan said. ''It's a symbolic P.K.O. for February and March. What it really implies is a window-dressing operation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/29/technology/what-s-next-tracking-down-cell-phone-users.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Wayner", "pub_date": "1999-07-29", "snippet": "Federal Communications Commission has ordered cell phone industry to come up with way to track its customers so that 911 operators can know location of anyone calling on cell phone for help; scientists at Lucent Technology's Bell Labs have come up...", "word_count": 1079, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tracking Down Cell-Phone Users", "print_headline": "WHAT'S NEXT; Tracking Down Cell-Phone Users", "body_text": " **********ONE of the big challenges for the cell phone industry in the next two years will be the task of following its customers. The Federal Communications Commission says that by early 2001, all cell phone companies will have to provide 911 operators with the location of anyone calling on a cell phone so help can get to the right place. **********Several scientists at Lucent Technology's Bell Labs recently announced that they had come up with a way to reduce the cost of making this change. They said it would also let companies offer a wide variety of new features, like a switch that would allow users to protect their privacy by turning off the tracking. **********But whether the systems for tracking cell phones that are adopted will be an invasion of privacy is still an open question. And it is not yet clear how the ability to locate any phone in use quickly will be used. **********Until recently, there were essentially two strategies for locating cell phone users. One depends on every cell phone tower being able to estimate the distance of each phone from the tower. Information from several towers can be used to pinpoint a phone in use. For the other method, every handset needs to be able to determine its own location, using the Global Positioning System. **********The tower-based approach to locating callers works by timing the flow of signals between the towers and the handsets. It would require a heavy investment by the cell phone company and is accurate to only a few thousand feet. The method is made more difficult by the fact that a cell phone tries to minimize interference and maximize battery life by lowering its broadcast strength until the signal is just strong enough to reach one tower. But it has adherents  because it would require no change in the handsets and would work with older phones. A limited tower-based system is already in use. **********The other basic method would require that each new handset be programmed to find its own location using the Global Positioning System. In essence, the phone manufacturers would blend the G.P.S. receivers popular with backpackers into handsets. The position information from such handsets would be more accurate, to within 100 feet. **********Perhaps more important, the caller could use the G.P.S. information even when there was not an emergency. Backpackers, for example,  could use a cell phone to find their location and would not need to carry a separate G.P.S. receiver. That approach, however, would be more expensive, and it could be slower because G.P.S. receivers often take several minutes to determine a location. G.P.S. receivers also require a separate antenna to perform well, and that could add bulk to a phone. **********The new technology is a hybrid of both approaches. It would use an enhanced base station and a more sophisticated handset to solve many of the problems found with the other options. While the system would rely on G.P.S. signals to locate a handset, it would also use information transmitted from local cell towers. That information would let the handset calculate its location with greater precision and speed than it would be able to do with a G.P.S. receiver alone. **********Robert Richton, a member of the Bell Labs technical staff working on the project, explained that G.P.S. signals were usually difficult to decode, which was why it could take a handset with a G.P.S. receiver a minute or more to find its position. **********A G.P.S. satellite sends two signals mixed together, Mr. Richton said, a high-frequency signal and a slower stream of data. ''One of the problems for a stand-alone handset is separating out the two parts,'' Mr. Richton said. ''In our scheme, the network handles that for you.'' **********That is, the towers would constantly send to the handset information that would give the handset a basis for interpreting the satellite signal. The cell phone network, taking advantage of the fact that its towers never move, would be able to keep track of all the satellites continuously. That information would be distilled into a basic summary of what the signals from the satellites should look like. The handset would use that information to locate the signal and calculate the slight timing differences caused by changes in its location. That help would let the handset come up with its location in a matter of seconds instead of minutes. **********Giovanni Vannucci, another member of the Bell Labs staff, said that the researchers had been able to find the location of outdoor handsets with an accuracy of within 15 feet. The system is also sophisticated enough to work with handsets indoors, even though signals often bounce off metal objects, resulting in multiple reflections. Most basic G.P.S. systems cannot handle such interference. **********The system would also be able to use the fixed locations of the towers to strip away some of the error introduced intentionally by the Global Positioning System's owner, the United States Department of Defense. The military introduces a slowly changing error into the signal in the hopes of confusing potential enemies and giving United States forces an edge. **********Steve Eisenberg, a spokesman for Lucent, said that the company had recently licensed the technology to Qualcomm, a major manufacturer of cell phone base stations and handsets. **********The team from Lucent also said that phone companies were brainstorming about how the location information could be used. Many engineers want to use it to track failed phone calls and reduce the dead spots that confound cell phone users. **********The marketing divisions, however, may come up with the most creative uses. Some companies are considering charging land-line rates when you use a cell phone within several thousand feet of your home. That would give people more incentive to save money by canceling their wired service. Of course, calls would be billed at the regular mobile rate once the cell phone left the home area. **********Others are dreaming of using information about phone positions to route calls. Dialing (800) PIZZAME, for instance, might direct you to the closest pizza delivery shop. Pizza companies would probably be charged for that listing. **********David Banisar, an editor of ''The Electronic Privacy Papers'' (Wiley, 1997), said he worried that the phone companies would become so entranced with selling the tracking data to marketers that they would not give users control of it. **********''Each day as you go home, you drive the same route,'' he said. ''The marketers would love to be able to sell the fact that you drive by the same store each day to that store.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/business/investing-how-best-to-hitch-a-ride-on-a-highflying-index.html": {"writer_name": "Alison Rogers", "pub_date": "1999-04-18", "snippet": "Article on spectacular growth of Nasdaq-100 Shares unit trust since its March debut; graph (M)", "word_count": 681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INVESTING; How Best to Hitch a Ride On a Highflying Index?", "print_headline": "INVESTING; How Best to Hitch a Ride On a Highflying Index?", "body_text": " **********WITH a flurry of newspaper advertisements and cable television commercials, the Nasdaq-100 Shares unit trust made its debut last month, and it is now safe to call it a major marketing hit. The trust, listed on the American Stock Exchange, trades an average of over 4 million shares a day, making it the most successful product rollout in Amex history in terms of volume. **********The shares are perhaps the simplest way for investors to trade the sizzling Nasdaq 100 Composite index, that  amalgam of growth stocks that has skyrocketed as investors flock to the technology, telecommunications and consumer growth stocks it contains, from Cisco Systems to MCI Worldcom to Starbucks. **********As with other such unit investment trusts, there is little management involved: stock positions are changed only to match the index. **********The Nasdaq 100 index zoomed 85.3 percent last year, and is up 13.6 percent this year. But investors who bought into the index believing it to be a relatively broad-based benchmark -- similar, say, to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- are mistaken. Indeed, it is the Nasdaq 100's concentration on a few favored stocks that has made it such an outstanding performer. **********THE biggest five stocks in the index -- Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, MCI Worldcom, and Dell Computer, account for 40 percent of its value. (Microsoft alone is 16 percent.) By comparison, the five largest stocks in the S.& P. 500 account for just 13 percent of that benchmark's value. **********Still, there is no arguing with the Nasdaq 100's results. For investors who want to buy into the index, the question is whether the Nasdaq-100 Shares trust makes more sense than  other paths with similar goals. **********Two mutual funds, Rydex OTC and Profunds Ultra OTC, track the index, but in quite different ways. The Rydex fund is an index fund explicitly tied to the Nasdaq 100. The Profunds Ultra OTC uses futures and options to magnify the index's returns. **********There are other variables, too. The Nasdaq-100 Shares trust allows for much smaller minimum investments: An investor can buy a lone share, which closed on Friday at $103.9375. By contrast, the minimum investment is $25,000 for the Rydex OTC fund and $15,000 for Profunds Ultra OTC. **********The unit trust's expenses are lower, too, at 0.18 percent of assets under management, versus 1.1 percent for Rydex OTC and 1.07 percent for Ultra OTC. While such differences may seem minor  when an index is climbing 85.3 percent a year, they assume greater importance if returns fall. Investors trading trust shares, however, have to pay brokerage commissions. **********Robert Steele, vice president of the Rydex Series Trust, based in Rockville, Md., said investors might face larger spreads -- the differences between the bid and offered prices -- on unit trust trades than they would through a fund, especially in periods of volatility. **********Investors may want to base their decision on liquidity -- how quickly they want to accumulate or sell their holdings. **********James Bianco, president of Bianco Research in Barrington, Ill., points out that an investor can buy or sell the unit trust at the current price of the index throughout the trading day. When buying or selling shares of a  mutual fund, you almost always get the closing price for that trading day,  or the final price the next day, if the order is placed after the close. **********That could leave you open to price swings of 10 percent or more in an index as volatile as the Nasdaq 100."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/12/world/economy-s-ebb-in-japan-spurs-temporary-jobs.html": {"writer_name": "Howard French", "pub_date": "1999-08-12", "snippet": "Japanese companies, after 10 years of serious decline in nation's economic prospects, have been laying off workers in increasing numbers; are cutting costs by replacing permanent jobs with temporary ones, making longtime ideal of lifetime employme...", "word_count": 1176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Economy's Ebb In Japan Spurs Temporary Jobs", "print_headline": "Economy's Ebb In Japan Spurs Temporary Jobs", "body_text": " **********Fed up with the long hours of overtime that her publishing company insisted she work, Yoshiko Kitani quit a secure job seven years ago and spent a year traveling around Japan, getting to know her country for the first time. **********Ever since, the 30-year-old trade school graduate from Yokohama has hopped easily from job to job, hiring herself out through temporary agencies instead of casting her lot with a single employer. **********''I began to think that when I get older, if anyone ever asked me what I had done with my life, all I could tell them about was work,'' she said.

But many of those workers changed jobs more than once during the year, making it difficult to calculate the total number who found jobs. **********Japanese workers seem willing to quit jobs when they are feel they are underpaid or just bored, even at the risk of becoming unemployed for a time. And increasingly they are resorting to private job placement agencies to find new work. **********But with unemployment approaching 5 percent -- a post-World War II record -- the Government has been slow to adapt to this changing scene and has only grudgingly begun removing the restrictions. **********Instead of encouraging bloated companies to restructure, and making it easier for people to change jobs, the Government's response has been to pay subsidies to companies to hold on to their workers, even when their positions are no longer needed. **********That reluctance reflects a long-held belief that companies are morally obligated to provide for their employees, even by giving them make-work jobs rather than laying them off. **********But Japan's long economic recession, pressures on companies to become more efficient and a growing desire on the part of some Japanese workers for flexibility and mobility are eroding these beliefs. **********''The public has been expressing more interest in temporary work, and so have the employers, so we are beginning to lift restrictions on this sector,'' said Masaki Iuchi, a senior Labor Ministry official. ''In the past we have always tried to remain in step with the rules of the International Labor Organization.'' **********But Government officials do not seem to feel any particular sense of urgency. Last year only about a third of Japan's college graduates were able to find full-time employment. And yet temporary agencies are still forbidden from securing work for anyone within a year of graduation. **********Other rules establish mandatory fee schedules, inhibiting competition among job agencies, or place a number of job categories off-limits to temporary employment agencies. **********Most galling to employees who might want to use temporary jobs as a stepping stone to permanent ones, the rules limit temporary workers to one-year contracts and prevent their immediate rehiring for the same job. **********''The granting of money to companies to keep workers on the payroll does nothing to encourage fundamental change,'' said Yasuyuki Nambu, the founder of Pasona, the job placement agency. ''They are behaving just as someone does when he has a cold: treating the symptoms but doing nothing about the underlying infection.'' **********Mr. Nambu, 47, an outspoken maverick who ranks among Japan's most successful younger entrepreneurs, said the problem was that workers and businesses alike were kept in a ''regulatory cage'' by the Government. ''What we need more of in Japan is the wilderness,'' he said. **********Many foreign economists agree with that diagnosis and say the preoccupation with preserving what exists, whether industries or individual jobs, in a deeply conservative Japan has become a suffocating obstacle to economic regeneration. **********''Without more labor market liquidity, which would shift human resources into more productive industries, Japan will not experience the kind of recovery in productivity which must be the foundation of any new growth path for the country,'' said Andrew Shipley, senior economist at Schroeders Japan Ltd., an investment bank. **********For her part, Miss Kitani has little use for the economic theories used to criticize or justify Government policies. Her observations of the regulations are fueled by the experiences of someone who, like millions other Japanese, commutes for nearly two hours a day from a bedroom suburb to a job in central Tokyo. **********More than 10 months into her contract in a job she says she enjoys, she is already making preparations to leave the company and look for new work once more. ''It is really too bad that I can't keep the job I have now,'' preparing manuals for engineers. **********''In a job like this,'' she said, ''it takes a certain time to learn the programs and to get a feel for what you are doing. But by the time you feel you know what you are doing, because the rules are the way they are, your time is up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/business/the-right-thing-when-fear-of-firing-deters-hiring.html": {"writer_name": "Jeffrey Seglin", "pub_date": "1999-04-18", "snippet": "Jeffrey L Seglin column on reasons given by several executives for their reluctance to hire otherwise qualified people because of threat of anti-discrimination law; drawing (M)", "word_count": 755, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "When Fear Of Firing Deters Hiring", "print_headline": "THE RIGHT THING; When Fear Of Firing Deters Hiring", "body_text": " **********OVER the last few years, several people have spoken to me about their reluctance to hire people whose race, color, creed or national origin -- or age, disability or sex -- put them in protected classes under anti-discrimination law. **********The reasoning goes this way: You have to be absolutely sure that someone in a protected class is the best possible candidate, because people in these categories can make your life miserable with litigation if you ever have to dismiss them. **********''It's a dirty little secret'' that people are thinking this way, said Tama Starr, president of Artkraft Strauss, a sign-making company in New York, and one of the few business people who has spoken out on the subject. Those who subscribe to these ideas ''have to choose between different protected classes and weigh the risk of hiring them,'' she said, adding, ''This is a very obnoxious way to think.'' **********Managers tread on swampy ethical terrain when they allow fear of possible problems to deter them from hiring apparently capable minority applicants -- or to hesitate so long over a decision that a candidate loses interest or gives up in frustration. **********The fear of discrimination suits is not wholly groundless. A 1997 survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management found that of 616 personnel executives who responded, 53 percent said their organizations had been sued at least once by former employees in the last five years; nearly half the 611 suits they reported involved claims of discrimination. **********But Martha R. A. Fields, chief executive of Fields Associates, a management consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., says the risk of a suit is often an excuse that masks a deeper motive for not hiring people in protected classes. It is more likely, Ms. Fields said, that managers really just feel safer hiring people like themselves. **********Some people, she said, find it easy to think to themselves: ''If I know people who are like me, I know the good, bad, and the ugly about them. If I don't know them and I see images of them in the media, I'm, like, 'Oh man, those black people, they might be welfare-dependent, or criminals, or crime victims. I don't know if I really want to bring that into my organization.' '' **********Increasingly, such bias is economically irrational as well as unethical. ''The demographics of this country are shifting in major ways,'' Ms. Fields noted, as minority groups, especially Hispanic people, account for a rapidly growing share of the population and its purchasing power. ''Consumers want to see people like themselves in organizations,'' Ms. Fields said. **********Another underlying problem is managers who are poor at managing. Some who speak these fears are simply afraid to fire anyone  -- not just someone in a protected class -- and shy away from situations they perceive as requiring them to take a chance. **********To avoid hiring problem employees from any group, managers just ''need to do a good job of checking resumes, identifying the time gaps and verifying simple facts,'' said Mary C. Dollarhide, an employment lawyer with Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker in Stamford, Conn. For $200 to $300, a manager can also get a criminal background check on a candidate and a docket search to see if he or she often files lawsuits. ''If you do your due diligence, you're going to stand a much better chance of not bringing in the gripers, complainers, bad actors and poor performers,'' Ms. Dollarhide said. **********BUT a thorough screening does not absolve managers of having to manage. ''If you get somebody in your midst whom you fail to discipline because you're afraid you're going to get slammed for having reprimanded someone in a protected class, well, guess what: The failure to do that is going to land you in exactly the same spot,'' Ms. Dollarhide said. ''If the employee is terminated, he can sue and you're left with no records to support your case.'' **********Much sound management translates into ethical behavior. Employees who are treated fairly, honestly and directly are both less likely to require dismissal and less likely to sue over it later. **********That frees everyone to concentrate on the business they enjoy. ''I still believe that people are good and honest and they want to do a nice job,'' said Ms. Starr of Artkraft. ''Having to fight through more stupidity just hampers everybody's humanity.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/29/world/us-backs-away-from-bid-to-cut-off-aid-to-russia.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Kahn", "pub_date": "1999-12-29", "snippet": "Clinton Administration officials say United States will not seek to block economic aid to Russia as punishment for drive against separatist rebels in Chechnya; says US backs World Bank decision to release $100 million loan package; approval raises...", "word_count": 985, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Backs Away From Bid To Cut Off Aid to Russia", "print_headline": "U.S. Backs Away From Bid To Cut Off Aid to Russia", "body_text": " **********The United States will not seek to block economic aid to Russia as punishment for that country's widely condemned campaign against separatist rebels in Chechnya, a Clinton administration official said today. **********The official, speaking after Russia won the release today of a $100 million loan from the World Bank, said  aid packages to Russia from the United States, the World Bank or its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, would be considered on a case-by-case basis. But he said the Clinton administration would not apply a umbrella political standard when reviewing aid programs and has no plans to cut off aid in general as a way of punishing Russia for its military campaign in Chechnya. **********''We support this disbursement of funds, which will be used to restructure the coal sector,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''It is fully consistent with the common objective of promoting market reforms in Russia.'' **********The World Bank loan released today to help Russia restructure its coal industry did not require formal United States approval. But Washington often uses its influence at the bank and the International Monetary Fund to block loans that it considers contrary to its national interest. **********Last week, the administration sent a different signal when Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright ordered the Export-Import Bank to reject a $500 million loan for Russia. Dr. Albright cited concerns about the Russian state-affiliated oil company that would have received the money and State Department officials said the decision had nothing to do with Chechnya. But other administration officials suggested at the time that the Chechnya conflict had heightened the political sensitivity of economic cooperation with Russia. **********The approval of aid from the World Bank immediately raised Russian hopes that the United States would not block a much larger aid package from the monetary fund. The fund must decide whether to release $640 million to Russia that it delayed in September, citing Russia's failure to meet certain conditions of the loan. A decision on whether Russia has met those conditions could come as soon as next month. **********''It is good news, a good event,'' Alexander Livshits, a senior Russia economic envoy, said today on Moscow television. ''The World Bank has grasped positively what is happening in the Russian economy. I think this is not the last good news.'' **********Clinton administration officials said they did not intend to signal that their support for World Bank loans would necessarily carry over to aid from the monetary fund, which is intended to help Russia pay back earlier loans it has received from international agencies. But they said that the United States was not applying a political litmus test to economic aid and that the administration would continue to pursue its broad economic objectives in Russia despite the Chechnya campaign. **********What the war in Chechnya has done, one administration official said, was to make the United States reluctant to approve any new loan disbursements if Russia had not strictly adhered to the terms of using previous aid. In other words, Russia is not going to get much latitude in the way it uses aid, but could still see a steady flow of foreign loans as long as it uses them properly. **********Russia had fully met the conditions of previous World Bank loans to its coal industry, and therefore the bank and the United States had no grounds to hold up aid, officials at the bank and the Clinton administration said. **********The World Bank loan will mean little to the Russian economy or the country's ability to wage war against Chechen separatists. The money is earmarked exclusively to ''cushion the impact'' of mass layoffs in the coal industry. Russia has agreed to close 116 inefficient mines as a condition of receiving the aid. **********But the loan is still an important symbol for the Russian government, which has been working to show that its economic relations with the outside world are still on track despite international condemnation of its military actions in Chechnya. **********Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, whose centrist political party did well in Russia's recent parliamentary elections, has promised to jumpstart economic reforms advocated by the West even as he leads the uncompromising military effort. His party includes a number of politicians who say they would like to speed up efforts to remake Russia's economy in the Western mold, changes that came to a standstill when Russia devalued its currency and defaulted on some of its debt in August 1998. **********The Clinton administration has also been eager to show that economic engagement with Russia, a broad policy of helping Russia manage its economy and its finances, has paid dividends despite an increasingly strained relationship with Moscow over geopolitical issues. Officials said halting aid to Russia now makes no sense, given that politicians with favor economic changes are ascendant and that Russian markets have begun to recover from their sharp reversal last year. **********Human rights groups also criticized the World Bank's decision to release the loans. ''We are seriously disappointed by the bank's decision,'' Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division, said in a statement. ''The bank's stated commitment to addressing the 'human aspects' of development rings hollow when its funds are paid directly to a  government pursuing the kind of abusive campaign we are witnessing in Chechnya.'' **********The World Bank staff considered the Chechnya conflict when reviewing whether to release the aid, according to a bank spokeswoman, Gina Ciagne. But that review focused soley on the financial impact -- whether the war effort would so deplete Russia's financial resources and scare away investors that the country would have a hard time paying back the loans, she said. **********The war could have that effect in the long run, Ms. Ciagne said. But it did not threaten to do so now. She said the bank was legally obligated to disburse money agreed to in the 1997 coal-sector reform package, provided that Russia met the loan's conditions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/26/business/international-briefs-vw-predicts-slowing-of-sales-in-1999.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-03-26", "snippet": "Volkswagen AG says sales will rise less than 10 percent this year for first time in five years as weak economies in Latin America and Asia limit gains; says sales fell 'significantly' in Britain and Italy, although first-quarter sales rose worldwi...", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "VW Predicts Slowing Of Sales in 1999", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS; VW Predicts Slowing Of Sales in 1999", "body_text": " **********Volkswagen A.G. said yesterday that sales would rise less than 10 percent this year for the first time in five years as weak economies in Latin America and Asia limit gains.

Two boys were down by the water's edge fishing. Sanja Milenkovic, 17, a top mathematics pupil at a Belgrade high school, was walking home across the bridge. The local Orthodox priest, The Rev. Milivoje Ciric, was celebrating Trinity Sunday inside his small white church perched above the river. **********It was just before 1 P.M. when NATO planes roared in low to shatter the calm. They bombed the bridge over the Juzna Morava River, a sturdy concrete and steel structure, striking it in the first run and then returning minutes later to hit it again. **********A fisherman standing on the river bank downstream said he watched in horror as people and cars toppled into the river. ''There were a lot of people and cars on the bridge,'' he said, refusing to give his name to a Western journalist. ''It was market day; a few thousand people were here. It was absolute panic. We were terrified.'' **********At least 9 people were killed and 28 wounded. (The state-run media said 11 died.) People who had gathered earlier for the church service were setting off for home across the bridge, on foot and in cars, when the bomb hit. **********Ms. Milenkovic, the mathematics student, had just crossed the bridge and was on the far bank just a mile from home when the planes struck. She was wounded so gravely by shrapnel that she died on the way to the hospital, said Dragoljub Stanojevic, her former teacher and a friend of the family. **********After the first strike, people rushed from the nearby market to help those injured on the bridge. Then the planes came back and struck again, unleashing two bombs that smashed the bridge off its concrete supports and sent lethal shrapnel flying up the street into the marketplace, witnesses said. **********Father Ciric had come out of the chapel when he heard the first blast and was standing in the courtyard of the church, just 100 yards from the bridge. Shrapnel caught him full in the head, killing him instantly and injuring another priest, a police officer said. **********In all, seven men and two women have been identified so far as having been killed, all civilians. Townspeople said that, in addition to Father Ciric and Ms. Milenkovic, one victim was a 33-year-old factory worker named Zoran. The chief investigator for the town said that 30 were injured, 17 critically. **********Later in the afternoon, blood and remains of human flesh marked the road where some of the victims had died. **********Divers stood in their wet suits beside the edge of the bridge, where it ended abruptly in front of the broad river. The nearest section of the bridge had completely been swept away under the swiftly flowing muddy waters. **********''We do not know how many people found a grave in the Morava River and how many victims there are in the hospital remains to be seen,'' said the Mayor of Varvarin, Dragan Cavnic. **********The fisherman said he feared for the lives of two young boys who had been fishing close to the bridge. The blast cast up huge waves of water, and he thought they had been swept away. **********One woman's body had been retrieved from the water but it was not clear how many people had died in the water, the chief investigator, Janko Milenkovic, said at the morgue. ''We know there is something down there,'' he said. **********Eight bodies were lying on stretchers in the morgue at the entrance to the town cemetery. Father Ciric stood out in his black suit trousers and city shoes. The other men were in cheap workers' clothing. Their bodies were mangled horribly. The woman whose body was found in the river, in her stocking feet, alone appeared calm in death. Ms. Milenkovic's body was still at the hospital. **********''This is a catastrophe for us,'' said a local police officer named Dragan. ''We are just a small town. There is nothing around here but agriculture.'' **********At least until today, Varvarin was something of a beauty spot. A town of only 4,000 people about 95 miles south of the capital, Belgrade, it is in an idyllic setting with thick green foliage flanking the broad river. **********''People are full of bitterness,'' Mr. Stanojevic, the teacher at the local school, said, curling his fist into a ball against his heart. ''We are not scared. They will never scare us. But this is making them bitter. **********''I am trying to be a realist. Maybe a bridge is a military target, but if it is a military target, why did they not bomb it at night when there are no people? It is well-known that Sunday is market day here and people are lined all along the street down to the bridge selling things.'' **********Dragan, the police officer, said he suspected that NATO pilots had aimed at the bridge after they spotted the commotion from people and cars. ''They flew very low,'' he said. **********NATO said that four aircraft attacked the bridge at about 1 P.M., and that it was a legitimate and designated target. The alliance said it was unable to confirm reports of casualties, but it has said repeatedly that civilian casualties in air strikes are unintentional. **********It was the first time their town had been hit during the more than two months of bombing, the men here said. They were pessimistic that the bombing would stop soon. ''It does not depend on us -- if it depended on us it would not have started,'' Mr. Stanojevic said. **********''We hope this will end soon, but not because we are afraid,'' he added. ''We are just defending our country and we have always supported a peaceful deal.

Relative to their U.S. counterparts, many of these international Internet stocks can be purchased at entry-level prices. **********Europe is fertile ground, particularly Britain, which has an active Internet industry (Page 18). \"The market isn't quite as crazy in Europe, so you generally need more of a track record to go public than in the U.S., but Net companies in general and in Europe especially don't have much of one,\" said Esther Dyson, the technology pundit and author. **********As in the United States, most international Internet issues do not have earnings because they spend all the money they can get their hands on to expand their market share. This is one reason they are not widely followed by brokerage-house analysts. **********So to pick an Internet stock, said Lise Buyer, a director at Credit Suisse/First Boston, investors should \"look for businesses that actually make sense to them. If you don't understand it, don't buy it.\" They should also look for big ones, she added. \"The bigger Internet companies tend to grow at a faster rate than the smaller ones \u2014 that's contrary to old practical business models where it was the start-up that did.\" **********Steve Harmon, editor of the on-line stock report Internet.com, said prospective investors doing their own research should visit a company's website \u2014 it would be hard to think of an Internet company without one \u2014 and peruse its press releases and financial reports for evidence of decent sales, an established user base and identifiable market share. **********Mr. Harmon has begun tracking international Internet stocks that could offer big payoffs down the road, though he cautions that their issuers \"still have a lot to prove.\" **********Among these companies is Easynet Group PLC, Europe's largest independent Internet service provider. A relatively low-profile stock among investors, Easynet's stock is trading near 310 pence ($5), up more than 60 percent this year. The British company provides dial-up Internet access to 5,000 domestic consumers and businesses and is now moving into France and Germany. **********For investors weary of single-product companies, Easynet is well rounded, including a focus on high-margin Web consulting services. It derived most of its \u00a317 million ($27.4 million) of 1998 sales from corporate customers and it has recently signed two noteworthy deals: one gives it a portion of the charge that British Telecommunications PLC levies when people dial up Easynet over its lines, the other is with the software publisher Eidos PLC for an on-line video-game service. **********Unlike many Internet companies, Easynet had earnings last year, though its \u00a3112,000 profit comes to just 0.53 pence per fully diluted share, a price-earnings ratio of more than 500. **********The Vienna exchange is home to E-Pub (Holdings) Ltd., a promising Internet play, and one that Ms. Dyson said she was betting on. Based in Budapest, E-Pub is considered to be the world's leading producer of on-line entertainment, with a unique stable of on-line single- and multi-player game shows. **********The company just signed an agreement with Pearson Television Inc., owner of the popular shows \"Family Feud\" and \"Password,\" under which E-Pub will develop on-line versions of TV games. As part of the deal, Pearson took a 10.9 percent stake in E-Pub **********Intershop Communications AG, founded in Jena, Germany, has its worldwide headquarters in San Francisco. It helps companies set up and manage websites for Internet-based commerce. It boasts big customers such as Robert Bosch GmbH, DaimlerChrysler AG and Hewlett-Packard Co.

James Eidisch, senior industry analyst at International Data Corp. in London, said Autonomy was undervalued at its current level of 5.30 euros ($5.74). Its knowledge-management software enables data traveling over the Web and corporate intranets to be categorized, essentially reading the documents and then deciding where to send them. **********Internet-oriented stocks are considered an anomaly in Asia. One that you can buy is Singapore's leading Internet service provider, Pacific Internet Ltd., which went public in the United States at $17 a share on Feb. 5 and rose as high as $88 that day **********It has since fallen to about $31, still a healthy advance from the offering, reflecting solid profits, operations in other Asian countries and a diverse business model, which includes dial-up services, Internet retail outlets and web-consulting services. **********One soon-to-be public stock to keep an eye out for is StarMedia Network Inc., an on-line network in Latin America. StarMedia is preparing for a Nasdaq listing sometime later this year. **********The company, which is headquartered in New York, is currently offering Internet services as well as on-line content in Spanish and Portuguese throughout Latin America.

To avoid a repeat, Deutsche Bank executives established much tighter control over Bankers Trust and indeed are doing away with the name itself. **********Under the original takeover plan announced last November, Mr. Newman was to become co-chairman of Deutsche Bank's corporate banking and investment banking division, known as Global Corporates and Institutions. He was also supposed to become a member of Deutsche Bank's management board. **********But after Bankers Trust's guilty plea, some of Deutsche's top executives rebelled against giving Mr. Newman a board seat. When the two banks formally completed the sale on June 4, they omitted any mention of the matter. **********Mr. Newman will not leave penniless. His contract with Bankers Trust guaranteed him salary and bonuses of roughly $55 million, and Deutsche Bank may pay significantly more in order to avoid an embarrassing public fight. **********Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, wants to use Bankers Trust as a springboard into the United States and to strengthen its position in investment banking. **********Mr. Newman, a former Deputy Treasury Secretary, was hired in late 1995 to clean up Bankers Trust after a series of scandals at the bank involving high-risk derivative securities. He orchestrated several acquisitions, including that of Wolfensohn & Company, a small investment bank, and BT Alex. Brown & Sons, the Baltimore brokerage firm with a reputation in high-technology stocks. **********But Bankers Trust suffered heavy losses as a result of Russia's economic collapse, and it was in desperate need of a strong new partner. **********The German bank has thus far installed Bankers Trust executives in several senior jobs.

Deutsche Bank installed John Ross, an American who had formerly run its Asian operations, in charge of North American operations. **********Though Mr. Newman was supposed to share power over the Global Corporates business with Josef Ackermann, a Deutsche Bank board member, he remained outside the lines of real operational authority. **********Mr. Newman's isolation increased when Deutsche Bank refused to name him to its management board, known as the Vorstand.

From the start of the year through Thursday, the 58 Latin American equity funds tracked by Lipper Inc. have posted an average total return of 30.9 percent. **********Analysts are excited about the potential for further gains: Based on price-to-earnings ratios, Latin stocks are still very inexpensive compared with those of other parts of the world. **********Carlos Asili, Latin American equity strategist for J. P. Morgan, took some time last week to discuss how the coming year is shaping up for Latin stocks. Following are excerpts from the conversation: **********Q. Latin stocks have been very strong for the last couple of weeks. Why is that? **********A. When the European and American bond markets began their strong rally, that was a big positive for Latin equity markets. Also, during the period this summer when the American stock market was correcting, there were net inflows into international equity funds. Some of that money went into Latin funds. Finally, there is a sense that the Latin economies have bottomed out and are in a recovery phase. **********Q. Do you agree that the worst is over for these economies? **********A. Our economists have forecast that growth will show a steady acceleration in Latin America through the end of next year, to an annualized year-over-year rate of 4.4 percent by the fourth quarter of 2000. **********The drivers will be Chile and Mexico. Brazil will be a little weaker than those countries, with growth of about 2.5 percent in the first half of the year, accelerating to 3.5 percent in the second half. And Argentina should see its economy accelerate in the second half of the year. **********Q. Latin stocks and economies are hostage to what happens in American and European bond markets. Do you fear a rise in interest rates in the developed world? **********A. It is very likely we will see bond yields back up some, but we will not return to the levels we hit three weeks or a month ago. **********And while fixed-income spreads between emerging-market bonds and Treasuries have narrowed, we think they could narrow further. **********At the height of the crisis last year, rates on emerging-market bonds were as high as 17 percent above U.S. Treasuries, according to the J. P. Morgan emerging-markets bond index. Now, that spread is around 9.8 percent. Conservatively, we could get a further 2.5-percentage-point improvement in those bond spreads. **********It depends on the country, but in Latin America a 1.5-percentage-point compression in those spreads could lead to an expansion in price-to-earnings ratios on stocks of 20 percent to 30 percent. **********Q. Political instability is often another source of potential concern in emerging markets. Do you see potential problems in any of the major Latin countries? **********A. No one can say that nothing bad will happen, but at this point the outlook looks positive. **********I feel comfortable about political stability in Argentina, Chile and Mexico, which will hold presidential elections next summer. There is a lot of confidence in Mexico. **********Of the four major investible countries, Brazil is the country where there is some risk. That is not because of impending elections, but because of the future of economic reform and liberalization. **********Q. How do you see the rally continuing? And do you have a list of stocks that are trading as American Depository Receipts in this country that you like? **********A. Recently, the stocks that have outperformed have been the telecommunications companies, which are by far the most liquid. Telmex, Telebras and Televisa have all moved up significantly. As the rally matures, we expect it to broaden out. **********There are at least 10 stocks that are liquid, trade A.D.R.'s and have very good bottom-up fundamentals. **********In Mexico, Coca-Cola Femsa, which has risen around 5 percent this week, still offers good value.

Titled ''Internet Explorer Marketing Review,'' it was loaded with statistics, analyses and marketing assessments. **********Mr. Boies pointed to one conclusion: Most people who switched to Internet Explorer did so because ''it came with my computer,'' suggesting that the browser was gaining ground largely because it was bundled with Windows. **********Asked about that, Mr. Chase explained that the 20-page strategy assessment ''was done by a summer intern'' and had no standing within the company. **********''Do you know where a supposed summer intern got all this information?'' Mr. Boies asked, his voice laced with incredulity. Mr. Chase said he did not, prompting Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to observe that the study appeared to be in the form of a slide show for a meeting, and he asked, ''Do summer interns do slide presentations at Microsoft?'' **********Mr. Chase said it was possible that an intern prepared the show and never presented it. **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Boies continued to challenge a videotape Mr. Chase played last Thursday that purported to show how easy it was to download Netscape Navigator, the principal competition to Internet Explorer from the Netscape Communications Corporation. Mr. Boies began the attack last Thursday, noting that the difficult and time consuming parts of downloading and installing Navigator had been edited out. **********Mr. Boies tried to show his own demonstration tape on Thursday to counter Microsoft's. But under the rules of the trial, he had to allow Microsoft 72 hours to examine it. **********When Mr. Boies finally played his tape today, he managed to force Mr. Chase to acknowledge that some answers he had given Judge Jackson on Thursday had been incorrect. **********Specifically, Mr. Chase had told the judge that an America Online customer downloading Netscape from the service would see a simple, self-explanatory series of screens that makes the process easy. The tape Mr. Boies played today showed that the process was considerably more complicated. Judge Jackson asked several questions along the way indicating that he was confused. **********Later, Mr. Boies tried to deflate Mr. Chase's assertion that Internet Explorer had won the majority of critical product reviews in the last two years. Among other things, he showed the results of a Microsoft tracking poll of professional Web developers, who concluded in the fall of 1997 that ''Netscape is still perceived as having the best browser.'' **********Mr. Chase offered the view that these developers used Netscape primarily to check their Web sites to assure that they worked well with Netscape. **********The judge seemed puzzled by that explanation and asked, ''Is this just speculation, or do you know that for a fact?'' **********Mr. Chase said several Web developers had told him that. **********At midday, Mr. Boies offered what he thought would be an explosive new document, one that a Government official called ''a naked attempt at market division.'' **********The document did appear to be just that, but it was so old that Microsoft's lawyer appeared successful in convincing the judge that it was irrelevant. **********The document, an E-mail message to Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, Mr. Chase and others, was dated March 1990 and was written by Mike Slade, a Microsoft executive who had just returned from a meeting with the leaders of Intuit, manufacturers of Quicken, the popular accounting software. **********''I made a fairly surprising proposal to them,'' he wrote. ''Usually we can topple anyone,'' but ''we'd rather not compete with you. So how about this?'' Then he suggested that Intuit write software for Apple computers and others running DOS but leave the new market for Windows computers to Microsoft. **********He said Intuit's leaders seemed receptive, and ''if they were listening carefully, this could have been interpreted as a chance to avoid competition with us.'' **********The proposal is quite similar to one that the Government charges Microsoft made to Netscape several years later, an accusation that Microsoft denies. Mr. Boies said he was offering this memo, despite its age, ''because this is something that shows a pattern of anticompetitive behavior.'' **********But Mr. Chase said he had no recollection of the document or events surrounding it. And eventually the judge told Mr. Boies to move on to another subject. **********After Mr. Chase completed his testimony this evening, William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs, asserted that he ''hasn't been moved an inch off of the central point of his testimony.'' **********On Wednesday, John T. Rose, a senior vice president for the Compaq Computer Corporation, takes the stand. In his direct written testimony made public today he said he believed that most consumers wanted a computer ''with broad functionality that is simple and easy to use right out of the box.'' He endorsed the idea of giving them a Web browser but added, ''It is irrelevant to users whether the feature is incorporated in application or operating-system software.'' **********Mr. Rose also took issue with the Government's accusation that Microsoft threatened in 1996 to cancel Compaq's license to sell Windows with its computers when Microsoft learned that Compaq was also loading Netscape on its machines. **********Mr. Rose said the real problem was that Compaq was deleting some on-screen icons, including one for Internet Explorer, that Microsoft had pre-loaded. This was done, he added, as the result of an agreement with America Online. When Compaq restored the icons, Mr. Rose said, Microsoft withdrew its threat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/14/world/crisis-in-the-balkans-kosovo-update.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1999-04-14", "snippet": "Update on crisis in Serbia; map (M)", "word_count": 271, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KOSOVO UPDATE", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS; KOSOVO UPDATE", "body_text": " **********COMBAT *********** NATO bombers destroyed a railway bridge in southern Yugoslavia where, just hours before, allied bombs hit a train.

He was a ''danger to the public interest,'' an incorrigible repeat offender who had to be stopped. **********Mr. Hund, 40, is a self-employed roofer. His alleged crime: taking telephone calls at home from customers. **********Talking on the phone is not usually illegal. But Mr. Hund was only licensed to work as a ''traveling'' carpenter and not as a ''master'' roofer. It was all right for him to walk up to a construction site and offer his services, but he was forbidden to have a fixed place of business. **********Now, eight years after Mr. Hund says he did not hang out his shingle, the local authorities are about to shut him down. ''They keep talking about the unemployment problem, but they're putting me out of work,'' he grumbled. **********Mr. Hund is one of countless Germans caught up in a much broader political battle over job protection and workplace flexibility. Germany has some of the strictest work rules in Europe, which have helped produce one of the best-paid and most productive work forces in the world. **********But Germany also has high labor costs and a stubbornly high unemployment rate of more than 10 percent. And competition is increasing as Europe becomes a single market with a single currency. In Spain, tens of thousands of people work in illegal sweatshops that operate with impunity. **********The work rules cover more than 90 professions, and few areas are as tightly regulated as the country's skilled crafts. Those include everything from carpentry, baking and piano repair to window washing, house painting and boat building. **********Most other developed countries, including the United States, set licensing standards for many professions. But in Germany the entrance barriers are higher, the rules more complex and the punishments harsher. **********House painters, for instance, need to attend classes for several years, serve as apprentices and then pass a rigorous exam before receiving a coveted ''meisterbrief.'' The classes and testing alone often cost more than $5,000, not counting the living expenses that a worker has to pay while not earning money. **********While workers do not require full certification to work under the supervision of a meister, a vast majority of craft workers are either self-employed or work in small companies that do little outside hiring. **********Consider the case of Simone, 34, a roofer in the town of Hagen. After working illegally for three years, she was caught by city officials last November and given a staggering fine of 80,000 marks, or about $47,000. **********''This is a profession dominated by males, and I don't have any other job possibilities,'' said Simone, who did not want to disclose her full name in public because she is still looking for work on the sly. ''The only way I could get certified would be to live in another city for at least seven months while I attended roofing classes. I can't leave my family for seven months.'' **********Defenders of the system argue that it protects the public from shoddy work and helps finance education programs. Besides setting rigorous educational standards, master craft workers all pay dues to national associations that run technical training centers. **********''We live in a time when quality is ever more important,'' said Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer, secretary general of the Association of German Handworkers in Bonn. ''The strength of Germany is largely due to the strength of its middle-sized industry and to its skilled workers.'' **********But others argue that the organized craft workers are simply shielding themselves from competition. ''The main purpose of all this is to protect themselves,'' said Horst Mirbach, the author of a book on laws governing craft workers and founder of an advocacy group in Bonn called Action for Trade Freedom. **********The German Government liberalized the law somewhat last year, making it easier for people to move between different crafts and lowering the requirements for certain lines of work. **********But even today the rules are strict -- and tricky. Marion Beuter is an authorized piano tuner near Heidelberg. But she lives in daily fear of being caught repairing pianos, which she is not certified to do. **********A potentially major battle is brewing over companies that repair personal computers, most of which never bothered to seek accreditation because the entire field was so new. **********There have already been a few scuffles between traditional office-machine services and the newer computer consulting and repair companies. So far the big craft organizations have generally refrained from filing complaints, but they may not for long. ''It is still very controversial,'' acknowledged Mr. Schleyer, of the handworkers' organization. **********Meanwhile, the battles are being fought by people like Thomas Melles, an unemployed carpenter who runs a tiny advocacy group in the town of Woltersdorf called the Professional Association of Independent Craft Workers. The group's logo features a ghost carrying tools, a whimsical reference to spooking the establishment. (The German acronym for the group is BUH, pronounced boo.) **********''None of us have gotten into trouble because we weren't paying taxes or because of complaints about the quality of our work,'' said Mr. Melles, who was ordered to stop work last fall and faces a fine of 5,000 marks, or about $3,000, each time he is caught. **********Like Mr. Hund, Mr. Melles thought he had found a loophole in the rules by registering as a ''traveling'' tradesman. The idea dates back to the times when knife-sharpeners and handymen would ply their services door to door. A traveling tradesman can perform many jobs without being a master, but is not allowed to advertise or even keep an office. **********But the distinctions have now reached hair-splitting exactitude. After lengthy deliberations, the local guild here in Gummersbach allowed Mr. Hund to paint a colorful sign on his truck but prohibited him from putting a telephone number on it. **********Mr. Hund obeyed -- sort of. He put a phone number on the back of his truck, underneath another sign promoting his work as a fully authorized scaffold-builder. **********After listening to witnesses and deliberating about the truck, a local court ruled last October that Mr. Hund should lose his license as a traveling roofer. ''Unless the license is revoked, the public interest will be jeopardized,'' the court ruled. **********A final decision on the license is due within the next few weeks. In the meantime, Mr. Hund is grabbing as much work as he can get."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/business/working-job-testing-multiple-choices.html": {"writer_name": "Michelle Cottle", "pub_date": "1999-09-05", "snippet": "Michelle Cottle Working column explores question of how a company can decide which tests to use to screen job applicants (M)", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Job Testing: Multiple Choices", "print_headline": "WORKING; Job Testing: Multiple Choices", "body_text": " **********Today, the cost of hiring the wrong person can be steep. Your company is thinking of introducing tests to screen applicants. With so many kinds of tests available, how do you decide which ones to use? **********No doubt about it: employment tests are hot. The Association of Test Publishers estimates that personality testing is now a $400 million industry, and the Society for Human Resource Management estimates that more than 20 percent of its members use some kind of pre-employment testing. There are tests to gauge an applicant's honesty, creativity, technology skills, communications skills -- you name it. But before you start shelling out money, determine just how much information you really need. **********It's probably not worth your while to ask retail-clerk applicants to take an extensive (and expensive) battery of tests, said David Arnold, an industrial psychologist and lawyer with Reid Psychological Systems, a Chicago-based company that develops employment tests. For many positions, a basic skills or aptitude test may suffice. For jobs in which security is an issue, a more comprehensive personality assessment may be desirable, Mr. Arnold said. **********The difference in time and cost can be considerable. According to Roger Sommer, employment committee chair for the Society for Human Resources Management, some basic tests can last about 10 minutes and cost just $5 to $10 an applicant, while executive testing can take most of a day and run into the thousands. **********John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray, & Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago, says that to find out what to test for, talk with managers who have been hiring for the type of job you are interested in. ''Get a good handle on what it is that makes people in the job successful,'' he said. **********Mr. Arnold recommended asking three basic questions when choosing a test publisher. First, has the test been validated? The company should have evidence that people who score well on the evaluation tend to be good performers, he said. **********Second, is the test fair? Has the publisher followed legal or professional standards,  like Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines, to insure that the test does not discriminate against applicants of a particular race, sex or age? **********Third, if your use of the test ever faces a legal challenge, how will the publisher help you? At the very least, Mr. Arnold said, the company should provide a psychologist, at no cost to you, to help you develop a response to the complaint. **********Apart from legal issues, some of the more comprehensive tests include questions that some people might regard as intrusive. The  less clearly that test questions deal with job-related behavior, the greater the risk of alienating applicants, the experts said. **********Particularly in fields like information technology, in which the demand for qualified applicants far outpaces supply, he said, you run the risk of making the process so rigorous that applicants ask, ''Why in the world do I want to go through all of this?'' **********Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

Members of the Geocities personal Web community (www.geocities.com), for instance, can earn commissions on purchases that result when they refer visitors to Internet retailers that participate in Geocities' Pages That Pay program. **********While the terms -- and success -- of such deals vary widely, some retailers say affiliate programs are becoming a crucial source of revenue, particularly as it becomes apparent that advertising revenue alone cannot sustain most Internet businesses. **********''The return is phenomenal,'' said Julie Wainwright, who until recently was chief executive of Reel.com, a video seller. The Reel.com affiliate program was so successful, she said, that it ''generated more revenue than any of our portal deals.'' Ms. Wainwright left Reel.com last month to become chief executive of Pets.com, an on-line peddler of pet supplies, where she intends to develop an affiliate-referral network. **********The Internet bookseller Amazon.com is widely credited with pioneering the affiliate model. The company began its ''associate'' program in 1996, offering to pay Web sites that refer customers to Amazon a percentage of any resulting sale. **********Amazon's legion of affiliates now numbers 230,000 -- a figure that attests to Amazon's vaunted marketing prowess, of course, but also to the considerable buzz that surrounds affiliate programs. The music seller CDNow has the second-largest affiliate program on the Web, with 207,000 members, while other large retailers' programs are growing at a brisk pace. **********Why the buzz? The biggest draw of affiliate programs is that merchants do not have to spend marketing dollars to acquire a customer until a purchase is actually made. **********According to industry executives, top-tier Internet retailers currently spend between $20 and $40 to acquire a new customer -- an exorbitant amount compared with off-line retailers, and primarily a result of the high cost of advertising on Web portals like Yahoo and Lycos to develop brand name awareness. Often, merchants must then spend time working with the portals to find the best approach to delivering customers. **********''With affiliates, you pay for performance,'' Ms. Wainwright of Pets.com said. ''You don't pay up front and then work to get performance.'' **********The best proof of the increasing popularity of these programs is the fact that merchants are competing against each other to attract affiliates, said James McQuivey, an electronic commerce analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting group. **********For the last two years, the bounty paid by merchants has grown steadily, he said, ''from 8, to 10, to 12, now as high as 20 percent.'' For some high-margin goods like toys, in fact, bounties can reach as much as 25 percent. **********For merchants, the real dollars flow from a small number of affiliated companies that bring in the bulk of customers. According to the research firm Jupiter Communications, 15 percent of affiliates account for 85 percent of sales. In many cases, these are high-traffic or highly focused sites like SCN Athlete Daily.com, which tracks the activities of 125 popular athletes. **********Even with high-performing sites, though, merchants must do more than simply post a link and wait for the registers to ring. **********The Sports Superstore Online site (www.sportssuper.com), for instance, has three full-time employees who work with more than 2,000 affiliates (including SCN Athlete Daily.com) on merchandising techniques meant to improve the chances of a sale. The payoff: one year after starting the program, the site gets 7.5 percent of its revenue from affiliate sales. Helio Fialho, the company's chief executive, said he hoped to push that to 18 percent by the end of the year. **********While some companies, including Sports Superstore or Amazon.com, run their affiliate programs in-house, others have chosen to use third-party services like Linkshare and Be Free to manage the relationships. These so-called affiliate networks provide services like sending small monthly checks to thousands of affiliates, policing affiliates' sites for possibly offensive material and dealing with the technical challenges that inevitably arise with such programs. **********For Internet companies that sign up to be a retailer's affiliate, one drawback is the risk of confusing viewers about the site's mission -- a particularly thorny issue for media companies. On the one hand, such sites do not want to risk appearing biased toward advertisers, by essentially selling goods that appear on news pages where they are mentioned. On the other hand, media sites are loath to give up affiliate earnings as a source of revenue, particularly as advertisers are paying less for banner ads. **********''It is absolutely a fine line, but every media company is drooling over the idea of getting involved in commerce,'' said Bill Bass, a media analyst with Forrester Research. ''Of course, it causes editors to clutch their stomachs whenever it's mentioned.'' **********Such relationships do pose risks, Martin Nisenholtz, president of The New York Times Electronic Media Company, acknowledged. Under an agreement between The Times and Barnesandnoble.com, book reviews on The Times's Web site are accompanied by a ''buy it on line'' link to the bookseller. ''It boils down to the perception that something has changed,'' Mr. Nisenholtz said. ''The reality is that there's absolutely no interaction between the editorial side of the book review and the advertising side. We handle commerce the same way we handle advertising.'' **********To address the issue, Mr. Nisenholtz said the company would soon ''publish a very clear set of guidelines about these agreements and what they mean.'' **********Another risk, for merchants and publishers alike, is that as more sites go into the business of selling goods, the Web could start to resemble a billboard-laden highway. And if consumers become turned off by a constant barrage of sites trying to sell them something, they could lose their appetite for buying anything on line."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/28/technology/library-art-history-cd-rom-s-lessons-on-the-masterworks-and-the-mundane.html": {"writer_name": "Verne Kopytoff", "pub_date": "1999-01-28", "snippet": "Art history computer software uses digital sound effects, film clips and slide shows to teach users about painting, sculpture and architecture; photo (M)", "word_count": 395, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Technology", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Lessons on the Masterworks and the Mundane", "print_headline": "LIBRARY/ART HISTORY CD-ROM'S; Lessons on the Masterworks and the Mundane", "body_text": " **********WALKING through a gallery, you notice a dark painting of a Biblical scene executed with a touch of gore.

Unlike books of art history, they allow users to learn about painting, sculpture and architecture with a flourish of digital sound effects, film clips and slide shows. For some people, the infusion of action may make studying art that much more interesting.

''Ones that I haven't liked have a feel that they started out as another project. They have limited capabilities or they just have a talking-head expert who comes on screen.'' **********One of the most important things to bear in mind before investing in a CD-ROM is that the quality of images is often no better than that found in art books. Paintings reproduced on screen are not usually detailed enough to show individual brush strokes, patches of thick paint and subtle color differences. **********But then, no one would argue that digital images are a substitute for the real thing.

Everyone knows what it is. But money is something that can change a lot over time. **********A century ago, there was little question about what money was. It was gold, period. Or, to be a little more exact, it included national currencies like dollars and pounds, but only to the extent they were convertible into gold. There was but one real money. **********Now there are dozens and dozens of national currencies, none of them tied to gold. But there is a hierarchy of currencies that in practice significantly reduces the real number. That hierarchy is based not on relative value, which can and does fluctuate, but on their function in the world economy. The United States dollar is clearly No. 1. **********At the same time, the nature of money is changing. With no anchor in precious metals, the task of maintaining the value of currencies has fallen to central banks, few of which even existed in 1900. It was the central banks -- most notably the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bundesbank in Germany -- that were given credit for slaying the inflation dragon in the 1980's, leading to what might be called the cult of the central banker. **********The big questions for the international monetary system in the 21st century will revolve around those points: Will the dollar maintain its supremacy, or will the euro, and perhaps even the Japanese yen, gain comparable status? How will other countries manage the value of their currencies? And, perhaps most important, will central bankers maintain their power and prestige, or will they stumble and take the blame for some economic problem? **********The current supremacy of the dollar does not reflect a brilliant record as a store of value. If one uses consumer price inflation as a measure, a 1999 dollar is worth about a nickel in 1900 money. Measured against gold, the dollar is down 93 percent. **********Instead, the dollar's primacy reflects the United States's role as the world's largest economy, with capital markets that lead the world. The dollar is the most likely currency to be held as official reserves by other countries. It is the main currency of international lending. Companies from Brazil to Indonesia owe dollars, not reais or rupiahs. When the real and rupiah were devalued in the crises of the late 1990's, local companies that had thought they were in good shape found themselves in financial difficulty. **********The euro, the currency of 11 European countries, was created in part to challenge the dollar's supremacy. Its first year has not been a smooth one, and the value of the currency has fallen. But the euro's use in international borrowing has risen. **********Some major economies, such as Britain and Japan, can easily keep floating exchange rates with the dollar and the euro, in part because those countries have capital markets that can allow companies to borrow in local currencies. **********But for many other currencies, the options are not so clear. Until the Asian currency crisis, many countries opted for a sort of nonbinding fixed rate. Their currencies were tied to the dollar, sometimes with a planned gradual depreciation. **********The Asian crisis, however, saw many such currencies plunge in value and led to a growing consensus that countries must choose one of two options. They can choose freely floating exchange rates that rise or fall against other currencies moved by market forces, a plan that gives governments maximum flexibility but can make it hard for businesses to plan their affairs. Alternatively, they can adopt an absolute fixed rate versus a major currency. **********That has meant proposals in Latin America for ''dollarization,'' in which the local currency is simply replaced by the dollar. At the extreme, that could lead to the entire hemisphere, and perhaps much of the rest of the world as well, adopting the dollar. Such a policy would give Latin American businesses the ability to borrow at relatively low dollar interest rates, with confidence that devaluation would not devastate them. **********The downside to that arrangement for other countries is that the Federal Reserve, in designing its monetary policy, is unlikely to take into account the effect a given policy might have on a foreign country that has dollarized but whose economy is not moving in tandem with Washington. **********The role of central banks is the other major issue. A century ago, there were only 18 central banks, 16 of them in Europe, plus Japan and Indonesia. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913. **********Now there are 172 central banks, and more and more of them claim some degree of independence from national governments. The European Central Bank represents a new degree of independence since no one government appoints all its members. **********The claim for such independence rests largely on the success of tight monetary policies in quelling inflation in the 1980's. **********The role of the European Central Bank might prove to be the most controversial of the next decade. While one can argue that the economies of the euro zone, from Naples to Helsinki, are no more diverse than those of the United States, from Boston to Birmingham, this country has a political unity to go along with a common currency. It has much greater labor mobility, aided to no small extent by a common language, and it has a more developed system to allow fiscal transfers -- via welfare and unemployment benefits -- from prosperous regions to struggling ones. **********All that means that the challenges confronting the European Central Bank in bad times could be of a different order of magnitude than those that confront the Fed, simply because the nonmonetary means of stabilization are less developed. It is conceivable that a prolonged economic downturn could lead one European country or another to elect a government that blamed the central bank and wanted out of the euro, thereby precipitating a crisis since no exit from the euro is supposed to be possible. **********The European Central Bank is not, of course, the only one that could end up being vilified if economies went bad. The most important question for the future of the international monetary system may be what would happen if faith in central banks were damaged so badly that alternative ways of managing currency values were sought. Some think that gold would make a comeback, as the only real money. Alternatively, a currency's value might be tied to a basket of commodities. **********One central banker, Mervyn King, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, has even suggested that new computer technologies might end up making it possible for financiers effectively to bypass government-created money, creating their own relative values through trading. The unit of account, he said, might be a commodity standard, leaving central banks out of the equation. **********If that were to happen, he said in a speech last summer, ''central banks would lose their ability to influence monetary policy'' and ''the successors to Bill Gates would have put the successors to Alan Greenspan out of business.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/25/business/world-business-briefing-europe-nestle-has-slight-gain.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-09-25", "snippet": "Nestle SA says first-half profit was little changed; net income rose to 2.08 billion Swiss francs ($1.37 billion) from restated 2.07 billion (S)1", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NESTLE HAS SLIGHT GAIN", "print_headline": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: EUROPE; NESTLE HAS SLIGHT GAIN", "body_text": " **********Nestle S.A, the world's largest food maker, said first-half profit was little changed as it spent savings from efficiency gains to promote products like Nescafe coffee and Kit Kat candy bars.

Their names are symbols of how firmly the earthquake has sealed the alliance between Israel and Turkey. **********''God bless the Israelis,'' said one new mother, Serap Balcioglu, whose child was born blue and seemingly lifeless but was revived by an emergency team at the hospital. ''They're taking beautiful care of me. What would we do without them?'' **********Over the last few years, Israel and Turkey have built a strategic partnership that has altered the face of Middle East politics. Trade and tourism are booming in both directions. Israeli pilots practice maneuvers in Turkish airspace, and Israeli technicians are modernizing Turkish combat jets. There are plans for Israel to share its high-tech skills with Turkey, and for Turkey to send some of its plentiful fresh water to Israel. **********Military commanders, Cabinet ministers and business leaders agree that this new friendship makes good sense for both parties. But it took the earthquake to show that it has become more than political -- and has clearly taken deep root among ordinary people. **********''There has been so much tourism and so many business and political contacts between the two countries in the last few years that almost everyone in Israel feels some kind of personal connection to Turkey,'' said Benjamin Krasna, an Israeli diplomat who has spent much of the last week working on earthquake relief projects. ''You pick up a 16-page newspaper in Tel Aviv and 6 pages are about the quake. It shows what Turkey means to Israel today. Israel sees Turkey as a neighbor, a brother, a partner.'' **********''We've sent relief teams to help after disasters in plenty of countries, and our people support that,'' Mr. Krasna said. ''But those other disasters didn't provoke the same emotional response among our people. Things have changed because of the nature of our relationship with Turkey.'' **********Israel was one of the first countries to respond to news of the earthquake, which devastated Adapazari and much of the surrounding area. It sent 350 search-and-rescue specialists with teams of dogs. They were at work the morning after the quake, and in the days that followed they found and saved 12 buried people. **********The hospital team followed quickly, and set up operations in the muddy front yard of a damaged official building here. Doctors and nurses treated hundreds of earthquake victims, and now that the initial trauma is past they are dealing with infections, broken limbs and all the other medical problems that are normal in a community of 300,000 people. **********Israeli officials are now discussing the possibility of sponsoring long-term earthquake relief projects in Turkey. They may build a town to replace one of those that were destroyed, or perhaps assume responsibility for rebuilding hospitals in the affected area. Top officials of the Foreign and Defense Ministries, accompanied by the director general of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office, have already been here to survey Turkey's needs. **********''Israelis are absolutely obsessed with the earthquake,'' said Barry Rubin, an Israeli scholar who has written extensively about the Turkish-Israeli relationship. **********''There's a psychological as well as a political reason for this,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''Jews and Turks have historically been thought of as outsiders, especially in Europe. They are two peoples who are extremely conscious of who their friends are. But even though I've been following this subject for 10 years, I'm amazed at how many messages I've received since the earthquake. Israelis want to know what they can do to help, and Turks want to say how grateful they are.'' **********Not everyone in Turkey considers Israel an ideal partner. Some leaders of the Islamic political movement have suggested that Muslim countries, including traditional enemies of Israel like Iran and Libya, would be more suitable. **********Many Turks feel a solidarity with Palestinians, and are deeply disturbed when they see pictures of Israeli soldiers shooting at or beating Palestinian protesters in the West Bank. Others complain that Israel has not been vigorous enough in its condemnation of Kurdish rebels who have been fighting the Turkish Army for years. **********But the relationship between Turkey and Israel is no longer the province only of generals, politicians and corporate executives, but of the peoples of both countries. **********''After what has happened since the earthquake,'' said Hasan Koni, a professor of international relations at Ankara University, ''it's going to be very hard for anyone to criticize the relationship. Even people who have been suspicious of Israel must now see that after the United States, Israel has become the country we can trust most. That is now clearer than ever.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/business/investing-diary-no-rush-to-upgrade-internet-stocks.html": {"writer_name": "Sana Siwolop", "pub_date": "1999-05-30", "snippet": "Stock analysts have generally not upgraded their recommendations for Internet stocks as prices of such stocks slid sharply (M)", "word_count": 248, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "No Rush To Upgrade Internet Stocks", "print_headline": "INVESTING: DIARY; No Rush To Upgrade Internet Stocks", "body_text": " **********It's been a black spring for Internet stocks, with the Bloomberg Internet Index falling 26.5 percent since its high on April 13.

Casey, of the Pentagon's policy planning staff, and several Russian generals who flew from Moscow aboard an American military plane, the Pentagon said. **********A senior Russian officer at the airport said this morning that his troops, which moved into Kosovo from peacekeeping duties in Bosnia, intended to stay in place as part of the international security force. **********He declined to give his full name, but was addressed as ''general,'' and he said the Russians would be reinforced and be in Kosovo ''a long time.'' **********The race for Pristina had bizarre aspects, but the Russian entrance into the capital created great enthusiasm among ordinary Serbs, who greeted the Russians like a liberating army at about 1:30 this morning. **********The Serbs, many of whom are afraid of revenge from returning Albanians, yelled slogans of gratitude, chanted, cheered, threw flowers and fired guns in celebration. **********It was not immediately clear how much Belgrade, or the Kremlin, had orchestrated the Russian move. The Russian military is angry over Moscow's role in pushing the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, to give in to most of NATO's key demands, and has insisted on having its own command structure if it is to take part in the Kosovo force. **********One Yugoslav official said the race between East and West to Pristina was a pale comparison to the race to conquer Hitler's Berlin as the Nazi regime collapsed. It reminded him, he said, of Marx's dictum that history repeats itself, ''the first time as tragedy, and the second as farce.'' **********He acknowledged that the Russian voice would soon become muted in Kosovo's affairs as the rest of the NATO-led force moved into the province and hundreds of thousands of Albanians began to return to their homes, aided by thousands of foreign refugee workers. **********The peace force commander will share authority in Kosovo with a civilian administrator to be appointed by the United Nations. That job, Secretary General Kofi Annan announced today in New York, will be filled temporarily by a Brazilian diplomat, Sergio Vieira di Mello, while American, European and United Nations officials negotiate over who will get the job permanently. **********In the meantime, thousands of Serbs, fearing revenge at the hands of returning Albanians, have left Kosovo for Serbia proper. Today, near the airport, a column of Serbs from Djakovica, a few miles from the Albanian border, waited for the Serbian police to let them continue out of the province. **********Vukosav Slavkovic, 86, had just left the home of his grandparents to travel with his family in a tiny red  car to relatives near Kragujevac. A battered suitcase sat on the roof, with a large blanket. **********''I left everything, a house and furniture,'' Mr. Slavkovic said. ''This is what we took, one blanket.'' **********He was angry. ''When the Serbs had a state 600 years ago, Indians were hunting in California,'' he said.

For the Secretary of State, the half-hour visit was the vindication that top officials, whose policy has been questioned and even skewered in some quarters, savor far beyond the moment. **********''We have fought this war so that you, the refugees, could go home,'' she told a crowd of barefoot children and roughly dressed men and women who had struggled over the border to escape the Serbs. **********Now she reassured them. ''Milosevic and the Serbs have lost control over Kosovo,'' Ms. Albright said. ''You will go home and be able to live a decent normal life and do it your way.'' **********Six miles outside this capital, the Stenkovac 1 camp, run by Catholic Relief Services and host to 20,000 refugees, has been the most popular stopping point for politicians and other figures since it was set up in the days after the air strikes began.

She has already cautioned that winter might fall before all the refugees have safely returned to their homes and that preparations had to be made to winterize their tents. **********In another tent, Ms. Albright heard about the desire for revenge against the Serbs that many ethnic Albanians say they feel. ''The Serbian people are troublemakers,'' Tahir Shelova, 39, said. ''They must pay for this.'' **********Ms. Albright also addressed several hundred American troops, another favorite constituency during the war. The Secretary often praised the valor of American pilots who flew over Serbia. The forces assembled in a tent were part of an advance guard of the 7,000-member American contingent that is preparing to enter Kosovo with French, British and other NATO troops. **********Ms. Albright told the troops that they were embarking on a distinctive mission.

With an eye to his political fortunes, the same maverick Governor and former President who provoked Brazil's currency crisis in January by defaulting on his state's foreign debt is now seeking to sabotage a crucial federal government program to privatize state-owned companies. **********Heeding a call by Itamar Franco, the Governor of Minas Gerais state, the board of its electric utility agreed on Thursday to expel directors representing minority shareholders including two American companies, the AES Corporation and the Southern Company. In 1997, the companies acquired a one-third interest in the utility, known as Cemig, and have since invested nearly $1 billion under a contract that Mr. Franco, backed by a sympathetic state court, now refuses to recognize. **********''We are completely shocked by the action taken by Minas Gerais,'' said Richard Owen, vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean for Southern, one of the biggest utilities in the United States. ''This could reflect on the appetite foreign companies have in future privatizations.'' **********Mr. Franco has also campaigned to block the privatization of Furnas Electrical, a utility that supplies power to nearly half of Brazil's 165 million people. Recently he went so far as to threaten to divert the course of the rivers that feed the giant Furnas dam, situated in his state, if the utility is sold. **********In addition, Mr. Franco has dispatched state military police to conduct maneuvers in the area around the dam and has established a command base there. Though he has not explicitly threatened to use those forces to block private investors from taking control of Furnas, he has cited the crucial role of the military police in coups in 1932 and 1964. **********To what extent the actions of Mr. Franco, who was elected Governor of Brazil's third-most populous state last year, are motivated by ideology, as opposed to personal grievances, is hard to determine. As President from 1992 through 1994, he ushered in a period of economic stability, but most of the credit went to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was his Finance Minister and is now serving a second term as President. **********One of Mr. Franco's first acts after taking office in January was to decree a moratorium on payment of his state's debts both to the central government and to foreign creditors, which set off a crisis that resulted in a 40 percent devaluation of the Brazilian currency. **********Despite the criticism that earned him, Mr. Franco is said by political analysts still to harbor hopes of returning to the presidency when elections are held in 2002. **********His chances are considered slim, however, since many Brazilians regard him as irresponsible and even clownish. Cartoonists and comedians habitually mock the pompadour hair style that is his trademark. They like to poke fun at his irascibility and penchant, at 67, for romantic pursuits of women half his age. **********''Itamar came into office obsessed with screwing things up for Cardoso as much as he could,'' said David Fleischer, a professor of political science at the University of Brasilia and publisher of a widely read political newsletter. ''He is totally vain, thinks he is going to be Brazil's savior, and is thoroughly convinced he can get the nomination.'' **********After trying for several weeks to ignore Mr. Franco's latest challenge, the federal government finally fired back on Oct. 1. Asked at a luncheon of the Council of the Americas in New York about Mr. Franco's behavior, Arminio Fraga, head of Brazil's central bank, dismissed the former President as an eccentric whose actions were unjustly tarnishing the entire country's image. **********''You shouldn't think that is Brazil,'' Mr. Fraga was quoted as saying in Brazilian news reports. ''That is Minas. If you are minority investors, find another state and not Minas Gerais.'' **********The political fallout has been both immediate and extensive. At the behest of the Governor's allies, Mr. Fraga this week was ''invited'' to explain his remarks to a congressional committee, and talks aimed at getting Minas Gerais to end its debt moratorium are said to have stalled. **********Mr. Franco himself has sued Mr. Fraga in a state court, seeking damages for his remarks. He also has accused the central bank chief, who has an American mother, of being more loyal to the United States than Brazil. **********While Mr. Franco's behavior is regarded with a certain bemusement here, it comes at a delicate moment. In a setback to the austerity program Mr. Cardoso pledged to carry out as part of a $41.5 billion rescue package signed with the International Monetary Fund last November, the Supreme Court ruled last week that two important taxes on civil servants were illegal. **********Mr. Cardoso's economic team has been scrambling to find new sources of revenue to fill the gap left by that decision. **********Mr. Fraga acknowledged in New York that ''we are very annoyed'' at what he called the former President's potentially damaging efforts to drive away private capital. **********But Mr. Franco's defiant stance has also, as the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo noted in an editorial this week, ''given him political vitality.'' In particular, he has scored points with nationalist and populist groups on the left. **********''A people who do not control their own sources of energy have no autonomy,'' said Joao Pedro Stedile, leader of the Movement of the Landless, a peasant group. If Brazil were to completely privatize its electricity sector, he said, it would be ''transformed into a gigantic, Portuguese-speaking Puerto Rico,'' so his group ''is in total solidarity with Itamar.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/29/world/a-sport-called-extreme-with-reason.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1999-07-29", "snippet": "Article on canyoning notes that it has emerged as trendy 'extreme' sport in Europe and US, ranking somewhere between bungee jumping and whitewater rafting in its thrills and spills; it remains particularly popular in Switzerland, Austria and Franc...", "word_count": 618, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Sport Called Extreme, With Reason", "print_headline": "A Sport Called Extreme, With Reason", "body_text": " **********Canyoning has emerged as a trendy ''extreme'' sport, ranking somewhere between bungee jumping and whitewater rafting in its heart-thumping thrills and spills. **********Canyoning usually involves roping down into a river gorge, then riding the fast whitewater by swimming, sliding or jumping from rock to rock to the eventual safety of dry land. In Europe, the protective uniform includes a helmet, wet suit and slippers, life jacket and climbing harness. **********In the United States, where it is called canyoneering, the sport is more laid back. For years hikers in southern Utah have been roping down into narrow sandstone canyons and then walking, wading and swimming out. **********The extreme aspects of the sport caught on a decade and a half ago in Europe. It remains particularly popular in Switzerland, Austria and France as an income-producing counterpart to traditional winter sports. **********Canyoning has since taken root in Australia, Brazil, South Africa and the Caribbean, where it attracts new tourists in search of something more exciting than the beach or handicrafts market. **********In the Dominican Republic, a canyoning outfitter, Get Wet, promises the excitement of ''really letting go, leaping, diving'' near the Jimenoa Falls, finishing up with a 50-foot waterfall rappel and a 16-foot jump into the local lake to bask in ''a certain standing applause from the many excursion holidaymakers who visit here as part of their tourist schedule.'' **********In Brazil, an outfitter, Grade VI, offers a canyoning course that includes rappels off powerful waterfalls at Pinheirinho (116 feet) and Saltao (230 feet). **********The risks of such a sport are not limited to falls. The worst danger is posed by flash floods that surge without warning through narrow canyons with the force of water blasted from a fire hose. **********In August 1997, a flash flood killed 11 casual hikers in Lower Antelope Canyon in northern Arizona. **********In July 1993, two adults with a Mormon youth group drowned after they roped down into a 700-foot canyon in Zion National Park in southern Utah and began working their way downstream; another adult and five teen-agers were stranded on a ledge for four perilous days. The party was unaware that floodgates had opened at the head of the canyon. **********Cheto Olais, the chief ranger at Zion, said that perhaps 10 percent of the park's 2.8 million visitors a year engage in canyoneering. ''It's basically climbing, hiking, rappelling and swimming in cold, cold water, because some of these slot canyons never see the sun,'' he said. **********Most canyoneers at Zion, he said, were experienced enough not to go out when there were thunderstorms to set off flash floods. ''They have to determine whether they want to pursue it or back off,'' Ranger Olais said. ''We try to provide a wilderness experience and there's some inherent danger from Mother Nature.'' **********Cindy Lee, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, said it  permitted canyoneering only at Zion and Canyonlands National Parks in southern Utah. Outward Bound, the National Outdoor Wilderness Leadership School and other prominent outdoor-skills programs do not teach canyoneering. Serious climbers and hikers tend to view the sport, as practiced in Europe at least, as little more than a stunt. **********Jed Williamson, a former chief climbing instructor and program director for Outward Bound, said extreme canyoneering comes with a high ''C.T. factor,'' shorthand for cheap thrills. **********''It seems like a good idea and produces a lot of adrenalin rush, but there are some consequences,'' said Mr. Williamson, who is now the president of outdoor-oriented Sterling College in Craftsbury, Vt., referring to the 19 canyoners killed Tuesday in Switzerland."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/world/crisis-balkans-neighborhood-macedonia-village-typifies-peaceful-coexistence-b.html": {"writer_name": "David Rohde", "pub_date": "1999-05-30", "snippet": "1,500 Macedonians and Albanians who live in Radiovce, Macedonia, inhabit separate worlds; they speak different languages, send their children to different schools and never intermarry; village is even physically split, bisected by asphalt road wit...", "word_count": 1210, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Macedonia Village Typifies: (a) Peaceful Coexistence (b) Dormant Hatred", "print_headline": "CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE NEIGHBORHOOD; Macedonia Village Typifies: (a) Peaceful Coexistence (b) Dormant Hatred", "body_text": " **********The Macedonians and Albanians living in this village of 1,500 people till their soil side by side, experiencing birth, marriage and death within easy earshot of one another. **********But they inhabit separate worlds, speaking different languages, sending their children to different schools and never intermarrying. The village is even physically split, bisected by a thin asphalt road with Albanian homes largely on one side and Macedonian ones on the other. **********While the dividing line is thin, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the arrival of more than 230,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in Macedonia have widened the distance between the dual worlds of Radiovce. About 260 refugees from Kosovo have been taken in by Albanian families here. Not one has been taken in by Macedonians. **********''They are not interested at all,'' said Ejup Ziberi, 33, an Albanian who heads a local emergency aid committee. ''We haven't had any help from them.'' **********Ethnic Macedonians, who make up two-thirds of the nation's population, are Orthodox Christian. Albanians, who account for most of the remaining third, are typically Muslim. Macedonian is a Slavic language; Albanian is Indo-European. **********On the surface, the village is a travel poster for what the United States says can work in the Balkans: people of different backgrounds and religions living peacefully side by side. But critics see folly in the Western notion of a multiethnic Balkan society, which they consider a contradiction in terms. **********Still, the villagers here, while on edge now, have peacefully lived out their dual existence for decades. Western diplomats desperate to hold Macedonia together argue that if the tenuous society in villages like Radiovce can hold together, Macedonia will stand as a bulwark of peaceful coexistence next to Croatia, Bosnia and now Kosovo. **********But listen to Slavko Kirovski, a Macedonian store owner here: ''I don't hate them, but if the Albanians in this village make any problem with my child I will kill them. You cannot believe their talk. You cannot trust a dog.'' **********He said that the ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo had only themselves to blame for their plight. They should not have pushed for independence from Yugoslavia, he said, and any similar demands or violence from local Albanians will not be tolerated here. **********For the last decade, Kosovo has stood as the first domino in a theory that envisions ethnic conflict spreading south across the Balkans. Macedonia would be the second. Radiovce, for its part, is wobbling. **********It is an atypical village. In most rural areas Albanians and Macedonians live entirely apart, with Albanian villages concentrated in the country's northwest. Macedonia's cities, which account for just over half the country's population, tend to be more mixed ethnically. But even in Skopje, the capital and by far the most integrated city, Albanians tend to live on one side of the Vardar River and Macedonians on the other. **********At first blush, the differences between the groups are vast. Macedonians are Slavs, like Russians and Serbs, with whom they generally sympathize, while Albanians are an ethnic group unique to Europe. The Macedonian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet and is closely related to Serbo-Croatian, which is spoken in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia. Albanian uses the Roman alphabet. **********But there is little physical difference between them, and young Albanians and Macedonians have trouble telling one another apart. Both groups wear Western clothes and covet Levi's, Nike sneakers and the latest in American and European fashions and music. Older Macedonians and Albanians can be picked out by some clothes they wear, particularly the white, cone-shaped hats called pils, worn by many older Albanian men. **********Schooling, a common magnet for integration elsewhere, is largely separate here. Following a system from the former Yugoslavia, Albanian and Macedonian children go to school together until the fourth grade. Then, through high school, students are segregated, sometimes within the same school. In Radiovce, for example, Macedonian children are bused to a nearby all-Macedonian village while Albanians stay in the local school. **********Festim Baftaijari, a 13-year-old Albanian boy from Radiovce, said he had a few Macedonian friends in the village. ''Some of them are good and some of them are bad,'' he said, showing a youthful color-blindness. When asked whether he talked to Macedonian girls, he giggled. **********Avramoska Rosana, an 11-year-old Macedonian girl who lives on the other side of the village, said she had Albanian friends but conceded that they were not close. ''We say hello and make conversation with the Albanian kids,'' she said. ''But we don't play with them.'' **********Tensions among teen-agers were difficult to gauge, with some saying fights were common and others not. But it is clear that dating is strictly taboo. There is not a single mixed marriage in the village. Each side blames the other for the situation. **********''Macedonian men consider Albanians like a second class,'' said Esat Ebdiu, 31, an Albanian electrician in Radiovce, ''so you can imagine what they consider Albanian women. They don't even speak to them.'' **********Albanians complained that the job market, the police force and the university all favor Macedonians. But Macedonians said the opposite, saying local preference programs unfairly give jobs and university admission slots to Albanians who do not deserve them. **********And Macedonians complained at length about the high birth rate of Albanians -- one of the highest in Europe. They said that although Macedonians were in the majority in Radiovce 50 years ago, the village was now evenly divided because of the Albanian birth rate. Albanians denied this. **********''The Albanian women have many children, 8 or 10 kids, like worms,'' said Milevska Jaglika, 62, a Macedonian villager. **********But despite the criticism there was evidence of peaceful coexistence. For every negative comment about Albanians that Ms. Jaglika made, her soft-spoken neighbor, 60-year-old Markovska Sofija, said something conciliatory. **********''I feel sorry for the refugees,'' Ms. Sofija said. ''It's difficult for both sides, for the Macedonians and the Albanians, for the moment.'' **********And Baskim Nuredini, a 29-year-old Albanian cafe owner, emerged from a Macedonian friend's home in Radiovce today and predicted war would never come here. ''We see what's happening in Kosovo,'' he said. ''I think we can do better.'' **********In the end, the clearest message from both communities in Radiovce was fear. Macedonians fear that they will soon be outnumbered. Albanians fear that like their kin in Kosovo, they will be expelled. **********Vladimir Milcin, a Macedonian playwright and the director of the Open Society Institute in Skopje, says much depends on whether the Macedonian Government and society develop structures that assuage visceral fears, instead of fueling them. **********''Many things in the Balkans are not in the field of rationality,'' he said. ''A lot of emotions are still running our lives.'' **********Mr. Milcin said that most people in the Balkans would probably prefer not to live in a multiethnic society. But they realize that on a practical level, after witnessing the wars that destroyed Yugoslavia, their lives and land are so intertwined with each other that trying to separate into new, ethnically separate nations would prove catastrophic. **********''For sure, the will to fight is lower than the resistance to living together,'' he said. ''I still believe we are going to survive.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/14/business/international-business-mexicans-in-us-say-wiring-money-can-be.html": {"writer_name": "Rick Wills", "pub_date": "1999-08-14", "snippet": "Mexicans in the United States say wiring money back to Mexico is too expensive; Western Union Financial Services and Moneygram Payment Systems Inc have settled costly class-action suits accusing them of profiteering; Mexican central bank estimates...", "word_count": 979, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Mexicans in U.S. Say Wiring Money Can Be Costly", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; Mexicans in U.S. Say Wiring Money Can Be Costly", "body_text": " **********Like millions of Mexicans, Miriam Sagaon Rojas worked for a time as a factory laborer in the United States to earn dollars when things were hard back home.

Two other senior executives in the United States resigned. The circumstances of their departures remain unclear, but they all said they had expressed strong differences with the company over its rates for wire transfers to Mexico. **********Western Union declined to comment about these former employees, saying that to do so would violate standard corporate policy unless they gave written consent, which none of them had done. But in a statement, the company denied that any executives had been dismissed for stating an opinion.

Western Union exchanges customer dollars at 90 percent of the benchmark exchange rate set by the central bank, sometimes less. **********A study by the United States Congress found that Western Union gave better exchange rates in countries where customers had a wider range of options, including India, Spain, Canada and the Philippines. **********Western Union also charges transfer fees ranging from $12 to $25. Although fees have fallen recently in response to litigation, sending $100 to Mexico can still cost about $25. **********Several Hispanic executives who had problems with Western Union said they believed these fees were unfair to Mexican immigrants in the United States who had limited financial resources. **********''Western Union has become its own worst enemy simply because it is so greedy,'' said Alejandro Urtiz, who was director of Hispanic development at Western Union until being dismissed in January. Mr. Urtiz said Western Union had accused him of trying to establish a competing electronic transfer company. He denied the accusation and said he believed he was dismissed because he criticized the company's prices. **********Hector Bidegain was dismissed in December as director of sales for Orlandi Valuta, the Western Union subsidiary. Mr. Bidegain said he believed he had been dismissed for speaking out against the company's exchange rate at a Western Union convention in July 1998. **********Elias Mercado, who arranged Western Union's joint venture with the Elektra appliance stores in Mexico in 1994, said he was dismissed as head of Mexican operations two years later. According to court records in Mexico, he had written a report urging the company to offer what he called a more equitable exchange rate. **********Mr. Mercadio won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit in Mexico and was rehired and assigned to work in Colorado. He declined to comment on his case. **********Peter Ziverts, a Western Union spokesman, said the prices charged for transfers to Mexico reflected the quality of the service, which includes toll-free operators and the delivery of cash in 15 minutes. **********Still, Western Union's prices have been coming down, and critics say the drop in prices is a result of legal pressure. **********A class-action lawsuit filed against Western Union and Moneygram in Federal District Court in Chicago accused the companies of failing to disclose exchange rates. When the lawsuit was settled in May, Western Union agreed to pay $2 million to Hispanic community organizations, and Moneygram agreed to pay $300,000. The companies also agreed to make $375 million in discount coupons available to anyone who had wired money to Mexico since 1987. **********Rob Ayres, an executive vice president of Moneygram, said his company had made the exchange rate information on its remittance forms easier to understand. The company's settlement payment, he said, was more a good will gesture than an admission of guilt. ''This was just a way to get it resolved,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/17/world/remaking-a-vast-frontier-in-china-s-image.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Eckholm", "pub_date": "1999-07-17", "snippet": "Article discusses efforts by Chinese Government to transform mainly Muslim frontier region of Xinjiang into cities and farms; Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which has led China's drive to settle region, has built whole cities and hund...", "word_count": 1499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Remaking a Vast Frontier in China's Image", "print_headline": "Remaking a Vast Frontier in China's Image", "body_text": " **********South of this onetime camel stop on the Silk Road, bulldozers and men with spades flounder in the wickedly fine sand, leveling dunes into fields in China's own version of the taming of the West. **********Soon a stretch of the Taklimakan Desert will be transformed into an oasis of cotton and rice. And another enclave of ethnic Chinese will spring up in the mainly Muslim frontier region of Xinjiang. **********The men and machines are the advance guard of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a huge, little-known organization that for nearly half a century has led China's drive to settle -- and secure -- this alien region with a turbulent history and China's most violent separatist movement. **********The Corps, as it is known, is practically a world unto itself. It has built whole cities and hundreds of farms and factories producing more than one-third of Xinjiang's cotton and other goods. With workers and their families numbering 2.4 million, 97 percent of them ethnic Chinese, it runs its own university and television station, its own militias and prison camps. **********In the tradition of settlers anywhere, Corps leaders look on their works with an exalted sense of achievement -- and seemingly little understanding of how indigenous people, the dwindling majority of Muslim Uighurs and others, might respond to the onslaught. **********''We've made towns and cities where there was nothing but a vast wasteland, blank spots on the map,'' said Wang Guizhen, the deputy commissar. ''That is a source of great pride for the Corps.'' **********Although Uighurs want economic progress, and have benefited from regional development, they worry about their culture, and many resent the Chinese domination of politics, water resources and production. **********''The Corps says it's here to help local development, but look at us -- we're still poor,'' said a Uighur teacher. ''Uighurs see the Corps as a military agency. They don't want us, and we don't want to work under them.'' **********Leaders of the Corps, by contrast, unabashedly recite its mission, laid down at its inception in the heyday of militant Communism in the 1950's: ''To develop Xinjiang, defend the nation's borders and protect social stability.'' **********When the Chinese Communists gained control of the northwestern frontier in 1949, they felt special measures were required to hold it. All desert and mountain, Xinjiang accounts for one-sixth of China's land area, yet even now it has a population of little more than 17 million. Over the last two centuries, it has been the scene of repeated revolts. **********To tame this wild land, the Corps was formed as a paramilitary organization of cashiered soldiers, convicts and volunteers. In this landscape of scorching summers and subzero winters, the early pioneers endured hardships that are now legendary in China, living in branch-covered holes and pulling plows with their own shoulders. Some fought die-hard remnants of the defeated Chinese Nationalists. ''In those days we held a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other,'' Mr. Wang said in an interview in Urumqi, the provincial capital. **********The mythic struggles of the early pioneers are now being honored in a dramatic television series, filmed on location and featuring the adventures of 8,000 women who were sent as soldiers to join the men in the desert in the early 1950's. **********These days Corps militias and armed police sometimes aid the army and civil authorities in quelling riots. But its primary contribution to security is more basic. **********''Over time, 'defending' became more a matter of occupying real estate than of bearing arms,'' said James D. Seymour, a China expert at Columbia University who has studied the Corps. ''It is a corporation whose purpose is to colonize.'' **********With the Corps as a spearhead, the number of Chinese in Xinjiang has grown dramatically. In 1949 there were just 300,000, but by 1997, more than 6 million Chinese made up 38 percent of the population, according to official figures. **********Uighurs number 8 million, or 47 percent of the total, while 1.2 million Kazakhs and numerous smaller groups round out the total. **********Today the children of the early pioneers have taken over their parents' jobs, supplemented by a stream of Chinese migrants. But Corps leaders say their overall numbers have largely stabilized, with new arrivals offset by retirees returning home. **********The Corps operates in parallel with the provincial authorities, reporting directly to Beijing. Over the decades it has created hundreds of enclaves of Chinese culture within the Islamic Xinjiang of exotic bazaars, bearded men in skull caps and women in scarves or veils. **********The Chinese settlements are concentrated in an arc along the western border, which in the 1960's and 70's was -- in Chinese eyes -- menaced by the Soviet Union. **********Today that border is with three countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The military menace has diminished as China has fostered good ties with those nations. But a revival of cross-border ties among Uighurs and related ethnic groups may be promoting Uighur nationalism, and Chinese authorities say they have found weapons smuggled from Central Asia to Uighur separatists in Xinjiang. **********The showcase of the Chinese effort to bind this vast territory closer to the rest of China is Shihezi, west of Urumqi, an all-Chinese model city of 220,000 people surrounded by Chinese farming towns. **********Each of the 174 Corps farming complexes is a Chinese stronghold. Driven by zeal as much as by economics, the Corps still reclaims more than 100,000 acres from the desert each year, usually expanding from existing farms. **********For decades this was a project powered by the paramilitary, communal nature of the Corps. In the new, more market-oriented China, even the Corps is trying to transform itself into a corporate conglomerate, battling low farm prices and obsolete factories by avidly seeking foreign investors. Its No. 1 Agricultural Division, with large holdings in Aksu Prefecture, has even sold shares on the Shanghai exchange to raise money for new desert development. **********''We are pushing back the desert,'' gushed Yang Haihan, vice commander of the division. ''We are improving the environment.'' **********In centuries past, Aksu was one of the main Uighur oases of southern Xinjiang. Here, from the desert floor, snow-capped peaks of the Tianshan Mountains are visible year-round, the source of the river waters that permit agriculture. **********On a recent tour, the ethnic divide was evident, along with the formidable achievements of the Corps. But, accompanied at all times by several officials, including one who videotaped every encounter, a foreign reporter was not permitted to speak privately with Uighurs or with ordinary Corps workers. **********Today, 1.8 million people crowd into the Aksu area, surrounded by desert. More than three-fourths of them are Uighurs, mostly living in mud-brick villages where they farm cotton, grains and melons. The Corps has 264,000 people in the area, divided between Aksu City and numerous farms. **********Aksu City has the look and rhythms of mainstream China: On a summer evening, pop music blares from the multistory Corps recreation building and hundreds of Chinese couples and retirees gather to practice the fox trot. **********In the Uighur corner of the city, a modest minaret pokes into the sky, radios play wailing ballads and shops offer stacks of flat breads. **********Officials insist that all groups in Aksu are living in harmony. But on the streets are Government signs saying ''Oppose National Separatism'' and ''Defend Social Stability.'' Here and in other Uighur centers, with an unknown degree of public support, festers a violent movement that seeks an independent East Turkistan. **********In 1998, according to an article in The Xinjiang Daily, the police in Aksu Prefecture ''wiped out a number of terrorist gangs, confiscated a number of firearms, demolition devices and reactionary propaganda materials, and discovered a number of underground scripture-lecturing places and underground military-skill schools.'' **********Xinjiang's political leaders have spoken publicly about the ''grim situation'' and ''fierce struggle'' against separatism in the province. So far this year, the executions of at least 18 Uighurs for bombings, murders of officials, arms smuggling and other crimes have been reported in newspapers; hundreds of Uighurs, perhaps thousands, are in prison for political offenses. **********An article on June 2 in a Hong Kong newspaper with close ties to the Beijing Government said that to fight the ''heinous'' armed separatist movement in Xinjiang, economic development must speed up and Chinese immigration via the Corps should accelerate. **********''The purpose is to adjust the proportions of the populations of different ethnic groups in this region, especially in its southern part,'' said the article, in Ta Kung Pao. **********It is unclear whether the article reflects a proposal under serious debate. **********Mr. Wang, the deputy commissar, said the development contributes to stability by helping all of Xinjiang's people. Certainly living standards have improved, even if the Chinese remain better off on average, and many Uighurs and members of other minority groups benefit from Government projects. In Urumqi and Aksu, Uighur professionals are visible on the streets, working easily with Chinese counterparts. **********But many Uighurs have a deeper fear. **********''They're all aware that Inner Mongolia is now only about 14 percent Mongol,'' said Dru C. Gladney, dean of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu. ''They just don't want that to happen to Xinjiang. On the other hand, they do want development.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/08/business/ex-employees-sue-first-union-over-costs-of-401-k-plan.html": {"writer_name": "David Johnston", "pub_date": "1999-09-08", "snippet": "Former First Union Corp employees sue bank, charging it runs its 401(k) pension plan to earn profits at expense of workers; hold it charges higher fees to its workers than to those of companies whose much smaller plans it manages; claim it routine...", "word_count": 657, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ex-Employees Sue First Union Over Costs of 401(k) Plan", "print_headline": "Ex-Employees Sue First Union Over Costs of 401(k) Plan", "body_text": " **********Federal law requires that companies operate their retirement plans solely to benefit their workers, but a lawsuit filed yesterday accuses the First Union Corporation, which owns the nation's sixth-largest bank, of operating its 401(k) plan to earn ''monopolistic profits'' at the expense of its workers. **********The suit contends that First Union, based in Charlotte, N.C., has charged higher fees to its workers than it has to those of companies whose much smaller 401(k) plans it manages. **********First Union's 401(k) plan ''fees and expenses are routinely hidden from participants, and in some cases, are affirmatively misrepresented'' as being waived or discounted, according to the lawsuit, filed by 18 former employees in Federal District Court in Richmond. **********The suit quotes internal memorandums that it says indicate an active campaign to hunt for ways to extract the maximum possible fees from the First Union 401(k) plan. **********And, the suit says, when First Union wanted to move into the complicated business of keeping 401(k) records, it experimented using its 401(k) plan and then charged these costs to its workers. **********First Union, saying it would vigorously defend itself, said employees have ''a broad range of investment options which are prudently and appropriately selected'' in a plan run for their benefit. **********The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, says that First Union's 71,000 employees have suffered $100 million in damages. It seeks triple that amount, however, contending that First Union has operated as a racketeering enterprise and in violation of antitrust laws. **********The suit also says that Edward E. Crutchfield, the company's chief executive, and John Georgius, its president, knowingly allow and encourage conduct that benefits First Union at the expense of its workers and have made sure no one will ''watchdog with independence and knowledge'' the 401(k) plan. **********Mr. Crutchfield and Mr. Georgius, the suit says, ''intentionally failed to select'' executives competent to protect the interests of 401(k) plan participants. **********The suit contends that Benjamin J. Jolley, a First Union senior vice president who is on the board of the 401(k) plan, is so ill-informed about 401(k) issues that he testified recently in a related case that he did not know the difference between the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Fortune 500 ranking of top companies and had no idea which was tracked by the stock index fund offered by the First Union 401(k) plan. **********Mr. Jolley had no comment, said Donna Smart, a First Union spokeswoman. **********He testified in a lawsuit filed last May by nine former employees of Signet Bank, which First Union acquired in 1997. That suit contends that First Union moved its 401(k) savings from investments that turned in strong performances into its far-less-lucrative Evergreen funds. **********The suit filed yesterday goes much further, contending there are not just poor investment options but a long-running plan to find ways to load fees and expenses onto the 401(k) plan that has pushed costs far above what can be bought in the market from 401(k) vendors, including First Union. **********The lead plaintiff in the suit, Sue B. Franklin of Danville, Va., said that when First Union sold the bank branch where she works, it kept her 401(k) plan and did so in a way that would force her to cash out and pay taxes now if she wants her money back before she turns 59 in five years. **********''First Union is supposed to look after our money for our benefit, but they certainly have abused their power,'' Mrs. Franklin said. **********Eli Gottesdiener of Sprenger & Lang in Washington, one of the lawyers who filed the suit, said he was contacted by workers at many other banks and mutual funds who said their 401(k) savings suffered because their employers ''are engaged in similar practices to boost their fee income.'' **********Mr. Gottesdiener added, ''Unless these financial companies have controls in place, there is going to be a creeping infringment of business objectives on the needs of the plan.'' **********He said that First Union's conduct was the most egregious he had found but that more such lawsuits were being planned."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/08/business/media-talk-after-the-interview-the-good-and-the-tawdry.html": {"writer_name": "Lawrie Mifflin", "pub_date": "1999-03-08", "snippet": "MSNBC promotions urge viewers watching Barbara Walters's interview with Monica S Lewinsky on ABC to use picture-in-a-picture mode to also view MSNBC's Hockenberry; Joe Klein, journalist, appears on Ted Koppel's Nightline program to criticize media...", "word_count": 379, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Media Talk; After the Interview: The Good and the Tawdry", "print_headline": "Media Talk; After the Interview: The Good and the Tawdry", "body_text": " **********A few final observations before the Monica Lewinsky interview fades into history: **********BEST POST-MODERN MOMENT:  MSNBC's ''Hockenberry'' producers, knowing they couldn't beat 'em, tried to join 'em.

Tyumen paid only $52 million, a sharp markdown from the asking price of $145 million. **********Despite assurances from the Russian Government that BP Amoco's 10 percent investment would be protected, BP Amoco has watched valuable Sidanko subsidiaries gradually slip away over the last year and end up under the ownership, or at least the influence, of Tyumen Oil. **********The Kondpetroleum sale to Tyumen may be the most decisive blow yet: if the deal goes forward, it is likely that similar methods will be used to sell Sidanko's core oil producer, Chernogorneft, later this year. Most analysts predict that Tyumen Oil, which has long sought to buy Chernogorneft, will get it. **********''There's a good chance that Cherno will go, too, at this rate,'' said Peter Boone, director of research for the Moscow brokerage firm of Brunswick Warburg. ''The fight has been going on for a long time, and BP Amoco seems to be losing every little battle.'' **********The Kondpetroleum sale is the latest in a series of disputes that have further tarnished Russia's poor image with investors. Two weeks ago, a St. Petersburg court reversed the privatization of the Lomonosov porcelain factory, annulling a majority stake held in the company by several executives from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the $440 million U.S.-Russia Investment Fund. **********Days later, police in Vyborg, north of St. Petersburg, clashed with workers at a cellulose plant who refused to obey a court decision handing over the factory to a Britain-based owner. Last Friday, Russia's chief securities regulator resigned over what he called Russia's intractable hostility  toward outside investors. **********In the case of Sidanko, BP Amoco and many industry analysts say that Tyumen Oil has used the bankruptcy process to strip away Sidanko assets like Kondpetroleum at exceedingly low prices. Tyumen Oil has rejected such accusations. It has said BP Amoco is frustrated by the British company's own poor decision to invest in Sidanko. **********Indeed, BP Amoco two years ago picked a concern that was more a collection of scattered assets rather than a functioning company. By late last year, minor creditors had begun bankruptcy proceedings against three Sidanko units, including Kondpetroleum and Chernogorneft, and early this year Sidanko itself was pushed into bankruptcy. **********Sidanko is the largest creditor of Chernogorneft and Kondpetroleum, but since the bankruptcies began, Russian courts, especially in the Tyumen region where the companies are based, have handed down rulings contradicting creditors' wishes. BP Amoco and others accuse Tyumen Oil of unduly influencing the local courts, particularly because the head of Tyumen Oil's board, Leonid Roketsky, is also the region's governor. Tyumen Oil denies such accusations. **********The courts have installed external managers at Chernogorneft and Kondpetroleum who have refused to register debts Sidanko is owed by the units. That, in turn, reduces or voids Sidanko's role on the creditors' committees, which decide how to deal with the companies' bankruptcies. In both cases, the external managers, contrary to Sidanko's wishes, have decided to sell the production units quickly. **********In a country where business and politics are inextricable, high-level influence may ultimately decide the fate of Sidanko's units. BP Amoco has successfully lobbied Congress to delay $500 million in Export-Import Bank loan guarantees to Tyumen Oil. **********But in Russia, BP Amoco is clearly less influential than Tyumen Oil, which is owned by the powerful Alfa Group, whose top executives include former Government ministers and Kremlin insiders. Said one Moscow oil analyst, ''Domestically, Alfa has enough power, enough good connections with the current regime, to be able to go all the way on this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/06/business/tyco-completes-acquisition-of-amp.html": {"writer_name": "Bloomberg News", "pub_date": "1999-04-06", "snippet": "Tyco International Ltd completes $12.22 billion purchase of AMP Inc (S)", "word_count": 207, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tyco Completes Acquisition of AMP", "print_headline": "Tyco Completes Acquisition of AMP", "body_text": " **********Tyco International Ltd. completed the $12.22 billion purchase of AMP Inc. today, adding the world's biggest maker of electronic connectors to its array of industrial businesses. **********AMP shareholders received 0.7507 Tyco share for each share of AMP.

But you can't bank on gold anymore, either. Indeed, in the nearly six years since Mr. Eveillard started the gold fund, it has lost, on average, about 8 percent a year for its investors. Only the threat of a worsening global financial crisis last fall stopped Mr. Eveillard from liquidating the fund at the end of 1998. **********In fact, gold -- once the dependable haven for millions of worried investors -- looks a lot like just another sinking commodity these days in a world financial system dominated by inflation-fighting central bankers. Even Swiss bankers, the doyens of gold, do not push it anymore as part of a properly diversified portfolio because there are now many more efficient ways to hedge risk. And a whole generation of investors can only imagine the glory days when the price of gold cleared $800 an ounce for two days in January 1980. **********''At some point I have to say I think I have been wrong so long that maybe I am missing something,'' Mr. Eveillard admitted reluctantly. ''Maybe I was just being stubborn.'' **********In the nearly two decades since the price of gold peaked, there have not been many good seasons for the precious metal. It last touched $500 an ounce in December 1987, and it has not fetched $400 since April 1996. Its average price for 1998, $294 an ounce, was the lowest in 20 years. **********But 1999 is turning out to be especially harsh and is clearly trying the patience of even the most devoted gold bugs. Unfortunately for them, the strongest argument for gold and its special qualities is that its price is doing exactly what it should be doing in an environment of low inflation: falling. **********Yet gold's real nemeses these days are the world's central banks, which are likely to control the outlook for some time to come. **********Many central banks are selling or planning to sell portions of their huge hoards of gold, a looming presence that has driven down the price by almost 30 percent since the selling announcements by the banks accelerated in 1997. Central banks controlled about 23 percent of the above-ground stocks of gold at the end of 1998, according to Gold Fields Mineral Services, a leading precious metals research firm based in London. They have sold more than 3,100 tons of gold since 1989. **********At the same time, they are succeeding in reducing inflation, a force that has traditionally pushed the price of gold higher. **********All this allows speculators to make a pretty safe bet -- that gold will fall. And they have added to the downward pressure by selling gold months ahead in the futures market and pocketing easy profits. **********''Most things are conspiring against gold,'' said Philip Klapwijk, managing director of Gold Fields. **********Among the factors eroding gold's age-old role as a haven against political or financial disaster has been the opening of financial markets throughout the world. That means investors in many nations can put their money in another currency and in foreign stocks and bonds. In addition, there are many more sophisticated ways to hedge against risk these days. And often, as happened last year at the low point of the global financial crisis, buying United States Treasury securities is as safe as buying gold, and much easier to do. **********The shift has been reflected in gold's recent reactions to world political and financial crises. Gold managed to top $400 an ounce when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and again when the United States and its allies started a land war in January 1991 to force Saddam Hussein's army out of Kuwait. But the price plunged again quickly, even with the threat of a surge in oil prices. Gold did not budge this spring with the threat of a land war in Kosovo that could have sucked in most of Europe. **********And gold could not sustain a rally in any of the big selloffs in the stock market, either in 1987 or in 1998. In fact, the price of gold was higher before August 1998 than it was after the Russian currency devaluation that month and the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the giant hedge fund, both of which prompted the Federal Reserve to engineer three one-quarter-point cuts in interest rates to calm the world's financial markets. **********Yes, there is the Year 2000 computer bug to worry about. But the fear of a computer crisis as the new millennium begins has contributed more to the record sale this year of 1.54 million 10th-of-an-ounce American Eagle gold coins -- favored by millennium bug alarmists -- than to the price of gold itself. Some analysts still say gold will spike higher as the year 2000 draws closer. **********The debate on gold's relationship to inflation, however, is unlikely to be settled until there is another serious threat. **********Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at American Skandia Life Assurance in Shelton, Conn., says that gold is still the best barometer of future inflation. **********''I would argue that the gold signal is pointing toward zero inflation and, hence, its price should be easing down,'' he said. ''The gradual elimination of inflation renders gold a poor investment. That is how it should be. People should be buying stocks.'' **********Gold has so far failed to react to the latest ado over inflation. That is surprising, since interest rates have shot higher this year in part, traders say, because of fear that the jump in oil prices, a seesaw run-up in other commodity prices and a rebound in growth in Asia and Latin America will push consumer inflation to the 2.5 percent range, up from the 1.6 percent increase in 1998. The Consumer Price Index was up 2.3 percent for the 12 months through April. But perhaps that is simply too small a jump to stimulate action in gold. **********The worst news this year for gold was the Bank of England's announcement in early May that it planned to sell 415 metric tons, or 13.3 million ounces, of its gold bullion over the next several years. Even the World Gold Council, a trade group that represents big mining companies, acknowledged that Britain's decision would be seen as ''further evidence of official disenchantment with gold as a reserve asset.'' **********The first 25 metric tons (803,775 ounces) will be sold in July; other auctions will follow, with the aim of selling 125 tons (four million ounces) a year. Since the announcement, the price of gold has plunged 7.8 percent, to $260.35 an ounce, just above the 20-year low of $258.60, reached last week. **********Britain's big move, which amounts to shedding 58 percent of its stockpile, came on top of sales already announced over the last several years by the central banks of Belgium, Argentina, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. If it sets off a competition among central banks to sell before the price falls too much lower, it will reverberate in the gold market for years. **********And there are other major official sellers waiting in the wings. The Swiss are working on a plan that could result in the eventual sale of 1,300 tons (41.8 million ounces) of its gold reserves. Part of the money would go to survivors of the Holocaust and relatives of the victims. And the International Monetary Fund is considering selling about 161 tons (5.2 million ounces) of its reserves and using the proceeds to help the world's poorest countries. **********Central banks are also undermining the price of gold by lending their reserves to be used in trades that make it easier for gold producers to sell their product in futures markets. **********Given this year's price decline, Mr. Eveillard said his Sogen fund, which makes its bets on gold by buying stocks of gold companies, might become one of the casualties of the rout. Many gold mines have already fallen victim, including Bannockburn, Bullabulling and Mount Morgans in Australia, which have closed, and Canada's Royal Oak Mines, which has gone into receivership. **********Even the apparent good news for the industry -- that it is now cheaper to produce gold -- is bad for the price. In 1998, according to Gold Fields, the total cash cost of production fell almost 18 percent, to $206 an ounce. This means there is an incentive to produce more, only adding to the supply. **********''It is a market with no upside,'' said Bruce L. Cleland, the chief executive officer of Campbell & Company in Baltimore, a money manager that deals in foreign exchange and financial and commodity futures, including a tiny bit of gold. As an unapologetic gold bear, he believes that gold ''has been essentially demonetized by the modern financial economy.'' **********But Joseph F. Ippolito, a registered investment adviser in Malvern, Pa., feels differently. **********He started buying gold stocks in 1969 and until recently had 10 percent to 15 percent of his portfolio in two gold mining companies, TVX Gold Inc. and the Bema Gold Corporation, and one gold mutual fund. **********The plunge in the price of gold has cut that share quite a bit. TVX is now worth $1 a share while Bema Gold shares are trading at 62.5 cents -- both less than one-third of the value of their 1998 highs. **********Yet for him, he said, ''hope springs eternal. **********''I'm staying in good health,'' Mr. Ippolito, 61, added. ''I intend to be around. Sooner or later there will be a traditional world crisis and gold will respond.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/14/world/with-berger-in-catbird-seat-albright-s-star-dims.html": {"writer_name": "Jane Perlez", "pub_date": "1999-12-14", "snippet": "Sec Madeleine Albright has been effectively eclipsed in last six months by Samuel R Berger, national security adviser who enjoys proximity to Oval Office and personal relationship with Pres Clinton; Berger has influenced every recent issue, from C...", "word_count": 1359, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "With Berger in Catbird Seat, Albright's Star Dims", "print_headline": "With Berger in Catbird Seat, Albright's Star Dims", "body_text": " **********The end of the war in Kosovo was supposed to be a moment of glory for Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who had argued passionately for the fight. **********Instead, in the six months since,  Dr. Albright has been effectively eclipsed in foreign affairs by Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, who has brought his physical proximity to the Oval Office and his personal relationship with President Clinton to bear on every foreign policy issue, according to administration officials and foreign policy experts. **********From forging China's entry into the World Trade Organization, to the unsuccessful battle to win the Senate's approval of the nuclear test ban treaty, to shaping American policy toward Russia's war in Chechnya, to running President Clinton's 11-day trip to Europe, Mr. Berger's presence has been unrelenting. **********Nobody would argue that Dr. Albright has been locked out. The secretary was at center stage in the Middle East last week when the Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad, told her during their meeting in Damascus that he was prepared to resume negotiations with Israel. Her assistants were quick to note that Mr. Assad had told a visitor the week before that ''nothing can happen until the lady comes.'' **********The Israeli-Syrian breakthrough was announced by President Clinton,  but Dr. Albright was in the spotlight explaining the deal on television, even though she is less a fixture on the talk shows than she once was. **********Despite what will be continued visibility for Dr. Albright this week as the Middle East peace talks resume in Washington, officials inside and outside the administration say there is little doubt about who actually formulates the decisions. **********''There is no dispute who runs the show on foreign policy,'' said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who is working on a study of the national security council, and who worked with Mr. Berger in the first Clinton term. **********Of Dr. Albright, he said: ''She remains a participant in the process. But her weight as secretary of state in the determination of foreign policy appears less than at any time in the Clinton administration, including Secretary of State Warren Christopher's term.'' **********Mr. Berger, a trade lawyer by profession and longtime Washington political insider, has emerged on top not because of his expertise in foreign policy, said Mr. Daalder. **********Rather, what helped him rise so forcefully are his skills as a hands-on manager, his obsession with finding a consensus among top officials and the fact that, in this administration, foreign policy has often been redefined as economic policy advanced through increased trade. **********Administration officials say Mr. Berger emerged the much stronger of the pair from the Kosovo war. **********Dr. Albright, who is seen as a policy maker driven by convictions with a large human rights concern, convinced Mr. Berger and Mr. Clinton of the need to go to war against the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, many officials have said. It was a position that the president and Mr. Berger came to much later and more warily than the secretary. **********But once the war began, the White House became the center of operations, a place that Dr. Albright visited for meetings but where Mr. Clinton and Mr. Berger held the fort. For the most part, her task was to work the phones from the State Department to try to keep the NATO foreign ministers on board and fully briefed. **********The administration's foreign policy emphasis then shifted away from Dr. Albright's strengths -- the Balkans and Europe -- to China, Russia, the Middle East and Ireland -- where a special envoy, George Mitchell, reported to Mr. Berger and the president. **********At the same time, Mr. Berger was being reinforced by a bigger and more operational National Security Council than ever before. There are currently 99 policy assistants at the council (35 on loan from nongovernmental institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations), many of them micromanaging issues. A decade ago, there were about 70. **********On Mr. Clinton's recent trip to Istanbul for a meeting of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Russia was the major topic, Mr. Berger briefed reporters every day, a job often done by the White House spokesman. **********On Russia policy in general, Dr. Albright's deputy undersecretary of state, Strobe Talbott, is the key  policy maker, with Mr. Berger increasingly involved, officials said. **********Mr. Talbott, who is the administration's most frequent traveler to Moscow, writes long memos that are delivered to Dr. Albright and Mr. Berger ''concurrently and equally,'' an administration official said. The issues are then resolved at the White House, the official said. **********The secretary talks frequently with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, but Mr. Ivanov, according to administration officials, is not part of the inner workings of the Russian government. **********On China, Mr. Berger has taken the lead, a situation that Dr. Albright has said she believes is a traditional one for the White House. **********When China's entry into the World Trade Organization needed to be pushed, Dr. Albright said it was natural that the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, should be in charge. **********''She's fantastic,'' Dr. Albright said. ''She has every detail in her head; that is her job.'' **********On the fight with Congress over the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, Mr. Berger was in the catbird seat. He gave the Democratic leadership the go-ahead to try to win approval  and then negotiated -- unsuccessfully -- with Republican leaders. Neither Dr. Albright's warm relationship with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms -- a friendship she has taken great pride in -- nor Mr. Berger's political instincts helped. **********The treaty's defeat was a major setback for the administration, and Mr. Berger tried a comeback with two speeches that lambasted what he called the dangers to the United States of neo-isolationism. But after receiving poor reviews from the foreign policy establishment on the grounds that he had been too partisan, Mr. Berger dropped the theme. **********Dr. Albright had not been given an advance copy of Mr. Berger's first speech, to the Council on Foreign Relations, State Department officials said. In the interview, she said crisply: ''I write my speeches and Mr. Berger writes his speeches.'' **********Mr. Berger is not the most powerful national security adviser in recent history -- a status that that still belong to Henry Kissinger followed by Zbigniew Brzezinski. But he is surely the most political adviser. **********''He instinctively understands Mr. Clinton's needs better than anyone else,'' Mr. Daalder said. ''That makes him absolutely the best national security adviser for this president, whose involvement in foreign affairs is episodic and often driven by domestic political considerations.'' **********Mr. Berger and Dr. Albright, who know each other well from Democratic presidential campaigns and Washington salons, insist that they work together in seamless coordination. **********In an interview in his office, Mr. Berger said he and the secretary  ''work together as a team as well as any foreign policy team in the last 25 years.'' **********He is, however, sensitive about their relative positions. He took care to read in advance a State Department transcript of an interview that Dr. Albright had given to The New York Times a week earlier, in which a question suggested that Mr. Berger had assumed some of the mantle of secretary of state -- a notion that Mr. Berger hotly disputed. **********For her part, Dr. Albright said, ''As far as I am concerned a strong national security adviser is very important for a strong secretary of state.'' **********In some respects, the emphasis on teamwork is not misplaced, said Coit Blacker, who was the senior assistant on Russia on the National Security Council in Mr. Clinton's first term  and is now a professor of international relations at Stanford. **********Mr. Berger had overtaken Dr. Albright because his personality suited the president, and Dr. Albright appeared to have left a vacuum. It is Mr. Berger who has the ease of access to President Clinton, an ultimate measure of clout in any administration. **********When pressed in an interview how often she had seen President Clinton one-on-one this year, Dr. Albright replied: ''I do not keep track of it but often what happens is that I see him alone or after a meeting or I talk to him on the phone. He calls me or I call him.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/17/world/grave-of-bubis-is-desecrated-by-an-israeli.html": {"writer_name": "Ethan Bronner", "pub_date": "1999-08-17", "snippet": "Tel Aviv grave of Ignatz Bubis, head of Germany's Jewish community, is desecrated by Israeli who accuses him of being traitor to his people; Bubis, who died in Frankfurt on August 13 at age 72, asked to be buried in Israel so grave would be safe f...", "word_count": 353, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Grave of Bubis Is Desecrated By an Israeli", "print_headline": "Grave of Bubis Is Desecrated By an Israeli", "body_text": " **********The burial in Tel Aviv of Ignatz Bubis, the head of Germany's Jewish community, took a bizarre turn on Sunday when an Israeli squirted black paint onto his grave and later accused Mr. Bubis of having been a traitor to his people. **********Mr. Bubis, who died on Friday in his hometown of Frankfurt at age 72, asked to be buried in Israel so that his grave would be safe from desecration by neo-Nazis, which happened to the grave of his predecessor, Heinz Galinski. **********Meir Mendelssohn, 52, of Tel Aviv, who described himself as an artist, told reporters afterward that he had carried out the desecration because Mr. Bubis had been ''a bad man.'' **********Mr. Mendelssohn was on his way today to Germany, where he lived for 27 years -- until three years ago, said a woman who answered the telephone at his Tel Aviv residence and gave her name only as Elisheva, describing herself as his companion. **********''He knew Bubis personally very well,'' she said.

Pierce, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who heads its investigations unit. **********And crimes could hit close to home. One of the firm's clients, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency that sends checks to some 500,000 retirees, recently found its computer defenses penetrated by security experts who could have robbed it blind. The reason they didn't was that the break-in was a test of the agency's systems, determining that for all the electronic safeguards, it was vulnerable to external and internal attack. **********With businesses rushing to go online, theft and fraud are not far behind. E-commerce has spawned its own array of hard-to-detect cybercrimes, like transaction fraud and Web site destruction. The crimes are producing not only fear in corporations, but also many new assignments for auditors and consultants, who are increasingly being asked to trace e-mail and ferret out smoldering diskettes. **********But in trying to find gumshoes who can sniff out white-collar crime from three cubicles away, Big Five recruiters obviously won't find many candidates on the B-school campus. That is why, over the last 18 months, almost all of the 25 new employees hired for the Deloitte & Touche forensic and investigative services division came with law-enforcement experience. And PricewaterhouseCoopers, in addition to hiring former F.B.I. and Interpol agents, has just recruited Scott Charney, 43, formerly a top cybercop at the Justice Department. **********At Ernst & Young, the forensic investigations practice has more than tripled in two years, said Cheryl Sparkes, a partner. ''We've gone from 30 to 100 employees and we're aggressively seeking more,'' she said, ''mostly with law enforcement and other investigative backgrounds.'' **********CONSIDER Don M. Svendson, 50, hired last year after a 26-year career with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to run Deloitte & Touche's investigative office in Chicago. ''There's no end in sight to the rise in embezzlement, executive malfeasance and money laundering,'' he said. **********Though a roaring economy and the dot-com invasion make pastures greener for criminal activity, Mr. Svendson says there is more to it than that. ''Corporations are leaner and meaner, the management turnover is high and companies can't exercise all the controls they really need,'' he said. **********Mr. Svendson may well be a typical recruit -- someone with professional training in criminal justice and decades of hands-on experience. While the job may not sound as adrenaline-pumping as his previous work -- which included commanding a SWAT team in Manitoba and breaking up riots -- he says he finds it thrilling. **********Having extracted confessions from rapists and hit men, Mr. Svendson was recently asked to put his interrogation skills to work on someone suspected of embezzlement at a company after irregularities were found. Mr. Svendson said he got the employee to confess; the employee was dismissed. ''You need to know what body language to look for and how to ask the questions,'' Mr. Svendson said. **********Ed Rial, 40, recently made the leap from criminal justice to corporate fraud investigation, and is now a Deloitte partner. Mr. Rial, who dreamed as a boy of being a detective, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania law school in 1984 and took a job at the Justice Department in Manhattan. He spent almost a decade as a federal prosecutor and four years in charge of a New York office of the department's business and securities fraud unit, bringing to trial cases involving drugs, murder and kidnapping. **********With Deloitte since November, Mr. Rial specializes in hunting down corporate fraud, kickback schemes and insurance fraud. These days, he sees stock fraud as the fastest-growing white-collar crime. In particular, he cites outfits that take shell companies public, trade with cronies, then dump the shares into the public's lap through cold calls. **********''Many of these boiler-room brokers worked for years as telemarketers,'' Mr. Rial said. ''They have phenomenal sales skills and are completely unscrupulous. And it's incredible the amount of participation they get from smart people -- doctors, lawyers and educators.'' **********The quick stock-market success of Internet companies, he added, makes people  more susceptible to high-technology pitches from fraudulent promoters. And many people don't think of white-collar crime as a big issue anyhow. **********''It's because the perpetrators are often the people you grew up with, the best friend of your father,'' Mr. Rial said.''They're almost always people in very senior positions. Believe me, no one ever says, 'I always suspected him.'

A vision thing. **********People keep asking me, \"Are you bitter?\" After all, Stephen King has made a vast chunk of cash \"pioneering\" a concept that I pioneered almost eight years ago. No, I am not bitter. **********In 1994, I published the opening chapter of my novel \"Delirium\" on Time Warner's Pathfinder site. It was, by a few hours, the first novel ever serialized on the Web. Potentially, it a decisive moment in the history of publishing. **********In my own bashful way, I wanted \"Cooper\" to be engraved -- with the names Caxton and Gutenberg -- into the marble pediments of the world's great libraries. **********Short of that, I would have settled for a soup&amp;#0231;on of cash. The deal, after all, was brokered by William Morris, my agent at the time; and the publisher was Time Warner, now a minor subdivision of AOL. The agency was properly greedy on my behalf. The deal had taken ages to finesse because the world had never seen a contract of this nature, and William Morris did not wish to be left holding the short end of the precedent. **********For a time, I permitted myself to dream. I had some prior success as a novelist. My first book, \"Amnesia,\" had been a best seller in Canada (and I truly thank all six people who bought it) but no, I was not a household name. Neither, however, was the Web itself. Mosaic had just been introduced. **********Netscape was a dream, a zygote. If you had suggested to anyone that AOL would someday buy my publisher, you would have inspired wild chortling. **********And I did receive a modest passel of fame. The book's release was covered by Rolling Stone, and the precedent was acknowledged by The Wall Street Journal, Japanese Esquire and the inaugural edition of Wired UK. **********And, for what it's worth, the whole business earned me an entry in \"alt.culture,\" an encyclopedia of the 90's. It called my novel a \"futuristic curio.\" (I've been waiting for years to return the favor: check out its Web site, www.altculture.com . It's what you might call a futuristic curio.) **********An online writer was ahead of his time, but still receives little credit. **********My publication date was not without drama. **********A few days earlier, I had received word through my network of spies that Wired magazine was working quickly to post the first installment of a Web novel on Hotwired because it was hoping to beat me to the prize. **********I had written for Wired, and it was hoping to thwart my one bid for publishing history. The race was tense, and very close: I beat Wired by mere hours. **********It was a nice little victory, and I received a gentlemanly e-mail message from the magazine, a slightly red-faced admission of defeat. **********Thus I became, accidentally, one of the world's first \"content providers.\" Nobody much read my book, but the academy paid attention. Brown University, home of Robert Coover's hypertext project, would steer its students toward \"Delirium.\" When I finally met Mr. Coover, long a hero to the literary avant-garde, he was extremely kind. **********An important cultural theorist, Marshall Blonsky, disapproved of my experiment. **********Luckily, he wrote his critique in Italian, a language I do not read. **********When the finished novel was released in hardcover, however, the critics championed my work. Critics, unfortunately, never actually buy what they read. Peter Eisenman, an architect whose work is perhaps even less acessible than mine, built a project based on \"Delirium\" for the Milan Triennale. An Italian publisher gave me a contract. I felt as though I had arrived. **********And indeed I had arrived: six years early, penniless, in a bad suit. Then along comes Stephen King, and the public downloads a half-million copies of his petite novella within days of publication. Whenever he receives press coverage for his groundbreaking venture -- acclaim that inevitably fails to mention my precedential shovel work -- helpful friends call to ask me whether I am upset. No, I say, by which I mean yes. **********Not that the dollars really matter. It's honor, not cash, that drives this would-be prophet. Aristotle noted that no man values fame undeserved. And I sincerely doubt that I would enjoy the fame associated with genre fiction. **********I simply wanted recognition for having conducted a successful little world-historical experiment. **********Let's face it. I lost the numbers game to Stephen King long ago. **********I meant to lose. **********You don't go into this field -- opaque, intestinal metafiction -- to compete with Stephen King. We might as well be in two entirely different trades, say, hog-tying and extermination. Yes, I know that David Foster Wallace teaches the King oeuvre to his students. I bow to his fashionable gesture, and wish him a pleasant tenure . Nevertheless, art and entertainment rarely coincide. **********I have always said that my sole ambition in life is to write from the margins, a spectral presence acknowledged only by the perverse. Recently -- it's true -- I have augmented this thing-that-I-have-always-said with, Be careful what you ask for. But the truth is, despite my whining, I am happy with the way things worked out. I have my readers, and I'm told that all 12 of them like my work very much indeed. **********Nor does it bother me that 10 are Bulgakov scholars, and 2 are feminist nuns. **********I consider that a crossover success. **********Related Sites **********These sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability. **********www.altculture.com **********Home | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace **********Quick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel **********Help/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today **********Copyright 2000 The New York Times Company"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/19/world/jakarta-journal-it-s-ramadan-school-is-out-quick-the-earplugs.html": {"writer_name": "Calvin Sims", "pub_date": "2000-12-19", "snippet": "Noisy celebrations marking Muslim holy month of Ramadan in Jakarta, Indonesia, sets off widespread complaints from Muslims and non-Muslims alike; cacaphony, caused by youths banging on drums and setting off firecrackers and noise makers at all hou...", "word_count": 975, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jakarta Journal; It's Ramadan.

Ramadan, when Muslims are required to fast during daylight hours, is perhaps the one time of year when Indonesia, which has never been too concerned with following Islam to the letter, tries to act like a traditional Muslim state. **********Unlike many other Islamic countries, Indonesia does not require women to cover their heads in public or segregate themselves from men. As the faithful are called to mosques for evening prayers, many young people in Indonesia head for bars and discos. So far, there is no constitutional precedence given to Islam in Indonesia, where 85 percent of the country's 210 million people are Muslim but other religions are freely practiced. **********But during Ramadan, public schools are closed, and most restaurants and street stalls do not open until sundown. Many employers reduce working hours to accommodate fasting employees, and television stations voluntarily censor sexually suggestive scenes from programs. The city government requires bars and nightclubs to shut down by midnight, and many do not open at all. **********After evening prayers and supper, many young people celebrate Ramadan by setting off firecrackers late into the night. And as the firecracker explosions end, boys in street parades begin banging on drums at about 3 a.m. to summon the slumbering for sahur, the predawn meal. **********While Indonesia has a reputation for being one of the most tolerant Islamic countries, many non-Muslims and foreigners living here have expressed concern over what they see as the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism on public life in Indonesia, a trend that they said was especially evident this Ramadan. **********Although Indonesia has large pockets of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists, the government closed  public schools for Ramadan to allow students ''to concentrate on the practice of their faith.'' **********Since the start of the month, two militant Muslim groups have attacked discos, pubs and restaurants that they considered sinful. Armed with sticks and swords, the groups have roughed up patrons and vandalized the establishments in an effort to close them. **********In the city of Jogjakarta, another Muslim group threatened to vandalize an exhibition of modern art that it said included pornographic paintings that were disturbing Ramadan. **********A spokesman for the exhibit said  works containing nude images would be hung facing the wall and placed in full view only at the request of visitors. **********Long before Ramadan began, Indonesia experienced a wave of threats and attacks against Americans, Israelis and nightspots by Muslim militants. **********Aryoso, an accountant who is Christian, said that it was not so bad that her favorite restaurant was closed for lunch during Ramadan or that a local television station edited out her favorite scene from the movie ''Risky Business,'' in which a young Tom Cruise dances in his underwear. But Mrs. Aryoso said she was deeply troubled by the closing of public schools for Ramadan and the continued attacks on entertainment establishments, which she said the government tacitly approved by failing to stop them. **********''I think most non-Muslims recognize the importance of Ramadan to our fellow Indonesians, and as a show of support, we often join our Muslim friends in fasting for a day or two,'' Mrs. Aryoso said. ''But I am worried that our country's respect for religious freedom is disappearing.'' **********Under former President Suharto's military government, ethnic or religious violence was not tolerated in Indonesia. But the fall of Mr. Suharto in 1998 brought new political and social freedoms and a rise in militant Islamic movements and fighting between Christians and Muslims in the Moluccas, the Spice Islands of old. **********President Abdurrahman Wahid, a cleric and former head of the country's largest Muslim organization, has long stressed the need for religious tolerance and freedom of thought. But Mr. Wahid, who was elected last year, has seemed unable to control growing religious clashes. Facing increasing pressure from Muslim groups, he has made some concessions. Most notably, he has agreed to introduce Islamic law in the far western province of Aceh as a way of diluting support for separatists who want to establish an independent Muslim state. **********And for many poor Indonesians who struggle to afford just one meal a day in a weak economy, fasting during Ramadan is no longer the sacrifice it used to be. **********''What fasting month are you talking about?

On Monday, after preliminary results indicated that the main opposition leader, Laurent Gbagbo, had an 11-point lead, soldiers invaded the offices of the National Electoral Commission and halted the vote-counting. **********Mr. Gbagbo reacted furiously to the announcement, which had been read out by a mid-ranking electoral official at a hastily called news conference at the Interior Ministry. Declaring himself the country's rightful new president, Mr. Gbagbo called on his supporters ''to stand up against the impostor.'' His party said later that two people were killed in a confrontation with soldiers. **********Thousands took to the streets late this afternoon, marching through several of the city's working-class neighborhoods, setting up roadblocks and burning tires.

''I have never participated in a demonstration before. I'm sick over this. It's a masquerade, a fraud. Guei has to leave power. If he doesn't leave, it's war.'' **********A man in the crowd expressed anger that the military government had annulled an election that many ordinary Ivoirians had supported through small donations, after Western countries had cut off support, to protest what they said would be an unfair vote. ''All of us gave what we could because we believed in democracy,'' he said. ''But now we see that this transition will never end. We've been waiting and waiting.'' **********The center of Abidjan was quiet tonight after the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a nighttime curfew throughout the country. Earlier in the day, before the announcement, the military had placed tanks at critical spots in downtown Abidjan. As the electoral commission kept an ominous silence, shops closed early, schoolchildren went home, and Air France canceled its daily flight here from Paris. **********Today's announcement drew strong condemnation the European Union, including France, the former colonial power, and the United States. ''We call on the military junta to respect the will of the Ivoirian people,'' said Philip Reeker, the State Department spokesman. ''General Guei cannot legitimize his rule through a military coup, followed by an illegitimate election.'' **********Earlier this month, the European Union and Washington had said they would not endorse the election after a court controlled by General Guei eliminated the candidates of the two major parties. But privately, foreign diplomats had said that a victory by Mr. Gbagbo would have helped the Ivory Coast re-establish ties with the West and international donors. **********Today's turn of events cast a shadow on this region of Africa, where the Ivory Coast had long been an anchor of stability and one of the few African nations not to have experienced a coup until last December. **********It was in a Dec. 24 putsch that General Guei toppled the unpopular civilian government of President Henri Konan Bedie. The general claimed not to be interested in long-term power, but he sidelined his political and military rivals in recent months and eventually declared his intention to run as president. **********Last Friday, General Guei promised on national television that he would respect the election's results. But clearly he did not like what he saw on Monday morning, the day after what was widely considered a well-organized and fair vote. **********With 8 percent of the ballots counted, the electoral commission had Mr. Gbagbo ahead with 11 percentage points. Mr. Gbagbo's own numbers, based on tallies given to each party representative at the voting booths, gave the politician an overwhelming lead. **********Today, the military government accused the commission of incompetence and said that ''massive fraud organized by certain political parties'' had been committed. **********The commission's president, Honore Guie, was taken away in a sport-utility vehicle by soldiers. Shortly afterward, at the Interior Ministry, a mid-ranking electoral official, Daniel Bamba Cheik, said that the commission had been dissolved. He said that it had counted the ballots in ''confusion'' and that its conclusions were worthless. **********Mr. Cheik announced the junta's election results, which gave the general 53 percent of the votes, compared with 48 percent for Mr. Gbagbo. A couple of hours later, General Guei gave a short speech declaring himself the new president. **********Complimenting Ivoirians for their ''maturity and solidarity,'' General Guei said: ''You have fulfilled your civic duty, the results of which have made this humble person the first president of the second Republic.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/08/world/clinton-offers-israel-syria-7-page-working-paper-study-golan-heights-control.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "2000-01-08", "snippet": "Pres Clinton intervenes in Israeli-Syrian peace talks, offering seven-page 'working paper' defining differences over deal that would return Golan Heights to Syria; acts after American officials find that Israeli Prime Min Ehud Barak and Syrian Min...", "word_count": 955, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Offers Israel and Syria 7-Page 'Working Paper' to Study Golan Heights Control", "print_headline": "Clinton Offers Israel and Syria 7-Page 'Working Paper' to Study Golan Heights Control", "body_text": " **********President Clinton intervened in the peace talks between Israel and Syria today by presenting leaders of both countries with a seven-page ''working paper'' defining their differences over a deal that would return the Golan Heights to Syrian control. **********Mr. Clinton's move, on his fourth trip here this week, was his first effort to define the terms of a ''core agreement'' that could lead to a far more detailed peace accord. **********He acted after five days of wheel spinning during the negotiations in this town 70 miles from Washington. Mr. Clinton presented the working paper only after American officials had concluded that Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara of Syria  had sufficiently demonstrated to their domestic constituencies that they were holding out on the emotional questions of new borders and security arrangements. **********''That was certainly part of the thinking,'' a diplomat involved in the talks said when asked why Mr. Clinton had waited until his fourth trip to make the American-drafted paper the centerpiece of the talks. ''We had to give everyone time to vent, and they did so pretty thoroughly.'' **********The diplomat described the document as having a proposed text for an agreement, with points of dispute bracketed, the standard method of hashing out textual differences in diplomatic and trade talks. **********Officials familiar with the talks said there was virtually no chance that the ''core'' text would be agreed to before Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara returned to the Middle East, probably on Sunday or Monday.

But the United States had to go through 22 more drafts before that deal was done. **********Mr. Clinton presented the American working paper to Mr. Barak and Mr. Shara this morning, as they were seated around a fireplace in the Clarion Hotel and conference center, where the Israeli and Syrian delegations have been confined all week.

He described the talks as ''not warm and fuzzy, but businesslike and professional.'' **********Both sides suspended the talks late this afternoon for 24 hours of religious observances. **********Mr. Clinton's decision to present the paper was clearly motivated by a frustration at the slow pace of the first substantive negotiations between the two countries since 1996. **********The two sides argued all week over what issues to negotiate first. The Syrians were intent on establishing for a domestic audience at home that Jerusalem was committed to giving back the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the Arab-Israeli war in 1967, before the subject turned to the security guarantees that Mr. Barak would receive in return. **********The Israelis wanted just the opposite, a discussion of security first, to make the case in Israel that they have obtained concessions more valuable than the Golan Heights buffer zone, which has been their main deterrent to Syrian attack for a quarter-century. **********If a treaty is reached, Mr. Barak has vowed to hold a national referendum before signing it. And it is far from clear that Israelis, who have been told for years that the Golan Heights is the key to national survival, will give it up. **********The document covers all the major areas of dispute, starting with whether the border would revert to the 1967 line, whose exact location is also in dispute, or the 1923 line that runs along the Sea of Galilee. The issue is closely related to the question of water rights. Israel fears that if Syria can tap the sea, Israel will lose some of its most vital water supplies. **********Also at issue is what American officials call ''normal peaceful relations,'' whether Syria would let Israel open an embassy in Damascus and, ultimately, open the border to tourism and commerce. Syria has opposed any symbols of Israeli presence. None of these issues are new. All have been exhaustively discussed in past negotiations, from 1992. **********Nonetheless, the American effort to start the talks by creating committees of Israelis, Syrians and Americans to take up each subject broke down by midweek. No one could agree on what to discuss first. Two panels, one on borders and one on water, have yet to meet, even after five days of talks. **********The procedural argument, however, may have been largely for show. For while they argue over the details, both sides are aware of the changing strategic landscape. **********For the Syrians, the cost of continuing isolation, the American economic sanctions applied against a terrorist state and a fast-declining economy have all put pressure on an ailing President Hafez el-Assad to reach an accord. **********And for the Israelis, the security gains of the Golan Heights have been offset by better military technology, although the Israeli right wing argues that no amount of weaponry could replace the security of holding on to the area."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/17/business/continental-airlines-profit-is-up-despite-higher-oil-costs.html": {"writer_name": "Laurence Zuckerman", "pub_date": "2000-10-17", "snippet": "Continental Airlines says third-quarter profit rose 32 percent, to $137 million; revenue rose 16 percent, to $2.62 billion (M)", "word_count": 697, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continental Airlines Profit Is Up Despite Higher Oil Costs", "print_headline": "Continental Airlines Profit Is Up Despite Higher Oil Costs", "body_text": " **********Cashing in on a seemingly insatiable demand for business travel, Continental Airlines said yesterday that its third-quarter profit rose 32 percent, surpassing Wall Street expectations. **********Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline, was the first large carrier to report earnings for the quarter. But some analysts warned that profits for the industry over all would not be as strong as in the last quarter because of the rise in oil prices. **********Continental said that it earned $137 million, or $2.24 a diluted share, excluding a $2 million charge, compared with $104 million, or $1.44 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent, to $2.62 billion from $2.26 billion. Analysts had expected Continental to earn  $2.19 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. **********Continental executives estimated that the airline got a boost of about $20 million, or 20 cents a share, from this summer's disruption at United Airlines, whose on-time performance plunged and cancellations soared because of bad weather and protests by its pilots. United announced last month that it would lose money in the third and fourth quarters. **********Gordon M. Bethune, Continental's chairman, said that most of the gains came from the demand for seats by high-paying business travelers, which did not flag in the quarter despite five fare increases so far this year. Continental's load factor, or the percentage of its seats that were filled, rose to a record 77.5 percent, while the average fare the company received rose 8.8 percent. **********''Maybe we are not charging enough,'' Mr. Bethune said after being asked whether he saw any weakness in the demand for seats. **********But Samuel C. Buttrick, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York, said, ''Continental's solid profit growth in the quarter is not representative of industry results for the period.'' He estimated that overall airline profits fell 11 percent to 12 percent in the quarter compared with results in the quarter a year earlier. **********Continental not only benefited from turmoil at United, it also successfully hedged itself against the rise in oil prices. American Airlines, which is the second-largest carrier after United and its chief rival, is also expected to beat earnings estimates for the quarter. Southwest Airlines, the low-fare king, is also expected to exceed forecasts because of its strong hedging strategy and cost controls. **********Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said he had raised his revenue estimates for many airlines over the summer because the strong economy was fueling demand for business travel. But at the same time, he was raising his cost estimates as oil prices rose. **********''The question for airline analysts is which will come down more quickly, fuel or the economy?'' he said. ''Three months ago, I would have said fuel will come down quicker. Today, I am not so sure.'' **********Because business travelers pay the highest fares but also book their tickets at the last minute, it is difficult to forecast airline earnings. A softening economy could quickly translate into a decline in corporate travel. **********''As profit growth slows, intuitively one would expect corporations to exert stronger cost controls than they have in recent years,'' Mr. Buttrick said. ''Travel often makes the short list of discretionary items to be curtailed.'' **********Though he does not yet see any evidence of such cutbacks, Mr. Buttrick thinks that most earnings estimates for the fourth quarter are too high. **********A new tentative contract reached by United with its pilots also promises to add to rising cost pressures in the industry. Delta Air Lines' 10,000 pilots announced on Friday that they were seeking salary increases that would surpass the generous increases at United. **********Such concerns have driven down the price of airline stocks to levels that frustrate many executives who feel that they are not getting credit from investors for maintaining profits. **********Shares of Continental rose 19 cents yesterday, to $42.69. Shares of UAL, the parent of United, fell 50 cents, to $37.88 AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 50 cents, to $30.38. **********''Five years ago, I would have never believed that Continental would have a record quarter with oil at $35 a barrel,'' Mr. Engel said. ''The next test is an economic downturn. Until they get through that, people are going to always look for another reason why airline earnings can't stay high.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/05/world/south-lebanon-now-reaps-a-harvest-of-bitterness.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Sachs", "pub_date": "2000-06-05", "snippet": "Small villages in southern Lebanon's buffer zone that were occupied by Israeli soldiers for 22 years are reaping bitter harvest of Israel's withdrawal; occupation divided families and estranged neighbors; was enforced against Lebanese by Lebanese,...", "word_count": 1333, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Lebanon Now Reaps a Harvest of Bitterness", "print_headline": "South Lebanon Now Reaps a Harvest of Bitterness", "body_text": " **********Sweet things can grow in the rocky soil of southern Lebanon. Before the civil wars that raked the people from the land and the Israeli occupation that drove a wedge between those who remained, its terraced farms once yielded a bounty of plump cherries, grapes and apricots. **********Little but enmity and wild roses have been cultivated since in villages like Kafr Shuba, a jumble of houses atop a steep hill where a brisk wind always blows. Now this swath of liberated Lebanon, bombed and conquered and then governed until late May by the South Lebanon Army, an Israeli-backed militia, is reaping the bitter harvest. **********Across the nine-mile-deep border strip that Israel maintained as a military buffer zone for 22 years, every village and town has its tales of divided families and estranged neighbors, of a household that made its accommodation to the occupation while the one next door persisted in stubborn resistance. **********Take Ali Komra, a lean, sun-weathered former police officer of 52. He lost his younger brother during those unhappy years -- first to the ranks of the South Lebanon Army, which Mr. Komra considered a bunch of mercenary traitors, and then to a roadside bomb planted by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia in its guerrilla war against Israel. **********Mr. Komra, a retiree living in a home he rebuilt over the rubble left from an Israeli bombing raid in 1970, said he had begged his brother to run away from the $500-a-month paycheck offered by the Israelis. But the younger man shrugged aside the appeals -- and Mr. Komra finally turned his back on him. **********Even after the Hezbollah bomb ripped his brother apart on a deserted road in 1993, Mr. Komra refused to bend. Repelled at the thought of rubbing shoulders with his dead brother's commanders, he broke every convention of his village culture and refused to attend the funeral. **********''I do regret it,'' he said, while inspecting a tiny field of wheat and barley that he has tried to revive in a small valley outside the village, just behind the Israeli border. ''After all, he was my brother. But I couldn't go. The way I felt, who I was, I just couldn't.'' **********This part of southern Lebanon near the border has been a battleground for years. In the 1970's Palestinian guerrillas used its rugged landscape for attacks on Israel and provoked devastating reprisals against the villages that sheltered them. **********Then came the retribution from Lebanese Christian militias in the south that allied themselves with Israel to overpower the majority Muslim and Druse population. **********Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982. When the main body of Israeli troops withdrew in 1985, they held on to the buffer zone. To administer the area and protect the border from attacks by Hezbollah and others, Israel set up the South Lebanon Army as a formal civil administration and security structure. **********By the time the Israelis and about 6,000 men from that group and their families scrambled out of the zone recently, the South Lebanon Army had evolved from a right-wing Christian militia to a more representative organization. **********Its top commander, Antoine Lahd, was a Maronite Christian. But like southern Lebanon as a whole, it eventually had more Shiite Muslims than Christians in its ranks. In areas populated by the Druse sect or, like Kafr Shuba, by Sunni Muslims, it recruited from those groups. **********The Israeli occupation was enforced against Lebanese by Lebanese, and over the years it corroded social relations. **********''There was no more trust left,'' said Muhammad Ahmed Hassan, a retired Lebanese Army officer who lives in Kafr Shuba. ''On the surface we would say all the nice things, the traditional things, but they were just words. Underneath there was nothing anymore. We drew away from each other.'' **********South Lebanese Army security men lived in the same neighborhoods, perhaps attended the same schools, as men and women they imprisoned without trial. Contacts with members of the group could not be avoided. It not only patrolled the so-called security zone, but also collected utility bills, operated phone networks and decided who received the coveted passes to travel in and out of the zone. **********Every so often, its command would send out a demand for more foot soldiers. Lists would be drawn up by the local officers who knew the villagers. Bonuses were given for new conscripts. **********With southern Lebanon's economy devastated by war and isolation from the rest of the country, steady work with the Israeli-backed militia was sometimes more attractive than abstract nationalistic ideals. **********Financial desperation led Nazem Adel Alayin to join the group as a foot soldier about six years ago, said his wife, Afifi Adri. He had five children to support -- the couple has nine now -- but no land to cultivate and no job. Then came the order to present himself to officers at the South Lebanon Army post in the nearby city of Hasbeya. **********''They said, 'You have to work with us; we need you and we can help you with money,' '' Mrs. Adri recalled. ''At first he didn't tell me what it was all about. He just came home and stormed around and acted angry. **********''The second time they called him in, they told him he could either join or he could go to jail or he could leave -- those were his only choices. So he thought about things, and the third time they asked him, he said yes.'' **********Mrs. Adri has been anxiously making the rounds of her neighbors in Kafr Shuba lately, effusively congratulating them on the end of the Israeli occupation and professing joy that the group's reign is over. **********''There was never friction here,'' she insisted. ''In this village people are very understanding. My children were never harassed.'' **********But there are scars that may not heal so easily. **********''We were afraid of the Lahd people,'' admitted Talal George Khalil, 42, a school principal from the Christian village of Rasheiye, a few miles from Kafr Shuba. ''We knew them because they were from around the area. And when I would run into one of them, I would smile and I would say: 'How are you? Have a coffee. Sit down with me. How are you doing?' Just because I was afraid.'' **********His fawning did not protect him. He was imprisoned in one of the musty crowded cells in the jail at Khiam seven months ago -- as two his brothers had been before him -- and was there when his third child, a daughter, was born. **********He said he had not been told why he had been detained, but speculated that it was simply because South Lebanon Army officials suspected, rightly, that he was in favor of the armed militias fighting the Israeli occupation. **********He was freed, with another 145 prisoners, by Khiam residents on the day of the Israeli withdrawal. **********It was, in the end, the petty cruelties that came with the South Lebanon Army's petty power over other Lebanese that are remembered with the deepest anger. For three years, Mr. Hassan said, he was not permitted to travel outside the security zone. **********He could not say goodbye to a brother who died in a Beirut hospital. His wife could not attend her father's funeral. Their son was imprisoned, losing his chance to attend a military academy in Beirut, in another attempt to put pressure on the father. **********Mr. Hassan's wife, who has only one kidney, had a heart attack, then a breakdown under the stress, and she was at last allowed to go outside the zone for treatment. There, she could also do what Mr. Hassan could not: attend the wedding of their daughter. **********''The mother of the bride always has to be happy and has to dance for her daughter,'' said Mr. Hassan, beginning to weep as he recalled what happened. ''All she could do was walk once around the hall and leave. **********''But when she came back here, they immediately called her to the Lahd headquarters, and they said, 'Whatever happens to you, we will never give you another pass. If you are so ill, why were you dancing at your daughter's wedding?'

Autumn-winter may decree a return to the '80s but in Miami they never went away. Cruise the strip on Ocean Drive, where Miami's patron saint Gianni Versace lived and died, to see leopard print teeny bikinis, diamonds for daytime and major maquillage. **********Only in Miami do you still see the grand dames who haunt Harry's Bar at the Eden Roc hotel \u2014 where a Pucci-clad Marilyn Monroe flirted with Joe DiMaggio in the '50s \u2014 wear Norman Norell's '60s sequin \"Mermaid\" column dresses for sundown cocktails. **********Miami Beach is the spiritual home of autumn-winter's maximalist, dress-up-and-party mood, as '60s Pucci, '70s Gucci and '80s Gianni Versace haunt the runway. If de\u0301ja\u0300 vu design is the season's worst-kept secret, Miami's vintage stores are one of the best. **********Miami Twice is a retro bounty hunter's paradise. Wild '70s disco print Diane von Furstenberg wrap dresses, Pucci hand-painted silk jersey tunic tops and Halston Original jersey caftans hover like ghosts of fashion past on ceiling-suspended rails. Fox-fur tippets and silver mink stoles, revived by Prada for autumn-winter, spill out of Louis Vuitton trunks. Art Deco cocktail jewelry sparkles on '50s boudoir dressing tables. **********\"Twenty years ago, young women wouldn't even look at Pucci,\" said Mary Holle, who opened Miami Twice 15 years ago. \"Now we have celebrity stylists, dealers and girls on vacation from New York whipping round the store like Tasmanian devils and practically clearing us out. Right now we're doing very well with the '40s tweed suits because Prada has brought them back this season. Seventies Halston, Gucci and Pucci have been hot since the big '70s revival in the mid-90s.\" **********\"Miami is one of my favorite places to source vintage clothing,\" said Sex & The City designer Patricia Field, whose styling of Sarah Jessica Parker in the television show woke New York up to the vintage vibe. \"Miami is a place people move on to in later years. The ladies bring 40 years of fashion with them and may want to offload it at a store like Miami Twice. Also, as a resort town, there's a spirit of fun, of celebration in the aesthetic here. So the vintage pieces you find here match the mood of fashion today.\" **********Designers have always stalked vintage stores for inspiration. Tracy Tolkien, owner of London's prestigious vintage emporium Steinberg & Tolkien, recalls a day in 1999 when Tom Ford, Donna Karan, John Galliano and Marc Jacobs all paid unofficial visits. Tolkien published \"Vintage: The Art of Dressing-Up\" this year with a listing of more than 400 vintage stores in the United States: 62 in New York alone. But Miami Twice and the Art Deco district store Fly Boutique aren't listed. **********\"Miami is not as tapped as New York or L.A. and now people are wise to the value of vintage, it's getting tough to find,\" said Jean Marie Deardorff, owner of Fly Boutique. \"Versace is, was and always will be huge in Miami. The loud silk print shirts, the gold, the sequins. It's Miami. These pieces are at premium in New York and the mark-up makes them as expensive as new season. Here we're selling $2,000 shirts for $200.' **********Celebrity endorsement has made vintage mainstream. \"Vintage will always have its place in the mix,\" Field says. \"It is an essential ingredient for women today.\" In the Los Angeles store Paper Bag Princess, vintage Pucci costs more than this season's Pucci collection. You'll also have to wrestle Hollywood starlets like Mena Suvari and Alicia Silverstone for rare-as-hen's-teeth pieces. **********Where celebrities like Sarah Jessica Parker lead, fashion inevitably follows. Chloe Sevigny earned her place on the International Best Dressed List with her '70s Yves Saint Laurent look. Winona Ryder is famed for her collection of '50s Charles James, '60s Pauline Trigere and '70s James Galanos gowns. The models Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Amber Valletta raid designers' archives for '80s Alaia, Mugler and Montana. **********As with any collectible, only a finite number of designer pieces survive. \"There's a feeding frenzy for vintage right now and named pieces are getting pretty sparse,\" said Mary Holle. \"But my stock is from closets, not dealers and auction houses, so it's constantly refreshed and not overpriced.\" . **********\"Our climate in Miami isn't kind to fabrics,\" Holle says, \"and it's only recently that people have learned the value of their closets. They didn't save their clothes like family heirlooms. Besides, a lot of the ladies in Miami don't think of the '80s as vintage.\" **********Seasoned vintage shoppers are understandably miffed that the fashion-hungry public is switched on to the trend. In September, Harper's Bazaar devoted six pages to the cult of vintage fashion and the season's retro kick. Barneys on Madison Avenue in New York recently gave an entire window to collectible Jean Muir, Gucci and Bonnie Cashin. **********Yet an afternoon's shopping in Miami's Deco District unearths a wealth of pieces that dealers and auction houses would sell for 10 times the price tag at Fly Boutique. A white Courreges shift dress from the '60s is $100. A Pucci print shirt is $60. **********\"You've got to be 100 percent dedicated and love those clothes,\" Deardorff said. \"I go thrifting every day of my life, to garage sales, estate sales and closet sales in private apartments.\" **********\"The big labels for me are the '60s and '70s designers right now like Pauline Trigere, Pucci, Cardin, Saint Laurent and James Galanos,\" Deardorff adds. \"Florida has 'em in spades.\" **********Miami Twice, 6562 S.W.40th Street, Miami, Florida 33155 (305-666 0127). **********Fly Boutique, 650 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach, Florida 33139 (305-604 8508). **********JAMES SHERWOOD is a columnist for the Independent on Sunday. **********[Not to be reproduced without the permission of the author.]"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/11/business/the-markets-sec-approves-regulation-against-selective-disclosure.html": {"writer_name": "Danny Hakim", "pub_date": "2000-08-11", "snippet": "Securities and Exchange Commission approves new rule banning companies from giving important information to analysts and professional investors before disclosing it to public; rule should accelerate democratization of investing fostered by Interne...", "word_count": 767, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "S.E.C. Approves Regulation Against Selective Disclosure", "print_headline": "THE MARKETS; S.E.C. Approves Regulation Against Selective Disclosure", "body_text": " **********The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule yesterday that bans companies from giving important information to analysts and professional investors before disclosing it to the public. **********The rule should accelerate the so-called democratization of investing fostered by the Internet. Over the last few years, online trading, financial message boards and the rapid-fire dissemination of news from Web sites have helped close the gap between average investors and Wall Street. **********Regulation FD -- short for fair disclosure -- should benefit small investors even more, said Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C. **********''High-quality and timely information is the lifeblood of strong, vibrant markets,'' Mr. Levitt said. ''But when that information travels only to a privileged few, when that information is used to profit at the expense of the investing public, we must ask, 'Whose interest is really being served?' '' **********Though the full text of the regulation will not be released for several days, it will require that companies give Wall Street professionals and individual investors equal access to information and will give companies 24 hours to inform the public after accidental disclosures. **********A company could not, for example, disclose a profit warning on quarterly earnings to analysts at 5 p.m. and issue a news release to the public the next day. Instead, it would have to inform everyone at the same time. **********Opponents of the regulation say it could lead to an ''information blackout'' if companies grow more cautious about talking. **********''It will actually hurt, rather than help, the investing public,'' said Stuart Kaswell, a senior vice president for the Securities Industry Association, the top trade group for Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch. The concern is that some companies, used to filtering sensitive information through favored analysts, could disclose less as an end result. **********''Many companies say they'll clam up,'' Mr. Kaswell added. **********Most experts think there will be an uncertain transitional period as companies learn to live by the new rule. **********''The reality is that most of the time when you have a proposal like this, you'll have predictions of horror stories,'' said Joel Seligman, dean of the School of Law at Washington University in St. Louis. ''Most of the companies find a way to live with it.'' **********Ordinary investors will gain access to information either by reading news releases or watching for a company's S.E.C. filings, which can be found on Web sites. Broadcasts over the Web may be acceptable in some cases, but postings on a company's Web site will not be sufficient enough notice on their own. **********The rule, which will take effect in two to three months, will not ban selective disclosure to the media, to firms that rate corporate bonds or to a company's customers and suppliers -- as was proposed in the original draft released last December. It will also exclude information about initial public offerings and foreign companies whose shares trade in the United States. And the regulation will affect only senior management and officials who speak with analysts and stockholders. **********''There are going to be some tough questions,'' said Daniel J. Kramer, a securities lawyer and partner at Schulte, Roth & Zabel in New York. ''If an analyst calls a lower-level person in the company, can that person return the call, and what can they say?'' **********Mr. Kramer said, however, that  the fact that infractions will be handled by the S.E.C. and that the regulation will not allow shareholders' suits, is positive for companies. **********''That gives comfort to companies that they're not going to be subject to a lawsuit any time there's an unintentional violation.'' **********The new rule will undoubtedly transform how Wall Street securities analysts do their jobs. There will be fewer, if any, face-to-face meetings with top-level executives, and no hot tips to deliver to prominent clients. **********''I believe the principal benefit of this will be to enforce the independence and objectivity of the securities analyst,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor. **********''Right now, corporate executives have a key weapon to hold over the securities analyst,'' he said. ''An analyst, to remain competitive, has to get as much or more selective disclosure as his competitors.'' **********The S.E.C. received nearly 6,000 letters and e-mail messages, most in support of the measure. Some were detailed legal briefs. Others were more blunt criticisms of the way business is conducted on Wall Street. **********''Vegas would love to play by these rules,'' one correspondent wrote about existing regulations in an e-mail message posted on the S.E.C.'s Web site. The measure passed on a rare split decision. The only Republican member of the commission, Laura Unger, dissented in a 3-to-1 vote. Two other rules intended to strengthen existing prohibitions against insider trading passed unanimously."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/25/world/clinton-urges-arafat-to-calm-rioting-in-the-west-bank.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "2000-10-25", "snippet": "Pres Clinton calls Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to urge him to bring rioting in West Bank and Gaza under control quickly; gets no assurances and no response to invitation for Arafat to visit United States soon to map way back to peace talks; pl...", "word_count": 650, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Clinton Urges Arafat to Calm Rioting in the West Bank", "print_headline": "Clinton Urges Arafat to Calm Rioting in the West Bank", "body_text": " **********President Clinton called Yasir Arafat today to urge him to bring rioting in the West Bank and Gaza under control quickly. But Mr. Clinton received no assurances and no response to an invitation for Mr. Arafat to travel to Washington soon to map a way back to peace talks, administration officials said tonight. **********Mr. Clinton planned to speak with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel promptly, the officials said, with a similar call for restraint and an invitation to a separate meeting with the president. But officials said the two leaders had not been able to speak. **********Mr. Clinton did not ask the leaders to visit at the same time, because, a senior administration official said, ''nobody thinks that would work right now.'' **********Instead, the official said, Mr. Clinton hoped to bring quiet to the streets long enough for small steps to be taken toward resuming ''some kind of dialogue.'' **********President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also called Mr. Arafat, after having heard from Mr. Barak. Mr. Putin asked the Palestinians to demonstrate a ''maximum restraint to prevent a worsening of the crisis,'' the Kremlin said. **********The White House made its calls as Palestinian rioting abated somewhat for the second day today. But Israeli military officials were offering their assessment that the violence in the West Bank and Gaza was likely to continue for months. **********A spokesman for the Israeli army said the nature of the conflict was changing from street battles to low-level warfare, ''with fewer incidents but harder ones involving roadside bombings, nighttime shootings and more accurate shootings.'' **********Although some Palestinian militants had called for protesters to break through Israeli checkpoints into Jerusalem today, that did not occur. But one Palestinian was killed in Gaza, and another in the West Bank. **********White House officials who are watching the violence from afar are clearly concerned that the cease-fire accord that they reached last week in Egypt is in danger of complete collapse. ''The clear thrust of the call was that we need to see more progress on getting the Palestinian security forces to stop the violence,'' one senior official said. **********Mr. Arafat's diminishing control over the Palestinians in the streets  and a reluctance to compromise on the status of Jerusalem has driven Mr. Clinton to fits of anger, one official said, adding that on the telephone Mr. Arafat ''basically said he's happy to get together and talk sometime, but he doesn't want to take strong measures now.'' **********In asking Mr. Barak to travel to Washington, Mr. Clinton may be seeking to head off the creation of a broad emergency government run by Mr. Barak and the Likud Party leader, Ariel Sharon. Although American officials have been careful to say publicly that the creation of an emergency government was Israel's business, officials here clearly believe that any such deal would end any hope of resuming peace talks. **********In the meantime, one official said, Mr. Clinton's message to Mr. Barak would be, ''We know you can't control every settler, but please keep the military's reactions commensurate'' to the Palestinian actions. **********Some Palestinian experts said it appeared that senior officials had made a quiet effort to calm the streets. School was out, in honor of the Muslim holiday for the prophet Muhammad's ascension to heaven. That put the youths who tend to congregate and throw rocks at home with their parents, many of whom frown on such a degree of involvement. **********In Israel, Mr. Barak continued his talks with Mr. Sharon. They were stumbling over two issues, how to share power and whether Mr. Barak will agree to renounce the peace proposals made in July at Camp David. **********Complicating matters, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Israel Radio from abroad to weigh in. Mr. Sharon and Mr. Barak have an interest in keeping Mr. Netanyahu politically sidelined. Mr. Netanyahu said he endorsed an emergency unity government for a limited time if the intense conflict with the Palestinians continued."}}
