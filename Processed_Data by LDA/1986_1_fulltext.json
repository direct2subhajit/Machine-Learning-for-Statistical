Underground air raid shelters were unopened, their entrances long blocked by mud and debris. **********Traffic proceeded normally, and in the labyrinthine market in the Old City merchants conducted business without interruption. **********An Information Ministry spokesman said the test was an indication of Syria's commitment to help Libya militarily if the United States or Israel attacks Libya. In recent days, Syrian newspapers have given prominence to condemnations of the United States for imposing punitive sanctions against Libya and promises of Syrian solidarity if Libya is attacked. **********The siren test comes only five days after unidentified military sources in Lebanon said Syrian troops had fired at least two SAM-6 ground-to-air missiles at Israeli warplanes. Israel denied that its planes were fired on, while Syria had no official comment. Israel Downed Two MIG's **********Tension between the two countries increased dramatically after Israel shot down two Soviet-made MIG-23 jet fighters over Syrian air space on Nov. 19, in the first Syrian-Israeli air clash since Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. **********Shortly afterward, Syria installed new batteries of fixed SAM-2 antiaircraft missiles along its border and twice moved mobile SAM-6 and SAM-8 missiles in and out of the Bekaa in Lebanon. The installation of the medium-range SAM-6 and short-range SAM-8 mobile missiles, designed to protect the high-altitude SAM-2's, was opposed by Israel. **********Even more worrisome over the long run, the Israelis say, is the permanent placement of the SAM-2 missiles on Syria's border. Israel considers them a serious threat to its daily reconnaissance patrols over Lebanon. **********Syria says Israel has no right to tell it what to do on its own territory. Syrian officials say they also have the right to deploy missiles in Lebanon to protect the Syrian ground forces, estimated at 30,000, stationed in the Bekaa and northern Lebanon under a 1976 mandate to end Lebanon's civil war. **********''We have a right to put our missiles where our troops are stationed,'' a Foreign Ministry official said. ''We don't need to ask permission from anyone, and no one can blame us. Would you stay in your house and not lock the door?'' **********The official reiterated charges that the Israeli downing of the two MIG-23's was an act of unprovoked aggression carried out while Israeli planes were flying over Syrian territory. **********At the presidential palace, an adviser to President Hafez al-Assad charged that the behavior of Israel, not Syria, should be scrutinized. ''Whoever questions Israel about deploying its missiles and guns and warplanes, about sending reconnaissance planes over Lebanon?'' he said in an interview. ''Who gave Israel the right to do so?'' **********Diplomats and military analysts said they expected Syria to re-deploy the mobile missiles in Lebanon. **********''Because of the risk of Israeli air attacks on Palestinian targets in Lebanon and because of the proximity of Syrian forces to Israel, Israel could easily hit the Syrians,'' a Western military source said. ''They must have their own air defense capability to make sure that doesn't happen.'' **********''Assad is testing world opinion with his own chess game,'' a diplomat said. **********Both Syrian officials and Western military analysts believe the importance of the positioning of the missiles has been exaggerated by the Israelis. **********Western sources said that even in the best of times the defensive curtain of SAM missiles is too thin to pose any real challenge to the Israelis."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/world/protestant-cause-hurt-by-belfast-strike.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1986-03-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 692, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PROTESTANT CAUSE HURT BY BELFAST STRIKE", "print_headline": "PROTESTANT CAUSE HURT BY BELFAST STRIKE", "body_text": " **********In front of a string of bleak, shuttered shops in downtown Belfast, a group of men gathered to watch two cars burning. Before the automobiles were set ablaze, the drivers had been stopped, dragged out and told they were not going to work during a one-day general strike called by Northern Ireland's Protestant leaders. **********The threat of the act was obvious and effective. ''No one from this area would dare go to work today,'' said Jack O'Hare, a passer-by. **********Across Northern Ireland last Monday, similar scenes of intimidation and vandalism were widespread, with factories attacked, office windows broken and stores looted. By police reckoning, there were more than 500 reports of intimidation and property damage, 670 roadblocks manned by Protestant militants and 57 arrests. **********Unionist leaders had billed the strike as a nonviolent display of the Protestant majority's dissatisfaction with the British-Irish agreement. The agreement, signed in November, gives the Irish Republic a say in the affairs of Northern Ireland. **********But the strike turned out to be a violence-marred day that brought the unionists more enmity than sympathy and underlined the difficulty that Protestant political leaders face in trying to control their militant followers. Unionists favor continuing the union of Northern Ireland and Britain within the United Kingdom. **********''I was horrified, shocked and disgusted by the violence,'' said James Molyneaux, leader of the Official Unionist Party, the largest unionist group and one of the strike organizers. ''It damages the unionist cause.'' After a protest that backfired, the unionist leaders appeared to have no clear idea how to proceed with their campaign to try to suspend or change the British-Irish agreement. Moreover, after the strike London and Dublin pointedly reaffirmed their commitment to carrying out the pact, which will increase outside pressure on the unionists to accept it. **********And President Reagan stressed Washington's support for the agreement when he proposed a five-year, $250 million Irish aid program, saying it could help give ''a promise of peace for the people of Northern Ireland.'' **********The clear divisions within the unionist majority portend a difficult and possibly dangerous time ahead as the ''marching season'' for Protestants approaches with the militants in an angry mood. Adding to the uneasy outlook was the behavior last Monday of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force, which has more Protestants than Catholics in its ranks, and the prominent role played by two paramilitary groups, the Ulster Defense Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. **********Before the strike, the Government promised to keep the roads open so that anyone who wanted to go to work could do so. Keeping traffic flowing was mainly the responsibility of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Yet at many roadblocks, the police often stood by talking to protesters at the scene of roadblocks, doing nothing to prevent them from stopping cars and telling people to go no farther. #130 Complaints About Police There were more than 130 complaints of a lack of police action at trouble spots, many of them coming from Roman Catholics who said they had been harassed. **********''Loyalists with impunity were able to block off main roads and factory gates without any action from the Royal Ulster Constabulary,'' said Danny Morrison, a spokesman for Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army. ''It showed the sectarian bias and loyalist sympathies of the R.U.C.'' **********A key objective of the British-Irish pact was to reduce the violence in Northern Ireland, mainly that carried out by the I.R.A., by addressing the grievances of the Catholic minority and giving Catholics more say in the affairs of the province. But unless the police can control the Protestant militants, the chances of reducing violence in Northern Ireland appear dim. **********The unionists are demanding that the British-Irish agreement be suspended before they will discuss terms under which they might take part in a new order. For its part, the British Government has said that it is willing to discuss modifications that take account of unionist concerns, but that London will not suspend the agreement."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/23/business/it-s-a-happy-time-for-the-motorist.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1986-05-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IT'S A HAPPY TIME FOR THE MOTORIST", "print_headline": "IT'S A HAPPY TIME FOR THE MOTORIST", "body_text": " **********Plentiful gasoline, at sharply lower prices, will make this Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the peak summer driving season, one of the least worrisome for motorists in recent years, according to oil industry experts and motoring groups. **********Nationally, all grades of gasoline now average 92 cents a gallon at the pump, according to Lundberg Survey Inc., an oil industry consulting firm. That price is 2 cents higher than the low of 90 cents a gallon, reached in late April. However, it remains far below the average $1.21 a gallon at the beginning of the year. **********Daniel Lundberg, president of the firm bearing his name, and other industry experts said they expected gasoline prices to rise further between now and Labor Day, when motor vehicle pleasure driving tapers off. The Lundberg firm surveys more than 17,000 service stations throughout the country every two weeks. **********Some analysts predicted that retail prices could move up by nearly 10 cents a gallon. But Mr. Lundberg maintained that the average increase would be less than 5 cents a gallon. However, it is widely agreed that gas price increases would not affect the expected substantial increase in the number of Americans vacationing by motor vehicle. 'Splurge' Expected **********Richard Marose, an oil analyst for Geldermann Inc., a commodities firm based in Chicago, said that because retail prices had declined so sharply recently motorists were likely ''to feel they can splurge a bit on gasoline now.'' **********''They're not going to ignore all the energy-saving steps they've learned,'' Mr. Marose added. ''But buying gasoline at 80 cents a gallon is a lot different from buying it at $1.30 a gallon.'' **********The strong demand for gasoline throughout the spring has caused prices at the pump to increase, the analysts said. Yet they remain far below prices of a year ago, by an average of 28 cents. **********A survey by the American Automobile Association of 6,000 service stations along major travel routes found that average full-service prices were now $1.06 a gallon for regular leaded. Regular unleaded was $1.09 a gallon, and premium unleaded $1.12. Diesel was at $1.03 a gallon.

Regular unleaded and premium unleaded gasoline cost 95 cents a gallon and $1.10 a gallon, respectively, compared with $1.24 and $1.38 a year ago. **********Mr. Lundberg said that regular leaded gasoline nationally averaged 79 cents a gallon, regular unleaded 99 cents, and premium unleaded $1.11 a gallon."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/world/us-issues-threat-in-talks-on-trade.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1986-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 887, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. ISSUES THREAT IN TALKS ON TRADE", "print_headline": "U.S. ISSUES THREAT IN TALKS ON TRADE", "body_text": " **********A senior Reagan Administration official warned today that the United States would pull out of planned new global trade talks this month unless other nations gave priority to freeing trade in two key areas for the American economy. **********The United States Trade Representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said at a news conference here that the two key areas were agricultural goods and services like banking and telecommunications. **********He said the United States regarded agricultural goods and services as ''priority issues'' for new talks under the General Arrangement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that regulates commerce. Trade ministers from more than 100 countries hope to begin such negotiations at a meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay, that starts Sept. 15. **********But Mr. Yeutter warned that if the agreement on beginning talks is ''unsatisfactory in areas of major importance to us, then probably there won't be a new round at all or if there is one, it will be conducted without the U.S.'' Reluctance 'to Play Games' **********''We are not going to play games on any of the issues of importance to us,'' Mr. Yeutter said, recalling that the United States faces what he called an ''unsustainable'' trade deficit of $200 billion this year. **********Mr. Yeutter was speaking after two days of talks here with his counterparts from Europe, Canada and Japan that were devoted to final preparations for the Punta del Este meeting. Together, the four parties account for some 43 percent of all world trade. **********Despite the American threat, the two-day meeting brought no discernible narrowing of differences over agricultural trade between the United States and the Common Market. **********Last month, France, with support from Ireland, Greece and Denmark, blocked agreement on a draft agenda for the new GATT round because it felt the text was overly hostile to the Common Market's protectionist farm policy, which benefits French farmers. **********Today, the Common Market's Commissioner for External Relations, Willy de Clercq, who negotiates on trade for the 12-nation European Community, acknowledged that differences remained between Europe and the United States on the treatment of farm trade in the new GATT round. **********He said Europeans saw the American approach as one that ''over-concentrates on the issue of subsidies,'' an allusion to American hostility to the big subsidies Common Market farmers receive to help them export high-priced farm produce in competition with American farm exports. A Refusal to Speculate **********The Reagan Administration has been the principal advocate of the new GATT trade negotiation this year, seeing it as essential to defeating a rise in protectionism throughout the world, helping curb America's huge trade deficit and heading off the danger of a new global recession. **********Mr. Yeutter refused to speculate on the consequences of an American withdrawal from a new trade negotiation if Washington does not get its way on agriculture and services at Punte del Este. In the past, the Reagan Administration has said it would seek to negotiate trade-freeing deals with sympathetic countries one by one if it cannot win agreement for a new worldwide attack on barriers to commerce. **********Officials at the meeting of trade ministers said the American threat to withdraw had had a chilling effect on other participants, forcing them to contemplate the danger of a collapse of the world trading system. A Look 'Over the Abyss' **********''We looked over the abyss,'' a senior official said. ''This could be 1929 all over again.'' Most economic historians blame the start of the Great Depression on growing protectionism in Europe and the United States. **********Sources said the American threat appeared to help consolidate European support for bringing trade in service industries into a new GATT round. **********A small group of developing countries led by India and Brazil oppose the inclusion of services, saying free trade in this area would hamper their development by preventing them from building up banking, insurance and telecommunication industries. **********The Common Market appeared this week to be wavering in its support for full inclusion of the services sector when a senior official told a press briefing that the American approach is likely to encounter strong third-world opposition at Punta del Este. **********But today, Commissioner de Clercq strongly denied that the Common Market is withdrawing support for freeing trade in services. **********Officials said Mr. de Clercq came under heavy pressure from the United States, Canada and Japan to reassert European support for bringing services and other so-called ''new areas'' -for example, patent rights and foreign investment - under GATT trading rules during the four-party talks. **********France has warned, however, that it will not support a new GATT trade round unless the negotiations also win widespread backing from the developing world. **********Meanwhile, officials say the United States drive to free up agricultural trade and cut back on farm subsidies is being complicated by the much tougher position taken by a group of 14 other major farm-exporting countries led by Australia. **********At a meeting last week in Cairns, in northeastern Australia, the 14, which include Argentina, Brazil and New Zealand, attacked both the United States and the Common Market for subsidizing their farmers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/world/with-iraqis-at-the-front-esprit-looks-strong.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1986-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 696, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WITH IRAQIS AT THE FRONT: ESPRIT LOOKS STRONG", "print_headline": "WITH IRAQIS AT THE FRONT: ESPRIT LOOKS STRONG", "body_text": " **********Presumably they complain, or else they would be among the few soldiers in history not to exercise that right. But even after six years of war, the morale of Iraq's soldiers appears to be reasonably good. **********Most foreign military attaches here hold this view to some extent. Any such assessment, however, needs the qualification that Iraqi society is close to impenetrable to foreigners, and in-depth surveys are hardly possible. **********But certain observations can be made. They might seem superficial to civilians, but military officers anywhere in the world take them seriously. For one thing, the troops are clean. A group of senior officers seemed to be indignant when asked if the soldiers were required to shave every day. ''Of course they must shave and wash every day, and they must keep their uniforms clean,'' said a general. **********A visit to the front-line Eighth Infantry Division on the southern front with Iran confirmed the claim that this is not a slovenly or battle-dazed force. **********Moreover, the Iraqi command seems to have an enlightened personnel policy. Soldiers in the large army (perhaps 700,000 men) are given one week of home leave with their families for every three weeks on duty. Where it is possible, soldiers can telephone home. **********''In matters of man management the Iraqis are quite good,'' said a Western military analyst. Training, the glue of any army, also seems to be taken seriously. **********A conscript or volunteer is given 14 weeks of basic, ''individual'' training and gets a substantial dose of unit training in special schools, senior officers said in interviews. **********This does not mean that everything is rosy. **********''The Iraqi Army is not bad,'' said one Western expert, ''but it does seem at least to have some trouble with combined arms operations,'' in which air support, armor and infantry must work smoothly together. ''That takes practice in repeated training and it's hard to do while fighting this war.'' **********Protection for the soldiers is not slighted. On a visit to the front, it could be seen that earth-moving equipment was used to create a high protective embankment into which had been built infantry bunkers and firing positions. **********During the visit, only a few Iranian artillery shells were fired, as well as about a dozen sniper shots from rifles. But one of the shells made a direct hit on a front-line bunker. The men in the firing chamber were untouched. One man in a sleeping room was wounded by fragments from flying concrete. **********Company, battalion and brigade forward headquarters were heavily fortified rectangles. Both they and the front lines had copious concertina and staked barbed wire and protective minefields as well as the Soviet version of Claymore mines that spew out clouds of steel pellets. **********Sleeping rooms included cots and even a few curtains and embroidered cushions from the families at home, the kind of comforts most soldiers will contrive. **********One measure of morale and spirit is that troops sent home on their once-a-month leaves are not herded or guarded. They are expected to return on their own and apparently the overwhelming majority do. **********Asked if there was, as rumored, a desertion problem in the marshes where deserters could hide, Maj. Gen. Talie Khalil Ibrahim al-Duri, commander of the III Corps but formerly a commander of a northern sector in the mountains, smiled and said: ''They don't just desert here; they also desert in the north. But very few. They are the soldiers with bad problems or problem soldiers - the same as in any army.'' **********The troops seem to be well fed with soup, flat bread and plentiful amounts of fruit for breakfast and rice and lamb or other meat at midday and supper. Fresh fruit, a troublesome logistic item for an army, is said to be plentiful. Rest areas with basketball courts, television sets and movies are available for units rotated out of the line. If these things do not make a six-year war popular with soldiers, they may make it more endurable."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/world/raisa-gorbachev-appointed-to-a-cultural-fund-in-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Raisa Gorbachev Appointed To a Cultural Fund in Soviet", "print_headline": "Raisa Gorbachev Appointed To a Cultural Fund in Soviet", "body_text": " **********Raisa M.

It is projected at slightly less than 3 percent this year. **********Coordination Is Urged **********Mindful of recent economic policy disagreements between the United States and its allies, Mr. de Larosiere counseled that economic policy coordination is a ''prerequiste for growth.'' **********He urged the industrial countries to ''work together to complete the process of disinflation, to maximize the sources of economic growth, and to assure an open international trading system.'' **********It is a time of change at the helm of both instititions that are considered the pillars of the postwar economic system, for Mr. de Larosiere has announced he will be leaving his post by the end of the year. **********Mr. Conable, 63 years old, whose term as seventh president of the World Bank extends to 1991, wrote his speech entirely by himself, aides said.

He said they ''bear witness to the wider world.'' **********Mr. Conable said the bank would be focusing new attention on the role of population, of the environment and of women in the lives and hopes of the world's poor. **********''It is clear that population pressures are one source of heavy environmental damage, so we must provide training to give women the skills to take charge of their productive and reproductive lives,'' he said. Many Are Encouraged **********Although the speech did not go into great substantive detail, the ideas, especially on raising food production in the poorest countries, touched responsive chords. ''I was encouraged,'' said J. S. A. Funna of Sierra Leone, who represents 17 African countries on the board of the World Bank. ''Self-sufficiency in food should have the highest priority.'' **********Pierre Ngenzi, Finance Minister of Burundi, said Mr. Conable's emphasis on sustained development, including food production, was ''highly welcome.'' **********Anticipating criticism from American farm lobbyists opposed to World Bank lending for agriculture, Mr. Conable declared: **********''There is a zero-sum fallacy contending that agricultural trade -especially exports from rich to poor - will shrink as subsistence farmers increase their productivity. The reverse is true. With development, most of the extra income earned by the poorest farmers goes to improve their families' diet. So investments in farm equipment and techniques, land reform, fertilizer, seeds and crop research can be investments in the long-term growth of international commerce.'' **********Mr. de Larosiere, 56, who has headed the I.M.F. for eight years, said he had chosen to leave now before negotiations begin for another increase in I.M.F. resources. These negotiations are expected in 1988. In 1983 Congress nearly rejected President Reagan's request for the last rise in resources. Report on Successor **********The Dutch Finance Minister, H.

The White House is expected to press Congress next year to approve an American contribution of nearly $3 billion over three years to the bank's International Development Association, which makes no-interest loans to the poorest countries. It is then expected to ask for a new increase in capital for the bank itself. **********Sometime later, Congress would be asked to approve new resources for the I.M.F. Explaining the timing of his decision to leave, Mr. de Larosiere said that in light of the future negotiations, ''I think the fund will be better served if the change in management takes place now, rather than in 18 months' time.'' **********He said it was this consideration, together with a wish to keep the period of transition as short as possible, that led him to announce his decision 10 days ago.

''It seems to me the President has indicated his willingness to go the extra mile, so that we can act together - just as we feel together - on the need to end apartheid. I will vote to sustain the President's veto.

Botha of South Africa: ''The Botha Government has made it clear that anything less than the Congressional bill would be a victory.

Regan, said: ''This is a matter of principle with the President, his veto.

The move came after Syria's decision on closing the British Embassy in Damascus. **********Embassy as Clearing House **********Government officials maintained that the break in relations came from its discovery that the embassy in Belgrave Square was used as a clearing house for the plot. Scotland Yard detectives reported that the sophisticated three-pound luggage bomb was probably constructed at the embassy by Syrian Air Force intelligence using Syrian-Arab Airlines as a courier. **********They maintain ranking officials of the Damascus-based intelligence service recruited and trained Nezar Hindawi, 32 years old, who was convicted in the plot and fled to the embassy after the bomb was discovered April 17 and who was greeted and provided with shelter by Ambassador Loutof Allah Haydar. **********Ambassador Haydar described the bombing plot as an Israeli-American ploy staged to embarrass Syria. He denied as ''nonsense'' the British Government's accusation that he was directly involved in the crime. **********After Britain's decision to take the strongest measure of diplomatic retaliation, police and security agencies were reported on heightened alert for signs of terrorist activities. Plastic Explosives **********There was a particular note of concern because the El Al Israel Airlines case featured what antiterrorist police described as one of the more confounding explosive devices - moulded plastic, virtually metal-free and eluding X-ray detection. According to trial testimony, the bomb was detected only in a final, random check by a guard suspicious at the luggage's extra weight when emptied. **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is sending the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to Luxembourg on Monday to discuss antiterrorist measures with the European Community. **********After a series of bombing incidents in Paris this summer, security agencies of the 12 members nations are cooperating in tracking 100 suspects. **********Three hours before Britain broke its ties with Damascus, Mr. Hindawi was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in the plot to destroy the plane and its 375 passengers as it headed for Tel Aviv. **********The Ambassador said he had never previously met Mr. Hindawi and their meeting at the embassy was an innocent matter of serving someone bearing a Syrian passport who reported an emergency. Mr. Hindawi said he told him he was a victim of an anti-Syrian plot in which he thought he was smuggling drugs aboard the plane by way of an innocent passenger, an Irish chambermaid who was his pregnant lover. **********Mrs. Thatcher's decision to break ties was evolving well before the verdict, according to Government officials. One key factor, officials said, was the interception of a letter Mr. Hindawi had purportedly smuggled from jail two weeks after his arrest. In it, he reportedly sought to alert Syrian officials to arrange a hostage switch for his release and made a reference to the then pending visit of Mrs. Thatcher to Israel. It was unclear what he was suggesting in the latter reference. **********Another factor was a report from the West German authorities that Mr. Hindawi's brother, Ahmed Hazi, confessed he bombed an obscure German-Arab Friendship Society last spring after Mr. Hindawi cleared the operation in Damascus and after the explosives were supplied by way of the Syrian Embassy in East Germany."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/25/world/john-paul-at-the-midnight-mass-extols-event-of-bethlehem-night.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1986-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 541, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JOHN PAUL, AT THE MIDNIGHT MASS, EXTOLS 'EVENT OF BETHLEHEM NIGHT'", "print_headline": "JOHN PAUL, AT THE MIDNIGHT MASS, EXTOLS 'EVENT OF BETHLEHEM NIGHT'", "body_text": " **********As Christmas began today, the bells of St. Peter's Basilica rang wildly at midnight, and Pope John Paul II celebrated an ancient liturgy for a congregation that extended electronically across 41 countries. **********Addressing the dignitaries and pilgrims gathered around him, as well as ''our brothers and sisters to whom this solemn rite is being transmitted by radio and television,'' the Pope said, ''The event of Bethlehem night unites us all.'' **********John Paul's global audience is at its peak with his Christmas midnight mass, which is broadcast more widely than any other papal event. **********For the first time this year the Pope's countrymen will be able to watch a live broadcast of the service. Shortly after the Government officially stated that John Paul would make his third trip to Poland next June, the Polish state television announced Sunday that it would broadcast the midnight mass.

Well, thank you very much. I am delighted to have this opportunity to be with all of you today. I know the purpose of this get-together is some back-and-forth between us, so I'll try to keep my remarks short. But this is a very influential group, and what politician worth his salt would give up the chance to make a few points to you this morning. **********It reminds me of a story that my friend Punch Sulzberger tells about the time he had lunch at the White House. That evening he went home and called his mother, who as you know is the most remarkable woman, and he said to her, ''Mother, today I had lunch at the White House with the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States and the Secretary of State.'' **********''Yes, dear,'' his mother said dryly, ''and what did they want?'' **********I didn't want this opportunity to go by without pointing to some of the enormous changes that we've seen in American politics during this decade. I don't have to remind those of you who report and edit the news of the scope of this change, but I do think it's a good idea now and then to take a moment and reflect on the meaning of that change and gain some perspective on a decade that is now more than half over. **********I'm sure you all remember that when we took office in 1981 we faced appalling economic conditions, and that's not to mention the crisis of confidence in America's military strength and her international prestige. Our program for economic recovery was much criticized, and getting it through the Congress was the first of many tough struggles to come. We also faced opposition to our efforts to restore America's military strength and carry out a foreign policy that pursued peace while it also sought to halt Soviet expansionism and expand the borders of freedom. New Ideas **********Much of this opposition was understandable. A number of the people in policy- and opinion-making circles had trouble dealing with the new ideas that we brought to Washington. As Bill Buckley once put it, ''Though liberals do a great deal of talking about hearing other points of view, it sometimes shocks them to learn that there are other points of view.'' **********But despite the parochialism of some of our critics, our programs, with the support of the American people, gained passage. I think the results achieved thus far with the revitalization of the economy, our military strength and the restoration of our international prestige bear out the merit of our conservative ideas. **********A few years back, our simple efforts to get some aid to El Salvador, so a democratic government could be firmly established there, met with fierce opposition. But thanks in no small part to the Salvadoran people, who braved guerrilla threats and gunfire to march to the polls, we prevailed - and so did the dream of democracy. **********My favorite story is of an elderly woman standing in line waiting hours to vote in the hot sunshine in that first El Salvador election. And she had been hurt by the guerrillas because of her determination to vote, and they had told her that they would kill her and her friends if she went on and voted. And she said: ''You may kill me and you may kill my family, my friends. You can't kill us all.'' **********And so she went in defiance of them and stood and voted. The Grenada Operation **********I can't help but mention the Grenada operation also in connection with these things. It was hardly under way when some of our critics took to the airwaves to denounce our efforts there as rampant militarism. Well, just as the people of El Salvador spoke out in their own way, so too our medical students and the people of Grenada provided all the eloquent rebuttals that were needed. **********In a curious way, though, being wrong about the issues - whether it's the economy or Central America -doesn't seem to discourage our critics. I'd hardly gotten through my televised address asking support for the freedom fighters in Nicaragua when some voices were questioning some of the charges I made against the Sandinista regime. For example, that the Sandinistas engaged in vicious acts of anti-Semitism and that they'd been deeply involved in the illicit drug trade. **********But again, fortunately, some of the doubters were quickly rebutted. The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith quickly issued a strong statement confirming the truth of what we said about the persecution of Jews in Nicaragua. **********And on the illicit drug trafficking charge, I was grateful to a number of publications for editorially outlining the depth and extent of the evidence against the Sandinistas. A massive report by the President's Commission on Organized Crime on the international drug trade, for example, discussed the Sandinistas' participation in the drug trade. **********Extremely persuasive testimony has also come from Alvaro Baldizan, the former chief investigator of the Special Investigations Commission of the Ministry of Interior in Nicaragua. And by the way, besides his descriptions of what he learned about the Sandinistas' involvement in the drug trade, Senor Baldizan's testimony, called ''Inside the Sandinista Regime: A Special Investigator's Perspective.'' This is a richly detailed harrowing look at the Sandinista regime. **********It's been published for the State Department, and I recommend it to you. I think your readers would be intrigued by his revelations, especially his portrait of Sandinista leaders like Interior Minister Tomas Borge and that gentleman's often successful attempts to mislead visiting dignitaries. La Prensa Editor's Article **********I hope you'll permit me one other recommendation, Jaime Chamarro, the editor of La Prensa, the heavily censored but last remaining non-Government newspaper in Managua, recently wrote an article for The Washington Post. He put it quite plainly. He said the Sandinistas are transforming the Nicaraguan revolution fought for by all Nicaraguans into a revolution that serves the purposes of Marxism-Leninism. **********And he went on to say that the Sandinistas want to use his country as, and I'm quoting, ''a beachhead for Communist expansion.'' He said they were filling Nicaragua with quote ''internationalists whose aims are the expansion of Communist influence and Soviet domination in the region.'' **********And he adds: ''When Latin America or much of Latin America is under the influence of the Eastern bloc, NATO will no longer be in Europe. It will be San Antonio, Tex.'' **********You know, he said that, I'm just quoting. **********You know, a number of people here in Washington have said that we can win the support for the freedom fighters only on the strength of the national security issue. Well, I agree with Senor Chamarro that the national security issue is very important. But you know, sometimes I think Washington people forget that self-interest doesn't really count as much with the American people as it does in this town. **********Well, I think you know that over the long run, the American people are a little more enlightened than that, that they respond readily to what's right and wrong, what's good and bad and not just what's in it for me. I think that's why support for the freedom fighters is growing in this country. The Sandinista Regime **********The American people are just now getting the facts about the Sandinista regime. its atrocities against groups like the Miskito Indians, its persecution of Jews and Christians, the verbal attacks on Cardinal Obando, who we intend to prevent from becoming the Cardinal Mindszenty of this hemisphere. And the list goes on. **********The savageness and inhumanity of this regime is a story that is waiting to be told. We know now that the Cubans knew and approved of Sandinista plans for their recent incursion into Honduras and that each day's delay in assisting the freedom fighters increases the chances of a permanent Soviet beachhead of agression on the Norht American mainland. **********The Sandinistas, the Cubans and the Soviets want a military, not a political, solution to the problem of Central America. And that's why it's imperative for the House of Representatives to approve the legislation recently passed by the Senate -legislation that provides the freedom fighters with a full aid package, especially the defensive weapons they need to protect themselves. **********And now that's been enough of a monologue, and I understand there's a dialogue in the offing, so, Mr. Chairman. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS **********Chairman: Thank you very much, Mr. President. We will have questions from the floor. Let me remind you that members only will ask questions and please state clearly your name and your newspaper affiliation so that not only the others in the hall but the President can understand who you are. **********And I'll recognize the questioners, and I recognize Dick Smyser. Dick. Marcos Accusations **********Q. Mr. President, I'm Dick Smyser from The Oak Ridge in Oak Ridge, Tenn. President Marcos said during his interview with Ted Koppel last Thursday night that, in effect, he was double-crossed. He said that all of a sudden the Administration would not answer his telephone calls. He said that when he went to Clark Air Force Base, he thought he was going elsewhere in the Philippines and that it was only after he was on the plane that he learned that he was going to Guam. Would you comment on his accusations? **********A. I think that my friend Mr. Marcos has been misinformed by some. As a matter of fact, I had a personal representative that was meeting with him and quite consistently. Our only practice - or what we did during that entire time - was to try and see that the Philippines, which historically the Filippino people have been our close friends, that this did not degenerate into civil war. And when he himself publicly announced he refusal to order the army to fight, we were very pleased with that, and I thought it was very worthy of him that he did that. **********And this was all. We just wanted to see that there would be no civil war, and we respect him for his willingness to leave the island. But, as far as we knew, he was aware that his destination when he left the palace was Clark Field. **********Q. And you're in effect saying that President Marcos misspoke himself or stated a falsehood when said he thought he was going to somewhere else in the Philippines? **********A. I think maybe he was misinformed. It happens to every President. Contadora Initiative **********Chairman: Over here on my left. **********Q. Heath Meriwether with The Miami Herald. Mr. President, diplomatically you said you supported the Contadora peace initiative in Central America. Yet those nations of the Contadora pact have said that they don't think that aid to the contras will help their effort. How do you resolve the contradiction between support of the Contadora initiative and your own push for aid to the contras? **********A. Well, we may disagree on whether it is necessary now to give this - we do believe it is necessary, and I'm wondering if their view would not be the same about help to the contras in view of what just happened at the last meeting, because once again - and we have subscribed to their goals that they have put down as to what it is they're trying to achieve, and they know we fully subscribe to them. **********But in this last meeting, it was Nicaragua once again - the Sandinista Government - that refused the proposals of Contadora and walked out. So, maybe now they'll join us in believing that there's going to have to be some pressure put on the Sandinista Government to make it return to the goals of the revolutionary against the Somoza regime. They announced publicly goals and informed the Organization of American States what their revolutionary goals were. And they were democracy, a pluralistic society, freedom of press, religion, freedom of speech, observance of human rights and the right of the people to choose their own government. And that's what is at issue. The Sandinistas were only part of that revolution. And they ousted their revolutionary companions who are mainly now the contras. Once the revolution succeeded, they took over and have established a totalitarian Communist state. **********And we think they're not going to -when have we have ever seen a Communist government that has achieved that totalitarian statehood? When have we ever seen them voluntarily and without some pressure or force give up their power? So we believe that arming the contras is necessary, and I hope maybe now the Contadora will agree with us. Fall in Oil Prices **********Chairman: Don, on the right here. **********Q. Don James, Wichita Falls Times and Record-News. Mr. President, the free fall in oil prices is concerning a lot of people, particularly with respect to what it will do for exploration. Do you have any concerns about the long-term effect of a virtual halt in exploration for oil on the national security? **********A. Well, yes, and we hope that this whole thing will stabilize very quickly. We're concerned lest some major producers in other parts of the world might start playing games with this as if in an effort to eliminate competition. And if they have such ideas - I don't know that they do - but if anyone does and has such an idea, of course they would be looking forward to a time when they could then skyrocket prices on a kind of monopoly basis. But we still believe in the free market. We know that it now is a hardship for the oil-producing regions and industry here in America. **********At the same time, we can't deny that it has been of great benefit to the rest of industry in America, to our productivity because of the importance of energy as part of production and of benefit to our citizens, with the lower prices. But I hope that the free marketplace can adjust. I'm resistant to the idea of government trying to inject itself and through regulation and so forth bring about a change because that never has worked. I have always stated that the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth is a government program. Coverage of Fighting **********Q. Bill Ketter, from The Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass. Mr. President, as you know the members of A.S.N.E. and the press in general were concerned when the press was excluded from the Grenada invasion sometime ago. After that we worked out this situation with the Defense Department when we had these practice pools, where reporters would be able to go with the military on these exercises. And recently, in the Libyan encounter in the Gulf of Sidra, there were six journalists that were on the U.S.S. Saratoga as part of a press pool. But when the military encounter began, they were removed from the ship and flown back to Rome and were not even made aware of the fact that there was a military encounter going on in the Gulf of Sidra. **********I'd like to know if you'd give us an explanation as to why the reporters were removed from the ship and if you could restate your attitude on reporters covering military encounters involving the United States? **********A. Well, with the Grenada situation, we had found out how leaky Washington is in a number of things. We realized that for the safety of our men that that operation had to be top secret. It came about with a direct request to us from the other Caribbean island nations that they didn't have the power and asked us. As a matter of fact, at about 3 o'clock in the morning it was relayed to me - if George Shultz ever asks you for a quiet weekend of golf at Augusta, don't take him up on it - that's where I was awakened. And I knew that we had to accede to their request. **********Now, we only had 48 hours to put this operation together, and we feared very definitely that any leak would result in higher casualties for our forces. We immediately that we had landed, as you know, then, did provide the transportation and make possible the bringing in of the press. **********On this latest one that you're asking about, I was not aware of those six being taken off. It seemed to me that we started, once there were hostilities, we started trying to round up the press in Italy. But this in response to the reports that we deliberately went in there as a provocation. That was the seventh such maneuver - war games, you may want to call them -that we have conducted in that same area. And we knew that we were risking, knowing the nature of Qaddafi, that there might possibly be something. **********And I've always had one order: any place we ever sent our personnel, I declared to the Navy that it was my policy that if hostilities were launched against us, we'll never send American military personnel without the right to fight back and fire back if they're fired upon. So that was the only rule that was in there. **********But we went in on what had been planned for months and months, and they'll probably be another such maneuver next year. And then when the hostilities - when they did launch the attack against us - why it was my understanding that then following that, when it did become an operation that we tried to round up the press and so informed them and make available to them the news. **********Q. Well, it's our information that the six reporters or six journalists were removed from the ship and were not told about the military encounter that was going to occur once the ship went across the ''line of death.'' But are you saying that you think the press should accompany the military on all of its encounters? **********A. Yes, but I think that the - and we have had such a policy - but I think also that you must understand where we believe that there is an operation, that where secrecy is so all important, that you give us the right to protect ourselves against a leak of information. And that leak does not necessarily come from you. We found that the White House is the leakiest place I've ever been in. So, you'd be surprised how few people knew that we were planning that operation. Not even our press secretary knew - not that he's the leaker - we just kept it that close. **********Q. We'd like to be there for the leaks. **********A. But I'm going to look into what you said about the six. Dealing With Terrorism **********Q. Mr. President, Randy Hatch, from Ogden, Utah, The Ogden Standard-Examiner. After increasing terrorism and incidents of terrorism and reviewing all the options available, do you have a specific plan of dealing with terrorism in the future now? **********A. Well, we've taken very seriously things - as I've said, we're not going to just sit here and hold still. We're trying to work with our allies, and we've been successful in part, with regard to cooperation and intelligence matters. Last year, thanks to that cooperation between our countries, we were able to abort 126 planned terrorist attacks throughout the world. **********And we're continuing to try and get more support now for action that would be appropriate in view of the greater threats that are being uttered of terrorist activities. And right now, with the most recent activities, I can't get specific with you because I can only tell you that we are investigating and trying to gather all the information we can so that we can actually, with solid evidence, point a finger at who is responsible. **********Q. Can you indicate if it might be Mr. Qaddafi? **********A. Let us say he is definitely a suspect. Q. Thank you.  Attacks on Critics Q. Mr. President, I'm David Corcoran from The Record of Hackensack, N.J. A personal question, if I may. I think Americans overwhelmingly regard you as a nice guy, and yet in your talk today and in talks around the country you have denounced your critics and liberals and the previous Administration in language that I think is unusually harsh for a President in the sixth year of what's overwhelmingly considered to be a very successful Administration. Can you tell us, sir, why at this stage of your Presidency you find it necessary to engage in such attacks? **********A. Well, now, my quoting of Bill Buckley and his line, is that what you're referring to as being harsh? I don't often quote him because he uses too big a words, but I didn't think that was harsh. There's no question but that I am tagged throughout the world as being an archconservative, and I've always thought that I was kind of defending myself when I answered back. **********Back in the beginning of our economic program that started this recovery, I was aware that my critics had named the plan Reaganomics, and I knew it was a success when they stopped calling it that. **********Where have I been so - I don't think I've been all that harsh. **********Q. Well, sir, would you say then that your remarks about liberals and your critics in the media are just a normal part of the ongoing dialogue and exchange in the marketplace of ideas? **********A. Well, I'm sorry you took that to yourself. I was very careful to say ''critics'' and stop there. There's a good share of the 535 on Capitol Hill, and they aren't connected with the press, that are critics. And so I wasn't - in front of this audience I wasn't going to actually tag my critics as being the press! **********No, I recognize the right, and I go along with Thomas Jefferson. I will protect and believe in a free press. I could say there is a section of the press that takes me on regularly, but it's a controlled press - Pravda and Tass - and I don't defend them at all. Publicity of Terrorists **********Q. Mr. President, Mike Davies, The Hartford Courant. It has been said that publicity, in a sense, is the lifeblood of terrorism. Perhaps without so much publicity terrorist acts might diminish in scope and in number. Would you care to comment, please, on how well or how poorly you think the American media have covered terrorist acts up to this point? **********A. I know there's talk about publicity and so forth, and I know they strive for it. On the other hand, just trying to pretend that it doesn't happen, keeping quiet about it, isn't going to end it. I think we all - and by all I mean that we in our country plus our friends and allies throughout the free world - have got to set down standards and make it plain that there will be retaliation and that terrorism cannot succeed. And thus part of our policy is that we will never pay off terrorists because that only encourges more of it. **********I think the only time that I ever wondered about the media was in the terrorist kidnapping of a plane in Beirut, and then when Nabih Berri took away from the original hijackers our people and held them and then started negotiating for their release. **********I did wonder why some one of the press that was present, when they could come in and out and go back to their hotels at night and then meet with Nabih Berri the next day and there he sat, flanked by their fellow Americans who were prisoners, kidnap victims. Even though Nabih had not been the man who hijacked the plane, he hijacked it from the hijackers. **********And I wondered why at some time someone didn't say: ''We are Americans, we've committed no crime or anything, we're going when this press conference is over, be able to walk out of here and go where we want to go. Why can't those other Americans who've committed no crime against anyone, why can't they walk out of here with us?'' **********And I just - I would have liked to have seen the look on his face on the TV news program if someone had asked him that question at the time. **********So if it ever happens again, maybe someone will think of it and ask that question. **********Q. We thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate your being here."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/world/rights-group-critical-of-2-sides-in-nicaragua.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rights Group Critical Of 2 Sides in Nicaragua", "print_headline": "Rights Group Critical Of 2 Sides in Nicaragua", "body_text": " **********Amnesty International today issued a report on human rights in Nicaragua that criticized both the Government and the American-backed rebel forces. **********The London-based human rights organization said the Government often jailed opposition leaders, lawyers and trade unionists for short periods to intimidate and harass them. **********The report also said Nicaragua had punished its military men for abuses such as murder and rape of prisoners, but it said some reported killings and disappearances of past years still had not been cleared up. **********As for the rebels, the report said deserters and witnesses had spoken of the torture, mutilation and execution of prisoners by the insurgents.

But, according to the officials, Mr. Kohl and his Foreign Minister feared that such a demand to Washington might torpedo the chances for a breakthrough on what is known as I.N.F, or intermediate-range nuclear forces. **********An Issue for Later **********''We felt that it was not wise to overburden this thing now with the short-range issue,'' a senior official said. ''The philosophy of Kohl's letter is, 'Let's deal with I.N.F. now and then tack on the concern for the shorter-range systems later.'' **********The letter to Mr. Reagan, the official said, asks the American side to oblige the Russians to follow up any accord on medium-range weapons with one addressing the shorter-range systems, particularly SS-21's, Scud-B's and SS-23's. Washington has assured the Kohl Government that these concerns will be taken into account, according to a high-ranking Defense Ministry source. **********With a range of 300 miles, the SS-23's can cover most of the European central front, as can the Scud-B's, which have a range of 200 miles. West German military experts have said that neglecting these highly accurate systems could lead to the emergence of a ''gray zone'' left out of the arms-control process like that created previously by the deployment of SS-20's. **********As the only nation to accept Pershing 2 missiles - 108 of them as well as 16 ground-launched cruise missiles that have already been deployed - West Germany was the pivot of NATO's decision in 1979 to match the Soviet Union's buildup of SS-20 systems. Although the Kohl Government is not directly involved in the Soviet-American nuclear arms-control talks in Geneva, its assent would be central to an accord on medium-range weapons. **********West German officials said they did not expect a medium-range missile agreement to be struck at the meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Iceland, but they predicted the outlines of an understanding might be reached. **********With national elections less than four months away, domestic political considerations weighed heavily in Mr. Kohl's calculations. A breakthrough on the medium-range missile issue would be enormously popular with the West German electorate, vindicating the Chancellor's slogan that he is striving to ''make peace with fewer weapons.'' Kind Words for Gorbachev **********Even without a tangible agreement, the Reykjavik encounter will be a major political coup for Mr. Kohl's center-right coalition if Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev reach even a minimal agreement to meet again. The Chancellor, whose coalition is heavily favored to be re-elected in January, will be able to argue that steadfastness to NATO and Washington has led to a decrease in East-West tensions, depriving his Social Democratic opponents of any resonant foreign policy issue. **********The approach of the Iceland meeting was accompanied by strikingly friendly words for Mr. Gorbachev from the Kohl Government. Horst Teltschik, the Chancellor's national security adviser, told a Bavarian newspaper Thursday that the Soviet leader had demonstrated his ''serious willingness to make progress in disarmament.'' **********Mr. Teltschik said he saw ''a good chance that in this year the scrapping of medium-range missiles could begin.''

The process, which has already ended the need for anesthesia and drilling for many, is known as the Caridex Caries Removal System, and was introduced in the United States last February. Last month it became available in Europe. **********''Caridex is quieter and gentler than drilling,'' said Theodore R. Goldstein, a Manhattan dentist. ''This will make patients less afraid to go to the dentist.'' Dr. Goldstein is co-founder of the Dental Phobia section of Mount Sinai Hospital. He reports that his patients support the use of Caridex ''100 percent,'' welcoming any relief from the overwhelming fear of pain. ''One lady was so excited about getting a filling without drilling, she jumped on her chair and started yelling hallelujah,'' he said. **********Caridex consists of a chemical solution that softens the decayed part of the tooth. The solution, N-monochloro-DL-2-amino-butyric acid, known as NMAB, softens the decay layer by layer by breaking the bonds between the decayed material. Because the material in decay is different from that in the healthy part of the tooth, the solution affects only the decay. **********Caridex has a delivery system that looks like a water pick. The solution is warmed to 98 degrees Fahrenheit and pumped through a plastic tube to an applicator tip. The dentist lightly abrades the decayed tooth, thereby washing away the decay. **********Caridex is viewed by experts in the field as a major advance. ''It's like going from the propeller airplane to the jet,'' said Dr. Bruce R. Baral, a dentist in Long Beach, Calif. He said that with Caridex his practice had grown ''from about $200,000, to $300,000.'' **********The search for Caridex had its origins 16 years ago, when Dr. Melvin Goldman and Dr. Joseph Kronman, two scientists at the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, developed the solution as an aid to their root canal study. In 1971, the National Patent Development Corporation acquired the technology for wider use. **********In 1984, after 10 years of research and testing, National Patent Dental Products of New Brunswick, N.J., a wholly owned subsidiary, received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration. **********In November 1985, Caridex received recognition from the American Dental Association. National Patent is now distributing it throughout the United States, Canada, France and Belgium, and by the second quarter of 1987 it will be introduced in Sweden, Spain, Italy, West Germany and Britain. **********''Since I started using Caridex last year,'' said Louis J. Malcmacher, a general dentist in Cleveland, ''I treat eight of my twelve daily patients with it - and have reduced my total drilling time by 50 percent.'' **********The system also reduces the use of anesthesia. According to a study in Dentistry Today, a trade publication, 87 percent of patients receiving the Caridex solution do not require anesthesia. **********The Caridex machinery costs about $900, while that for a conventional drill is about $600. **********''I charge about $25 for both a conventional filling and a Caridex treatment,'' said David B. Holm, a dentist in Tempe, Ariz. **********There are now 3,000 dentists in the United States and Canada using the system, and, according to W. Keith Stoneback, president of National Patent, ''by 1990 there will be over 83,000 units throughout the world. By then, we expect 25 percent of all restorations will be done with Caridex.'' **********Despite the enthusiasm there are still obstacles. Some patients complain of the salty taste of the solution. In addition, dentists say that Caridex takes longer than drilling. ''Usually, it takes 15 minutes with a conventional handpiece,'' said Henry A. Blom, a dentist in Manhattan. ''With Caridex, it would take 25 minutes.'' **********Finally, Caridex cannot yet completely replace drilling. ''Some cavities are impossible to get to without some drilling and sometimes abrasion is needed for a tooth to hold the filling,'' said a spokesman for the American Dental Association. **********''Caridex isn't a magic wand, but it's not a gimmick,'' Dr. Holm said. ''This is the wave of the future -comfortable dentistry.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/22/business/answers-emerging-on-senate-tax-bill.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1986-05-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1487, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Question", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANSWERS EMERGING ON SENATE TAX BILL", "print_headline": "ANSWERS EMERGING ON SENATE TAX BILL", "body_text": " **********As more details of the Senate Finance Committee's tax revision plan emerge, new questions have been raised by individuals trying to grasp the impact of the sweeping proposal. **********The plan is still being drafted by committee staff members. But in recent days aides and Treasury officials have provided some specifics of what the final document will include. **********The tax bill, unanimously approved by the committee two weeks ago, is expected to reach the Senate floor early next month after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess. **********Here are answers to some of the latest questions about the tax plan: **********Q. Why does support for the Senate committee's bill seem to be so much broader among businesses and other interest groups than for the House version? **********A. Mainly because of the lower individual and corporate tax rates in the Senate plan. With the top rate reduced to 27 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations, giving up deductions and other tax breaks becomes more palatable. The Senate bill is also viewed as achieving greater simplicity for individuals, which is a major goal of tax revision. **********For corporations, the Senate version is much more favorable than the House bill. The Senate bill would increase corporate taxes by $100 billion over five years, but the House bill would increase them $140 billion. **********Although many business people still do not like the idea of tax revision, they now believe that Congress is likely to approve some kind of tax legislation, so they see an advantage in supporting the version that does them the least harm. **********Q. Is it true that some people might get hit with a tax increase next year under the Senate plan? **********A. Yes, because of the way the plan is phased in. Most of the provisions scaling back tax benefits are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, 1987, but tax rates would not be lowered until the following July. As a result, people who now claim such deductions would lose the benefit of those deductions for the full year while gaining only a half-year benefit from the cut in the rates. Others would receive a tax cut next year, although it would be smaller than what they would get in 1988 when the lower rates would apply throughout the year. **********Q. How would the transition in rates affect capital gains tax rates? **********A. The top rate on long-term capital gains in 1987 would be 27 percent for the entire year. A senior Senate Finance Committee aide said the committee staff was devising a formula to prevent next year's ''blended'' rate schedules from automatically pushing the capital gains rate beyond 27 percent - a cap that would not apply to wages and other income in 1987. Long-term gains, which are now taxed at a top rate of 20 percent, would no longer receive preferential treatment under the Senate bill. **********Q. The Senate plan does not seem to make many fundamental changes to the corporate tax code. What happened to the idea of eliminating most special industry tax breaks to create a level playing field for business? **********A. The playing field still looks quite bumpy. Many of the tax breaks for oil and gas, timber, mining, financial institutions and military contractors would be retained. And depreciation write-offs for machinery and equipment would actually increase. **********But the tax plan goes further than is apparent toward removing some of the tax system's current bias favoring certain industries over others. The proposed repeal of the investment tax credit for machinery and equipment purchases was one step. **********Of more sweeping impact are the lower corporate tax rate and a stiffer minimum tax on corporations. Both would dilute the value of special industry tax benefits. **********Q. Would the increase in corporate taxes simply be passed on to consumers? **********A. In some cases they might. But not all companies would be able to pass the increased tax burden on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Companies facing stiff foreign competition would have difficulty raising their prices. The same would be true for companies selling products whose demand is sensitive to price changes. In these cases, the tax increase would likely translate into smaller profit margins for the company, which might hurt stockholders or force the company to make cutbacks in other areas. **********Q. Is it true that homeowners would be able to get around the restrictions on consumer interest deductions by simply taking out a second mortgage or a home-equity credit line? **********A. Yes. Although credit card finance charges, interest on car and education loans and other consumer debt would no longer be deductible, interest on second mortgages and home-equity credit lines would remain fully deductible - even if the proceeds are used to finance the same consumer items. This loophole exists in both the House and Senate tax bills. The reason is that tax writers did not want to infringe in any way on the mortgage deduction for first and second homes, which they regard as sacred and untouchable. **********Q. Will not clever accountants be able to find plenty of other such loopholes, making the new system just as unfair as the current one? **********A. There are bound to be some other loopholes found, but the Senate bill would curtail many of the most effective methods for cutting taxes, such as the use of tax-shelter losses to reduce taxes on income from other sources. While accountants and tax lawyers might find alternative strategies, they would likely be less attractive schemes that are suitable for fewer people. Furthermore, the lower tax rates would reduce the incentive to search for tax-avoidance schemes. **********Q. Would the out-of-pocket cost of financing a home go up if mortgage deductions are worth less under a system of lower rates? **********A. Yes, but homeowners would still likely end up no worse off. **********Consider, for example, someone now in the 40 percent tax bracket with monthly mortgage and property tax payments of $1,000. This homeowner now saves $400 in taxes through the deductions and thus has to pay only $600 a month out of pocket. If his tax rate fell to 27 percent, the deductions would save only $270 in taxes, making the homeowner pick up the other $730 - an extra $130 a month. **********But the homeowner would be saving a similar amount of taxes on income earned. Instead of paying $400 tax on $1,000 of income, the homeowner would pay only $270 - a tax saving of $130. Because of other provisions in the bill, many homeowners would wind up with more money in their pockets, rather than less. **********Q. So how is the homeowner affected if everything balances out? **********A. The relative cost of housing would go up as a proportion of the owner's after-tax income - even though the after-tax income might well increase. Some homeowners will not care. Others might decide to spend a smaller share of their income on housing. **********Q. Since the tax plan would repeal special capital gains tax treatment, would the favorable tax rules on home sales go out the window as well? **********A. No. Homeowners would still be able to defer taxes on gains from the sale of their principal residence so long as a new residence of equal or greater value is purchased within two years. The bill would also retain the one-time exclusion of up to $125,000 of gains on the sale of a principal residence by homeowners 55 or older. **********Q. Would elderly taxpayers find more of their Social Security benefits subject to tax? **********A. Some would. But that does not mean they would end up with a higher total tax bill. Under current law, about 10 percent of Social Security recipients are subject to Federal income tax on a portion of their Social Security benefits. The formula for determining how much, if any, of the benefits are now subject to tax is based on adjusted gross income. **********The Senate plan would not change the formula, but adjusted gross income would become a larger figure for some taxpayers. The reason is that the Senate plan would expose more income to tax. For example, the current 60 percent tax exclusion for long-term capital gains would be eliminated. So would the exclusion for dividends. **********With those exclusions gone, adjusted gross income would go up for taxpayers with dividend or capital gains income, resulting in more of their Social Security benefits being subject to tax. But for many retirees, this increase would likely be more than offset by the lower tax rates."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/14/business/company-news-people-express-shifts-deadline.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 223, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People Express Shifts Deadline", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; People Express Shifts Deadline", "body_text": " **********People Express Inc. said yesterday that it had extended until today the deadline for obtaining creditors' approval of a change in the airline's debt structure, a key condition of its acquisition by the Texas Air Corporation.

Trott, the No. 3 official at the Justice Department. The request was made several weeks ago, the officials said. **********Lawmakers said the disclosures raised serious questions about whether senior Justice Department officials had advance knowledge of ties between support for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, and efforts to release the hostages. **********Administration officials have acknowledged that American weapons were sold to Iran in hopes of freeing the hostages, and that millions of dollars in profits from the arms sale were diverted to support the rebel groups. Justice Dept. Statement **********In a carefully worded statement, the Justice Department denied news reports indicating that Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and other department officials had advance knowledge that money from Iran had been funneled to the contras. The officials have denied knowing of the diversions until late last month. **********The statement by Patrick Korten, a department spokesman, said ''legitimate national security concerns required a brief delay in inquiries involving Southern Air Transport several weeks ago.'' **********Southern Air, a Miami-based carrier formerly owned by the Central Intelligence Agency, has been linked both to the Iran arms sale and efforts to support the contras. It was used to transport American arms to Iran through Israel earlier this year, officials said. **********Mr. Korten would not say if the hostage issue figured in the decision to delay the inquiries. He added that the delay ''does not go to the integrity of the process.'' 'Not Affected in Any Way' **********''The inquiries resumed shortly thereafter,'' he said. ''The inquiries were not affected in any way.'' Both the F.B.I. and the Customs Service are said to be studying the activities of Southern Air, officials said. **********At a brief meeting with reporters, Mr. Trott, the Associate Attorney General and former head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, would not comment on reports of a delay in the F.B.I. investigation. **********''I'm just not in a position to comment on it right now,'' he said. **********Senior law enforcement officials said they were convinced that Mr. Trott knew nothing of the diversion of money to the contras, although he was probably aware of some link between support for the rebel groups and the American hostages. Letter From Biden **********In a letter to the department today, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called for an internal investigation of the reasons for the delay. **********He said the inquiry should be conducted by the department's Office of Professional Responsibility and focus on ''allegations of possible improper or unethical activities in connection'' with the F.B.I. investigation. **********The department had no immediate comment on the Senator's request. A Congressional aide said Mr. Biden's letter was intended to guarantee that Justice Department documents related to the case were not destroyed. **********In another development, a member of the three-judge panel seeking a special prosecutor for the Iran arms investigation said the panel was still considering ''several names that are very much at the top of our list.'' F.B.I. Background Check **********The judge, Walter R. Mansfield of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, said in an interview that the panel had submitted a list of candidates to the F.B.I. for a preliminary background check and was waiting for a response. **********''My hope is that we can get this thing over within the next week,'' he said. Judge Mansfield declined to discuss which lawyers were under consideration for the job of special prosecutor, known formally as an independent counsel. **********Justice Department officials said the statement today was approved by the Attorney General and Mr. Trott. Law enforcement officials said they understood that Mr. Trott's request for a delay was made directly to William H. Webster, the F.B.I. Director. **********An F.B.I. official said he did not believe that the request had prompted ''any protest over here.'' **********He said it was not unprecedented for the Justice Department or other agencies to seek delays in F.B.I. investigations, particularly in espionage cases that could jeopardize relations between the United States and other countries. U.S. Cargo Plane Downed **********According to the Justice Department statement, the delay this time ''did not adversely affect the conduct of these inquiries.'' **********''At no time during this period did officials of the Department of Justice have or obtain knowledge of anything related to recent disclosures of funds transferred to the contras which were involved with the Iranian arms transfers,'' the statement said. **********Law-enforcement officials said the F.B.I. investigation came after an American cargo plane was shot down Oct. 5 in Nicaragua, and Eugene Hasenfus, one of its American crew members, was taken prisoner. **********Mr. Hasenfus said he was working for Corporate Air Services Inc. of Lancaster, Pa., a company he said was connected to Southern Air Transport. **********Southern Air has denied any connection between the company and the downed plane but acknowledges that the plane's co-pilot, Wallace Blaine Sawyer Jr., worked for Southern Air until April.

Two Republicans, Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Larry Pressler of South Dakota, dissented. **********Lawmakers from both parties hailed the committee vote as a clear signal to both the Government in Pretoria and the Reagan Administration that Congress is determined to enact a stringent sanctions bill this year and is prepared to override a Presidential veto. **********House Bill Seeks Divestment **********Last month, the House passed a bill to require complete withdrawal of American investments in South Africa, but most lawmakers assume it will never become law. A similar proposal by Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, was defeated by the committee Thursday. **********Senator Charles McC. Mathias of Maryland, a senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, called the panel's action today a ''tremendous step forward'' and said it would ''get the attention of the people in South Africa we want to listen to us.'' **********In South Africa today, President P.

According to the Commerce Department, the United States purchased $75.3 million worth of uranium oxide and $43.4 million worth of coal from South Africa last year. **********Today, Senator Cranston said he would offer amendments to strengthen some provisions when the bill reaches the Senate floor, as it may do as early as next week. But he expressed satisfaction with the committee bill and said, ''Half a club is better than no club.'' **********Mr. Cranston also said he would not try to toughen the bill to a point where it could no longer command at least a two-thirds vote in the Senate. That is the vote needed to override a Presidential veto. A Signal to Britain **********The committee held an unusual Friday session to approve legislation before the Commonwealth nations meet in London this weekend and discuss the sanctions issue. Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, said the panel's action ''might be helpful in getting a point across'' to the Government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. **********Britain has steadfastly resisted pressures from other Commonwealth members to impose sanctions. **********A spokesman for Mr. Lugar, Mark Helmke, said the Commonwealth countries and the Senate were in similar positions: trying to apply pressure to the Thatcher and Reagan Administrations to move more rapidly on sanctions. **********After defeating the Cranston proposal Thursday, the committee turned to a less drastic alternative advanced by Senator Lugar. Today, by a vote of 13 to 4, the panel adopted an amendment offered by Senator Mathias and Daniel J. Evans, a Washington Republican, that made several key provisions in the Lugar bill tougher. **********For example, the Lugar bill would have banned new investments only in companies that do not adhere to anti-discrimination guidelines. Under the Mathias-Evans amendment, that ban was extended to all companies. **********A ban on loans to the South African Government was also extended to Government-controlled corporations. **********Lawmakers agree that these bans will have little practical effect, since new investments in South Africa have virtually dried up. Nevertheless, they consider enacting them an important symbolic gesture. **********The original draft would have banned the importation of products made by Government-owned or controlled companies in South Africa. The amendment approved today added the ban on uranium, steel and coal. Textile Ban Rejected **********Senator Cranston proposed adding an embargo on textile imports, but this lost on a tie vote. An Administration decision to increase textile imports from South Africa by 4 percent has been widely criticized on Capitol Hill. **********Other major provisions of the measure approved today include cancellation of landing rights for South African airlines, new authority for the President to deny visas to officials of the Pretoria Government, encouragement to the President to sell off American gold reserves as a way to undermine the South African economy, and a ban on the use of American banks by the Pretoria Government and its state-owned companies. **********There was controversy over a set of additional actions the President would be empowered to take if the system of apartheid is not dismantled within a year. One would be a ban on American military assistance to countries that continue to supply arms to Pretoria. It was adopted despite arguments by several lobbyists that such a provision could eventually lead to a cutoff of aid to Israel. **********The final version also says the sanctions would be lifted if Pretoria releases Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned black nationalist leader, and takes three of these four actions: repealing the state of emergency, legalizing black political organizations such as the African National Congress, removing restrictions on allowing blacks to live in integrated areas and promising to negotiate with black leaders in good faith. **********Several efforts by Senator Helms to soften the bill were decisively rejected. In his remarks, the North Carolina Republican assailed Mr. Mandela as a Communist and said, ''Before we get his halo in place too securely, let's examine this guy.'' **********He also said it was ''hypocrisy'' for the committee to bar South African airlines from landing here while the Soviet Union, which he termed an ''outlaw state,'' has landing rights. **********Despite the strong support for the sanctions measure, Senator Dole has insisted that it will not be considered until the Senate deals with a White House request to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether the Senate will get to the issue before Aug. 15, when it is scheduled to recess.

Both this country's Federal Reserve Board and foreign governments resisted deep cuts in borrowing costs despite a persistently sluggish worldwide economy. And while the soft state of business was not producing the expected benefits on the interest rate front, it did cause investors to stay away from certain industries, such as high technology, where fortunes are rigidly tied to the economy. **********Mark Sladkus, head of Morgan Stanley Capital International, which tracks worldwide stock market trends, said investors were more conscious of interest rates during the second quarter than previously. **********Some Profit Taking Noted **********''Also, some of the weakness in the second quarter was due to profit taking,'' said Mr. Sladkus, who pointed out that the worldwide stock market, according to Capital International's calculations, rose an extraordinarily strong 20.7 percent in this year's first quarter. He said these corrections were most noticeable in the Italian and French stock markets, which rose 70.5 percent and 40.5 percent, respectively, in the first quarter. **********During the second quarter, according to figures provided by Capital International, which calculates the movement of various stock markets using its own weighted index with a base year of 1970, stock markets around the world improved by a very modest 3.42 percent. **********The best gains came in the Singapore/Malaysia stock market, where prices rose 25.8 percent when calculated on a dollar basis. But the jump was big only because of comparison with the Singapore market's poor first quarter, when prices declined 8.5 percent at a time when most other markets were rising sharply. Difficult Time for Mexico **********One of the poorer performances during the second quarter was turned in by France, where stock prices fell 4 percent after a sharp increase in the first quarter. But the worst of all on Capital's list was the Mexican market, where the drop in the peso and declining oil prices caused a 13.72 percent plunge in stock prices. **********In the United States, stocks rose only 1.89 percent in the second quarter, compared with 13.3 percent during the first three months of the year, according to Capital's figures. Although major market indicators during the second quarter occasionally topped record levels, volume on the major stock exchanges were generally light, as investors saw little fundamental reason to invest in equities. **********In fact, the biggest fireworks during the past quarter came from programmed trading - a strictly institutional phenomenon - that occurred whenever the price of the cash stock market became misaligned with stock index futures and index options. **********Professionals said that much of the volume and price volatility in the second quarter, including a record 45-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on June 9, were caused by computerized trading programs. A Spur to Trading Activity **********These programs, in essence, gave professionals a reason to continue participating in the stock market even when a cloudy picture of the economy could make them inactive. **********''The market was pretty trendless,'' said Hugh Johnson, an analyst and economist with the First Albany Corporation. ''When you reflect on the quarter, it seems as though a lot happened. But we went nowhere.'' **********The market would surge, traders said, whenever there was news about an improving economy or declining oil prices, or when the lackluster business conditions were perceived as positive for interest rates. **********Whenever it became clear that interest rates were going to stay put, however, equities turned sour. **********''I think the reason there were so many starts and stops was because we got some encouraging economic news, which was followed by a long series of discouraging economic data,'' said Mr. Johnson. **********Despite the Dow's near record close on Friday, traders and market analysts said many professional portfolio managers were concerned that stock prices continued to rise at a time of stagnant interest rates, stable oil prices and sagging profits. Disappointments Perceived **********''The sum of it is that money managers will walk away from this quarter saying to themselves that the economic and earnings response to the decline in interest rates, the dollar and oil prices that the stock market promised us in the first quarter never materialized,'' said Mr. Johnson. **********Francis Schott, chief economist with the Equitable Life Assurance Society, said ''the economy has turned out to be weaker than previously expected'' and is growing at only about a 2.5 percent annual rate. Many economists had been expecting 3 percent growth, he said. **********''They are still saying the second half will be better, but now perhaps the fourth quarter more than the third quarter,'' said Mr. Schott. The silver lining, according to economists, is that interest rates could continue to decline into the third quarter, whereas most experts had originally been predicting that there would be pressure for rates to move higher. **********Some stocks have performed exceptionally well during the second quarter, and analysts say they tend to be in industries that do not ebb and flow with the overall economy. **********Because consumers have remained active spenders during 1986, industries such as retailing, nondurable goods and drugs have stayed strong despite weakness in the capital goods sector. This, in turn, has been reflected in the stock prices of the stronger industries. 'Tortoise-and-Hare Market' **********''People keep looking for rotation and change in leadership,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, manager of equity market analysis for Salomon Brothers. ''It's a tortoise-and-hare market. Everyone's looking for the hare, and the tortoise just keeps on going.'' **********The most productive stock in the United States during the last six quarter, said Mr. Birinyi, was Woolworth, the old-time retailer. Its shares appreciated 150 percent in the period. **********But market analysts say some of the most exciting second-quarter action came from corporate restructurings, many of which were self-imposed. This was in sharp contrast to the merger mania that occurred during the latter part of 1985, when friendly as well as unfriendly takeovers were more in vogue. **********Mr. Birinyi, for instance, calculates that in April alone corporate restructurings - including mergers, leveraged buyouts, divestitures and stock buybacks - totaled $25.7 billion. There were $44 billion more of restructurings during May and $18 billion during June. **********The $134 billion total in the first six months of 1986 is ahead of last year's pace of $121 billion for the first half. During all of 1985 there were $235 billion in restructurings, according to Mr. Birinyi. New York **********Stock prices on Wall Street were very volatile during the second quarter, but in the end the major indexes that are followed by investors had risen very little. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, for instance, ended the first quarter at 1,818, and last Friday stood at 1,885.26, only a 3.6 percent gain. **********By comparison the Dow rose 21.3 percent during the first quarter. There is still one trading session - today's - in the second quarter. **********While the Dow follows the action of only 30 blue-chip stocks, other broader market indicators also rose at a fairly modest pace. The New York Stock Exchange composite index, which calculates the price of all issues on the Big Board, started the second quarter at 137.71 and finished last week at a record high of 143.18, for a 4 percent gain. **********Michael Sherman, head of the investment policy committee at Shearson Lehman Brothers, believes that private pension funds became very cautious during the second quarter and that this was a key to the market's sluggish performance. **********''The pension fund industry is no longer as aggressive as it was in attempting to beat the market on the upside,'' said Mr. Sherman, who estimates that pension funds account for about 25 percent of all the equities held. He said their caution was caused by the fact that most of them were overfunded and ''they don't want big losses.'' **********''You've seen in this quarter some investors trying to time an exit from the market after the runup from October through March, which was accompanied by a tremendous fall in interest rates,'' he said. **********But when stock prices did not yield to selling pressure, traders said, investors plowed funds back into equities. This, along with the unattractive yields in fixed-rate investments, caused the dramatic market shifts during the quarter. **********One of the more discernable trends on Wall Street during the latest period, according to Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, was the attention paid to consumer stocks. **********Mr. Metz said the focus was on ''high visibility, high quality growth stocks,'' especially those of companies with a direct connection to consumers. Among the beneficiaries were the shares of soft drink companies, tobacco concerns, retailers, food enterprises and pharmaceutical companies. London **********The economy was the dampening influence that turned an excellent first quarter in Britain's equities market into a so-so second quarter. **********''The market was extremely strong in the first quarter, reflecting optimism about world growth because of the fall in oil prices and interest rates,'' said Martin Barnes, an international economist for the British brokerage firm of Wood Mackenzie & Company. ''In the second quarter people began to realize that economic prospects were not quite so exciting.'' **********The Financial Times 500-stock index, which opened the quarter at 901.13, closed Friday at 891.07. **********The slackening off in the equities market, analysts said, was caused by a realization that the decline in oil prices had done little so far to improve the British economy. The London Business School, for instance, last week predicted that economic growth in Britain this year would reach only 2 percent instead of the 3 percent that was predicted by the Government earlier this year. **********New equity offerings - about 50 were floated in the second quarter -also more than satisfied the demand for stocks in Britain. ''A lot of paper has been issued - giving investors a fright,'' said Kenneth W. Inglis, research director for Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage firm. **********Among the sectors that did well were printing and publishing, metals and metal-forming and property. **********Jaguar P.L.C., the maker of luxury autos, rose nearly 15 percent, and the Beecham Group, the pharmaceutical giant, gained nearly 7 percent. **********British Telecom, however, slid nearly 12 percent. And the mining sector, hard hit by the political tension in South Africa, slumped as Consolidated Gold Fields and the Rio Tinto Zinc Company led the drop. **********Looking ahead, analysts said the planned privatization of British Gas next fall, estimated to be worth $:8 billion, could have a deflating effect on the equities market. Tokyo **********Low interest rates pushed stock prices sharply higher in Japan during the second quarter. They reached record levels toward the end of the period. The Nikkei Dow Jones stock index rose about 11 percent during the quarter, in which the Tokyo exchange had the fourth-best performance of all the major stock markets. **********Market analysts credited the bullish market to excess liquidity brought on by the lower rates, which forced investors into the equities market in search of higher yields. **********The Nikkei index started the quarter at 15,745.68 yen but quickly weakits rung up in the previous quarter. Hovering near the 15,000 level for about three weeks, stock prices began to climb again on the expectation that the United States and Japan would act in concert to bring down interest rates. With lower rates expected on fixed-income investments, Japanese investors rushed into the stock market, hoping to beat the crowd into shares that had fallen during the correction. **********Soon the Nikkei average broke through the 16,000 level, eventually peaking at 16,078 yen on May 8. Strong segments of the market were high technology and biotechnology as well as interest-sensitive areas such as construction and real estate. **********The rally, however, was short-lived. By May 12, with the yen fast rising against the dollar, the index returned to the 15,000 level. **********Then it rose again, and a May 23 rally sent the average back up to 16,000. This time it was a depreciation in the value of the yen that acted as a stimulus. But other internal factors, especially the approaching elections for both houses of parliament, caused investor optimism to grow. A record 17,454 was reached by the Nikkei on June 21, and analysts are predicting strong demand for stocks in the near future. **********''Domestic demand-related issues will continue to dominate the market for some months to come,'' said Yoichiro Noda, head of the stock division of Nomura Securities. Hong Kong **********The fifth-best stock market performance, according to Capital International, was Hong Kong, where prices had risen 9.48 percent by last week in contrast to a drop of 5.4 percent in the first quarter. **********The Hang Seng index began the second quarter at 1,603, as investors, especially institutions, felt that share prices had reached their low point during the first quarter. **********A few days after the second quarter began, the index had exceeded the 1,700 level. Then it broke through the 1,800 barrier on April 17. The reasons for the gain, according to market analysts, were the healthy profits being reported by most major Hong Kong companies. **********An offering of Cathay Pacific Airlines stock during the quarter helped the overall market pick up momentum. Investors became excited when the sale was heavily oversubscribed. Cathay, Hong Kong's flag carrier, had offered to sell 397.85 million of its shares, and orders were received for more than 13 billion. **********The unsuccessful bidders, it was rumored, would probably pump their funds into other stocks once they received a refund. But the excitement died down, causing stock prices to decline by the end of May before experiencing a slight improvement toward the end of the quarter. By Friday, the index had slid back to 1,750.9. Paris **********The fast growth in stock prices experienced on the Bourse during the first three months of the year reversed itself in the second quarter, when prices fell more than 4 percent. The CAC index dropped about 50 points in the second quarter, ending Friday at 304.7. That put the Paris stock market in 16th place out of the 19 major markets followed by Capital International. **********In addition to the worldwide economic outlook, France suffered from political concerns caused when Jacques Chirac, a conservative, became prime minister. People in the financial markets worried that Mr. Chirac would not be able to avoid conflicts with Francois Mitterrand, the nation's president. **********On the economic side, meanwhile, investors were concerned that trade figures released in April and other reports meant that French industry was becoming uncompetitive with rivals in other nations. **********With the retreat of stock prices, some professional investment advisers think it is a good time to start rebuilding portfolios. ''You should be in French stocks,'' said Hugo de Crozes, a fund manager at Europeene de Banque, ''particularly when you consider the alternatives.'' Mr. de Crozes thinks stock prices in other markets - particularly London and Tokyo, are overpriced. West Germany **********After surging ahead in early April on momentum from the strong first quarter, the Frankfurt stock market stumbled under the pressure of the weak dollar, rising interest rates, local elections and the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl power plant in the Soviet Union. **********These divergent factors caused stock prices to slide about 15 percent from their high point in mid-April. The Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung index fell from 695.44 to 645.3 in the second quarter. **********Market analysts said the peaks, especially for banking and utility stocks, reflected expectations of lower interest rates as well as a bullish mood among British portfolio managers who invest in West German securities. **********Margot Schonen, who is with the Westdeutsche Landesbank in Dusseldorf, believes German stocks were overbought at the high point, a situation that was corrected in May and June by heavy selling. **********The sell-off, according to market analysts, was caused mainly by concern that the pro-business Christian Democratic Party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl could suffer electoral setbacks in key elections in the Lower Saxony state. **********Although the Chancellor's party won those elections by a narrow margin, the expected post-election surge in stock prices never materialized. **********Dieter Wermuth, an analyst with Citibank, believes the newest reasons for the market's slump are economic, not political. He cited rising interest rates, which climbed more than a half percentage point in West Germany since mid-April, and a lower dollar, which acts unfavorably on that nation's heavy export-oriented industries. **********The Chernobyl accident, analysts said, hurt companies such as Siemens A.G., the huge manufacturer of electrical products. Its Kraftwerk Union subsidiary is a major producer of nuclear power plants. **********The outlook? ''Everyone is banking on consumer spending,'' said Citibank's Mr. Wermuth. But the long-expected spending boom is only gradually gaining steam. Tax reforms put into effect in January, sizable wage increases and low inflation all point to the spending rise coming soon, analysts said. Toronto **********Prices on the Toronto Stock Exchange rose to record highs during the second quarter, but by last week they had fallen back to virtually where they were three months ago. The exchange's composite index closed Friday at 3,070.3, only slightly higher than its 3,028.7 at the start of the quarter. **********As in the United States, the stable overall performance masked tremendous volatility in selected stocks and industry groups. **********Mining shares, for instance, fell an average of 9 percent and oil company stocks dropped 8 percent because of continued weakness in the price of some natural resources. **********Among the groups with outstanding gains were communications stocks, with publishing issues rising 11 percent, and forest products stocks, which gained 7 percent because of higher lumber prices. **********Two of the strongest performers in Toronto trading were Cableshare, a computer and home shopping company, which rose from $7.50 a share at the start of the quarter to about $48, and the Ahed Corporation, which rose from just 20 cents a share to $28 after announcing a new biotechnology deal. **********But declining oil prices discouraged investors of some energy issues. Imperial Oil, in particular, fell to 39 1/4, from 44 3/4, during the period. **********Ross Healy, director of research at Merrill Lynch Canada, said conditions in the Canadian market are ready for a ''potentially sharp correction,'' although the longer-term outlook is bright. South Africa **********Racial unrest in South Africa continued to drag down not only gold mine stocks but also shares of industrial and manufacturing companies. **********Anthony Garnett of McIntosh Martin & Company, a London brokerage firm, said, ''Obviously it's an extremely bearish time for South African shares.'' **********The Financial Times Gold Mines Index, according to Mr. Garnett, has fallen about 44 percent since the high of 357 it reached in late January. Gold mine stocks have recovered from the low of 192 on June 12, but the rally has been intermittent, and there are still signs of hesitancy by investors. **********''The market seemed to reach a low shortly before the Soweto day holiday,'' Mr. Garnett said, reasoning that investors felt there would be a great deal of racial strife then. Although there was some violence, the holiday was not as bad as many investors had expected, and stock prices have recovered recently. **********Much of the slump in South African shares, analysts said, could be attributed directly to the declining value of the rand in relation to other currencies. Other Markets **********The last shall be first, it has been said, and that was true in the case of the Singapore/Malaysia stock market as a dismal first-quarter performance turned into an outstanding second-quarter recovery. **********In Sweden, however, stock prices have put together two consecutive spectacular quarters. Stock prices there were up 26 percent in the first three months of the year, according to Capital International, and 16 percent more in the second quarter. The Swedish market was second only to Singapore in second-quarter gains, according to the research firm. **********Other first-quarter stars faded amid the harsher economics of the second quarter. Italy, for instance, the winner in the first quarter with a 70 percent jump in stock prices, has lost nearly 6 percent since April 1. **********But Spain, where stocks rose an impressive 67 percent in the first quarter, managed an 8 percent rise in the second quarter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/business/credit-markets-measuring-bonds-over-time.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Quint", "pub_date": "1986-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 686, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Measuring Bonds Over Time", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; Measuring Bonds Over Time", "body_text": " **********The past three weeks, as the yield for the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell to 8.27 percent, from 9.30 percent, have been exhilarating for bondholders. But that rally has not reduced the anxiety of traders and investors, who must decide whether the rally will continue. **********Now that bond yields have plunged decisively into single-digit territory, analysts are brushing the dust off financial records of the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's to remind themselves of ''normal'' market conditions. What they find is that long-term bond yields are at their lowest levels since April 1978, but remain high compared with earlier years. **********Veterans of the bond business still recall such bellwether Treasury issues as the 4 1/4 percent bonds due in 1992, which were issued in 1962. Some traders never expected these bonds -or the 6 1/8 percent bonds maturing in November - to trade below par. The interest rate on those bonds was high enough to raise eyebrows when it was announced in 1971, but was eclipsed by issues like the 16 1/8 percent notes that coincidentally mature on the same day. **********To many, the examination of the past provides hope that the decline in rates can continue. A good sign that lower yields are expected by many was last week's mad scramble to buy bonds, especially long issues that are not callable before maturity. **********In the Treasury market, the 9 1/4 percent issue due in 2016 rose 4 7/8 points at the same time as a record $9.25 billion of new corporate and mortgage-backed issues were sold. **********One frequently used evaluation for bond yields is to compare them with recent inflation experience. By this gauge, the 8.27 percent yield for the 9 1/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016 is still more than four percentage points higher than the 4 percent inflation rate that has prevailed over the past four years. Assuming that inflation this year is 3 percent or less, as many economist now predict, long-term bond yields are still generous. Until the early 1970's, bond yields were about two or three percentage points higher than inflation. **********Of course, bond buyers ought to be comparing bond yields with inflation over the life of their investment, not with the recent past. But long-range inflation forecasts are very tenuous and many investors have tended to focus on the short term and the beneficial aspects of lower oil prices this year. Cheaper oil is expected both to reduce this year's inflation rate to 3 percent or less and help shrink the Federal budget deficit by stimulating the economy and Government tax receipts. **********Many analysts, including Paul A. Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, have warned that the sharp drop in the value of the dollar the past year will lead to higher prices of imported goods and American products. **********''I think it's premature for the bond market rally on the lower oil prices,'' said William Griggs, an economist at Griggs & Santow, an economic advisory firm. ''Oil is a volatile market and its price need not remain at $14 a barrel, so perhaps inflation will not be as low as expected.'' **********Another way to measure long-term bond yields is to compare them with the yield available on shorter-term issues. The difference between the bond equivalent yield of three-month Treasury bills and 20-year Treasury bonds has contracted to 1.1 percentage points in recent weeks, down sharply from more than three percentage points last October and two percentage points in early February. This shows that investors are not demanding as much reward, in the form of higher yields, for assuming the risks of a long-term bond investment. **********But according to an analysis by Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities, a firm based in Chicago, the recent spread between three-month bills and 20-year bonds is still high compared to earlier years. During the economic expansion of 1961 through 1967, the 20-year issue yielded on average only 65 one-hundreths of a percentage point more than three-month bills."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/world/japanese-agree-to-star-wars-research-us-expects-limited-help.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1986-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 388, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Expects Limited Help", "print_headline": "JAPANESE AGREE TO 'STAR WARS' RESEARCH; U.S. Expects Limited Help", "body_text": " **********Japanese participation in the research on an American anti-missile program may offer the Pentagon access to a host of technologies in leading-edge computer designs, semiconductors and artificial intelligence programming software that could speed the development of a space-based defense against nuclear attack, experts said yesterday. **********But at the same time, American Defense Department officials and industry analysts expressed sharp doubts that Japan's electronics giants would prove willing to contribute their most advanced technologies to the project, for fear of revealing too much to American competitors. **********And some Pentagon officials say they are very reluctant to entrust key classified elements of the ''Star Wars'' development to Japanese industry, which is closely monitored by the Soviet Union. **********''It sounds nice on paper, but by definition the Japanese are not going to want to sell us anything we really want to buy,'' said John Pike, the associate director for space policy at the Federation of American Scientists.

But the crowded industry, beset with marketing and development problems, is already heading for a shakeout, analysts say. **********One big company that has had a strong interest in machine vision, the General Electric Company, has reportedly cut back its efforts to market the systems, which help perform inspection, assembly and maintenance functions. And most suppliers of the equipment are struggling to survive. **********The problem is that there are between 100 and 200 of these companies, mostly less than five years old, courting potential customers with a bewildering array of technological approaches to vision in the factory. **********''Many of the vision companies want to become a supplier at any price - they'll promise anything,'' said Frank Caiati, director of machine intelligence at the General Motors Technology Center. ''The difficulty is that if everybody sells systems like that, there's an artificially low threshold price.'' Such pricing often wipes out profit margins. Practical Problems Arise **********''It's exciting - the same way trying to cross Route 128 on foot is exciting,'' said Robert J. Shillman, president and chief executive officer of the Cognex Corporation, referring to the eight-lane highway that runs by the headquarters of his five-year-old company in Needham, Mass. **********Such a cycle has been played out before - in the nation's computer industry, for example. During the initial boom of personal computers, scores of companies raced into the manufacture of peripherals, particularly disk drives, which store and retrieve data. The result was a fierce price war among manufacturers of similar products. Now only a handful of companies can afford to manufacture the drives in the United States. **********One reason pricing has often turned out to be unrealistic in the machine vision industry is that the practical problems of adapting the technology to the gritty world of the factory have been bigger than expected. **********''The machine vision makers have problems because they don't understand the environment they're working into, and we have problems because we don't understand the machines they are bringing in,'' Mr. Caiati said. **********Talk about machine vision's business potential became serious in the late 1970's as computer processing -a key component of vision systems -became cheaper. The price decline coincided with American manufacturers' growing interest in an automation technology, largely because of pressure from foreign competition. Investors poured into the field. 'A Wave of Investment' **********''There's lots of young M.B.A.'s working on deploying the venture capital pool, which jumped from $1 billion to more than $16 billion when President Carter cut capital gains taxes,'' said Stanley Lapidus, president of the Itran Corporation, a machine vision company founded with venture capital in 1983 in Manchester, N.H. ''That creates a wave of investment whenever a good idea appears.'' **********Investors and entrepreneurs alike, however, underestimated the hurdles confronting them. For example, several machine vision producers learned the hard way that some basic industrial operations, such as welding, are as much an art as a science, making automation design difficult. **********Even when operations seemed clear on paper, vision systems designed for them often were unworkable because actual factory practice was different or complicated. One auto maker told George Gagliardi, a machine vision specialist at the consulting concern of Arthur D. Little Inc., that at one time it had 48 vision systems from 20 different suppliers. **********Frequently the fault is not with the vision system. Robert Thibadeau, a professor and machine vision researcher at Carnegie-Mellon University and also a consultant to companies making or using the equipment, says there are cases when workers, worried about job security, sabotage vision systems by cutting wires. Lack of Proper Training **********More commonly, management simply fails to adequately train workers to use the new technology. **********So far, no machine vision company has come up with a general vision system recognized as superior for a wide variety of tasks. New applications often require much computer programming and engineering time. It may cost up to $20,000 just to set up a demonstration of a large system. **********''None of the niches in which vision is used is a true market yet, and none of them are close enough to each other so that if you get one it's easy to get another,'' said Michael J. Cronin, president and chief executive officer of Automatix Inc., a start-up company based in Billerica, Mass. **********''It's a deceptively easy industry to enter because it has low capital costs and obviously is going to be very, very important,'' said Phillipe Villers, chairman of Automatix. That company is ''the industry's biggest thinker,'' according to one executive at the General Motors Corporation, the driving force among vision users. But Automatix also symbolizes the industry's growing pains. **********A decade ago Mr. Villers founded Computervision, a Bedford, Mass., company. In the late 1970's it became the leader in computers for engineers, architects and other designers. Company's Ambitious Goal **********In 1980 he organized Automatix with the goal of marrying robotics and vision. Automatix went public in March 1983, selling 1.2 million shares at $19 each. Since then Automatix has been hampered by the costs of trying to achieve the industry's broadest applications base, and it has underbid on some projects that turned out to be far more expensive than expected. **********Moreover, the company's former manager of European sales was accused of overstating sales in 1983, forcing a restatement of earnings. That led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the company's accounting practices. The S.E.C. has not reported its findings. **********In 1984, with the company on its way to a loss of $14.2 million on sales of $20.1 million, Mr. Villers was replaced as chief executive by Mr. Cronin, a co-founder who had come with him from Computervision. **********''They stepped on every land mine in the field,'' said Laura Conigliaro, who follows the industry for Prudential-Bache Securities, which managed Automatix's stock offering. Automatix shares peaked at $26.75 in 1983, a year that saw record highs for the stocks of other start-up industrial vision companies that had gone public. Automatix shares were $3.125 in yesterday's over-the-counter trading. Success on Factory Floor **********Despite all its woes, Automatix is known for the success of its vision systems on the factory floor in a wide range of applications, and it appears to be getting a grip on its losses. The company recently reported a deficit of $5.6 million for 1985 on sales of $27.6 million. It is one of the leading vision suppliers to General Motors and is one of five companies that G.M. has invested in to speed the technology. **********By contrast, another ambitious pioneer, the Machine Intelligence Corporation of Sunnyvale, Calif., failed to penetrate industrial markets and is now struggling to survive by selling high-precision measuring systems to the electronics industry. The Vuebotics Corporation, a San Diego start-up and one of the few to go public, has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since last May. **********The vision business has been just as tough for large companies, too. G.E. is said by users and vision suppliers to be abandoning its vision system marketing effort. That effort had been tied to G.E.'s unsuccessful attempt to sell manufacturers complete automation packages involving computer-controlled machinery at every stage of the manufacturing process, from design to shipping of the finished product. Jack Batty, a company spokesman, said G.E. would not comment on such reports, but he said the company is still marketing three vision systems ''as of today.'' Concentrating on Research **********Other companies seen as potential entrants in the field, including the International Business Machines Corporation, have concentrated on research but have not tried to market their efforts. Japanese manufacturers, notably Hitachi, are known to have worked extensively on industrial vision but just for use in Japan. **********Some leading names in industrial process controls, such as Allen Bradley, Foxboro, Gould and Honeywell, are edging into the field through small acquisitions, investments in start-up companies or sales through small subsidiaries. Last year the Eastman Kodak Company established a subsidiary called Videk to exploit its experience installing 125 vision systems at Kodak plants. **********''We think of Kodak as our venture capitalist,'' said Ghassan Kahwati, Videk's president.

IDEA", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS; ORDER TO BYPASS CONGRESS ON IRAN CALLED C.I.A. IDEA", "body_text": " **********Government officials said today that the Central Intelligence Agency originally proposed the idea of keeping the Iran arms sale secret from Congress. They said the agency took the unusual step in the first draft of what became a Presidential order guiding the program. **********The decision not to tell Congress was a crucial step in the Iran affair, according to Administration officials, because it meant that the entire operation had to be run outside normal channels. **********The issue of what one official termed an ''off the books'' covert action has become significant because the Defense Department and the State Department were largely kept in the dark about the program, and even C.I.A. officials have testified to Congress that they knew little about the details. C.I.A. Contingency Fund **********One result of keeping the matter from Congress was that the agency's multimillion-dollar contingency fund could not be used to underwrite the arms. The C.I.A. is barred by law from spending any money not appropriated by Congress. **********The Iran arms sales were financed by Adnan M. Khashoggi, a Saudi arms dealer, who in turn raised money from a network of private investors in Canada and the Cayman Islands, according to testimony in Congress by C.I.A. officials. **********William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, also said today that he became suspicious last October that money from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to Nicaraguan rebels after a conversation with Roy Furmark, an oil trader and former business associate who was a marginal participant in the deal. Testimony to House Panel **********In testimony Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Casey said he had been ordered by President Reagan not to tell the Congressional intelligence committees or leaders about the plan to sell arms to Iran, House members said. **********That statement is accurate but incomplete, according to current and former Government officials familiar with the drafting of the Presidential order of last Jan. 17. **********Those officials said the first draft of the order, or finding, was written by Stanley Sporkin, then the C.I.A.'s general counsel and now a Federal judge. **********It specified that Congress not be told about the arms shipments. A second draft, rewritten by White House officials, did call for notification of Congress, officials said. The final draft, sent to the President for his decision, was also written by Mr. Sporkin, and it combined the two versions, giving the President several options. With the support of C.I.A. officials, according to officials familiar with the preparation of the finding, Mr. Reagan chose to keep the operation secret from Congress. **********The deliberations over the finding were restricted to a handful of people, Administration officials said. One intelligence source, for example, said there were indications that the C.I.A.'s No. 2 official at the time, John N. McMahon, believed that the agency had opposed from the beginning the idea of not notifying Congress. Effect on Future Relations **********The finding's order that Congress be bypassed is likely to have a profound effect on future relations between Capitol Hill and the agency. The two intelligence panels, formed in the aftermath of the C.I.A. abuses of the 1970's, are likely to become much more aggressive in their oversight of the intelligence agencies, according to several lawmakers. **********''The relationship that we thought existed does not exist,'' a Congressional aide said. ''We thought we had gotten past the point of having to ask exactly the right question to get the right answer. We haven't. The real lasting damage from this thing will be what it does to the oversight process.'' **********The Presidential finding attributes the failure to notify Congress to the ''extreme sensitivity'' and ''security risks.'' Administration officials have said it was believed that such an operation could not be told to the Congressional committees and some staff members without the risk of disclosures to the public. **********Under the law, the President has three options with a covert program. He can tell both Congressional committees. In rare instances, he can brief eight legislators: the chairmen and ranking members of the intelligence committees and the leaders of the House and the Senate. The law also mentions the possibility of not telling Congress, but says the President must then disclose the operation in a ''timely fashion.'' **********Mr. Sporkin was said by a former Administration official to have cited the preamble to the intelligence oversight act, which says notification is required as long as it is consistent with the President's constitutional powers, such as the prerogative to conduct foreign policy. Mr. Sporkin, this official said, viewed that language as a ''loophole'' put in by Congress to allow certain sensitive operations without notification. **********Several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, have said the panel will be looking at ''tightening'' the law on notifying Congress. **********Some legislators have speculated that the operation was kept from them because it would have faced universal opposition. The President is not required to gain Congressional approval for covert activity, but has dropped or modified programs that are opposed by Congress. Money for Nicaraguan Rebels **********Another explanation being examined by some in Congress is that the Iran arms program could have been intended from its inception to funnel money to the Nicaraguan rebels or other causes, and thus was kept from Congress. **********Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has repeatedly assailed the Administration for refusing to tell Congress about a program that was being shared with ''our new friends in Teheran.'' **********Robert C. McFarlane, the national security adviser until Dec. 4, 1985, said in a speech today, ''The deliberate planning for engaging the Congress was part of the concept from its first moments until I left government, and I believe that is an important part of any policy proposal if you intend to sustain it.'' **********A House member who has studied the classified testimony on the Iran program said today that he believed ''the normal authorities of the C.I.A. were transferred to the National Security Council.'' He added, ''The N.S.C. ran the operation, which allowed C.I.A., State and Defense to stay within the restraints of the law.'' **********The C.I.A.'s decision to seek a Presidential finding came in late 1985, after the agency became involved in helping with Israeli shippments of weapons to Iran. Role of Colonel North **********Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the White House aide who was dismissed last month, asked the agency to help ship oil-drilling parts to Iran, Mr. Casey told the committee. The request, according to Government officials, was approved by a mid-level employee. **********Colonel North was told to call Southern Air Transport, the Miami-based concern that was once a C.I.A. proprietary and has figured prominently in the private network to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, House members said. Southern said it had a plane in Europe and was able to arrange the flight. **********When the equipment was loaded onto the plane, the handlers noticed that they were carrying missile parts, not drilling equipment, Mr. Casey told the committee. It is unclear whether anyone then warned the agency. In any event, the flight went ahead, and the agency was told within days by Southern that it had been used to ferry weapons to Iran. **********Asked by the committee whether Colonel North had lied to the C.I.A., Mr. Casey was said to have replied, ''Maybe he made a mistake.'' **********Mr. McMahon, the former No. 2 official at the C.I.A., was furious when he discovered the agency's role in the shipment and said the agency would not send any more arms without a Presidential authorization, according to Administration officials. **********In early December 1985 senior Administration officials decided to end their support of Israel's shipment of arms to Iran. But within weeks, that decision was reversed and the agency's role was detailed in the Jan. 17 finding. **********Mr. Casey, in his testimony to the House, disclaimed knowledge of most of the details of the operation. He said the C.I.A. was aware that the Nicaraguan rebels were getting private money, but did not look into who was providing it. **********''He's denied knowledge, and he's denied curiosity,'' a House member said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/11/world/hungary-to-get-big-macs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Hungary to Get Big Macs", "print_headline": "Hungary to Get Big Macs", "body_text": " **********Representatives of the McDonald's fast-food chain signed an agreement today with Hungarian officials on establishing five outlets, with the first to open next year in Budapest, the Government press agency said.

When the deal is completed late in March, James River, currently No. 5 in the industry, will leap past such giants as the International Paper Company and the Weyerhaeuser Company to become the nation's largest paper and pulp manufacturer, with total sales of nearly $5 billion. **********The company will also be at a critical turning point, analysts say. **********James River's torrid performance - average annual gains of 23.9 percent in earnings and 50 percent in sales over the last decade - has been fueled by acquiring and then turning around one faltering company after another, the analysts said. As James River begins to meld the sprawling Crown operations into its own, it will enter the first sustained period of consolidation in its history, they said. **********And that will require a different strategic focus from its co-founders and driving forces, Brenton S. Halsey, its 58-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, and Robert C. Williams, 55, the president and chief operating officer. 'It's Going to Be Hard' **********''It was easy to grow when they were a small company making acquisitions or taking market share away from others,'' said Louis E. Hannen, an analyst with Wheat, First Securities Inc. here. ''But, frankly, it's going to be hard to grow beyond the industry when you are the industry.'' **********Indeed, the company's next five-year growth plan calls for a less volatile but still hefty 15 percent annual average rise in earnings and a 20 percent average return on equity. **********To meet those projections, the company has already begun to turn away from acquisitions to concentrate instead on fine-tuning its existing operations, Mr. Williams said recently in an interview in his office here overlooking the picturesque rolling river from which the company took its name. **********For example, he said, James River sees growing markets for itself in microwave packaging, plastic diaper linings and paper cups and plates. Heavy Research Spending **********In addition, the company will have spent about $300 million on research and development for the fiscal year ending April 30. ''Our goal is to be the lowest-cost producer of premium products,'' Mr. Williams said. **********But many analysts wonder whether problems with some of the Crown Zellerbach operations might interfere with the fine-tuning - and with the company's earnings forecast. **********''The principal question about this deal is: What's so wonderful about Crown Zellerbach?'' asked George Williamson, an analyst here with Davenport & Company. **********The deal came about in December, when Crown Zellerbach and James River agreed to a complicated exchange of stock valued at about $780 million. Under the agreement, James River would acquire all of Crown Zellerbach's paper operations. In addition, Crown's vast timberland property would go to Sir James Goldsmith, the British financier who won control of Crown last summer. Crown would retain its container division and other operations.  [ James River stock, which had been trading at about $38 a share when the deal was announced, declined a bit at the news but then recovered. It closed Tuesday at a record high, $41.625, up $1.25. ]  'Some Concerns' **********In one sense, the Crown deal was just another acquisition to Mr. Williams. ''When it's completed we'll be doing the same things - we'll just be bigger,'' he said. **********At the same time, he acknowledged that the deal presented ''some concerns.'' James River would not only have to spend huge sums upgrading Crown's paper mills, he said, but the combined operations ''need to achieve optimum growth in order to compete with growing competition from international companies.'' **********The concerns are warranted, analysts say. Two Crown units, flexible packaging and business paper, have had disappointing results of late, they note. In particular, they say, James River will have to prevent Crown's depressed earnings in the broad office market for white paper from diluting its own highly profitable business in that sector. Deal Is Defended **********Nonetheless, Mr. Williams remains convinced of the merits of the deal. **********''In almost all of our acquisitions, people have wondered if we were biting off more than we could chew,'' he said. ''We have found that it makes more economic sense to buy a business, even if you have to turn it around, than to start up an operation on our own. And our experience has worked out pretty well.'' **********To Mr. Williams and other James River officials, the latest acquisition makes considerable economic sense. **********They contend that Crown Zellerbach's strong presence in sanitary paper products in the Western states would complement James River's similar businesses in more easterly markets. The companies' combined lines of business and copying paper would become one of the broadest in the industry, they said, adding that James River's food packaging business would be complemented by Crown's flexible packaging division, which makes such products as potato-chip bags and diaper linings. **********Company officials also said that even the most lackluster of the Crown units have maintained profitability. In the past, they said, James River managed to flourish even though it almost always purchased businesses that were losing money. **********Mr. Williams and Mr. Halsey made their first purchase following the merger of their former employer, the Albemarle Paper Company, and the Ethyl Corporation, a chemicals concern. The merged company, which adopted the Ethyl name, decided to sell much of the Albemarle unit to a buyer that did not want two old paper mills. Mr. Williams and Mr. Halsey, with the help of the Citicorp Venture Capital Company, bought the mills for about $1.5 million. Acquisitions Begin **********Within six months, James River bought a paper coating operation -which became the only unit that it wound up closing - and began buying other weak businesses. It bought a Massachusetts paper mill from the St. Regis Paper Company in 1971 and another from Weyerhaeuser in 1972. **********The list of acquisitions lengthened in the next decade: two mills from the Household Finance Company, the Riegel Products Corporation from Southwest Forest Industries, Scott Graphics Inc. from the Scott Paper Company and the Brown Company from Gulf and Western Industries. **********Perhaps James River's most prized acquisition came in 1982, when it bought the domestic paper business of the American Can Company. That purchase, which included the Dixie-Northern division that made Dixie cups and Northern bathroom tissue, gave James River its first major consumer business and a long-sought source of Southern pulp. **********In a push to introduce its Northern tissue in the Northeast, dubbed Operation Yankee, the company spent an estimated $20 million on advertising that placed the tissue in direct competition with Charmin, the nation's best-selling tissue, made by the Procter & Gamble Company. **********Many in the industry were stunned when Northern captured 10 percent of the market and siphoned market share from Charmin. **********Since then, consumer products have become a significant business for the company, increasing from about 2 percent of sales in 1982 to 35 percent in the most recent fiscal year. **********James River is already the largest maker of specialty papers. Once the acquisition of the Crown Zellerbach businesses is completed, it will also be the leading seller of paperboard and consumer plates and cups and the No. 2 seller of copying paper, behind International Paper. And in the paper towel and tissue market, ''we'll be in the same league as Procter & Gamble,'' Mr. Williams said. **********Does the company's decision to concentrate on existing operations signal an end to its acquisition fever? **********''Not too long ago, someone wrote that James River's acquisition experience had petered out,'' Mr. Williams said with a smile. ''I would say it has slowed down for a while. I can say that strategic acquisitions of small operations will be ongoing. But, for the time being, that's about as much as we want to admit.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/23/business/advertising-ogilvy-mather-buys-lobbying-stake.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-07-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ogilvy & Mather Buys Lobbying Stake", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Ogilvy & Mather Buys Lobbying Stake", "body_text": " **********America's advertising agencies certainly seem determined to affect our lives one way or another. **********Now, in addition to creating what they hope is mind-bending advertising they increasingly are seeking ownership of Washington lobbying firms. **********The JWT Group only recently acquired Gray & Company, a leading practitioner of the art.

''The sooner they are in Nicaragua the better for Honduras.'' **********Concern over the rebels' four-year sojourn in Honduras is now a central topic of debate on the street, within the army, in the National Assembly and between the Honduran Government and the Reagan Administration, according to Honduran officials and Western diplomats based here. Contradictory Aspects **********The debate is complicated and often contradictory. Honduras is a very conservative country with deep antipathy toward the Sandinistas and their Marxist policies. As a consequence, few diplomats and other analysts see any likelihood that it will attempt to expel the Nicaraguan rebels, who are known as contras. One Honduran official described them today as ''a necessary evil'' for his country. **********But concern appears to have been sharpened by the perception here that with a Democratic majority in Congress and the Iran-contra controversy on his hands, President Reagan is less able than ever to guarantee continued support for the rebels or to help Honduras should the rebel war fall apart. **********Last week President Jose Azcona Hoyo, accompanied by his Foreign Minister and the five most powerful officers in the army, emphasized his worries when he told the United States Ambassador, Everett E. Briggs, that the Government wanted the contras to leave Honduras by April, according to three Government officials and diplomats informed of the meeting. **********United States officials in Washington have attempted to play down the Honduran request by saying it is also Administration policy that the contras should leave Honduras and fight inside Nicaragua and that the rebels will be able to do so with the $100 million in new American aid and training they are now receiving. Counting the Cost **********But the fact that the Honduran Government chose to make the appeal in such a direct manner is widely seen here as further evidence that the Government and army have concluded that Honduras is in risk of paying heavily for being host to the rebels. **********''Really nobody wants the contras to be here,'' said Manuel Acosta Bonilla, a leading adviser to the powerful National Party, a conservative opposition group. ''Honduras has paid a high cost, a terrible cost, for this policy and it is time for the Nicaraguans to go.'' **********President Azcona has made similar, though less blunt, statements in the last week, saying at every opportunity that the contras have a legitimate right to fight but that their battlefield is inside Nicaragua, not Honduras. **********Such expressions of concern have grown as the Sandinistas have taken the war into Honduras in recent months, forcing the contras to defend their rear bases while struggling to infiltrate units into Nicaragua. **********By bringing the war to Honduras, the Sandinistas appear to have intentionally raised the cost for Honduras of allowing the contras to remain in large border camps in a mountainous jungle known as the Las Vegas Salient about 120 miles northeast of Tegucigalpa. **********A European diplomat noted that at the same time the Sandinistas have demonstrated that the United States will not defend Honduras from small border incursions that embarrass Honduras and anger its citizens but do not seriously threaten its security. **********For most of the last year, and particularly in the last six months, Sandinista units have moved at will across the border, searching for contra units, according to diplomats. The Sandinistas even established permanent positions on mountains inside Honduras from which they could monitor contra units and direct fire on them. **********What has distinguished the fighting this week has been that the Sandinistas seem to have purposely hit Honduran positions, reportedly burning three small villages, shelling other occupied areas and overrunning a Honduran patrol, wounding three soldiers and capturing two others. **********After several meetings with the American Ambassador last week and a reassurance of American support in the form of helicopter transport, the Honduran Air Force struck back, bombing Sandinista positions inside Honduras on Saturday and Sunday and attacking an airfield well inside Nicaragua in the village of Wiwili, according to two sources here aware of military activity.

''Chernobyl came from the East,'' said Mr. Undorf, a part-time university student and full-time campaigner against nuclear power. **********So, after meticulous preparation and consultation with lawyers, 48 young Austrians fanned out to Prague and Budapest in May to distribute 50,000 leaflets explaining the health dangers posed by the fallout from the crippled Soviet reactor in the Ukraine. The leaflets for Czechoslovakia also called attention to the potential hazards of a Soviet-designed plant at Temelin in Czechoslovakia that that is to start generating atomic power in 1993. **********Five of the Austrians were briefly detained in Czechoslovakia, but, as their action had been designed to remain within the boundaries of the law, they were not charged. The Prague authorities privately informed the Austrian Government that if Mr. Undorf and his friends repeated the performance they would not be treated so indulgently. Frontiers No Protection **********Since Chernobyl, Europeans have become aware that frontiers are no protection against reactor catastrophes. The Austrians' foray was simply one example of antinuclear activists' carrying their concerns across borders. **********A French reactor at Cattenom has drawn protesters from both the neighboring Saarland and from Luxembourg, who contend that it is unsafe and will dump unacceptably high levels of radioactivity into the Mosel River. Showing concern over Cattenom's safety, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany sent his new environmental minister to Paris, and was not pleased when the envoy was snubbed. **********In the Netherlands, antinuclear activists are putting stiff pressure on Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers to withdrw from a consortium with Belgium and West Germany for the operation of a fast-breeder reactor at Kalkar, six miles inside the German frontier in North Rhine-Westphalia. The state's Social Democratic government has denied permission for the fast breeder to start up - putting Bonn in the position of having to overrule the state and alienating ecology-minded Germans. **********Ireland has been campaigning to get the European Community to monitor the ocean discharge levels of the Sellafield reactor on the West Cumbrian coast in Britain. Charles Haughey, leader of the Fianna Fail Party, recently denounced the plant as ''bordering on a crime against the peoples on both sides of the Irish Sea.'' Sweden Reconsiders Plant **********A debate in the Danish Parliament led Sweden to consider closing a twin-reactor plant at Barseback, 12 miles from Copenhagen, when the country begins phasing out atomic energy at the end of the century. **********One of the most resonant cross-border conflicts has soured relations between two previously amicable neighbors, Austria and the West German state of Bavaria. Franz Josef Strauss, the state's premier, is a vehement proponent of nuclear power, and has been riled by demonstrations against the building of West Germany's first reprocessing plant at Wackersdorf. **********Down wind from Wackersdorf, Austrians are alarmed by the prospect of being on the receiving end of radioactive emissions. They were hardly reassured when Mr. Strauss said that it would take several generations before genetic damage could be established. Vienna's Mayor, Helmut Zilk, accused Mr. Strauss of ''naked disdain and monstrous cynicism.'' **********The conflict got worse in June when the Bavarian border police prevented a group of Austrian protesters, including nuns and priests, from crossing into the state to celebrate an antinuclear mass in Regensburg. Some Austrians Alienated **********Mr. Strauss' fulminations against the demonstrators alienated some Austrians. The City of Salzburg demanded that he return a medal of honor he received last year, and Munich retaliated by asserting that Austrian fighters had violated ''Bavarian airspace.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/02/world/muscovites-voice-positive-reaction.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Taubman", "pub_date": "1986-01-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 513, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MUSCOVITES VOICE POSITIVE REACTION", "print_headline": "MUSCOVITES VOICE POSITIVE REACTION", "body_text": " **********President Reagan's New Year's greeting to the Soviet people was broadcast at the beginning of the evening television news today, and the initial reaction among Soviet citizens seemed positive. **********His remarks, translated in a voice-over, were not edited by the Soviet authorities and no commentary or analysis about his five-minute statement was immediately broadcast. **********When Mr. Reagan was interviewed by four Soviet journalists last year, his remarks were published in Izvestia, the principal Government daily, alongside a commentary of equal length that criticized much of what he said.

This has stirred envy among bank trainees in slower-moving departments such as credit. **********Their protests are met with the assertion that investment bankers are a different breed - individuals who are market-oriented, entreprenurial-spirited, imaginative, good at handling commercial customers, willing to travel and mathematically adept at complex merger financing. **********Compared with investment banking firms, commercial banks remain restricted - subject, for instance, to a ban on underwriting equity issues in this country. **********At the Chase Manhattan Bank, a big investment banking training program is under way, according to Terry A. MacColl, a vice president, with the emphasis on training 2,500 Chase employees around the world. She described it as a 40-day program over a period of 18 months. ''I would call it a practical M.B.A. program, but not theoretical,'' she said. ''We do not rely on academicians to do the training. Our theory is that a skilled pro can sell the whole bank.'' Some other large banks, she noted, use university professors. **********The 106 Chase staff members who have been trained to be trainers offer courses that include market mathematics, foreign exchange, worldwide taxation and strategic selling. The training techniques include seminars, video cassettes, teleconferences and home study. **********About 55 of the 72 new M.B.A.'s or holders of other advanced degrees who were hired in 1986 will take the courses, and so will 18 of the 178 new B.A.'s. **********''We are also hiring mid-career persons from investment banking firms,'' Ms. MacColl said. **********While banking giants are deep into such training, a more regional institution, the Marine Midland Bank, has also taken the plunge. **********This year it recruited 10 M.B.A.'s specifically for its new division at leading graduate business schools.

The powerful combination of falling interest rates and declining oil prices gave a big lift to equities in most major stock markets in the last three months. **********To be sure, market performance was uneven because of varying domestic economic circumstances. The weaker dollar, in particular, was a mixed blessing, lowering inflation for some countries, but hurting their exporters. Thus, the Western European bourses, which led last year's charge, are starting to wane to some degree, while the United States market is moving ahead at a faster rate. **********But over all the first quarter of this year topped the strong performance of the last quarter of 1985. The Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index rose 17.5 percent during the three months, compared with a 13 percent increase in the preceding three-month period. **********Behind the stellar performances were economic facts that are altering basic perceptions. In a new report, the First Boston Corporation commented that ''clearly, lower energy prices are resulting in a major structural change in the global economy.'' **********First Boston estimated that cheaper energy and the weaker dollar resulted in a nearly 60 percent drop in the energy-related costs of production in European countries and Japan. **********''The climate for equity investment is so improved that the kind of average valuations which have been accepted in the past are likely to prove too cautious,'' the report said. **********The Morgan Guaranty Trust Company estimates in its latest issue of World Financial Markets that consumer prices will be shaved an average of 1.4 percent in the major industrial countries because of the oil price decline, and, for some countries, that figure will be as high as 2.1 percent. **********In addition, Morgan Guaranty estimates, gross national product of the leading industrial powers will increase an average of eight-tenths of 1 percent because of cheaper energy. Japan and West Germany, two major energy importers, will enjoy a substantial 1.5 percent lift in their economic growth. Italy will see its economy expand an additional 2.3 percent, the bank said. That, analysts said, will contribute to continued improvement in equity prices in coming months. **********Nonetheless, falling oil prices pose potential problems, too. They have shaken some banks that lent heavily to energy concerns. And energy exporting countries, such as Canada and Australia, look less attractive. **********Thus, the UBS Phillips & Drew Global Research Group said it foresaw a shift in equity performance. **********''We expect the U.S. equity market to perform very strongly, outperforming other major markets in 1986, just as Continental European equity markets did in 1985,'' the group said in its latest stategy report. **********The performances in many markets seem to have defied gravity. In New York, the guessing seems to be only over how high and how fast stocks will rise. The Dow Jones industrial average set records almost continuously, and closed Thursday at a record high of 1,821.72. **********That marked a 21.3 percent gain in three months. The market leaped over 100-point marks during the quarter like an Olympic hurdler, easily clearing the 1,600, 1,700 and 1,800 barriers without breaking stride. **********In Tokyo, it was much the same, as the Nikkei stock average closed Friday at a record 15,364.34, after jumping 277.46 points on Thursday, its third highest single-session gain ever. That left the index 17 percent higher for the quarter. **********The biggest gainer among major exchanges, however, was France. Players at the Paris bourse were buoyed by a disorder well known on Wall Street: takeover fever. This lifted share prices there an average of 33 percent, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. **********But not all exchanges participated equally in the powerful upswing. Hong Kong, which has been jittery about China's intentions toward the free-wheeling British colony after it gains political sovereignty in 1997, suffered a decline. Canada, a major oil and mineral producer, showed comparatively paltry gains in its stocks, as the price of oil and other commodites fell. **********Even with all the variations, Morgan Stanley's World Index closed on Wednesday at 301.3, up 17.5 percent, from 256.5 at the end of 1985. New York **********Tumbling interest rates continued to pace the powerful stock market rally in New York. At every step of the way, there were those predicting an imminent end to the historic rally, but the correction never materialized. Every time investors grew cautious, interest rates would head still lower and bond prices would soar again, lifting stocks in their wake. **********The market, for instance, was jolted just two Fridays ago, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 35.68 points in extremely heavy volume. The drop resulted largely from big investors using complex arbitrage strategies involving stocks and stock index futures, which expired on that Friday. **********The setback proved temporary. In the last week of the quarter, the Dow resumed its sprint, gaining 53.16 points in the four days before the Good Friday holiday. **********''When we started 1986 there was broad concern that the economy, as it picked up some momentum, would cause inflation to rise,'' said Greg A. Smith, president of Prudential-Bache Asset Management. ''But that was before the drop in oil prices. As oil went down, expectations of inflation rates went down.'' **********Mr. Smith described the combination of low inflation, falling oil prices and interest rates and moderate economic expansion as ''the best of Nirvana.'' **********He added, though, that some sectors faced difficulties, particularly energy and oil services. Banks with energy loans have been hurt, and the major oil companies have slashed their capital spending budgets, which will have a significant impact on the economy generally, Mr. Smith said. **********However, he said that on balance, the current climate should aid equity markets. He said he expectd to see the Dow at 2,000 by June, before it levels off for the rest of the year. London **********After a period of uncertainty at the start of the year because of falling oil prices, investors decided that the decline was welcome news for most British companies, after all. That sent the London stock market ahead by about 17 percent during the first quarter of 1986. The Financial Times 500-stock index finished at 883.03 on Thursday, compared with 753.5 at the beginning of the year. **********''This has been one of the best quarters in recent years,'' said Nick Knight, an analyst for James Capel & Company, a London brokerage. ''It gave fund managers plenty to celebrate over Easter.'' **********Early in the quarter, investors focused on the fact that falling oil prices were driving down the value of the British pound. Thus, until mid-February the only bright spots were multinational exporters, whose products would be cheaper overseas with the value of the pound declining. The tobacco stocks, led by B.A.T. Industries, gained about 30 percent from early December to mid-February. **********The weakening pound also raised the prospect of higher interest rates, though. It was feared that the Bank of England might be forced to lift rates to defend the currency. **********But by mid-February, the pound's oil-related weakness began to be overshadowed by the dollar's weakness. The pound no longer seemed as vulnerable and the pressure on interest rates reversed. **********Thus, companies that depended on domestic consumer demand, such as brewers, distillers and retailers, returned to favor. **********For the year, economists expect continuing strength in the domestic issues. Moreover, some basic industry shares have also gained considerably since the start of the year, largely on the perception that the survivors of the shakeout in British industry in recent years are now poised for improved profitability. **********During the last month, British bank stocks - Lloyds Bank, Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank - have gained about 20 percent. Investors bought them on the theory that they looked comparatively better than American banks, which lent heavily to some third world and Latin American debtor nations. **********''The British banks are having their day,'' said Kenneth Inglis, director of research for Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage. **********But American buying of British stocks has slowed considerably after the Government announced on March 18 a 5 percent tax on the conversion of British shares to American depositary receipts, or A.D.R.'s. However, pressure is growing on the Government to repeal the levy. Frankfurt **********The Frankfurt stock market bolted ahead at the start of 1986, in line with the market's stellar performance in 1985. But the entire quarter, analysts said, was marked more by consolidation than dramatic gains as foreign investment tapered off. **********The first weeks of the year saw share prices climb 10 percent, buoyed by heavy foreign investment. By mid-January the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung index of 100 shares recorded an all-time high of 716.76, and the Commerzbank 60-share index climbed to a record 2,161.8. **********In fact, trading was so hectic that the Frankfurt exchange was forced on two successive days in early January to stay open an extra half hour to cope with the spurt in orders. **********However, the tumbling value of the dollar later began to dampen foreign investment and stifled interest in export-oriented companies such as the Daimler-Benz auto making group and the giant Siemens electrical company, as well as in other blue-chip stocks favored by foreign investors, such as the Deutsche Bank. On Feb. 27 the Frankfurter Allegemeine index hit its quarterly low of 618.36. **********Then, falling oil prices took control of investors' perceptions. Tumbling energy costs forced analysts to revise upward their forecasts of economic growth and corporate profits. **********This translated into a boom for chemical stocks. Wolfgang Kirsten, a stock market analyst at Frankfurt's Bank fur Gemeinwirtschaft, said that ''for chemicals, falling oil prices weighed more strongly than the falling dollar.'' Mr. Kirsten recommends the chemical giants Bayer A.G. and Hoechst A.G. **********In the banking sector, falling interest rates in Germany led to a strong recovery. The banks took advantage of this to raise about $1.3 billion in fresh capital during the quarter. **********Tax cuts by the Bonn Government totaling more than $4 billion are expected to fuel consumer spending in 1986, focusing stock market interest on retailers and consumer-related shares. Analysts generally recommended Kaufhof A.G. and Karstadt A.G., two large department store chains, as well as Continental Gummiwerke A.G., a tire maker, and Wella A.G., a maker of cosmetics. **********Phillips & Drew also predicts a rise in consumer spending because of the tax cuts, and corporate earnings expansion of 12 percent in 1986. ''The most significant earnings rises will probably be in domestic retailing,'' the brokerage said. France **********So popular is the stock market in France these days that the newspaper Le Figaro has been running a stock portfolio lottery. This is perhaps understandable, since the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for France has posted a 33 percent gain so far in 1986. **********The level of enthusiasm for stocks and evidence of the kind of cash lying ready to snap up interesting stock issues was demonstrated by heavy over-subscription of new issues for the nationalized banks Credit Industrial et Commercial and Banque Indosuez. Heavy foreign investment has also been a boon, according to Phillips & Drew. **********France's economy and stock market have benefited greatly from the sharp decline in oil prices. And the recent elections, which left the Government with a Socialist President and conservative Prime Minister, has not undermined the optimism on the stock market, analysts said. **********The week following the French elections, in fact, saw records broken on the Paris market. The bourse rose 9 percent in five days and volume topped 2.25 billion francs on March 20. The CAC index ended that week over 345, compared with 256.8 on the last day of 1985. However, a spurt of profit-taking in recent days took a hefty slice off some of the gains. **********''Since before Christmas we've been telling clients to buy France,'' remarked Stefano Mazzola, of the British brokerage Hoare, Govett. ''Now we are even surer.'' Mr. Mazzola said he is putting clients into smaller companies like SEC, an auto parts maker and Societe Generale d'Investissement, a holding company. **********One phenomenon that suggests French capitalism is really reviving is the fact that there is something of a takeover boom. **********''Popular interest in the stock market, hostile takeover bids, greenmail, these are all normal in other markets, so why not in Paris?'' asked a partner at Lazard Freres, the investment bank. **********BSN S.A., a food company, soared last week - 7.5 percent on Tuesday alone - on rumors that it would be a target soon. Source Perrier S.A. and Beghin-Say S.A., a sugar and paper producer, have also leapt ahead on speculation that other companies will bid for them. A hostile raid on Valeo S.A., an auto parts concern, by Carlo de Benedetti, an Italian industrialist, has sent its shares soaring. **********In the first quarter, the best-performing sectors were construction, particularly Bouygues and SCRET, and insurance companies like La Providence, which is also the subject of a takeover bid. The bidders for La Providence were AXA, a banking group, which appeared to have won, and La Compagnie du Midi. **********The significance of this battle was that for the first time in France there were two contenders. Tokyo **********It was a fitting conclusion to a strong quarter in Tokyo when the market rose sharply last Thursday on the heaviest volume in its history, 1.9 million shares. Overall, the Nikkei index rose 17.5 percent in the last three months as a number of favorable factors converged to attract domestic and foreign investors. **********The market put in an uneven performance, however, reflecting a mix of influences. There was concern in many quarters that the increases were unrealistic. ''Even by Japanese standards, the last three months in the market have been conspicuously speculative,'' Phillips & Drew said. **********The decline in oil prices has been a particular help to Japan, which is almost wholly dependent on imported energy. The sharply stronger yen, however, was a negative. This is expected to eat into the critical export business. As a result, issues that were sensitive to interest rates or to domestic demand, such as oil, gas, construction and real estate, climbed, while export-oriented blue chips like electronics, autos and precision instruments did not fare as well. **********In the first half of March, the prospect of lower interest rates sent share prices up sharply. The Nikkei index broke records for 12 straight sessions, the longest sustained surge since December 1960. **********Among the leading issues were Mitsubishi Estate Company, up 70 percent; Tokyo Electric Power Company, which gained 32 percent; and Tokyo Gas Company, ahead 35 percent. But export-oriented companies such as the Toyota Motor Corporation and the NEC Corporation declined. **********First Boston said, ''Despite the recent strength in the Japanese market, we remain skeptical about the underlying fundamentals at this time.'' **********Still, there are optimists, and Goldman, Sachs & company is among them. It said in a recent report that it believes the strength of the domestic sector in Japan is under-appreciated by stock investors. It recommends a heavy weighting toward domestic recovery issues such as Taiyo Fishery, Marui and House Food Industrial. It also stresses such domestic growth shares as Unicharm and the Bridgestone Corporation, and electronics companies Rohm, Japan Radio, Dai-Nippon Screen and Fujitsu. Hong Kong **********Hong Kong continued to act as a weather vane for whatever wind, good or ill, blew across the British colony's mountainous border from China. Anything that might be interpreted as a sign that China, which will assume sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, would alter the colony's free-wheeling economic policies caused a fright in the stock market. Whenever investors felt confident that China would not interfere with the local economy, share prices rebounded. **********For example, toward the end of the quarter, share prices nervously backpedaled after investors realized that Deng Xiaoping, China's leader and the principal force behind its liberal economic policies, had not been seen in public for almost three months. **********Concern that he might have died produced a wave of selling. But Mr. Deng finally re-emerged, giving the market something of a lift toward the end of March. **********Still, the Hang Seng index, the most closely watched market indicator in the colony, was at only 1,626 late last week, compared with 1,774.40 at the beginning of the year. **********Shipping concerns continued to suffer from a poor market, with the latest victim being Wah Kwong Shipping. The C. Y. Tung Group earlier had to undergo a restructuring. **********The financial sector has also continued to show weakness. Just last week, the Government took over ailing Union Bank of Hong Kong and passed control to Jardine Fleming & Company, a prominent merchant bank. That followed two other occasions in recent years when the Government had to step in and prop up a troubled financial institution. **********Nonetheless, Phillips & Drew puts Hong Kong at the top of its list in the Pacific Basin. It especially recommends Hong Kong over the Singapore stock market. It favors such blue-chip Hong Kong shares as Hutchison Whampoa, China Light and Swire Pacific. Toronto **********The Toronto Stock Exchange posted an anemic gain of slightly more than 5 percent in the quarter. **********Oil and gas issues led the declining groups, with a plunge of 16 percent, led by the collapse in energy prices. The banks, heavy lenders to oil producers, fell an average of 8 percent. The gold index was down a modest 2 percent. **********Among individual issues, Lac Minerals plunged $15.50, to $21, after a court awarded its Hemlo gold mine to a competitor. Dome Petroleum, a heavily indebted energy company that said it would curtail repayment on its $5 billion in bank borrowings, fell 95 cents, to $2. **********However, several industrial groups managed outstanding gains. Paper and forest companies rose 29 percent. Communication companies managed a gain of 21 percent. Metal producers were also strong, as copper prices recovered slightly on international markets. They advanced an average of 14 percent. **********B.C. Forest Products gained $2, to $14.50, largely because of strength in lumber prices and the decline in the value of the Canadian dollar. Genstar, the object of a takeover bid by Imasco, also advanced strongly during the quarter, gaining $21.12, to close at $55.37. **********Analysts remain worried about the prospects of the energy sector. ''If the oil price remains in the mid-teens or lower, we envision a wave of corporate activity - bankruptcies, reorganizations, restructurings and mergers,'' said Philip Swift, energy analyst at F. H. Beacon Hodgson Inc. He added that investors should have a minimal exposure to the energy industry, and should resist the temptation to bargain hunt. South Africa **********The Johannesburg Stock Exchange gold index moved in tandem with gold prices, posting a 20 percent rise for the quarter. **********South Africa's leading stock market was able to post the gains during a time of continuing political turmoil in the resource-rich nation. In fact, the political uncertainty helped some companies. The problems pushed the rand lower against the dollar, increasing export earnings. **********Many companies had earnings growth of as much as 45 percent because of the currency effect, according to Phillips & Drew. However, lower oil prices could work against some industries, such as coal mines. South Africa is a large coal exporter, and coal prices could slip with the fall in oil, according to analysts. In addition, there is the threat of a cutoff of imports of South African coal by France and Denmark. **********Phillips & Drew concludes that the gains in the stock market because of the rand's decline have pushed prices high enough that they are no longer attractive. It advises that investors stay neutral, or consider selling shares in the future. Others **********According to Morgan Stanley Capital International, the Australian stock market in Sydney rose by 10.4 percent in the first quarter. But the market faces some major uncertainties, primarily from falling oil prices and weakness in a number of other industrial commodities. **********Phillips & Drew said that there are some bright spots. While oil and mining shares may suffer, industrial companies may benefit from cheaper energy. Phillips & Drew picks Pancontinental Mining and Peko-Wallsend. It also likes BHP and CSR, oil producers, because the shares have already fallen considerably. It said it would look to sell the metals producers Western Mining and MIM. **********The markets in Singapore and Malaysia have been suffering from a number of problems, including political turmoil in Malaysia. That country is also being hurt by the drop in oil prices, since it is an energy exporter."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/10/world/2d-quake-rocks-bulgaria.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 52, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "2d Quake Rocks Bulgaria", "print_headline": "2d Quake Rocks Bulgaria", "body_text": " **********A second earthquake struck northern Bulgaria about 24 hours after a quake killed 3 people and left more than 3,000 homeless, the official Bulgarian news agency, BTA, said today.

Charges of Brutality **********One youth was said by lawyers to have been brutally dragged through township streets by the black police. A physician who has treated some victims said another 16-year-old endured a night of electric shock treatments and beatings. Lawyers said rape charges were also being prepared against some municipal policemen. **********The assertions in this southern city, among the most defiant of white rule in South Africa, seemed to reflect the failure of the nation's newest emergency decree to fully curb protest or stem the violence in this country. **********To the Government's critics, the deployment of black municipal policemen seems aimed at spreading responsibility for pacifying black townships among such auxiliary forces. **********The authorities say the emergency decree, the second in less than a year, has pacified some areas. But they assert that a ''revolutionary climate'' persists, justifying harsh tactics. **********Asked to comment on the charges of abuse, the Bureau for Information, the sole source of authorized news about the emergency decree, said in a telexed statement: **********''A charge concerning the incarcerating of a person in a deep-freeze is presently being investigated. **********''No sworn affidavit from persons who feel they have been maltreated has yet been received. Should anyone however feel that this is the case, they are free to file formal charges through the official channel. Statements made to the press by private individuals will not be investigated by the police.'' **********Anti-apartheid blacks here offer varying accounts of the effectiveness of the decree. A leading anti-apartheid campaigner, interviewed in hiding, said that while the mood among protesters had been made more sober and cautious by the decrees, defiance had not been crushed. **********A black lawyer with close knowledge of the anti-apartheid protest campaign here said: ''Physically, the state of emergency is working. The system is pretty much back in control on its own terms.'' **********''But I don't think there are any people who are completely tired'' of resistance, he said. The lawyer was one of several anti-Government campaigners who agreed to be interviewed on condition they not be named. **********The strands of the conflict are diverse. Residents of Port Elizabeth's impoverished black townships of New Brighton, Zwide and KwaZakele, for instance, have again begun a boycott of white-owned businesses to press a wide range of demands. Earlier boycotts crippled some white businesses. **********At the same time, a kind of low-level war persists between the black youths who call themselves ''comrades'' and the security forces, including the municipal police. **********Five policemen, anti-apartheid workers said, have been killed in recent weeks by the ''comrades'' - burned, buried alive or shot with homemade rifles known as scorpions. Township Fenced In **********New Brighton township is surrounded by a high wall of razor-sharp wire laid by the army to sever it from other districts. **********All the high schools in Port Elizabeth's black townships have been closed because of classroom boycotts, and black residents are withholding rent payments. **********The authorities have opened a campaign to win cooperation from township residents, using pamphlets and leaflets that advertise official achievements on behalf of the black population and urge blacks to cooperate with the security forces. #16 Requirements Listed One pamphlet, dated Oct. 3, proclaimed: ''The security forces have now been in New Brighton for three months and have assisted the Ibhayi City Council in cleaning up your area, in protecting you and in stabilizing everyday life.'' The Ibhayi City Council is the officially sponsored local black authority. **********The pamphlet added: ''We must now, however, also have your support in achieving the following goals.'' It listed 16 requirements, including ''that no arson shall take place'' and ''that no petrol bombs will be thrown.'' **********''If these conditions are not met,'' the pamphlet said, ''the security forces will remain and strict measures shall be taken.'' **********Foes of apartheid and other analysts suggest that the conflict between the municipal police and radical youths may be slipping out of control, since anti-apartheid leaders have been detained under the emergency decree and municipal policemen have become what one anti-apartheid worker called a ''law unto themselves.'' **********''It is difficult now to convince young people that what they are doing is barbaric,'' said a black anti-apartheid worker who was interviewed in hiding, referring to killings by the comrades. ''They see it as being on a par with killings by the other side.'' **********The municipal policemen wear olive-green uniforms and receive three months training in the use of weapons and other skills. Charges Difficult to Verify **********Charges of improper behavior proliferate, while censorship, imposed under the emergency decree, and other restrictions on reporters' access to black townships prevent corroboration of some reports. **********A woman from a respected civil rights group said she had received six reports from different individuals that in one black township, a liquor outlet, the Qwaford Bottle Store, had been taken over by the army and that its large deep-freeze had been used to incarcerate prisoners overnight at a temperature just above 20 degrees. **********Civil rights workers charge that municipal policemen raid homes in the early hours of the morning and show scant regard for property. ''They knock once and then kick the door down,'' a civil rights worker said. Campaign Against Protest **********The thrust of the official campaign against Port Elizabeth's black protesters seems to have been directed at the area and street committees, set up by anti-Government radicals as an alternative form of administration. **********''A lot of the 1,400 detainees in this area were not activists,'' a lawyer said, ''they were just ordinary people drawn into the street and area committees. But the police want to teach people a lesson: don't get involved.'' **********The municipal policemen, the lawyer said, ''are paid a lot of money and they are recruited from people who were the victims of the punitive measures of the comrades. **********''They also include comrades who have been turned against their own people,'' he continued. ''They know where to go and they know the psychology of the people. They are pretty rough.'' **********The lawyer acknowledged that, before the latest emergency decree, blacks had become tired of what he called ''the apparent directionlessness of the violence that took place'' and that the authorities had curbed some of that violence. Anti-apartheid workers now, he said, ''are taking a bit of a breather.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/17/business/company-news-westinghouse-nbc-in-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Westinghouse, NBC in Talks", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Westinghouse, NBC in Talks", "body_text": " **********Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable Inc. and the National Broadcasting Company, two of the oldest names in radio, are discussing merging 20 of their 21 radio stations and the NBC Radio Networks, executives at the two companies said Thursday. **********Such a combination would give the merged company its own stations in nine of the top ten markets and affiliated network stations nationwide. **********Sharon Metcalf, the NBC Washington press director, would say only that ''we are in discussion with a small number of companies,'' including Westinghouse, about the sale of NBC radio stations.

Instead of the simple **********''accident'' reported then, the Politburo this time spoke of ''gross breaches,'' ''grave consequences,'' direct losses amounting to $2.7 billion, hundreds of thousands of medical examinations and penalties against high officials ranging from firings to criminal proceedings. **********Yet beyond the catalogue of damage and the lists of culprits, much of which has been reported in the press in the three months since the disaster, the Politburo statement offered only a new hint about what had caused the explosion in the fourth reactor - an unspecified and unauthorized experiment. **********Although the reactor was down for routine maintenance, the Politburo said, managers and specialists at the Chernobyl reactor conducted experiments with the ''turbogenerator operation regimes,'' experiments that violated operating procedures and were neither cleared with higher authorities nor properly prepared for. **********Central Questions Unanswered **********But the Politburo gave no indication what the experiments were, or how they led to the accident, leaving a central question about the disaster still unanswered. **********More detailed explanations could emerge with publication of the full report of the Government investigative commission, on which the Politburo's statement was based. The Soviet Union has said it will share its findings with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. **********But the statement seemed designed less to explain the disaster than to depict it as an isolated incident caused by human irresponsibility and negligence, one therefore that did not reflect on the overall safety of Soviet atomic plants or, more broadly, on Moscow's ambitious nuclear-energy program. **********The rapid expansion of nuclear power has been a major element in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic revival. At the Communist Party congress in February, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov declared that ''by the end of the five-year period nuclear power stations will nearly double their share of power production and will account for 20 percent of the total amount generated.'' Plans' Targets Unchanged **********In the wake of the Chernobyl explosion, Soviet officials have repeatedly insisted that the disaster would not affect the development of nuclear power. Specific targets for the next five-year economic plan, which were published after the disaster, showed no changes that might have resulted from the Chernobyl disaster. **********The Politburo statement did suggest a broader concern with the safety of nuclear power by demanding ''additional measures to insure the safe operation'' of existing stations and the retraining of service personnel, and by forming a new Ministry of Atomic Power Engineering. **********What was missing from the report, however, was any suggestion that the Kremlin's own insistent demands for rapid expansion of nuclear energy could have contributed to the accident. The entire responsibility was apportioned among the power plant's officials and Government ministries, and no blame fell on party officials or party policy. **********According to some rumors in Moscow, the experiments may have been a local initiative to make power generation more efficient, in keeping with the Kremlin's directives to modernize and update Soviet industry. Party Policy Above Reproach **********The Politburo's approach, in any case, was hardly unusual; party policy is generally held above reproach in the Soviet Union, and blame for failures usually falls on specific ministries and responsible officials. **********But some diplomats thought the Politburo's statement could have a chilling effect on Mr. Gorbachev's campaign to instil more initiative and autonomy in Soviet industry. **********After the stern penalties and reprimands meted out to ministers, officials and technicials over the Chernobyl matter, the diplomats thought, industrial managers might be wary of undertaking independent experiments, even if the potential repercussions were nowhere near those of Chernobyl. **********In listing six senior officials who were dismissed or censured over Chernobyl, the Politburo said only that they were guilty of ''bad errors and shortcomings in their work,'' giving no indication of their specific contribution to the accident. Establishing Link to Military **********One of those whose dismissal was announced was a Deputy Minister of Medium Machine Building, identified in the Tass version of the Politburo statement only as Meshkov. According to Western experts, the ministry, under its cover name, is concerned with the development, testing and manufacture of nuclear warheads and other military-related nuclear programs. Mr. Meshkov's inclusion in the list of culprits contributed to speculation that the Chernobyl plant may have been used also for producing plutonium for thermonuclear bombs. **********Another possibility was that Mr. Meshkov was being penalized for earlier work on civilian power, since an Aleksandr G. Meshkov had been listed since 1971 as a deputy chairman of the State Committee for Utilization of Atomic Energy. **********The Politburo laid the heaviest blame on the Ministry of Electric Power and the State Committee for Safety in the Atomic Power Industry, charging that they were ''guilty of lack of control'' at the Chernobyl plant. Their senior officials evidently were penalized because the disaster fell under their jurisdiction, even if they were not directly to blame. **********Anatoly I. Mayorets, only recently appointed Minister of Electric Power, escaped with a ''strict reprimand'' because he was only recently appointed to the post, while a Deputy Minister, Gennadi A. Shasharin, who had specific responsibility for nuclear power, was dismissed. **********Also sacked was Yevgeny V. Kulov, head of the State Committee for Safety in the Atomic Power Industry, which was set up by the late Yuri V. Andropov in July 1983, reportedly after a lesser Soviet atomic-energy accident that was never reported by Moscow."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/business/finance-new-issues-fitch-joint-venture-on-korean-ratings.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 155, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Fitch Joint Venture On Korean Ratings", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Fitch Joint Venture On Korean Ratings", "body_text": " **********Fitch Investors Service, one of five rating agencies recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission, yesterday announced a joint venture with Korea Business Research and Information Inc. to expand the Korean concern's ratings of securities issued by local companies in domestic and foreign markets. **********The International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, will invest about $136,000 in Korea Business Research, with Fitch investing a similar amount. **********Fitch also signed a training and service agreement to enhance the Korean concern's expertise. **********Richard D.

Tisch has a reputation as a trustworthy insider. But, as Thomas H. Wyman, the departing chairman and chief executive of CBS Inc. has learned, Mr. Tisch also has strong business instincts and a willingness to act on them. **********When Ted Turner, the broadcaster-investor, and Senator Jesse Helms, the activist Republican from North Carolina - two outsiders CBS Inc. regarded as renegades - rode down on the network last year in separate unfriendly raids, Mr. Wyman sent out an S O S to Mr. Tisch and the billion-dollar company he heads, the Loews Corporation. **********Loews eventually bought nearly 25 percent of CBS at a total cost of more than $800 million, and Mr. Tisch became a CBS director. But when the fight came, after he had served less than a year on the company's board, he proved that his duty bound him to the board rather than to management. After a brief struggle, Mr. Wyman was forced to resign from CBS, leaving Mr. Tisch to serve as acting chief executive. **********Only a few months ago, Mr. Tisch was insisting that Loews did not intend to seize control of the network and that he had no interest in running it. He had bought CBS stock ''as an investment,'' he insisted. It was a perfect melding of his two life ambitions: investing shrewdly and giving richly. **********Mr. Tisch and his brother Robert had built a diversified empire through nearly 40 years of acquiring bargains. They started with a small resort in the Catskills and added holdings in movie theaters, tobacco, insurance and watches. **********Now, as a respected elder statesman in the business world, he could help lead CBS back to its dominance of broadcasting while earning a handsome profit for Loews. It was a position he had taken at other institutions - New York University and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. At 63, it could be his way of capping a long, successful career while his brother Robert went off to Washington to be the Postmaster General. **********Suddenly, a man who has always worked alone, more as a portfolio manager and strategist than as a handler of people, and who has usually chosen the company of his family over an active social life, finds himself at the head, at least temporarily, of a very public company with thousands of employees. **********Mr. Tisch began accumulating CBS stock for Loews in July 1985, convinced that it was undervalued. He quickly bought up 9.9 percent of the company and indicated in talks with management that he had an interest in buying more. **********Within a month, Loews sought Government permission to increase its stake. Ted Turner, rebuffed by Government regulators in his efforts to prevent CBS from spending its money on its own stock and now facing what seemed like insurmountable competition, switched his attention from CBS to the MGM/UA Entertainment Company. **********CBS said at the time that it accepted ''on good faith'' that Loews was buying the stock for investment. By early October, Loews had raised its stake to 11.1 percent, but CBS repeated that it believed Loews was acting in ''good faith'' for investment purposes only. **********Mr. Wyman knew by then that Mr. Tisch intended to acquire more of the network - as much as 25 percent. According to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Loews had already told Mr. Wyman that. Still, Mr. Wyman counted on Loews to help him build up protection against any future takeover moves, but it was becoming clear that Mr. Tisch was, as one source put it, ''very unhappy'' with the company's management under Mr. Wyman. So was William S. Paley, the former board chairman of CBS. **********The pace quickened early this year, with Loews announcing in February that it held 12.3 percent. Little by little Mr. Tisch was approaching his 25 percent goal. **********Loews, continuing to buy, raised its CBS stake by early April to 16.7 percent and then gradually in the following months to 17.7 percent and then 19.7 percent, 20.98 percent and 22.46 percent and now, to 24.98 percent. **********Along the way, Mr. Tisch had shrewdly eliminated a possible competitor, buying some of the new stock from New York's Fisher Brothers, a Manhattan real estate group then thought to have close to 5 percent of the broadcasting company. **********Takeover speculation continued strong, with some feeling that the Westinghouse Electric Corporation or Philip Morris Inc. or both might have been approached by CBS. **********Westinghouse, in particular, seemed to be a logical thought since the General Electric Company now owns the RCA Corporation, owner of the National Broadcasting Company. **********The idea, while not entirely out of the question, seemed remote because Mr. Tisch, with his 25 percent, and Mr. Paley, with about 9 percent, have more than enough CBS stock to prevent anyone from taking over the company. New York law requires approval by two-thirds of the stock. **********CBS, nevertheless, took pains to deny that the company or James Wolfensohn, an investment banker on its board, had approached anyone. The reported approach was mentioned in a cover article in the current issue of Newsweek magazine. In a statement it issued on Monday, CBS said Mr. Wolfensohn had not been retained as its investment banker, a function long held by Morgan Stanley & Company."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/27/business/japan-exports-of-cars-plunge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 87, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Exports Of Cars Plunge", "print_headline": "Japan Exports Of Cars Plunge", "body_text": " **********Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell 15.1 percent in November from a year earlier, to 516,928 units, the sharpest decline on record, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said today. **********Association officials said the drop was the largest since 1979, when it adopted its current method of record-keeping.

There are, after all, the thousands of books, somewhere near 6,000 new titles a year. There are the magazines (Business Week, Byte, Coal Age) and newsletters - 64 of them. He sees the Standard & Poor's stock reports. Shepard's legal citations. The F.W. Dodge construction reports. All that paper. That's what bothers Joe Dionne. **********He wants to see video screens with information flickering across them. He wants to see entrepreneurs in the information-technology business, not traditional pencil-wielding editors. He wants to see manifestations of what, in his dreams, is the future. **********Joseph L. Dionne, a former English and social studies teacher who has been the chief executive officer of McGraw-Hill for nearly three years, is trying to turn one of the elderly members of the publishing community upside-down. **********A little over a year ago, he announced a corporate reorganization, reflecting a rethinking of how the company ought to serve customers. Although the company is one of the leading suppliers of information, most of the facts it purveys are presented on paper and Mr. Dionne is convinced that there will be a wild explosion in the demand for information delivered through computers at supersonic speed. **********Thus McGraw-Hill is pushing editors and managers to think of ways to remove facts from printed pages and package them into all kinds of electronic information products. And it is willing to plow money into scores of possibilities, such as an electronic version of its successful Dodge construction reports, not worrying if that drags down short-term profits. **********It is a huge gamble for the 52-year-old Mr. Dionne. McGraw-Hill is not the first company to think that electronic information is the future, and it faces formidable competition from the likes of Dun & Bradstreet and Dow Jones, which have big head starts. And nobody really knows how much demand there is for electronically delivered facts, or how much corporate America will pay for them. But already, analysts estimate the market at $10 billion to $12 billion a year. McGraw-Hill thinks that sales of electronically delivered information are growing at 20 percent a year, while printed information moves along at 11 percent. **********Moreover, while Mr. Dionne has his eye on his goal, others may have their eye on McGraw-Hill, which has hardly any debt, 45 percent ownership of a valuable Manhattan headquarters building and a good, if stodgy, name. **********It is still too early to predict whether McGraw-Hill will succeed in reshaping itself. Even Mr. Dionne says he cannot gauge how long the transformation will take - or how many dollars will come from new information products. ''I don't know,'' he says. ''That's for the market to decide.'' **********John Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham, says, ''On the surface it all appears to makes sense. But we're going to have to wait to see if the vision bears fruit.'' **********One thing that Mr. Dionne wants to do is to feed information gathered by the company's books and magazines and financial services into what he likes to call a ''turbine,'' a metaphor for a complex computer network that will digest information and then whisk it electronically to corporate customers. The coming of this sort of setup, he thinks, will help McGraw-Hill's revenues to nearly double by 1990 to $2.5 billion; much of that growth he expects to come from electronic products. **********Getting to that point, though, is already causing considerable pain. A few of McGraw-Hill's pilot programs and acquisitions, like Data Resources Inc., have hit bad snags. Jobs have been eliminated and some key people, like the publishers of Business Week and Byte, have left. Clear evidence of why McGraw-Hill needs a new direction, however, was contained in last week's year-end earnings report, which showed that profits rose a mere 2.2 percent in 1985, to $147.4 million, and revenues advanced just 6.4 percent, to $1.5 billion, chiefly because of sluggish advertising sales, a vulnerability that has plagued McGraw-Hill for a long time. **********Moreover, a whole culture must change. McGraw-Hill is an odd jumble of properties that have never had much to do with one another. The company has long had a McGraw family member leading the way -from 1974 until 1983, it was the strong-willed Harold McGraw Jr., who remains chairman - and it has been conservative, bureaucratic, happy to just plod along. Mr. Dionne is asking it to become entrepreneurial, fast-stepped, electronic. ITS scramble to change is symptomatic of the anguish at many old-line corporations: How do you keep short-term earnings up and still invest for the future? How do you adapt old minds to new technologies? How do you prepare yourself for tomorrow without starving the businesses that kept you rich? **********''It's a tough transition,'' says one executive. ''The question is - assuming Dionne's vision is correct - will the people adapt? Can McGraw-Hill become as entrepreneurial as he wants it to be? I don't know.'' **********To Mr. Dionne, the metamorphosis is a necessity. McGraw-Hill derives some 30 percent of sales from electronic products like Standard & Poor's data bases and more conventional things like television broadcasting. But Mr. Dionne believes it must move further into newer electronic products. He will not say precisely how much further, but he thinks growth will stop if the company does not change. **********''The products are mature,'' he said, referring to the magazines and book markets that are McGraw-Hill's backbone. ''I hate that label. But they are mature. Every media company has to decide if it wants to exist in the backwaters or be part of the new mainstream. It's nice in the backwaters. But the backwaters have a way of becoming brackish and dying.'' **********Selling information has always been McGraw-Hill's business. In 1888, James H. McGraw bought the American Journal of Railway Appliances, and in 1899, pursuing his interest in education, founded the McGraw Publishing Company. Meanwhile, John A. Hill started his own company in 1902. The two companies' book departments combined in 1909, and, in 1917, the McGraw and Hill companies merged into McGraw-Hill Publishing. Business Week was born in 1929. F.W. Dodge was bought in 1961, Standard & Poor's, in 1966. Four television stations - in Denver, Indianapolis, San Diego and Bakersfield, Calif.- were added in 1972. **********Things did not always go right. In 1972, there was Clifford Irving's bungled effort to sell his phony ''autobiography'' of Howard Hughes. Shortly afterward, it was revealed that at least 33 pages of ''The Memoirs of Chief Red Fox,'' a best-seller, were plagiarized. Then, in a bitter confrontation in 1979, American Express unsuccessfully tried to buy the company, ultimately offering $40 a share. Harold McGraw claimed American Express lacked''the integrity, corporate morality and sensitivity essential to McGraw-Hill.'' **********Mr. Dionne is a thoughtful, high-voltage man who often alludes to lessons he learned as an educator. A large, gentle-looking man, he stands as something of a symbol of hope for any teacher who dreams some day of running a billion-dollar corporation. He taught English and social studies in Long Island public schools for a number of years. He eventually became senior project director for the Institute for Educational Development, then joined McGraw-Hill in 1967, starting at the book company as a vice president for research and development. He later became the company's chief planner. **********The roots of Mr. Dionne's changes date in particular to a 1983 management meeting that concluded that new electronics products were essential for the corporation to flourish. Mr. Dionne, then president, said he had come to see that all media were being affected by data bases, both as customers and competitors of them. He saw specialists in technology forging their way into prominence. **********One of the speakers at that conference who was influential in shaping Mr. Dionne's mindset was Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor. Mr. Dionne had read a book Mr. Porter wrote about strategic visions called ''Competitive Practices,'' and was intrigued enough by it to hire him as a consultant to study the company. At the time of the conference, Mr. Porter was in the midst of working with task forces that were conducting hundreds of interviews throughout the 50-story McGraw-Hill headquarters on Sixth Avenue. By early 1984, his work was done. One of the clear messages he delivered to Mr. Dionne was that McGraw-Hill needed to smash through old organizational barriers and zero in better on the markets it served. **********At that point, McGraw-Hill was organized by media - a book company, a magazine group and so forth. In November 1984, in Mr. Dionne's boldest move as chief executive, he shuffled the pieces and dealt them into 19 ''market-focus'' groups, such as construction, health and education. Into each group went pieces of the corporation - books, magazines, newsletters. Business Week, for instance, went into the management group, along with a seminar conference business and International Management magazine. The groups are expected to use their collective brainpower to spawn new products, principally electronic ones. **********''McGraw-Hill collects millions of bits of data each year,'' says Howard Hosbach, executive vice president for financial and economic information. ''The idea is to use it over and over and over again. It's no revolutionary idea. It's so simple you wonder, 'Why didn't we think of it before?' '' BY the turn of the century, Mr. Dionne sees sophisticated information centers whirring away in all large companies. They will buy information, receive it at a central computer and then distribute it to personal computers on employee desks. When that happens, Mr. Dionne feels, cost will be critical because information will be a commodity. **********To deliver the information, McGraw-Hill may develop some computer networks, a costly undertaking that will enable it to own its distribution systems. But it plans to do that only if it cannot reach the target customers over the existing computer, phone and cable lines of other vendors like Merrill Lynch, Mead Data Central and Dow Jones. **********In restructuring McGraw-Hill, there was not absolute agreement that so much should be done so fast. ''If I were doing it, I probably would have done it a bit slower, taken a few areas and seen how it worked first,'' says Harold McGraw. ''But everyone's style is a little different.'' **********Mr. Dionne does not know how long it will take to transform McGraw-Hill. But he wants it to become a star in the business information industry, whose principal combatants now are Dun & Bradstreet, McGraw-Hill and Dow Jones. I.B.M., Reuters and A.T.&T., among others, also have pieces of it and want more. These companies compete with each other, but some also distribute one another's products over their own systems. **********In thinking about its future, McGraw-Hill likes to compare itself to Dun & Bradstreet, by far the dominant player in information services, with some 3,000 products and services, and revenues nearly double McGraw-Hill's. In 1984, Dun & Bradstreet acquired A.C. Nielsen, the biggest market and media research company. **********McGraw-Hill, though, has ample information sources. The biggest revenue producer is the book company, but the fastest-growing, and most profitable, part is the financial and economic services business, particularly electronic products. This group includes Standard & Poor's, Data Resources Inc., and the recently acquired Monchik-Weber, an electronic deliverer of stock and commodity information. ACCORDING to BP Reports, an industry newsletter, McGraw-Hill - in terms of 1984 revenues - is the country's second-biggest book publisher, after Simon & Schuster. Most of McGraw-Hill's book sales are from textbooks, although Erma Bombeck's four McGraw-Hill titles have sold a total of 2.5 million copies. A huge success is Paul Samuelson's ''Economics: An Introductory Analysis,'' first published in 1948, which has sold more than four million copies. Roughly half of the nation's children use McGraw-Hill spellers. Most shorthand students use McGraw's? Gregg textbooks.  McGraw-Hill publishes 30 specialized magazines. The biggest and best-known is Business Week, which leads all newsweeklies and business magazines in ad pages and is sixth in revenues among all American magazines. **********Standard & Poor's Compustat data base harbors basic information on 6,500 companies, information that ranges from earnings to descriptions of businesses. S.&P. also ranks $170 billion worth of corporate and municipal debt. Another product, the S.&P. 500, a stock market barometer, is a widely followed economic indicator. **********McGraw-Hill now thinks it can spin off additional electronic renditions -and do so for almost all its products. Take F.W. Dodge. Each day, index-card-size dispatches go out to some 80,000 subscribers, people in construction trades who want to know about new buildings so that they can pursue contracts. Next month, a prototype of an electronic version will be tested, with Dodge making available its information as soon as it gets it. **********Last September, McGraw-Hill entered into a joint venture with Citibank to set up a 24-hour worldwide electronic trading, information and financial service for commodity markets. **********McGraw-Hill has a pilot program in Minnesota that electronically ties all the school districts so that, say, all math teachers can chat about curriculum. **********In a venture with Telecommunications Inc., a big cable television operator, and Telecrafter, a cable marketing concern, McGraw-Hill is testing X-Press, a service for cable subscribers with their own computers. It allows them to get dozens of news and financial wires, among other things. **********One big uncertainty is how much demand there is for electronic information. McGraw-Hill already has had disappointments. It invested something like $2 million in the Product Information Network, which offered purchasing tips to municipal governments. It drew a lot of yawns and McGraw-Hill is putting it out of its misery. **********In 1979, it paid $103 million for the econometrics analysis firm, Data Resources Inc. Perhaps D.R.I.'s most valuable asset was its founder and president, Otto Eckstein, the well-known Harvard economist. But he subsequently died unexpectedly. And there were other problems. D.R.I. sold information by charging customers to tap into its own computer. But that market dried up once people bought their own personal computers and access to all sorts of other information sources. D.R.I. has been put through a costly and bumpy conversion to selling through personal computers. **********There has been other pain. Manufacturing operations were consolidated last year, eliminating several hundred jobs; purchasing decisions are getting more rigorous inspection. Acquisitions have put pressure on profits and if McGraw-Hill's quarterly earnings continue to erode, the stock price could weaken and make the company more vulnerable to takeovers. (The 20 percent stake in the company's stock held by McGraw family members offers some protection against interlopers.)) Still, Mr. Dionne says that he badly wants to buy another large information company and would consider selling the television stations to help finance it. But ''everytime I show up on a front porch carrying flowers,'' he says, ''there are three guys sitting on the swing with candy in their laps.'' **********Analysts like the Dionne vision, but they are not as optimistic as he is. ''I've thought that McGraw-Hill's basic problem over the years has been marketing,'' says J. Kendrick Noble of Paine Webber. ''If that's true - that they have good products but have had trouble selling them -then this should help them.'' Drexel Burnham's Mr. Reidy says, ''The investment community is looking eagerly for double-digit revenue growth. It wasn't there in 1985. We think it's going to get better. But it hasn't happened yet.'' **********In the end, the future may become trapped in the crusty McGraw-Hill culture. The intensely market-focused Standard & Poor's already dances to the right tune, but McGraw-Hill acknowledges that most of the rest of the corporation does not. Some print people, who have an almost visceral attachment to the printed word, fear their products will be doomed, or at least lose readership to rival electronic renditions. **********''Some editors have risen to the challenge and are going like a house on fire,'' says Ralph Schulz, senior vice president for editorial. ''Others are not inclined to adapt to a whole new way of thinking.'' **********Clearly, however, management feels that change is the solution. ''If we have a product and it's cannibalized, I'd rather cannibalize it than have one of our competitors do it,'' says Mr. Hosbach. **********''Technology has a way of changing your life, whether you like it or not,'' says Stephen B. Shepard, Business Week's editor-in-chief, who is quite upbeat about the transformation. ''You can spin off products using the Business Week name that are not suitable for putting in the magazine to reach five million people. That will enable us to make the business grow.'' THE McGRAW'S ANDWHERE THEY WORK **********John Hill, a co-founder along with James H. McGraw of McGraw-Hill, had two daughters. But their interests lay outside the company and the Hill family involvement ended when John Hill died in 1916. The McGraw family, however, still remains a pervasive presence in the company. **********All told, roughly 20 percent of the company's stock belongs to various members of the McGraw family. Harold W. McGraw Jr., the grandson of the co-founder, is chairman of the company and preceded Joseph Dionne as chief executive officer. **********In getting to the top, Harold Jr. prevailed in a power struggle with two cousins, Donald Jr. and John. Donald resigned in 1977 after Harold eliminated his position as group president and offered him a less lofty post. John left as an officer after Harold became president, but remains a director. **********Several other McGraws work for the company. Two are sons of Harold Jr. - Harold W. (Terry) McGraw III is a group vice president in the transportation group and Robert P. McGraw is a group vice president of the health care unit. Mark W. McGraw, a son of John, is a sales representative for F.W. Dodge. James H. McGraw IV, a great-grandson of the co-founder, is a market manager for wine and spirits advertising for Business Week. **********Not all of the McGraws are especially close. Harold Jr. says he has not heard from Donald in quite some time. As John expressed it a while back: ''We haven't had Thanksgiving dinner at grandmother's house in a number of years.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/business/the-orderly-world-of-martin-davis.html": {"writer_name": "Geraldine Fabrikant", "pub_date": "1986-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2973, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE ORDERLY WORLD OF MARTIN DAVIS", "print_headline": "THE ORDERLY WORLD OF MARTIN DAVIS", "body_text": " **********THE snow was falling heavily, obscuring the glorious view of Central Park from the 42d floor of the Gulf and Western building. The pristine vista did little to cheer Martin S. Davis, the company's 58-year-old chairman. **********He and his wife were scheduled to leave for a week of skiing in St. Moritz, and a snowstorm could postpone what was to be his first real vacation in three years. **********As it turned out, luck was with Mr. Davis - his plane took off despite the weather. It was another example of how, despite momentary uncertainty, things have tended to work out Mr. Davis's way. **********Indeed, things have been going his way for nearly three years. First, in the face of intense opposition from some board members, Martin Davis was named to succeed Charles G. Bluhdorn, the Gulf and Western Industries' founder and only chief executive until his sudden death three years ago. And Wall Street has unwaveringly supported Mr. Davis's radical restructuring of G.&W. - the stock has soared, despite management disarray at Paramount Pictures, a major subsidiary. **********''He knows what he is doing,'' says Jack Kelly, vice president and conglomerate analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''The company has a definite strategy, and Mr. Davis has the conviction to implement it.'' **********Gulf and Western Industries today bears the unmistakable stamp of Martin Davis. Where Charles Bluhdorn was the ultimate diversifier, leading his company into a veritable polyglot of unrelated businesses and investments, Mr. Davis is a consolidator. **********Their styles are as different as their strategies. ''Charlie was an iconoclast - under Charlie, there was no warning down the road as to what would happen,'' said George A. Smathers, the former Florida Senator who has been on the G.&W. board since 1969. ''Martin's mind is entirely different. He began to put the square pegs in the square holes. It is not as exciting as it used to be. I don't want to say it is dull, but it is more conventional.'' **********As far as Mr. Davis is concerned, a little less variety and excitement is just what G.&W. needed. ''We were in too many places at one time,'' he says of the company that was once known as the quintessential conglomerate. **********Not any more. In the last three years, Mr. Davis has sold off enough assets to generate more than $2.6 billion in cash. Gone are the sugar operations in the Dominican Republic and Florida, and the building products units. Gone, too, is the consumer products and industrial group, sold to Wickes Companies last summer for $1 billion and the assumption of $90 million in debt. Even the $850 million portfolio of unrelated stocks that Mr. Bluhdorn loved so well is gone. **********Now, with almost all of the planned divestitures behind him, Mr. Davis has been building G.&W.'s presence in three service-sector groups: entertainment, publishing and information and financial services. Some of G.&W.'s companies in these areas, like Simon & Schuster and Paramount, are heirlooms from the Bluhdorn days. Others, like Prentice-Hall, are recent acquisitions. But all, with the possible exception of Paramount, are expected to not only contribute sizable profits of their own, but to help other divisions do so as well. **********''More than anything else, I think the theme of our company is distributing information,'' Mr. Davis, a lean, well-groomed executive, said in an interview right before his vacation. ''Not that somebody in the financial services area is going to be selling Prentice-Hall books, but I think there will be a definite correlation between the two.'' **********Now Mr. Davis is ready to tackle Act II in the drama of G.&W.'s continuing transformation. ''Davis has to rebuild Gulf and Western, that is the tough challenge,'' says Gordon Crawford, a media expert with the Capital Guardian Research Company, an investment management group. ''He has to create value out of the things he has bought, as well as esprit de corps.'' **********The ''new'' company's income in the fiscal year 1985, which ended July 31, was $234.3 million on sales of $3.1 billion. Although it is still relatively early to evaluate some of Mr. Davis's moves, investors have reacted as though G.&W. had been ailing in Mr. Bluhdorn's day and Mr. Davis had rescued it. Since he took over, they have bid G.&W.'s stock up to $56.375 from a low of $18 when Mr. Bluhdorn died. The price/earnings multiple has jumped to 16 from 3. **********Mr. Davis, perhaps because of his many years as a marketing executive, has cultivated a far better relationship with the media and with investors than did Mr. Bluhdorn. ''Mr. Bluhdorn didn't want to play the game,'' said one financial executive. ''Marty understands the game. Now the company is simpler and there is more information about it available. That is extremely important.'' STILL, there are some nagging questions raised by Mr. Davis's management style. In 1984, Fortune magazine called him one of the toughest bosses in the country. **********Mr. Davis is relatively untroubled by his reputation as a hard-nosed manager. ''If I'm considered a tough manager, I think it is accurate,'' he said. ''I won't object. I am demanding. I want team players, I want results.'' **********Still, several former G.&W. employees say that he is not only tough, but stingy with praise. For example, they recall a presentation they had made a few years ago suggesting that G.&W. buy some television stations. They had worked hard gathering their facts. Yet when the presentation was over, ''He just said thank you,'' one executive recalled. ''We never heard from him about it again.'' **********Mr. Davis remembers the incident somewhat differently. The presentation, he contends, ''was inept; rather than embarrass everyone in an open meeting, I didn't say anything.'' In fact, Mr. Davis says that the numbers made no sense form a financial or operating standpoint. **********That is not the way that Barry Diller, the former chairman of Paramount Pictures, remembers it, though. ''Inept or no, if Mr. Davis had simply followed the recommendations which were presented,'' he says, ''he would have succeeded in buying television properties at 25 percent of their current prices.'' **********This is by far not the only disagreement that Mr. Davis and Mr. Diller have had. Perhaps the most publicized clash between Mr. Davis and any of G.&W.'s executives took place in the summer of 1984, when Mr. Diller, the chairman of Paramount Pictures, left the company for 20th Century-Fox, and Michael Eisner, Paramount's president, defected to The Walt Disney Company. The two men are among the most respected in the entertainment community, and numerous analysts and industry insiders faulted Mr. Davis for not doing everything possible - including sweetening their compensation - to prevent them from leaving. **********Mr. Davis, aware of the criticism, said: ''It didn't bother me then, and it doesn't bother me now.'' Still, at the time he acknowledged that ''different styles'' and ''differences of direction'' between Mr. Diller and himself may have contributed to the executive's departure. And Mr. Davis also expressed discomfort with the huge salaries the two men were pulling down. **********The departures eventually led to a sizable personnel drain in Paramount's middle-management ranks. A large number of key executives left, many to join Mr. Eisner at Disney. Mr. Davis himself has acknowledged to associates that he made a mistake in letting Mr. Eisner go. Mr. Eisner, now Disney chairman, has proved successful there. **********Not one to cry over spilt milk, Mr. Davis, whose own salary and bonus came to about $1.24 million last year, has broadened the company's incentive compensation plan to cover 500 people, rather than just the 100 that were covered in Mr. Bluhdorn's days. ''You build for the future by rewarding people for a good job,'' he said. **********Mr. Davis has managed to hold on to some of G.&W.'s most widely praised executives outside of Paramount. These include Reece Overcash Jr., the head of the Financial Services operation (see box), and Richard Snyder, head of Simon & Schuster, who is known for his abiilty to pick and promote best-selling books. **********Under Mr. Davis, Simon & Schuster has moved more heavily into textbooks and other unglamorous areas that offer much higher margins and more easily forecastable earnings than do trade books. Profit margins at Simon & Schuster, which is primarily a trade book publisher, were about 9 percent before acquisitions last year. But, as a result of the Prentice-Hall purchase, Mara Miesnieks, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, is forecasting 13 percent margins for G.&.W.'s overall publishing operations in the fiscal year 1986. **********Currently, Prentice-Hall, which gets 45 percent of its revenues from educational publishing, is the centerpiece of that strategy. One key attraction of the textbook business is favorable demographics that will result in more children moving through the school system. **********Mr. Snyder has spent a good deal of his time since the acquisition paring costs and consolidating facilities. The result has been $20 million in savings. And Prentice-Hall also puts Simon & Schuster in the fast-growing business of providing information for lawyers, accountants and other professionals. **********Mr. Davis has made no secret of wanting to further expand G.&W.'s empire. He has had discussions with Time Inc. - ''They have a fantastic information company,'' he said recently - as well as with Thornton F. Bradshaw, RCA's chairman, before that company agreed to merge with the General Electric Company. Those who know Mr. Davis well say that he would have attempted to hold on to the network and to RCA's record company, while selling off its capital-intensive businesses. THE transformation of Gulf and **********Western from its conglomerate roots began on Feb. 19, 1983, when Charles Bluhdorn, who founded the company in 1958, died of a heart attack en route to New York from his vacation home in the Dominican Republic. Mr. Bluhdorn may well have been preparing to hand over the corporate reins - although few people knew it at the time, he had been suffering from chronic lymphatic leukemia for five years and generalized lymphoma for three years, according to his death certificate. **********Mr. Davis, as well as several board members, said they did not know that Mr. Bluhdorn had cancer. But a number of former company executives recalled that in the last year or so Mr. Bluhdorn did not look well and did not seem strong. Mr. Davis was not named to head the company until after an intense power struggle between his supporters on the board and those who felt that John H. Duncan, chairman of G.&W.'s executive committee, should get the job. **********Mr. Davis had already proved himself a tough infighter even before his G.&W. days. He did not bother going after a college degree. Instead, he got one of his first jobs, with Samuel Goldwyn Productions, through a newspaper ad. Among the young men working there were George Weissman, who was to become president of the Philip Morris Company and a G.&W. board member, and Bill Ruder, later chairman of Ruder & Finn, the public relations firm. **********That was 1947. By 1960 he was Paramount Pictures's head of sales and marketing. He was with Paramount when it merged with G.&W. in 1969. **********Mr. Davis got to know Mr. Bluhdorn partly as a result of Mr. Bluhdorn's fascination with the movie company. A few years later, when G.&W. became the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was to Mr. Davis that Mr. Bluhdorn turned to keep the company's image from being tarnished too much. **********Even as he rose in the company, Mr. Davis held onto responsibility for its corporate public relations. In later years, as chief administrative officer, he also had responsibility for the legal department and for banking and financial community public relations. **********Now one of the biggest questions is whether Mr. Davis can smooth the waters at Paramount. Arthur Barron, a Paramount veteran, now is responsible for the entire entertainment operation; Frank Mancuso, a longtime Paramount distribution executive, has replaced Mr. Diller, and Ned Tanen, the former head of Universal Pictures, has moved into Mr. Eisner's role. Early reports on several of the company's coming pictures, including ''Top Gun'' and ''Gung Ho,'' are positive. But their first effort, ''Clue,'' has been a disappointment. **********Mr. Tanen's personal plans are a question mark. When he joined the company, he negotiated a contract that would allow him to leave this spring, and work as an independent producer, if he so desired. Although Mr. Tanen said recently that he would stay indefinitely, there is no certainty as to how long that will be. And it is common knowledge in Hollywood that Mr. Tanen had planned to stay at Paramount for only a limited time. **********Paramount's television operation is turning in a lackluster performance. Although revenues from sales of reruns of three old series -''Cheers,'' ''Family Ties,'' and ''Webster,'' - will add $100 million to earnings starting in the fiscal year 1987, the company has only succeeded in getting one new series on the air, ''McGiver,'' in the last several years. Successful hits are crucial for steady earnings. **********As part of its entertainment business, G.&W. also owns Madison Square Garden Center and the New York Knicks and Rangers and MSG Network, a cable service. The Garden's future may be in question now. It is only marginally profitable. Last year, G.&W. bought the land underneath the Garden, and it now can build a new facility or sell the entire property. **********For now, Mr. Davis need not pay much attention to the merger mania that continues throughout corporate America. G.&W.'s high stock price and continued healthy earnings put it low on any list of takeover targets. **********But it is by no means invulnerable. G.&W.'s stock is widely held, and anything that would make that stock price decline would also make G.&W. an attractive target for a raider. **********So far, no serious raiders have emerged. Both Carl C. Icahn and Carl Lindner bought stock in the company, and then ultimately sold out. **********Mr. Davis has instituted an ambitious stock repurchase program. So far he has bought back 18 million shares, and there are plans to buy back more. But on the other hand, he has not instituted extensive anti-takeover measures. The company does not have any rule that more than a simple majority of the board must approve a takeover, nor has it made provisions for staggered board elections. **********Mr. Davis is fond of saying that if there is a fantastic offer for the company, G.&W. would have to pay attention. But for now, Mr. Davis seems to relish running his own show. What he is doing, he says, is ''creating a whole new culture'' at G.&W. FINANCIAL SERVICES LITTLE GLITZ, MUCH PROFIT Paramount Pictures may be the whipped cream at Gulf and Western, but the Associates Corporation of North America, its financial services sector, is the bread and butter. **********Last year financial services had operating income of $231 million on sales of $1.4 billion. In fact, the group accounted for 45 percent of G.&W.'s revenues and an even higher percentage of its operating profit. And that marked the Associates' 10th straight year of profit increases. **********It is a track record for which Reece Overcash Jr., the Associates' 59-year-old chairman, can be justifiably proud. He joined the Associates 11 years ago, after an executive recruiter talked him into leaving his position as president and chief executive of Wachovia Bank's American Credit subsidiary. **********Mr. Overcash was not a hard sell. ''Because of the Bank Holding Act, there were a lot of restrictions on banking,'' he recalled. ''And 1974 was a bad year. Interest rates went up to 12 percent.'' **********''I was staying at the Essex House, and it was raining,'' he continued. ''That made things even gloomier. A head hunter called to talk about Associates. He caught me in a down mood.'' **********Four months later, Mr. Overcash became chairman of the Associates. At the time, the financial services group was almost entirely in consumer lending. Mr. Overcash immediately diversified into the commercial lending business, thereby reducing the sector's vulnerability to interest rate swings. Interest rates on commercial loans usually vary with prevailing rates - in other words, when the rates Mr. Overcash pays for funds rise, so do the rates he gets on his loans. In contrast, rates on consumer loans generally are fixed. **********Today the Associates gets about half its income from each business. And that sets it apart from its prime competitors, most of which concentrate on one of the two types of loans. General Electric Credit, CIT, and ITT, are primarily in commercial finance, while Household Finance, Avco, and Beneficial are primarily consumer lenders. **********In the commercial area, the largest share of the Associates' lending operation is financing of heavy- duty trucks. That represents 25 percent of its $2 billion of outstanding receivables. ''We know that business inside out,'' said Mr. Overcash. **********Credit cards (the Associates issue both Mastercard and Visa) are a growing part of its consumer lending business. In fact, the Associates already has $800 million in outstanding loans and is the 15th-largest issuer of credit cards in the country. It may soon issue a great many more - the Associates and the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company have recently begun a joint marketing effort in which the Associates will give credit cards to Hancock policyholders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/27/business/finance-new-issues-ge-credit-offers-500-million-notes.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.E.

The church claims the Government has delayed in putting the measures into effect, under pressure from powerful landowners; officials say priests are helping to create a confrontation by inciting landless peasants to occupy private farms. **********Coming so soon after the return of civilian rule, the furor has also raised larger questions, such as whether the church should still be playing such a prominent political role and whether democracy is already frustrating the expectations of sweeping change that were raised among the population barely a year ago. Activism Began in 1960's **********Brazil's bishops first took a stance against the military regime in the late 1960's when they began protesting human rights violations, including the jailing and torture of numerous priests and nuns. But from the 1970's, strongly influenced by a ''liberation theology'' that identifies the church with the poor, priests became deeply involved in the broader struggle for social justice. **********There were frequent clashes with the regime and expulsions of foreign priests, but, working through a vast network of so-called ecclesiastic base communities, clergymen were increasingly to be found organizing and defending the rights of factory workers, landless peasants, Indians, slum-dwellers and abandoned street children. **********''The problem was never really of church versus state because the church was not trying to defend its privileges,'' Canon da Silva said. ''The church had become part of the people and the real conflict was between the people and the state. We're accused of agitating, but I say that we are agitated, not agitating. We are agitated by the needs of the people.'' **********Although the church at first imagined its public role would diminish with the end of two decades of military rule, it soon became apparent that Brazil lacked alternative democratic institutions, above all strong political parties, through which demands for social change could effectively be channeled. **********Further, with many of the interest groups that prospered under the dictatorship still influential in the Sarney administration, the Brazilian church concluded that it could not abandon its vanguard position in the campaign for social change. Land Program Stalls **********However, it was the Government that focused attention on the plight of some 7 million to 10 million landless peasants when it announced a plan to distribute 100 million acres of uncultivated land to 1.2 million families through 1989. The church, which had long been pressing for a land reform, immediately embraced the cause. **********In the more developed south, its Pastoral Commission for Land had helped form a Movement of the Landless that set up roadside camps as a way of pressuring the Government to execute its plans. In the center and north, priests were also aiding squatters who hoped to gain title to land they were already farming. **********But landowners also began organizing - and arming themselves - to fight the program and through a new Democratic Ruralist Union they soon identified the church as their principal enemy. Both before and since the killing of the Rev. Josimo Moraes Tavares in Maranhao state in May, many other priests, nuns and law workers have received death threats. **********Meanwhile in Brasilia, where the Bishops' headquarters stands one mile from the Presidential Palace, a different crisis was brewing around the Land Reform Minister, Nelson Ribeiro, who was retained during a Cabinet shake-up in February thanks to pressure from the Church but who was increasingly unhappy at Mr. Sarney's delay in signing the first batch of expropriation orders. **********Finally in late May, Mr. Ribeiro resigned. Though he was replaced by a young left-leaning politician, Dante de Oliveira, built-up tensions between church and state spilled over into mutual recriminations, notably between Bishop Lorscheiter and the Minister of Justice, Paulo Brossard. Priests Accused of Meddling **********''The agrarian question is a matter of the state and should be resolved by no one else,'' Mr. Brossard said, adding that the separation of church and state here was 100 years old and that, if that fact were ignored, ''the Government would be authorized to pronounce itself on liturgical and theological matters.'' **********The federal Police Chief, Romeu Tuma, also complained that priests and missionaires from the Netherlands, France and other European countries were involved in land conflicts. ''It's necessary to talk to them and pray,'' he said, ''to pray, above all, that priests return to praying.'' **********Bishop Lorscheiter responded that ''the old cliches of the generals are back - that the place of the priest is in the sacristy and of the worker in the factory, that priests who help the needy are subversives.'' **********He added that entry visas for 30 foreign priests were being held up ''by the conditioning that the dictatorial and fascist regime bequeathed to the present authorities.'' **********So far, President Sarney has avoided taking a public position in the dispute and has met twice in recent weeks with Bishop Lorscheiter. But aides said his visit to the Pope reflects his alarm at the church's alleged role in the escalating land conflict. Significantly, since the visit was announced, the President has signed 37 expropriation orders. **********Last week, Friar Leonardo Boff, a prominent left-leaning theologian, said he did not think Mr. Sarney would be so ''ingenuous'' as to try to resolve his Government's differences with the Brazilian church in Rome. ''If he does,'' Friar Boff added, ''he will be disappointed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/business/about-real-estate-a-super-drugstore-is-set-for-bedford-stuyvesant.html": {"writer_name": "Shawn Kennedy", "pub_date": "1986-06-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 719, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SUPER-DRUGSTORE IS SET FOR BEDFORD-STUYVESANT", "print_headline": "ABOUT REAL ESTATE; A SUPER-DRUGSTORE IS SET FOR BEDFORD-STUYVESANT", "body_text": " **********Since the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation was established in Brooklyn nearly two decades ago, this nonprofit organization has developed a string of successful residential and commercial ventures. **********The commercial projects have ranged from the creation of Restoration Plaza, a modern shopping mall carved out of a collection of dilapidated structures at Fulton Street and New York Avenue, to the development in 1979 of the first supermarket to open in the area in 20 years. **********Now the corporation is moving ahead with new ventures, among them a 12,000-square-foot super-drugstore for the neighborhood.

The partners are studying several neighborhood sites for the drugstore. **********Supermarkets General also was the Restoration Corporation's partner in development of the supermarket. **********While the success in the first few years of Restoration Plaza, bounded by Fulton Street, New York and Brooklyn Avenues and Herkimer Street, was intermittent, according to Marcia Baird Johnson, a spokesman for the Restoration Corporation, the center is now completely leased. Its tenants are a mix of stores and services including a Chemical Bank branch, an A.T.&T. phone store, a Lerner Shop, a restaurant featuring Louisiana-style cooking, and the Face Palace, a makeup salon. **********The corporation's work has contributed to the revival of much of Bedford-Stuyvesant, which was long a rundown section of Brooklyn. On Fulton Street, the neighborhood's main shopping throughfare, for example, signs of vitality abound. In the blocks nearest to Restoration Plaza there are few empty storefronts and such businesses as thrift shops and open-window food stands are being replaced by stores like Eye Encounter, an optical shop. **********The street has a mix of major retailers, among them Woolworth, Pioneer Foods and Florsheim shoes, as well as beauty salons, shoe repair shops, clothing boutiques, bicycle shops and restaurants run by local entrepreneurs. **********William Turner, a property appraiser with Cross Boro Realty, which has its office at 1514 Fulton Street, said that property values as well as the cost of retail space in the area had increased substantially. **********''Five years ago a typical building - a two-store taxpayer on a 20-by-100-foot lot - near Restoration Plaza was going for between $25,000 and $50,000,'' Mr. Turner said. ''Now when they are for sale these buildings go for between $75,000 and $125,000.'' He said stores along Fulton Street rent for $1,200 to $2,000 a month. **********Although the increase in property value on Bedford Stuyvesant's main shopping street is reflected in the strength of businesses there, some analysts have expressed disappointment in the lack of other types of enterprises that could create large numbers of jobs. **********''The value of commercial property is increasing, but unfortunately there has not been a proportionate amount of industrial development that will stimulate the economy and create jobs,'' said Ron Shiffman, director of Pratt Institute's Center for Community Development. **********Nevertheless, there are signs that some jobs will be created. For example, the new owners of an empty small office building at 977 Bedford Avenue plan to clean up the three-story structure and lease it. **********''I have been in the area quite a number of years and I have watched it improve,'' said Louis Fishman, who acquired the building through a city auction last April. **********Until recently the Bedford Avenue building was used by the city's Human Resources Administration. **********Mr. Fishman is seeking a rental of $12 a square foot for the building."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/business/houston-project-by-fluor-crow.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 131, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Houston Project By Fluor, Crow", "print_headline": "Houston Project By Fluor, Crow", "body_text": " **********The Fluor Corporation said it had agreed to a joint venture with the Trammel Crow Company of Texas to build a $380 million office and retail complex in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land.

If they can arrive at some form of agreement, it would probably raise the prices of products derived from crude oil. **********Since late last year, OPEC has pursued a policy of all-out production in order to flood the oil market, depressing prices to little more than $10 a barrel and forcing marginally profitable oil producers around the world from the market. **********At a meeting in Geneva in April, OPEC agreed to reverse that policy, seeking instead to curtail production and buoy falling prices to a level somewhere below $20 a barrel. At the same time, the group is seeking the cooperation of major oil-producing countries that are not OPEC members, notably Mexico, Norway and Egypt, in stabilizing oil prices. **********At a briefing for reporters, Mr. Lukman said the members had agreed on a production ceiling for the group and had asked the Indonesian Oil Minister, Subroto, to meet with experts and resolve ''the very important question'' of parceling out ''acceptable national quotas within the limits of production we will set out for the year.'' **********Without such individual quotas, any global ceiling would be virtually meaningless.

But the diversified high-technology concern said that earnings from continuing operations fell 26.6 percent, to $108.2 million, or 80 cents a share, from $147.5 million, or $1.08 a share, in the 1985 quarter.

The change in perceptions reflects a substantial adjustment in Britain's orientation to the 12-nation Community that has been taking place quietly as a result of patient diplomatic work on on a range of issues from airline deregulation to terrorism. **********The Prime Minister, now the Community's senior head of government, still resists flowery language about European unity, but as a matter of practical policy she has made it an objective of British diplomacy to align her Government as closely as possible with key European partners, especially France and West Germany, on major issues within the Community. **********Getting Used to Smaller Voice **********Such issues tend to be numbingly technical and obscure, having to do with budgets, subsidies to European farmers, the swelling agricultural surpluses these have produced, and trade barriers that still make the long-promised common market a remote goal. But Britain's evolving stance in the Community has far-reaching implications for a former imperial colossus that now seems to be getting used to the role it will probably have to accept in the next century: that of a medium-sized state whose voice is heard mainly as part of a larger European chorus. **********''We are very much in the central group of European states in terms of our performance, our objectives and our policies,'' declared a senior official who privately wishes that his Prime Minister was less of a nationalist and readier to take a more affirmative European line in support of her own policies. **********Yet her stance at the Council meetings this weekend shows how far Britain has come in only a year and a half since a similar meeting in Milan. At that meeting, the Thatcher Government found itself isolated and ineffectual, aligned only with Denmark and Greece in opposition to procedural changes designed to strengthen Community decision-making. In terms of tactics and policies, the Milan debacle moved Britain to a vow that it would never again let itself be isolated from the main voting blocs in the Community on relatively narrow issues of principle. ''The British Government was not prepared to be marginalized and put in a second category of members,'' said a British Ambassador with a key posting on the Continent. ''Finally we've come of age in the Community. We're not going to sacrifice our position in a fit of bad temper or absence of mind.'' Controversial Issue Evaded **********The new British style in Europe tends to avoid the confrontational approach with which Mrs. Thatcher was identified during a long, bruising struggle to renegotiate Britain's contribution to the Community's budget. The British officials who organized the agenda for this weekend's meeting, for instance, left little time for discussion of the controversial Common Agricultural Policy that now siphons half the budget into farm subsidies. The temporary evasion of the Community's most pressing immediate problem was an implicit gesture to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who faces a national election early next year. **********The shift in stance, which was largely ignored by British commentators, swiftly registered on diplomats and analysts in other European capitals. ''They've become more European, almost without noticing it,'' an Italian official said. **********''It's now clear that Britain belongs to Europe forever,'' said Philippe Moreau Defarges, a former French diplomat specializing in Community affairs at the Institute of International Relations in Paris. ''It's becoming a European country, like any European country.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher herself is unlikely ever to put it that way. She has not joined the ranks of the ''Euroloons'' or ''Eurofanatics,'' to mention two of the scornful epithets she used to fire at critics at home and abroad who questioned the single-mindedness with which she stuck to her effort to renegotiate Britain's contribution. ''She is not one of nature's natural Europeans,'' a member of her Cabinet wryly acknowledged. **********But in the last year she has demonstrated a symbolic commitment of her own by reviving the long-stalled project for a tunnel under the English Channel that would provide a tangible ''fixed link'' to the Continent. And she has noticeably resisted the temptation to score nationalistic points at the Community's expense. Effect on U.S. Ties **********What this slowly changing orientation means for Britain's threadbare ''special relationship'' with the United States is a subject for much theorizing by experts. So long as Mrs. Thatcher reigns, it will remain an axiom of British policy that the security relationship with the United States is fundamental, unquestionably Britain's most important tie in the world. **********Indeed, in Foreign Office terms, the most respectable argument for what is called ''political cooperation'' with the European partners is that only through increased influence in Europe will Britain be able to sustain its influence and prestige in Washington. In Government offices, an inclination to view Europe as an alternative to the Atlantic tie is still heretical. **********But in the looser political debate, skepticism about President Reagan's ability to manage foreign affairs and the durability of American commitments - especially conspicuous in the aftermath of the Iceland summit meeting - appears to have much to do with the urge to find an enhanced role for Britain in Europe. ''Anti-Americanism is succeeding anti-Europeanism as a popular political cause,'' said William Wallace of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. **********A commentator in the influential Financial Times, describing the political undertow, wrote, ''When the history of Mrs. Thatcher's premiership is written, it will be recorded that in the period all the British parties became more European.'' **********For those who see Europe as the answer to Britain's post-imperial quest for a role, the embarrassing truth remains that most senior officials here still find cooperation with Washington easier than cooperation with the rest of Europe. ''We're a gaggle of nation states,'' a senior official said, casting a cold eye on the prospects for enhanced political or military cooperation. United by a Common Fear **********Nevertheless, where once President de Gaulle saw Britain as a potential ''Trojan horse'' for American interests in Europe, now a common fear that Washington might be tempted to negotiate away their deterrents leaves Britain and France, Western Europe's two nuclear-armed nations, with a sense of common interests on national security. ''You could hardly put a cigarette paper between our two positions,'' an official in Paris remarked. **********Britain's greatest interest in Europe remains economic. It can hardly be argued that membership in the Community has proved to be Britain's economic salvation, for the last 13 years have coincided with a steep decline in industrial production and steadily rising unemployment. **********But even the British Treasury now appears to believe that Mrs. Thatcher has waited too long to bring the pound sterling under the umbrella of the European Monetary System, which would have the effect of tying it at a fixed rate to the German mark. It is only nationalist die-hards of the left and right who can still contemplate a withdrawal: A full 45 per cent of the country's trade is now with the Community. The loss of other markets has left little choice. **********In the field of high technology, where the Europeans lag, Europe-wide cooperation is now commonly and somewhat wistfully touted as the only alternative to economic colonization by the United States or Japan. Free Trade Over Sovereignty **********In pushing against the remaining barriers to the expansion into the Community of British banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, the Thatcher Government finds itself having to trade away small bits of sovereignty to secure the free trade principles in which it believes. **********Ultimately the ''completion of the internal market,'' Mrs. Thatcher's highest European priority, could mean agreeing to the ''harmonization'' of sales taxes and customs regulations under the Community's aegis. That, at least, is the view of Lord Cockfield, who is the senior British member of the European Commission in Brussels, the executive that is supposed to make a reality of the principles contained in communiques after the heads of government confer. **********''The British Government hadn't thought through in detail just what completing the market genuinely entails,'' Lord Cockfield said in an interview in Brussels this year. ''When you come over here and live, you get a very different idea of Europe. It's a fact of life and not a theoretical condition.'' **********It is a fact of life that many British politicians still instinctively resist. British members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, for instance, have to get in line with the general public and pass through metal detectors if they want to visit the Parliament at Westminster. More Help in Strasbourg **********Yet these elected M.E.P.'s, as they are called, find they are able to accomplish more for their voters than those who sit in ''the Mother of Parliaments.'' That, at least, is the view of John Tomlinson, a former Labor Party member of the House of Commons who was elected to the Strasbourg assembly after losing his seat in 1983. **********Through intensive lobbying in Brussels, he has managed to get European funds for a new conference center in Birmingham and regulations to restrict Japanese underselling that was destroying a manufacturer in his district. No Shimmering Vision **********From Mrs. Thatcher's standpoint, Europe represents a lot of very hard work on gritty issues, with relatively meager returns. It is not a shimmering vision. So far her attitude has accorded well with the seeming indifference of the British public, which is unresponsive to both anti-European and pro-European rhetoric. **********Yet even the Labor Party, which called for British withdrawal from the Community at the last election, now justifies its controversial military policy for a nonnuclear Britain by talking in terms of European options and responsibilities. In Mrs. Thatcher's Government there are potential successors - including Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, and Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Foreign Secretary - who would try to make a cause out of Britain's future in Europe. Whether this would change Europe or move British voters remains to be seen, but those who still believe in that future think it would be brought closer if political leaders were ready to avow it. **********Most likely, that would just show that ''Europe'' had finally become an accepted piety in insular Britain, as it is on the Continent. Visionaries and skeptics are coming to the same conclusion, contended Tom McNally, a former member of Parliament who once campaigned for the European ideal. **********''It's the safest harbor,'' he said, ''for Britain to be berthed in for the future.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/30/world/5-parties-reunite-to-end-rome-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Roberto Suro", "pub_date": "1986-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 534, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "5 PARTIES REUNITE TO END ROME CRISIS", "print_headline": "5 PARTIES REUNITE TO END ROME CRISIS", "body_text": " **********Leaders of five political parties agreed today to end Italy's monthlong political crisis by reassembling their coalition under Bettino Craxi, a Socialist, as Prime Minister. **********At a three-hour meeting this morning, the party leaders agreed that Mr. Craxi would remain Prime Minister until next March and then withdraw in favor of a Christian Democrat. **********Although Cabinet changes are still under discussion, the leaders agreed to re-establish the governing coalition that Mr. Craxi led until he resigned as Prime Minister on June 27. **********Since then, the Socialists and the Christian Democrats have engaged in often-bitter arguments over when members of the coalition should take their turns in the Prime Minister's office.

The United States has detonated nine nuclear explosions since that date. **********In Moscow, the official Soviet press agency Tass denounced the test today as a ''dangerous destabilizing step'' that cast doubt on American reliability as a negotiating partner.  [ Page A8. ]  Test Had Been Postponed The test, which had been postponed twice, was planned for Tuesday, the same day President Reagan met with the departing Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, to discuss a proposed summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Officials said the postponement was the result of technical problems and winds that could have carried any accidential radiation leaks toward populated areas. **********Mr. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has extended the Soviet self-imposed test moratorium several times and recently said the Soviet Union would not test until the United States carried out a test. **********Reagan Administration officials have regarded the Soviet suspension of testing as propaganda and have countered with a proposal to improve the verification of existing treaties limiting underground tests to 150 kilotons, the force of 150,000 tons of TNT. **********The two sides have similarly remained far apart on the issues of limiting nuclear weapons and Soviet compliance with past arms treaties. **********Tass, accusing the Administration of a rush to achieve military supremacy, said the decision to proceed with the test today showed ''criminal contempt'' for world opinion. **********Administration officials argue that the testing is needed to develop new weapons and insure the reliability of old ones. They say the United States would want to continue testing even if the issue of verifying a moratorium or ban on the testing of nuclear weapons was solved. **********The Department of Energy said the test today took place 1,300 feet below the Nevada desert at 9:08 A.M., Eastern standard time. Test Under 20 Kilotons **********The test, code-named Mighty Oak, was less than 20 kilotons and was designed to assess the effect of a nuclear explosion on missile warheads and components. The American atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima in 1945 was 12.4 kilotons. **********Late today, the House Rules Committee agreed to permit a full House vote on legislation that would ban further United States nuclear weapons testing until the President certified to Congress that the Soviet Union had resumed such testing. **********The legislation - sponsored by Representatives Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat; Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. and Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado - will be offered as an amendment to a supplemental appropriations bill for 1986 that the House is to take up next week. **********''This may be one small boom in the desert, but it's a big bomb for arms control,'' Mr. Markey said. Said to Squander Opportunity **********Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''The Administration is squandering one of the best opportunities in many years to achieve a comprehensive test ban treaty.'' **********Other members of Congress, such as Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, have argued that testing should go on to insure that the United States nuclear deterrent is effective. **********The international anti-nuclear organization Greenpeace declared: ''The reverberations from this blast will be felt around the world for many years to come. This act shows the true hypocrisy of President Reagan's stand on arms control.'' **********A Greenpeace spokesman said 96 demonstrators from Greenpeace and other anti-nuclear groups had been arrested near the test site since rumors of a test began circulating Monday. **********Twenty-two protesters, many carrying signs urging a test ban, stood on the perimeter of the site 40 miles from the explosion when the test was carried out today. **********In another arms control development, a bipartisan group of 52 senators sent a letter to Mr. Reagan on Tuesday urging him to maintain the Administration's current policy to not undercut the second treaty with the Russians on limiting strategic arms. U.S. Charges Violations **********The Administration has charged the Soviet Union with a number of arms control violations and is deliberating over whether to continue honoring the terms of the 1979 treaty. **********The United States has signed the agreement but has never ratified it. **********Unless the United States dismantles two Poseidon submarines, it will exceed the treaty's limit on multiple warhead missiles when a new Trident submarine begins sea trials on May 20. **********A report by the Congressional Research Service, made public today, said allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had urged the Administration to stick with the treaty. **********The study says that the NATO allies believe that the Soviet moratorium on testing has hurt the United States in terms of world opinion and that an Administration decision not to abide by the terms of the treaty would do further damage. Damage to Allies Seen **********The report also says that such an American move could damage conservative European governments friendly to the United States and that the Soviet Union is in a better position to build up its number of strategic weapons than the United States. **********The study, which was sent to Mr. Reagan by Senator Robert C. Byrd, the Senate Democratic leader, said NATO governments opposed some ''gray area'' approaches currently under consideration by the Administration, such as dry-docking the Poseidon submarines instead of dismantling them. **********Defense Department officials argue that the United States should signal its concern over what it sees as Soviet arms control violations by taking measures that run counter to the strategic arms treaty. They say the Soviet Union would be unlikely to significantly accelerate its longstanding plans for producing nuclear weapons in response to a American decision to change its position on the treaty. **********State Department official argue that the United States responses should be consistent with the treaty. They cite the concerns of the United States allies, note that the Soviet Union has complied with most arms provisions, and say Moscow has more potential to expand its arsenal beyond treaty limit than the United States."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/21/business/business-people-chairman-of-ltv-still-hopeful-on-steel.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-07-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 410, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chairman of LTV Still Hopeful on Steel", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chairman of LTV Still Hopeful on Steel", "body_text": " **********When Raymond A.

PEPPER BUILDS COKE'S LEAD", "print_headline": "DR. PEPPER BUILDS COKE'S LEAD", "body_text": " **********The Coca-Cola Company announced yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the Dallas-based Dr Pepper Company for $470 million in a deal that is important both for the world of finance and the soft drink industry. It represents one of the largest windfalls ever for investors in a leveraged buyout and it is a shrewd strategic move by Coke to keep its No. 1 position. **********''It's a royal coup poker move by Coke,'' said Jesse Meyers, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''Coke's bottlers are burping with delight. Their team has made a whopper of an announcement.'' **********And it is an equally staggering deal for Forstmann Little & Company, a Wall Street investment firm that purchased Dr Pepper in a leveraged buyout in February 1984, took it private and sold underperforming assets to streamline the company. At yesterday's announced price, equity investors brought together by Forstmann Little will receive a tenfold return on their investment - Coke will pay $300 million for Dr Pepper's equity that cost the investors some $30 million. The balance of the purchase price will retire the $170 million in debt remaining from the 1984 buyout. The Buyout Trend **********Of the spate of companies that have switched from public to private ownership in the last year or two through a leveraged buyout - for instance, Beatrice, Levi Strauss and Northwest Industries - this is the first of any size in which the investors have recouped their initial investment. **********In a leveraged buyout, a group of private investors purchases a company largely through loans secured by the company's assets. The investors earn their return when the company is either resold through a public stock offering or purchased by another company, as in this deal. **********The acquisition of Dr Pepper insures that the Atlanta-based Coke will retain its premier position in the highly competitive soft drink industry. With Dr Pepper, a spicy, cherry-based drink with a following in the South, Coke will now have some 46 percent market share, up from about 39 percent. Coke's stock closed yesterday at $90.25, up $3.75. Pepsi's Moves **********The purchase blunts recent strategic moves by archrival Pepsico Inc. It comes only three weeks after Pepsico announced the acquisition of 7-Up, a lemon-lime drink that increases Pepsico's market share to 35 percent. Without Dr Pepper, Coke would have been only four percentage points ahead of Pepsi. Indeed, had Pepsi purchased Dr Pepper, it would have catapulted into the No. 1 spot. **********''The ironic thing of all this is that once Pepsi bought 7-Up, it made Dr Pepper a hot property,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a beverage industry analyst with Montgomery Securities. **********After the acquisition is completed - the deal must still be reviewed by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission - Coke and Pepsi will have a combined market share of about 80 percent. The next biggest soft drink, Royal Crown Cola, has a 4.6 percent share. **********A spokesman for the F.T.C. said it was impossible to predict the Government's reaction to the purchase. Phillip Areeda, an antitrust expert at the Harvard Law School, said antitrust concerns would depend on how the Government defines the soft drink market. Should it choose to look at that market as a whole, ''these concentration numbers are quite troublesome,'' he said. But he added that the Government could define the relevant market by segments in which the two companies compete, which could lessen antitrust concerns. A Buyout Lesson **********Coke's acquisition of Dr Pepper is the final chapter in a nearly textbook-perfect version of how a successful leveraged buyout works. Forstmann Little bought Dr Pepper from its public shareholders for $650 million. Some $620 million was borrowed by Forstmann Little; the balance came from the investment group. Some 14 percent of this equity interest was put up by Dr Pepper management, which stayed on, and the rest from Forstmann Little's partners, who are wealthy individuals and pension funds. **********Once it became a private company, Dr Pepper began to sell underperforming assets, using the proceeds to pay off the borrowings used to finance the deal. Dr Pepper's Canada Dry soft drink operations were sold to R. J. Reynolds Industries for about $175 million. Some nine bottling plants and the headquarters building and other real estate also were sold, netting some $275 million. This reduced Dr Pepper's debt to about $170 million. At the same time, Forstmann Little said that Dr Pepper's operating earnings began to climb, from $39 million in 1983 to $51 million in 1984 and to $60 million in 1985. **********It is unclear whether 70-year-old W. W. Clements, the longtime chairman of Dr Pepper and one of the equity investors, will remain in his post. **********Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner at Forstmann Little, said few investors were interested in Dr Pepper when its management began to consider selling the company in 1984 to fend off a possible hostile raid. **********''No one saw the value at the time we bought, but we could,'' said Mr. Forstmann. ''Dr Pepper had been around almost 100 years.'' He added, '' It needed restructuring and divesting.'' **********It is unclear what impact the deal will have on the leveraged buyout business. Mr. Forstmann said he is uncertain whether this would attract more investment money to the business and whether other investors could expect the same size returns. **********''It's like watching Dwight Gooden pitch,'' said Mr. Forstmann, referring to the Mets star. ''Because he can doesn't mean others can. In this business, we can pitch. This deal says nothing about L.B.O.'s in general, except that this is the way they should be done.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/14/world/mitterand-doubts-he-will-run-again.html": {"writer_name": "Judith Miller", "pub_date": "1986-10-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 679, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MITTERAND DOUBTS HE WILL RUN AGAIN", "print_headline": "MITTERAND DOUBTS HE WILL RUN AGAIN", "body_text": " **********President Francois Mitterrand said today that, at this time, he did not intend to be a candidate in the next presidential election, which must be held by spring 1988. **********Mr. Mitterrand, speaking with reporters at a military exercise in Caylus in southwestern France, did not totally rule out running for a second seven-year term.

Analysts have noted that Mr. Mitterrand has lost much of his power in policy-making. On some issues, the presidential office is often belatedly informed by Mr. Chirac's Government of its actions and decision, analysts say. **********But Mr. Mitterrand, whose popularity slumped during the first five years of his term, has climbed in opinion polls since March. In July, 52 percent of French voters, when asked for whom they would vote in presidential elections, said Mr. Mitterrand, and 48 percent expressed a preference for Mr. Chirac. In October, the public was evenly split between the two men. **********The polls show that Mr. Mitterrand remains the strongest leftist challenger against any of several rightist candidates. **********Mr. Duhamel interpreted Mr. Mitterrand's remarks today as signaling that he would stay in office until 1988. **********''He wants to remain President, not a candidate until the end,'' Mr. Duhamel said.

After several years, it asserts, the United States would not be able to contain Nicaragua unless it introduced up to 100,000 troops into the region, with large-scale air and naval forces. **********The impetus for the negotiations has come from Mexico, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela who first met on the Panamanian island of Contadora and have since been known as the Contadora group.

''It falls apart, it's messy.'' The replacement is a smaller, single-stick version. **********Strategies Revamped **********And the company, custodian of a product that is a part of the childhood memories of millions of Americans, did not stop there. It has also added new flavors and snazzier packaging to the pop and its other hot-weather snacks - Fudgsicles and Creamsicles - as well as revamped its manufacturing and marketing strategies. **********At stake is Popsicle's leadership in what the industry calls the frozen novelty business, which has been flooded in recent years with a new generation of tastier, healthier and pricier products. **********''About 90 percent of the items in that section of our freezer are new since 1980,'' said a spokesman for the Kroger Company, one of the nation's largest supermarket chains. ''Popsicle is attempting to change to accommodate that new reality.'' **********Gone is the antiquated system whereby Popsicles were made and distributed to retailers by 100 different dairies around the country, a procedure that left the company with little say over product quality. Fruitier Flavors **********New, fruitier flavors have been added to the Popsicle line, as has vitamin C. At the same time, Popsicle is attempting in a new advertising campaign to awaken the memories that most adults have of bygone summer days spent eating Popsicles and to transfer those memories to today's children - who might otherwise clamor for a Jell-O Pudding Pop. **********All in all, the last six months have seen a major overhaul of the company, a division of the Sara Lee Corporation based in Englewood, N.J. **********''We needed more muscle,'' said Mr. Walters, who was brought in by Sara Lee to head Popsicle at the end of 1983. **********Only five years ago, two-thirds of the industry's sales came from scores of small local and regional companies with little marketing expertise or money to promote their brands. Dramatic Changes **********But the business has changed dramatically since. Huge packaged-goods makers such as General Foods, Dole, Coca-Cola Foods and Pillsbury came in with their technological, marketing expertise and their deep pockets. Besides introducing a host of innovative products, they spent lavishly to establish themselves. Advertising expenditures in the category have grown to a projected $65 million this year from $16 million in 1982. **********''We changed the rules of the game,'' said Ricardo DeSantis, a marketing executive at General Foods, whose Pudding Pop, introduced in 1981, is one of the most successful of the new products. **********Today, national brands account for almost two-thirds of frozen novelty sales, and the competition for space in the crowded supermarket freezer section and for consumer loyalty has increased tremendously. **********So has the market's size. Last year Americans bought $1.7 billion worth of frozen novelties - ice and ice cream bars, ice cream sandwiches and the like - compared with $720 million in 1982, according to Find/ SVP, a market research concern. Of last year's total, about $1.3 billion came in food stores, the segment in which Popsicle mainly competes. Industry Consolidation Seen **********As Popsicle sees it, the development of frozen novelties into one of the fastest-growing and competitive areas of the food business is sure to lead to continued industry consolidation. The company says it has held on to its 17 percent market share even in the face of the growing competition (General Foods has gone from zero five years ago to about 15 percent), but without some changes it would almost certainly have ended up as a second-tier brand. **********''Ultimately there will be two to four competitors with the lion's share of the business,'' Mr. Walters said. ''We'd like to have our place in the sun.'' **********The core of Popsicle's strategy is the change in the way it makes and distributes its products. The company has never made its own Popsicles, Fudgsicles or Creamsicles, but instead licensed the network of dairies to do it. The dairies, in turn, sold the products to retailers in their area. Using Different Packaging **********But that arrangement left Popsicle with little control over local sales efforts and product quality. The system was so decentralized that every dairy used different packaging. **********''Under that system,'' said Paul Kadin, who became Popsicle's marketing vice president last year, ''we were very vulnerable to the onslaught of national competition.'' **********Popsicle therefore ended the licensing system after almost 63 years, and replaced it with a system under which about 25 manufacturers would make the Popsicle products under tight supervision. Popsicle itself is now handling distribution to retailers, and keeps a much closer eye on product quality, which particularly in Fudgsicles and Creamsicles had dropped precipitously. **********Popsicles, Fudgsicles and Creamsicles, which together account for the bulk of the company's sales, compete at the low end of the price spectrum - typically $1.59 for a dozen Popsicles. **********Popsicle's marketing efforts are directed largely at mothers, who the company believes buy most of its products for children. ''Kids like them,'' Mr. Kadin said. ''Mothers don't need to spend the money on more expensive brands.'' Older Snackers a Target **********But much of the action and growth in the business has come in products aimed at older snackers who are willing to pay more for a tastier product, and Popsicle is paying more attention to that segment as well. **********Its main entry in the pricier category is Oreo Cookies 'n' Cream, an oversized ice cream sandwich version of the venerable cookie. Popsicle makes the brand under license from RJR Nabisco, the owner of Oreo cookies. In keeping with the latest trend -snacks that come in smaller, almost bite-sized portions - Popsicle is rolling out a new version called Oreo Snackwiches, which are roughly the size of a regular Oreo cookie. **********Meanwhile, Popsicle is still playing catch-up in the frozen fruit and juice bar segment. Several years after Dole and smaller companies turned froen fruits into one of the fastest-growing parts of the business, Popsicle this summer will test-market its own version, called Fruitsicle, and is expected to offer the brand nationally next year. **********The strategic shifts have not gone without some glitches. The company has portrayed its restructuring to retailers as the equivalent of a new-product start, and just as with a new product, Popsicle is having trouble getting the amount of space it wants in supermarket freezers already overflowing with competing brands. Sales Force Cited **********Some retailers also complain that Popsicle's new sales force has been slow to get up to speed. ''I've never seen or heard from anybody from that company,'' said a buyer for one major supermarket chain. **********The strategy's success will not be determined until after the prime summer selling season is in full swing, but Mr. Walters said that, despite the shelf space problems, the early indications were that the products were selling well. ''We're slower getting to the shelf than we'd like, but once we're there we're selling better than we expected,'' he said. **********The company's future may rest on its ability to rejuvenate its familiar brand names. A new television commercial seeks to transfer the nostalgia that they evoke among adults to a new generation by showing a father bringing his young son to the store where he always bought a Popsicle. **********''They're household words,'' Mr. Walters said of the Popsicle, Fudgsicle and Creamsicle. ''We have to make those trademarks a part of today's vernacular.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/15/business/consumer-debt-rise-is-slowed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 184, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Consumer Debt Rise Is Slowed", "print_headline": "Consumer Debt Rise Is Slowed", "body_text": " **********Americans took on $4.97 billion more in consumer debt than they paid off in February, the smallest monthly increase in eight months, the Government reported today. **********The Federal Reserve Board said consumer debt grew at an annual rate of 11 percent in February, compared with a 17.2 percent rate in January, when debt increased by $7.66 billion. **********The big change was a 39 percent fall in auto loans in February, as auto makers curtailed their financing incentive programs. **********In February, auto loans grew by $2.54 billion, an annual rate rise of 14.4 percent, compared with a January increase of $4.18 billion, an annual rate rise of 24.3 percent. **********The report also said that cash loans from banks and other short- and medium-term personal debt rose $1.21 billion in February, down from a January increase of $2.18 billion. **********Revolving debt, including credit card debt, rose by $1.04 billion in February, down slightly from $1.39 billion in January. **********The various changes put total consumer debt at $547.73 billion at the end of February."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/world/the-new-global-top-banker-tokyo-and-its-mighty-money.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Chira", "pub_date": "1986-04-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1616, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Series", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE NEW GLOBAL TOP BANKER: TOKYO AND ITS MIGHTY MONEY", "print_headline": "THE NEW GLOBAL TOP BANKER: TOKYO AND ITS MIGHTY MONEY", "body_text": " **********Long famous for its prowess in exporting everything from cars to computers, Japan has now become the premier supplier of a new export: money. **********In the last two years, fueled by profits from exports and huge pools of domestic savings, money has been flowing out of Japan to the rest of the world, through investments ranging from automobile plants in Michigan to United States Treasury bonds to loans for oil development in the South China Sea. **********Moreover, as Japan's power as a capital exporter has grown, so have the influence and ambition of the nation's financial institutions - and their ability to challenge American and European competitors. Japan's banks and securities houses, now among the world's largest and most creditworthy, have stepped up their overseas activities, lending money to a wide range of development projects, buying foreign financial institutions and pushing to expand their share in such competitive arenas as the Euromarkets, the London-based hub of international finance. **********Noting Japan's prominence as a capital exporter, many economists say they see a new era coming in which Japan will exercise much of the influence on the world economy that Britain and the United States wielded over the past century. **********A Topic at the Summit **********This shift will be much on the minds of the leaders of the United States, France, West Germany, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada as they start their economic summit meeting in Tokyo on May 4. **********Historically a creditor nation has led growth in each period of global economic expansion, and Japan's era is just arriving, said Kiyokiho Fukushima, a senior economist with the Nomura Research Institute. He and other economists predict that Japan's capital exports will spur world economic growth, keep world interest rates low and create employment. **********But economists also note potential problems. A great deal of this money is flowing to the United States and Europe, and economists doubt that Japan will be as eager as past creditor nations to lend money to developing countries. The majority of Japanese investment has been in securities, and these economists point to a risk that investors could quickly sell these holdings, causing disruptions such as higher interest rates. And they question whether Japan is willing to assume the leadership made possible by its economic might. Capital Outflow Skyrockets **********Japan's emergence as a leading capital exporter is relatively recent. In 1983, the net outflow of Japanese capital - when the amount of money leaving Japan is greater than the amount of money coming in - was $17.7 billion, according to the Bank of Japan. That figure skyrocketed to $49.7 billion in 1984, and surged again to $64.5 billion last year, when Japan surpassed Britain to become the world's largest net creditor nation. So far this year, the money has continued to flow overseas, at the rate of about $7 billion a month. **********Japanese banks are putting up money for projects around the globe, from the proposed tunnel under the English Channel to iron ore mining in Brazil. In the United States alone, Japanese investment includes loans to local governments, a chopstick factory in Hibbing, Minn., and the purchase last year of an estimated one-quarter of all the bonds issued by the United States Treasury. **********Where Japanese money is, Japanese banks and securities houses are not far behind. They can draw upon formidable advantages in competing with American and European banks. For one, they are flush with the same huge pool of savings that is behind Japan's emergence as a capital exporter. Last year, the average total savings of Japanese households exceeded the average annual income for the first time. Advantages of Japanese Banks **********These savings have helped make Japanese banks among the wealthiest. The banks are among the most highly rated by investor services such as Moody's or Standard & Poor's, enabling them to raise money at lower costs. Japanese banks and securities houses can also take advantage of Japan's low interest rates to raise money cheaply, allowing them to offer extremely competitive rates to clients. **********Armed with these advantages, and lured by the broader opportunities for profit in less-regulated markets overseas, Japanese financial institutions are charging abroad and proving to be fierce competitors. **********American and European banks have already felt their sting in the Euromarkets, where Japanese institutions want to expand their share of bond underwriting. As of April 11, Nomura Securities ranked third in the amount of Eurobonds it underwrote, surpassed only by Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse First Boston but ahead of Salomon Brothers, Union Bank of Switzerland, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, according to the trade publication International Financing Review. **********Some of their competitors have complained that the deals Japanese institutions were offering were priced far below market rates and expressed concern that firms were willing to suffer losses in order to win market share. Masaaki Furukawa, a managing director of Nomura Securities, shrugged off such complaints. ''We have never criticized our friends when they snatched away a deal - we admired them,'' he said. Overseas Expansion Expected **********Officials at several banks and securities houses said they hoped to expand their overseas activities considerably. According to the Bank for International Settlements, Japanese banks now rank first among the world's banks in foreign assets; several Japanese banks have already purchased stakes in foreign financial institutions. When asked where Nomura was planning to expand, Mr. Furukawa smiled and said, ''Anyplace in the world.'' **********''Their foreign competitors do not take such ambitions lightly,'' said Neil P. Benedict, a director of Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. ''They are going to be very tough competitors, no doubt about it. They're much more innovative than they were, and we see them time and time again coming up with new ideas and new instruments.'' **********The United States is a key destination for Japanese financial institutions. The banks, securities firms, pension funds and treasurers of Japan's cash-rich corporations have generally chosen to concentrate their investments in securities rather than direct investments such as factories. **********Out of the total of $81.8 billion that Japanese invested abroad last year, $53.5 billion went to buy bonds, particularly United States Treasury bonds; $10.4 billion was in the form of loans and $6.5 billion was invested directly. Country breakdowns for 1985 have not yet been tabulated, but in 1984, out of a total of $56.8 billion that Japanese invested abroad, $15.4 billion went to the United States, $14.3 billion went to countries of the European Community and $9.7 billion was invested largely in developing nations. Some Disturbing Trends **********Japanese investments have created jobs, helped finance the United States budget deficit and helped reduce inflation. But monetary authorities here also point to some disturbing trends -what they believe is an overconcentration of investment in the United States and in securities rather than direct investment. **********Toyoo Gyohten, Director General of the Ministry of Finance's International Finance Bureau, said: ''I strongly believe that there should be greater progress made in the area of direct investment. Such investment could help developing nations by providing them assistance without swelling their debts and by offering them management skills, new technology and jobs.'' **********Mr. Gyohten said April figures indicated that the stronger yen, narrower differentials in interest rates and high bond prices had begun to move investors away from securities. Some money might flow back to Japan, but several economists predicted that Japanese investors would merely place more emphasis on foreign real estate and purchases of foreign companies, particularly those with advanced technology. Money and the Third World **********Japanese officials are also concerned about another tendency of Japanese capital investment - toward the United States and away from developing countries. **********''I am not entirely happy with the concentration of capital flows to the United States,'' said Shijuro Ogata, the Bank of Japan's deputy governor for international relations. ''It has a positive impact - financing the deficit and alleviating interest rates - but if you look around the world there are many more needy countries.'' **********Japanese banks and securities houses, however, show scant desire to follow the example of American banks by investing in countries with higher risks. When asked, officials at several banks and securities firms said such lending was the primary responsibility of the Japanese Government or international organizations. **********Nobuyuki Ueda, an economist with the Long-Term Credit Bank, echoed the views of others that the United States, by virtue of its strong economy and creditworthiness, would remain very attractive to Japanese investors. ''Japanese companies are conservative and cautious about increasing their investment in development nations that have high risks,'' he said. **********For some in Japan, the issue of third world lending raises the broader question of Japan's leadership as the world's premier creditor. A Reluctance to Lead **********''There is a persistent reluctance to take the leadership role,'' Mr. Ogata said. ''We are trained not to take the initiative in international situations.'' **********The problem is likely to persist for some time. Although some economists such as Mr. Ueda are predicting that capital flows will slow slightly over the next year because of the stronger yen and narrower interest rate differentials, they are unanimous in their belief that Japan's surpluses will not disappear. The Nomura Research Institute predicts that by 1995, Japan's gross overseas assets will exceed $1 trillion. **********''Savings are a scarce commodity in the world economy, and somebody must save for other nations,'' said Saburo Okita, a former Foreign Minister and Government adviser. ''The question is how to make the best use of Japanese savings for global development.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/business/noranda-charge.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 70, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Noranda Charge", "print_headline": "Noranda Charge", "body_text": " **********Noranda Inc. said it planned to make an after-tax provision of $185 million against fourth-quarter results due to the reduction of values caused by depressed business conditions for North American mineral industries.

It cost $5,000 to build, but before the house was even finished he accepted a $7,300 offer for it. **********The next year, Mr. Campeau built 250 houses in Ottawa, the first of more than 20,000 he would erect in Canada's capital. By 1977, homebuilding seemed small potatoes, and he abandoned the business in favor of his growing commercial and industrial development interests. **********Today, he heads a real estate empire with assets of $2.4 billion (Canadian). He has become one of Canada's most prominent corporate leaders through his 55 percent ownership and 85 percent voting control of the Campeau Corporation. Mr. Campeau says he is Canada's most active builder, measured in dollars. **********It has not always been easy. Mr. Campeau had to fight Canada's old-guard English establishment to win his present position as one of Canada's two most powerful French-speaking businessmen, along with Paul Desmarais of Montreal's Power Corporation. He does not forget that Toronto's corporate leaders ganged up to prevent him from taking over Royal Trustco, one of Canada's premier financial institutions, in 1980. **********But he can afford not to dwell on it. His skiing buddy is Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the elegant former Prime Minister; his cuff links are diamond, and his dark-paneled library houses leatherbound Balzac in French and Shakespeare in English. He built a grand home precisely modeled after a Norman mansion, and furnished with exquisite 18th-century French antiques. His Chosen Vehicle **********And that may be just the beginning of Mr. Campeau's climb. He now has his sights set on broad penetration of the lucrative American commercial real estate market. Allied is his chosen vehicle. When warrants and convertible preferred shares are added to the $2.47 billion of common stock, the price tag comes to $3.11 billion, Mr. Campeau said. **********''Over the next 10 years, we will develop and acquire a lot of shopping centers in the United States,'' the elegantly tailored French Canadian said in a weekend interview. **********Allied, despite its ownership of such prestige stores as Brooks Brothers, has what Mr. Campeau considers only a ''good'' rate of return. What is important in the proposed acquisition, he said, is that it ''would plug us in right across the United States into the retail real estate market,'' at a time other development sectors, such as offices, are flat. **********With Allied, Mr. Campeau would begin shopping center projects with assured quality tenants. At a time population growth in Canada has stopped, he sees the opportunity to build millions of square feet of retail space in all regions of the United States. **********But the offer, to which Mr. Campeau wants a response by Thursday, faces obstacles, chiefly a common view that it is too low. Mr. Campeau bridles at the suggestions. **********''We're not stealing it,'' he insisted. ''We're paying for it, by any means.'' Analysts Question Offer **********Some analysts, however, have even questioned whether Campeau can pay what is viewed as a relatively cheap price, much less triumph in an expected bidding war. For this reason, Harry Rannala, senior vice president of Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., said he was ''flabbergasted'' by the offer. **********He and other analysts suggest that Campeau may be required to sell Allied's real estate to diminish the big debt arising from acquiring the retailer. Under this scenario, Campeau would continue to operate Allied's stores in leased premises. Alternatively, it might keep the real estate and sell the businesses, perhaps to Allied's present management. **********Mr. Campeau will not comment on such specifics, other than to say his management's expertise is not in selling corsets. He does suggest that Allied's present real estate is ''not worth much.'' What is valuable for the future, he says, is Allied's involvement in 46 states. **********Among publicly traded Canadian real estate companies, Campeau trails only Cadillac Fairview and Trizac, each controlled by a different branch of the wealthy Bronfman family, in size. Olympia & York, privately held by Toronto's Reichmann family, is biggest. **********The city of Ottawa, in particular, bears the stamp of Campeau, which built one of every five houses there and owns as much as 40 percent of the office space rented by the federal Government. **********''The skyline of our nation's capital is mostly Campeau's skyline,'' Diane Francis wrote in a new book, ''Controlling Interest: Who Controls Canada?'' Mrs. Francis and others have suggested that a large component of Mr. Campeau's success has been his political adroitness in capitalizing on friendships with Mr. Trudeau and others. The recurrent allegation has been that Campeau's rents, for some reason, are too high. ''He has turned politics into tremendous profits,'' she said. **********Last year, a parliamentary committee said, ''The appearance of favoritism to one contractor for government services is a serious concern,'' alluding to Campeau. Charges Rejected **********Mr. Campeau rejects the charges, saying he never used his friendship with Mr. Trudeau - or his developing relationship with the current Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney - for business purposes. He says his governmental transactions were all ''arms-length,'' pointing out that buildings constructed by the Government for itself cost it as much as 50 percent more than those he has rented to it. **********The Allied pursuit is Mr. Campeau's first major acquisition adventure since he went after Royal Trustco Ltd. in November 1980. His $450 million bid is said to have been unsuccessful largely because of resistance to the scrappy French Canadian upstart Mr. Campeau was perceived as being. Canada's biggest companies, which held the majority share of the blue-chip trust company, simply refused to sell to him. **********Relaxing on the terrace overlooking his garden, Mr. Campeau minimized the anti-French aspects of the fight, although he continues to believe that was a factor. **********Mr. Campeau was hardly intimidated. In 1983, he moved his head office from Ottawa to Toronto's Bay Street, Canada's equivalent of Wall Street. He also built Toronto's biggest house on the city's exclusive Bridal Path - 11,000 square feet of living space. More than 300 guests can sit down for dinner when the indoor pool is covered over. **********In addition to skiing, Mr. Campeau swims a mile and a half most days in the pool. Widowed, he is married to Ilse, his second wife, and has a total of six children. **********Meanwhile, Mr. Campeau has moved to streamline his company. For instance, he has been trying to sell unproductive assets, chiefly apartments under rent control. But these have been difficult to sell, and Campeau now owns around $500 million of unwanted properties. **********Even sales of various high-technology companies Campeau purchased in the early 1980's have not appreciably improved the company's highly leveraged balance sheet. **********This difficulty is exacerbated by the company's active office building program, at a time when this is the weakest sector in the development industry. It is building two major office buildings in Toronto and one in San Francisco at a time both cities have high vacancy rates. **********Merrill Lynch's Mr. Ranalla points out that, when Campeau unsuccessfully bid for Royal Trustco, its balance sheet was in considerably better shape than now. **********Mr. Campeau strongly disagrees. He says Campeau will pay $800 million, and possibly as much as $1.1 billion, in cash and notes toward the $3.11 billion acquisition. The remainder of the debt, he said, can be easily financed from the combined cash flow of Campeau and Allied.

The other two were given prison terms of 24 years and 15 years. Life Terms for 3 Fugitives **********The jury, however, ordered life sentences for three fugitives - the Palestinian leader Mohammed Abbas and two associates - who were tried in absentia and whom Italian officials acknowledge they are unlikely to apprehend. All were convicted for their role in organizing the hijacking. **********The defendants in custody are expected to appeal their sentences. Under Italian law, people convicted of terrorist crimes are not subject to early release. **********In New York, Mr. Klinghoffer's daughters expressed outrage at Mr. Molqi's sentence and called on President Reagan to extradite the Palestinians to the United States to stand trial for murder. **********The verdicts today involved a total of 15 defendants in the Achille Lauro hijacking, 5 of whom are in custody. Called 'Soldiers' With Ideals **********While generally adhering to the prosecution's view of the facts of the case, the jury also appeared to accept defense arguments that some of the Palestinians were ''soldiers fighting for their ideals'' rather than terrorists. **********Six of the 15 defendants were convicted of terrorist crimes; 5 others were found guilty of lesser crimes. Four defendants were acquitted of all charges. **********The jury indicated that Mr. Molqi and two of his three co-defendants - a fourth hijacker is to be tried separately as a minor - were given the lesser sentences because of what were called attenuating circumstances. **********The presiding judge, Lino Monteverde, said one of the important attenuating circumstances was that ''they have grown up in the tragic conditions that the Palestinian people live through.'' **********He also noted that Mr. Molqi cooperated with the prosecution for a time, although he disavowed his original murder confession in open court. Before the trial, Mr. Molqi signed a confession admitting that he had selected Mr. Klinghoffer for death and then had coldly killed him in his wheelchair. **********Mr. Molqi and his three co-defendants were arrested in Sicily on Oct. 10 after an Egyptair jetliner carrying them from Cairo was forced to land by United States Navy planes. Italy Had Freed Abbas **********Also aboard the jetliner on Oct. 10 was Mr. Abbas, chief of a small faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization, but he was later freed by the Italian authorities over the protests of the Reagan Administration. An international arrest warrant subsequently was issued for Mr. Abbas after the magistrates in Genoa determined he was the mastermind of the operation. **********At the end of the three-week trial here, attorneys on all sides of the case agreed that the jury's findings were likely to prove controversial. The findings included both what legal experts here called unprecedented legal decisions and sensitive political judgments on the Palestinian cause. **********During the trial, Judge Monteverde made a point of asking each of the five defendants in custody whether they had lived in refugee camps and whether any of their relatives had died in mass killings or battles. **********Another of the hijackers, Abdelatif Ibrahim Fatatier, was sentenced to 24 years and two months in prison. Ahmad Maruf al-Assadi, who fully cooperated with the prosecution, received a 15-year term. Called 'Selfish Political Act' **********Judge Monteverde told reporters that Mr. Abbas and his colleagues from a small guerrilla group, the Palestine Liberation Front, were given the full sentences for their crimes because they conceived the hijacking as ''a selfish political act'' that was designed ''to weaken the leadership of Yasir Arafat,'' chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. **********The jury, Judge Monteverde said, accepted the view of both the prosecution and the Italian Government that Mr. Arafat did not know about the hijacking plan, which was meant to help thwart his efforts to formulate a joint peace intiative with King Hussein of Jordan. **********Mr. Abbas and his deputies, Ozzudin Badratkan and Ziad el-Omar, were ''not acting for patriotic motives,'' Judge Monteverde said. Aside from Mr. Molqi, who was identified as shipboard commander of the hijackers, all the others involved in the operation were duped into thinking its real aim was to attack the Israeli port of Ashdod. **********The trial prosecutor, Luigi Carli, had asked the jury for life sentences against seven defendants, but on this score and on other important points the jury took its own course. Jury of 2 Judges and 6 Others **********Under Italian criminal law, a jury of six laypeople and two judges both determines guilt or innocence and issues sentences. After 70 hours of deliberation, the Achille Lauro jury reached findings that are likely to have an important impact on future trials here involving terrorist crimes. **********The chief accusation against 12 of the defendants was made under a special anti-terrorism law enacted in 1978 that classifies terrorist kidnappings as a crime against the state. The law allows for life sentences against those guilty of a terrorist kidnapping that ends in the killing of one or more victims. **********Mr. Klinghoffer's killing on Oct. 8 when the ship was off the Syrian coast came under this provision of the law rather than as separate charge of homicide. **********The jury found Mr. Abbas, his two deputies and three hijackers guilty under the terrorist kidnapping law. But in a ruling that appeared certain to be the subject of appeals from prosecution and defense, the jury acquitted all the defendants on charges under another important anti-terrorism law. 'Armed Band' Charge Rejected **********Those rejected charges were that the defendants had formed an ''armed band.'' This is a kind of conspiracy charge often used in terrorism and Mafia cases against those accused of organizing to commit a crime. **********In May, arrest warrants on ''armed band'' charges were issued by Rome magistrates against 14 people accused of various terrorist acts reportedly carried out by the Abu Nidal organization, including the attack on the Rome airport on Dec. 27. The charge could be used in a trial to show that although the defendants were involved in several different crimes, they were all part of the same terrorist group. **********Judge Monteverde said Mr. Abbas's faction of the Palestine Liberation Front was not considered an armed band because the hijacking was only a single act and did not reflect ''the reasons for its existence as an organization,'' which he described as ''the restoration of a homeland to the Palestinian people.'' KLINGHOFFERS OUTRAGED **********The daughters of Leon Klinghoffer said in New York yesterday that they were outraged that their father's convicted killer was not sentenced to life in prison. **********Ilsa, 28, and Lisa Klinghoffer, 35, called on President Reagan to extradite the Palestinian terrorists convicted of the hijacking to the United States to stand trial here for murder. **********''An opportunity has been lost to deliver a clear message to terrorists everywhere that barbaric, criminal acts in the guise of political activism will no longer be tolerated,'' Ilsa Klinghoffer said at a news conference several hours after the verdict was announced in Genoa. **********The Klinghoffer sisters said they were considering appealing the Italian verdicts to seek the maximum sentence for all 15 defendants in addition to seeking the extradition. **********''It's not over yet,'' said Lisa Klinghoffer. ''We call on our President to deliver that message. His courageous initiative in attempting to capture these men and bring them to trial in the U.S. must now be pursued through extradition.'' STATE DEPARTMENT COMMENTS **********WASHINGTON, July 10 (AP) - The State Department spokesman, Bernard Kalb, said today of the Genoa verdict that ''the United States is pleased that persons responsible for the death of an American citizen and injury and damages to others have been convicted.'' **********He added, ''We regret that the murder of Leon Klinghoffer was not treated more severely.'' **********Mr. Kalb also said the United States ''reserved its legal right to seek extradition of the hijackers once all Italian legal proceedings, including appeals, are ended.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/15/world/thatcher-backs-aide-accused-in-parliament.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Lelyveld", "pub_date": "1986-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THATCHER BACKS AIDE ACCUSED IN PARLIAMENT", "print_headline": "THATCHER BACKS AIDE ACCUSED IN PARLIAMENT", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, facing what is rapidly developing into her most severe political test since the Falkland War, rallied today to the defense of a key member of her Cabinet, who is accused of misleading the House of Commons. **********The Cabinet member, Leon Brittan, the Secretary for Trade and Industries, was already at the center of a furious controversy within the governing party over the future of a nearly bankrupt helicopter company when he stumbled into further trouble on Monday. **********He was forced to go before the House late Monday night to offer an explanation and apology for failing to acknowledge his awareness of a letter that had been the subject of three parliamentary questions in the afternoon. **********The letter had to do with the controversy over the Westland helicopter company, which led last week to the theatrical resignation of Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine, who walked out of the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence. **********Charge by Heseltine **********But even more it had to do with Mr. Heseltine's charge that Mr. Brittan -and, by extension, Mrs. Thatcher -had been giving behind-the-scenes backing to one of two multinational consortiums competing for a stake in the company while publicly proclaiming the Government's neutrality. **********Senior members of the Conservative Party were reported to be saying in private today that Mr. Brittan might have to resign, but an official close to the Prime Minister said that that feeling had not been communicated to the Prime Minister and that she had no intention of asking for his resignation. **********On Monday afternoon, Mr. Brittan repeated his theme that the Government was not taking a side in the Westland fight and proceeded to give the House of Commons his own version of a conversation he had had with the chief executive of British Aerospace, one of five companies in the consortium Mr. Heseltine backed in the Westland controversy. **********It was then that he was asked for the first time whether the Government had received a letter from British Aerospace. The question came from Mr. Heseltine himself, speaking for the first time as a backbencher, and it was seen by Tories loyal to Mrs. Thatcher as a parliamentary ambush. **********A trial lawyer by training, Mr. Brittan responded to his former colleague with an answer that was correct as far as it went. ''I have not received any such letter,'' he said. **********Replying to another question, he said he was unaware of a letter to anyone in the Cabinet from Sir Raymond Lygo, the British Aerospace executive he had spoken to the evening before Mr. Heseltine resigned. **********That was also correct, but it soon developed that there was a letter. It had been sent to Mrs. Thatcher, not Mr. Brittan, and instead of being from Sir Raymond, it was from the British Aerospace chairman, Sir Austin Pearce. He had known of the letter, Mr. Brittan acknowledged to the House when he apologized, but had not felt free to mention it because it had been marked ''private and strictly confidential.'' **********The charge of misleading the House of Commons is regarded as serious,especially when there is already an air of political crisis. It is less serious than the charge of lying to the House, which led to the sensational resignation in 1963 of John Profumo, who falsely denied in the House of Commons that he had had a liaison with a call girl. Letter to Be Published **********The outcome for Mr. Brittan may turn on the contents of Sir Austin's letter. This afternoon, on the defensive as she has seldom been before a packed and excited House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher promised to seek permission from British Aerospace to make its contents known. **********''I do not accept he misled the House,'' she said of Mr. Brittan, who was sitting silently by her side on the Government's front bench. **********In offering his explanation Monday night, the minister had argued that it would have been a breach of confidentiality to disclose even the letter's existence. He said he was sorry if anyone concluded that his replies had been misleading. Unassuaged, opposition members cried for a full apology.'' **********The Prime Minister's office said this evening that the British Aerospace letter would be made public on Wednesday morning, along with a reply from Mrs. Thatcher, before the House of Commons convenes for a full-scale debate on the whole Westland affair and the circumstances leading up to Mr. Heseltine's resignation. **********If the letter bears out a version already provided by Mr. Heseltine of Mr. Brittan's conversation with Sir Raymond, there are bound to be renewed accusations that Mr. Brittan has misled the House. According to Mr. Heseltine, the Trade and Industries Minister had told the executive that the role his company was playing in the consortium of European companies was against the national interest and that British Aerospace should pull out of the Westland fight. **********Mr. Brittan has already denied in the House that he said anything about the company pulling out and only expressed concern that opposition to the rival bid, which involves United Technologies, the American conglomerate, might fuel protectionist sentiment in the United States if it was seen to be anti-American. The Issues Overlap **********For the moment, the controversy about Mr. Brittan's level of candor has pushed aside accusations by Mr. Heseltine that Mrs. Thatcher violated proper Cabinet procedures and Britain's unwritten constitution in her handling of the dispute over the helicopter company, just as those accusations pushed aside the debate about whether Britain's future in high technology industries depended on collaboration with Europe or America. **********The overlapping issues make it difficult for politicians and commentators to say what the incipient crisis is basically all about, but day by day it appears to achieve new momentum, with longstanding complaints about Mrs. Thatcher's leadership rising to the surface. According to an opinion poll published today, the Labor Party had surged ahead of the Conservatives for the first time in months even before the latest accusations were aired. **********While attention was focused on the political fight, the shareholders' meeting that is supposed to settle the Westland battle was postponed until Friday on the ground that a larger hall was needed. It is now due to be held in the Royal Albert Hall, which seats 4,000. **********The postponement coincided with renewed speculation bout a ''mystery buyer'' who, by paying a premium, has bought up 15 percent of the company's shares in two days. **********The buyer's purchases are being handled by the London stockbrokers firm of Rowe & Pitman, which represents Westland itself. It is presumed that the firm would not represent anyone likely to vote against the recommendations of the Westland board.

He said the European concerns about that meeting were focused on ''a certain denuclearization of Europe compared to the Eastern bloc, and a certain decoupling of Europe from the United States.'' **********The subject of arms control and East-West relations was formally omitted from the communique. Participants said a draft statement on the subject, detailing a unified European Community position, had been supported by most members but was put aside after objections were raised by Ireland, which unlike other members has a national policy of neutrality on the subject. **********Instead, the members' concern about not having been consulted on the sweeping disarmament proposals considered at Reykjavik was expressed in an informal press statement.

Solidarity with the Reagan Administration? one British official was asked. ''With the Western alliance,'' he replied. Joint Stand on Terrorism **********The nations' 22-page communique included four pages on methods for handling terrorism that ''must govern their common fight.'' These reflected only implicitly on President Reagan's controversial decision to deal privately with Iran while publicly enunciating an unyielding policy of opposition to terrorist hostage-taking. In the communique, the European nations vowed ''no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors.'' **********In promising more concerted action against terrorism, the European nations called for better methods of extradition and stronger safeguards against theft and forgery of passports and against abuse of the right of asylum. A study was announced on the diverse needs of strengthening frontier entry points while also encouraging freer travel within the community. **********Under the same theme of ''safeguarding the open society,'' the group also urged concerted action against drug abuse and for public health information programs on the threat of AIDS, the disease of the human immune system, and for proclaiming 1989 as European cancer information year. **********The 12 nations also issued a statement noting the approach of the seventh anniversary of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, urging Moscow to undertake ''rapid and complete withdrawal'' and to stop the ''massive suffering'' and violations of human rights. **********Some participants made a point of stressing that the European Community meeting went quite well in handling a broad range of issues and that it did so without being preoccupied by the problem in Washington. **********''Everyone recognizes the U.S. executive is weakened, although this is not being discussed,'' said Prime Minister Chirac."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/business/another-coup-for-the-fighting-gallos.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1986-07-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3499, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ANOTHER COUP FOR THE FIGHTING GALLOS", "print_headline": "ANOTHER COUP FOR THE FIGHTING GALLOS", "body_text": " **********BY now, almost everyone who watches television is familiar with Frank Bartles and Ed Jaymes, the lovable pair of geezers who hawk Bartles & Jaymes wine cooler from their porch. ''Ed took out a second  [ mortgage ]  on his house, wrote to Harvard for an M.B.A., and now we're preparing to enter the wine-cooler business,'' intoned Frank in the first of a series of more than 30 commercials that always end with him humbly thanking the viewers for their support. **********But don't let commercials fool you. Frank and Ed are fictional characters portrayed by novice actors. The two people really behind Bartles & Jaymes are not innocent rubes, but two of the shrewdest, most aggressive, most secretive and most feared men in the wine business - Ernest and Julio Gallo. **********And with one-year old Bartles & Jaymes, the Gallo brothers have stormed into first place in the booming wine cooler business, one of the few bright spots in an industry suffering from flat sales. That coup, which reversed a two-year decline in sales for Gallo, was only the latest of the remarkable string of successes that allowed the E.&J. Gallo winery to grow from a shed in the Great Depression into the world's largest winery. And the cooler's success has left its stunned competitors gaping in awe. **********''The Germans did it in World War II; it's called a blitzkrieg,'' said R. Stuart Bewley, the co-founder and president of California Cooler, which started the wine cooler craze in 1981 and until six months ago, was the leading seller. **********Key to Bartles & Jaymes's success - indeed, the winery's success - are Ernest and Julio Gallo, who have perfected a system of clever advertising, adroit product positioning and brute-force sales and marketing, backed up by the most vertically integrated and efficient production process in the industry. **********Sons of an immigrant from Italy's wine-producing region, the brothers started in business at the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 with $5,900 and a recipe for wine-making borrowed from a Modesto Public Library pamphlet. Today, they run the winery with an iron grip, even though Ernest, considered the ultimate authority, is 77 and Julio, 76. They are so dominant in the company, in fact, that a major question is what will happen after they retire or pass away. **********''That's the biggest question in the whole industry,'' said Ed Everett, a wine columnist and consultant. ''A lot of people feel there's no replacement for either one of them.'' The brothers will not talk to the press about this - or indeed, about anything. **********Their stamp on the company is unquestionable. No batch of wine leaves the premises without being tasted by Julio. No commercial is aired without Ernest passing on it. Ernest makes unannounced visits to supermarkets and liquor stores to make sure that Gallo wines are prominently displayed. Julio is known to fly over vineyards in a helicopter to check on the quality of the grapes. **********By keeping such close control, the brothers have created a family-owned winery that produces a remarkable 25 percent of all the wine drunk in the United States - including imports - and about 40 percent of all the wine made in California. Total sales are estimated at $650 million to $1 billion. And its top-sellers are all over liquor-store shelves. **********In addition to ranking No. 1 in wine coolers, its E & J Brandy is the best-selling brandy in the country. Its Andre champagne, available for $2 a bottle, is the best-selling sparkling wine. It is also the leading supplier of low-priced flavored wines sold under names such as Thunderbird and Boone's Farm. Its main sales, however, are inexpensive table wines, normally sold in 1.5 liter jugs with aluminum caps. Its Gallo brand is the nation's best-selling wine followed by its Carlo Rossi brand. Even in varietal wines, a more premium wine for which Gallo is not known, it sells more than anyone else. **********Despite such successes, the brothers have had to struggle to be taken seriously by wine connoisseurs who sniff at Gallo's reputation for low-priced wines. (See box.) At the sprawling complex here that looks more like a refinery than a vineyard, the brothers share managerial duties as they share ownership. Julio handles grape-growing, purchasing and wine production. Ernest handles sales and marketing. The two sides of the operation are run almost like separate companies, former employees say. Julio and his staff occupy the first floor of the company's two story administrative building and Ernest and his staff the second, and the two staffs are not supposed to talk directly to one another. **********Ernest Gallo's fierce and combative personality has defined how the world views Gallo. While he does have a sense of humor, former insiders say, he is generally tempermental, secretive and suspicious of outsiders. ''Ernest has a way of talking. If you ask him a question he answers with a question,'' says one. **********He demands perfection from those around him. One story told is that Ernest was having lunch with top executives at a Modesto restaurant and felt he was not served fast enough. The whole table immediately left the restaurant, their meals uneaten, never to patronize the restaurant again. Mr. Gallo also demands absolute loyalty. A few months ago, Ernest got wind that two long-time Gallo executives had discussed joining another winery. He fired them on the spot, even though one was the son of the man who served as Ernest's right hand man for 30 years. **********The story of the Gallo family - another subject about which the brothers maintain a public silence - is a rich and sometimes tragic one. Their father, Joseph, bought a 230-acre vineyard in Modesto after immigrating from Italy. Their maternal grandparents also owned a California vineyard. In 1933, just before the brothers started in the wine business, their father shot their mother to death and killed himself, apparently because of a setback in business, former company officials say. **********The Gallos rarely give interviews or make speeches. Ernest Gallo agreed to be interviewed for an oral history of the wine industry done by the University of California at Berkeley only if the contents of the interview were sealed until 1995. The winery offers no tours to the public, unlike virtually all other wineries. ERNEST and Julio are said by people in the industry to still be in fairly good health and report for work daily. But both now are hard of hearing and sources close to Gallo say Julio experiences pain in his hands and is less vigorous than he was. Retirement doesn't seem likely. ''They are not going to retire,'' said one former executive. ''They are going to carry Ernest out of there.'' Said another: ''I suppose if you'd ask Ernest, he'd say he's not going.'' **********Still, it is clear that the Gallos have been preparing for their leaving. Companies such as Seagram and Tenneco considered buying Gallo in the late 1960's and 1970's, but Ernest and Julio were not interested. **********As early as 1978, the Gallos lobbied for - and won - a change in the Federal estate tax laws, dubbed the ''Gallo amendment,'' that allows payments to be spread over a number of years, making it less likely that their descendants will have to sell stakes in the company to pay inheritance taxes. In Washington's current tax battle, the Gallos have surfaced again backing another so-called Gallo amendment that would help them pass on more after-tax money to their grandchildren. The measure is still under discussion. **********It is hard to predict what will happen after the founders pass on the reins, a tricky transition for any family-owned company. Industry executives and former officials say the winery is so much larger than its competitors and has such strength throughout its product line that it will not suffer dramatically. But over time, some say, it could come to miss Ernest Gallo's marketing instincts and begin losing market share. **********Virtually everyone in the industry says that the Gallos will pass on the company to their sons to run. Ernest Gallo has two sons in the business, David, and Joseph, who are in their mid-to-late 40's. Julio has a son Robert, who is in his early 50's, and a son-in law, James Coleman. There are about 20 grandchildren and the oldest of them, including Robert Gallo's son John, now work in the winery as well. **********Still, while the sons and son-in-law are middle-aged, they have long been in the shadow of their domineering fathers. Up until a few years ago, Ernest would cut off his own sons when they talked in meetings, according to people who attended such meetings. Compounding the problems of succession, former insiders say, is that many of Ernest's and Julio's top aides are also in their sixties and seventies and likely to retire soon. **********Ernest's youngest son, Joseph, is considered the more likely son to replace his father. A graduate of Notre Dame and Stanford Business School, Joey, as he is called, is said to be just like his father: aggressive, impatient and demanding of perfection. ''He looks like his father and acts like him,'' said one industry executive and friend of Ernest. Still, he added, ''He's not Ernest. Nobody's Ernest.'' **********But while Joseph has been active in sales, he has not yet become heavily involved in marketing and advertising. His brother, David, has been working on that side of the businesss. **********Joseph Gallo is likely to split power with Robert Gallo, Julio's son, who now assists his father on the production side. Robert has become well known in the industry and often represents Gallo on industry councils. But Robert, who likes to drink his wine with ice, has not yet taken a liking to the wine tasting that is an important part of Julio's function. TO outsiders, these factors suggest that perhaps Gallo will be run in the future by a council of family members assisted by non-family members. Among the non-members who wield influence are Louis Friedman, a financial planner, and Peter Conway, a Procter & Gamble veteran who is in marketing. **********On the business side, the most immediate problem facing the new generation is likely to be America's apparent disenchantment with wine. After booming in the 1970's, overall wine sales fell flat in the early 1980's and dropped in 1984. Sales would have dropped 5.9 percent in 1985 as well, were it not for the popularity of wine coolers, a hybrid mixture of wine and juice, which helped the industry grow 4.7 percent over all, according to Impact, an industry newsletter. Already, wine coolers account for over 15 percent of wine industry sales. **********America's wine industry has been hurt by surging imports and a general drop in alcoholic beverage consumption. Low-priced California wines, Gallo's stronghold, have suffered most, as consumers migrated gradually to more premium wines or to imports that became cheaper as the dollar grew stronger. Imports accounted for 23.4 percent of wine consumed in the United States in 1985, up from 14 percent in 1975. **********The industrywide slump was felt at Gallo, whose sales started declining two years ago. But because of Bartles & Jaymes, Gallo had a sales rise in 1985 and will have another this year. The cooler helped push Gallo's total wine shipments up 7.4 percent in 1985, and they are up 19 percent so far this year over last year, according to San Francisco market researchers Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates. **********Gallo's cooler sales are expected to keep rising. While California Cooler led in sales in 1985, in the first quarter of 1986 Gallo outshipped Cooler, 2.3 million cases to 1.3 million cases, said Gomberg, Fredrikson. The triumph is psychologically all the more sweet because Gallo's last major new product, Polo Brindisi, did not do well. **********In conquering the cooler market, Gallo used a tactic that worked well with its Sangria and Carlo Rossi wines - using commercials featuring folksy winemakers. To convince retailers to carry their cooler, Gallo salemen carried video machines to show tapes of the upcoming commercials. But Gallo also positioned its product well. Bartles & Jaymes is a clear liquid sold in sleek bottles appealing to people over 30, an older audience than California Cooler's. **********Gallo also benefited from the fact that California Cooler was a new company with an inexperienced sales force, and that it erred by not offering special discounts to chain stores. **********The battle is not over yet. In 1985, California Cooler was bought by Brown-Forman, known for Jack Daniels bourbon. Brown-Forman will give California Cooler new financial muscle. The cooler has unveiled a new ad campaign featuring 60's rock music and portraying itself as the original cooler. It has introduced a variety of flavors, as opposed to only one for Bartles & Jaymes. SOME analysts say both products are likely to prosper, appealing to different age groups. The main question is whether coolers will be a fad. Most analysts think not, but it remains to be seen. **********The overall downward trend in industrywide sales may reverse itself because of the weakening of the dollar and some incidents of contamination of foreign wine. Still, many in the industry feel the trend is downward. Indeed, Gallo and several major wineries are arguing this case in negotiations that are just beginning with winery workers. The wineries want workers to accept pay cuts. **********If wine sales do not rise, Gallo will have to find new products - like the wine cooler - or take market share from competitors. **********Gallo is a tough competitor. Ask Coca-Cola, which entered the wine business in 1977 and hoped to challenge Gallo with massive advertising and low prices. Gallo stepped up its own discounting and advertising and by 1983, Coke sold out to Seagram. **********''They made the business highly unprofitable for Coke,'' said Emanuel Goldman, beverage industry analyst for Montgomery Securities. By the time Coke left the business, he said, the price war was so brutal that Coke was literally giving its wine away, issuing discount coupons to consumers that were worth more than the retail price of the wine. **********Gallo's main advantages against its competitors are its huge size and its vertical integration. It only grows about 5 percent of its grapes, but does almost everything else by itself. It makes bottles and aluminum caps, and sells caps to other wineries. To ship its wine, it set up Fairbanks Trucking, with more than 100 trucks. It also owns many of its distributors.  Many of these facilities are housed at headquarters here in Modesto, a city of about 125,000 in California's sweltering Central Valley. Peacocks - placed there by Bob Gallo - strut around the well-manicured lawn and front steps of the administration building. Nearby are research labs and row upon row of huge steel tanks that store wine and make the facility resemble a refinery. **********The company does not make wine in Modesto; Gallo only ages, stores and bottles it here. Huge facilities for crushing grapes and making wine are in Livingston, near Modesto, and in Fresno. It also owns the former Frei Brothers winery in Sonoma County. **********Gallo has more than 3,000 employees, including several hundred farmworkers, insiders estimate. While many production workers are unionized, Gallo has an anti-labor reputation stemming from the boycott in the 1970's by the United Farm Workers. Now, after a decade of litigation and contested elections, Gallo farm workers are not unionized. **********Its marketing and sales side is awesome, driven by Ernest. Gallo is notorious as one of the most difficult advertising agency clients because developing a successful campaign comes down to pleasing Ernest Gallo. More than a dozen agencies have worked for Gallo and been dismissed or quit since the 1950's. **********However, Hal Riney & Partners, formerly the San Francisco office of Ogilvy & Mather, has been in good graces for several years and now handles most of the ad budget, which is estimated at more than $35 million a year, about $20 million of that for Bartles & Jaymes. Mr. Riney created the Bartles & Jaymes ads, and dug up Dave Rufkahr, an Oregon farmer, and Richard Maugg, a Californian contractor, to play Frank and Ed. **********To Ernest Gallo, good position on the retail shelf is of the utmost importance. ''Ernest believes in total merchandising,'' said Legh Knowles, chairman of Beaulieu Vineyards, who is an admirer and former employee of the Gallos. ''That mean when you walk into a store, there wouldn't be any meat or tomatos, just all Gallo.'' **********Sometimes Gallo has been too aggressive. In 1976, it signed a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in which it agreed not to pressure its wholesalers. But the order was rescinded in 1983. **********The Gallos' aggressiveness extends to their own family. Recently the Gallo winery sued Ernest and Julio's younger brother, Joseph, a wealthy California rancher. The winery said he was infringing on the Gallo trademark by marketing ''Joseph Gallo cheese.'' While the winery said there was nothing personal about the suit, sources close to the family say Joseph Gallo seems to feel otherwise. **********The Gallos can be good employers, paying well above industry norms. Several key executives who have been at the winery for decades have been rewarded with equity positions in Gallo-owned distributors, but not in the winery itself. Many other executives have left, however, either because they were lured elsewhere by companies anxious to tap the Gallo expertise or because they could not get along with the Gallos. **********After their long and successful career, Ernest and Julio Gallo have amassed a fortune. Forbes magazine estimates that their joint net worth exceeds $600 million. But they do not flaunt their wealth. Ernest still drives an early 1970's Cadillac. **********The Gallos give millions to charities. Yet they do not actively participate in Modesto civic affairs and will not give a cent to something they don't believe in. Last year, the Modesto Chamber of Commerce kicked Gallo out because the winery would not increase its annual dues contribution above $1,000. AT THE WINERYTRYING TO GET A LITTLE RESPECT **********SAN FRANCISCO Despite their successes, the one thing the Gallos still have not earned is the respect of many of the nation's wine lovers. **********The company has prospered by producing inexpensive wine of consistent quality using advanced technology. Experts say it has done more than anyone to popularize wine and to raise the quality of Calfornia wine making with its technological improvements. But many wine connoisseurs would not be caught dead serving Gallo because of the company's reputation for making cheap wine. **********Gallo has been trying to change that for 20 years. Part of this drive is to follow consumer tastes for premium wines. But the drive is also a search for respect. ''I'm sure it bugs them that people don't respect them as much as they should,'' said Legh Knowles, chairman of Beaulieu Vineyards. **********To help, in the 1960's Gallo offered cash incentives to get growers to grow better grapes. Around 1970, although it was already selling Andre champagne, Gallo came out with a champagne under its own name, hoping the image of champagne would rub off on the winery. But it worked the other way. The champagne fizzled in the market. In 1974, Gallo introduced a line of premium varietal wines, in bottles with corks. Varietals, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, are made mainly from a single type of grape and named after that grape. By contrast, most of Gallo's wines, such as its Hearty Burgundy, are made from blends of different kinds of grapes. Although the 1974 effort flubbed, Gallo tried again a few years ago, giving in to the industry practice of vintage dating some wines. Gallo has always tried for consistent quality, but many wine buffs prefer the variations that occur year to year. **********This time, Gallo seems to be succeeding fairly well. Its varietals' sales were 2.3 million cases in 1985, more than any other vineyard's, says Impact, the industry newsletter. That is partly because some of the varietals are sold in jugs, but even the more expensive wines - like the 1978 Cabernet Sauvignon, priced at about $6 to $8 a bottle - are doing well. That wine has also won many awards. **********Gallo clearly could sell more premium wine under another name. But with the premiums, volume is not the issue: These are the wines that Ernest and Julio want to bear their family name when they are gone."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/02/business/finance-briefs-004786.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 113, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Arkla Inc. filed $300 million of debt securities. *********** Commercial Credit Corp. filed up to $750 million of unsecured debt. *********** Federal National Mortgage Association will announce the yield today on $1.9 billion of debentures - $700 million due Dec. 11, 1989; $600 million due Dec. 10, 1993, and $600 million due Dec. 10, 1996. *********** Finland is offering $100 million of 7.6 percent seven-year notes at par and $100 million of 7.8 percent 10-year notes at 99.79, to yield 7.83 percent, through First Boston.

NET FALLS 15.7% IN QUARTER", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation reported today that second-quarter earnings fell 15.7 percent, to $978 million, or $2.81 a share of common stock, compared with $1.16 billion, or $3.58 a share, in the 1985 period. Most analysts had expected the nation's largest automaker to earn about $3.10 a share. **********G.M.'s sales in the second quarter totaled $27.6 billion, up 10 percent from $25.1 billion in the 1985 period. The company said in a statement that earnings in its car and truck business had been hurt by ''the costs of extensive marketing campaign in the United States, the implementation of new technology designed to improve G.M.'s long-term global competitiveness and lower interest income.'' **********Meanwhile, the Chrysler Corporation reported second-quarter net income of $488.2 million, or $3.29 a share, down 18.1 percent from $596.4 million, or $3.35 a share, in the 1985 period. The results in the quarter included a one-time gain of 89 cents a share. Slump in Truck Sales **********Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, the nation's No. 3 auto maker, attributed the earnings decline to slumping truck sales as one of the company's major truck plants was being converted to produce a new model and to higher tax rates. **********In contrast to the year-to-year declines at G.M. and Chrysler, the Ford Motor Company is expected to report sharply higher profits when its earnings statement is released Thursday, analysts said. They said Ford was benefiting from higher production, the success of its Taurus-Sable midsize models and strong European earnings as a result of the weakening of the dollar. **********''Business is great, but G.M. and Chrysler are enjoying it less,'' observed Donald Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham. ''They are making good money on good volume, but the profits are not as good as in '84 and '85.'' G.M. Estimates to Be Reduced **********Some analysts said they would reduce their G.M. earnings estimates for the year as a result of the second-quarter performance. They said it was likely that the company would report an operating loss in the third quarter but that the earnings of its finance and other subsidiaries, particularly Hughes Aircraft and Electronic Data Systems, would keep the overall corporation in the black. G.M. said that those operations posted strong gains in the second quarter. **********''It is the same old story at G.M.,'' said Jean-Claude Gruet, an automotive analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ''They still don't have their costs under control. G.M. has the highest fixed and the highest variable costs in the domestic industry.'' General Motors **********Although G.M. has said it would be scaling back its capital spending program from about $10 billion to between $6 billion and $7 billion by the end of the decade, the company defended its huge investments in often balky new technology. **********''There's a critical balance between the needs of our current operations and the massive long-range investment that are imperative to retain our leadership position in the growing global marketplace,'' the company said in a statement. **********''Technology is moving so rapidly, particularly in electronics, that any organization in our industry that focuses only on short-term profits jeopardizes its competitiveness in the long run,'' the statement added. **********But Mr. Healy responded: ''The question is when the short run becomes the long run. G.M.'s margins have been deteriorating since the first quarter of 1984.'' He said it still appears that G.M.'s operating costs are higher than Ford's or Chrysler's. **********The company's operating income for the second quarter was $1.01 billion. G.M. does not separately state its earnings from its car and truck operations. Its operating income includes the earnings of its Electronic Data Systems and G.M. Hughes Electronics subsidiaries. **********G.M. said the performance of its subsidiaries with their own stock issues had improved in the quarter. Electronic Data Systems earnings were 51 cents a share of class E stock, compared with 35 cents a share a year earlier. G.M. Hughes Electronics had earnings of 76 cents a share of class H stock, compared with 46 cents a year earlier. G.M. allocates the earnings of these subsidiaries partly to the E and H stocks and the rest to G.M. common by a formula based on the extent of public ownership of the E and H stocks. **********G.M. also said that 32 cents a share of its common stock earnings were because of changes in pension fund accounting methods. In addition, the earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries, chiefly the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, provided $309 million of the company's $978 million net profit. Chrysler **********Chrysler's earnings, excluding the 89 cents a share it realized from selling its interest in the French automaker Peugeot were $2.40 a share, about 20 cents a share better than many analysts' estimates. Mr. Iacocca said it was the company's third-best second quarter in history. **********Sales were $5.7 billion in the period, down from $6 billion a year ago. **********Earnings at the Chrysler Financial Corporation, the company's financing subsidiary, reached a record $46.4 million in the quarter, up 30 percent, from $35.6 million in the 1985 period. **********Mr. Iacocca said the company had no plans to scale back its $12.5 billion, five-year capital spending program for new car and truck models and for modernizing production plants."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/15/world/role-of-officers-growing-in-nsc.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Trainor", "pub_date": "1986-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 897, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ROLE OF OFFICERS GROWING IN N.S.C.", "print_headline": "ROLE OF OFFICERS GROWING IN N.S.C.", "body_text": " **********The growing role of military officers in the National Security Council may come under special scrutiny by the commission appointed by President Reagan last month to examine the N.S.C., according to a spokesman for the commission. **********The commission is made up of former Senator John G. Tower of Texas, former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie and Gen. Brent Scowcroft, retired, himself a former member of the N.S.C. under President Ford. **********The military's role is also expected to draw the attention of Frank C. Carlucci, the former Under Secretary of Defense who will take over as head of the National Security Council in January. He will replace Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, who with Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North is at the center of the controversy the secret Iran arms deal. **********It has been reliably reported that Mr. Carlucci's deputy will be another military officer, Lieut. Gen. Colin L. Powell, an Army officer who is serving as a corps commander in West Germany and who was previously military aide to Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. #17 of 50 Are Officers According to Pentagon figures, there are 17 officers of the armed services serving on the N.S.C. staff. The authorized size of the council staff is reported to be 50, which means that over a third of the staff is made up of uniformed officers. This, according to the Pentagon, is almost double the number assigned six years ago, when there were nine officers on the agency's staff. **********Pentagon officials could not account for the growth since 1980. They say the National Security Council makes the requests for officers, often by name, and the Defense Department tries to honor the requests. **********According to people who have worked in the N.S.C., a balance was usually maintained on the staff among the military, the State Department, intelligence officials and the business and academic world. **********Although these sources could not account for the high proportion of military representation on the staff today, a former staff member who served in the Carter Administration said, ''That's easy, military officers are hard workers and come cheap,'' referring to the fact that the services pay their salaries. Some Get Extensions **********Officers assigned to the N.S.C. usually have the rank of colonel or lieutenant colonel and normally serve in their assignments for two or three years. Occasionally, one becomes especially valuable in the job and his civilian supervisor requests an extension of his services. This was the case with Colonel North. **********According to Marine Corps sources, Colonel North was to have returned to Marine duties two years ago, but remained with the N.S.C. at the request of Robert C. McFarlane, who was the President's national security adviser at the time. **********The disclosure of the powerful role played by Colonel North, a middle-grade Marine officer on the N.S.C. staff, came as a surprise to many. ''Few outside the Government are aware of the influential roles played in Government by officers on politico-military duty outside of the Department of Defense,'' one high-ranking Pentagon official said. **********According to this official, there are hundreds of officers assigned to important non-military jobs throughout the Government. ''Of course not all of them are Ollie Norths'' he said. Reorganized by Bundy **********One former staff member says he believes the makeup of the staff had its origins in the Kennedy Administration when McGeorge Bundy reorganized the council to make it more responsive to the President. **********Military officers assigned to outside jobs are usually highly talented and see an opportunity to serve in another part of the Government as good for their military careers. **********Many, however, never return to their service after duty with the N.S.C., according to a Government official, who estimated that ''about 25 percent become so enamored with being at the center of power that when it comes time to go back to their service, they turn in their uniforms and take up a new civilian career in Government.'' **********Some, according to this official, stay on with the N.S.C. 'Arrived at the Holy City' **********A former military assistant at the White House said the amount of deference shown to him by virtue of his position astounded him. ''I thought I had arrived at the Holy City,'' he said. ''I had to constantly remind myself that I was a mere mortal. Frankly, I was glad to get back with my service and out of that environment.'' **********Asked to profile the type of officer suited for duty on the N.S.C. staff, a former staff member said: ''He should have maturity and have the ability to use his clout. But he can't be too military. He can't just give and take orders; he has to know how to negotiate and be creative. He has to be able to get things done.'' **********This official said that there were pitfalls for officers coming from the structured society of the military to the somewhat freewheeling world of national policy making but that most officers took it in stride. ''Indeed,'' he said ''some not only survive, but prosper. Look at Al Haig, Brent Scowcroft and the current head of the National Security Agency, Bill Odom. All of them cut their teeth in the White House, and they haven't done badly.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/business/zellerbach-net-climbs-by-66.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 196, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zellerbach Net Climbs by 66%", "print_headline": "Zellerbach Net Climbs by 66%", "body_text": " **********The Crown Zellerbach Corporation said yesterday that it earned $17.1 million, or 48 cents a share, up 66 percent from $10.3 million, or 23 cents a share, a year ago.

Options Narrowed **********According to the sources, the options have been narrowed, including one plan said to involve the company's partial breakup, but the advisers are not believed to be throwing their weight behind any one proposal. ''There are no leading candidates,'' one Wall Street source said. **********Even after the First Boston and Goldman report is delivered to USX, the company's management and board will ultimately decide which, if any, of the proposals to carry out.

The Yates field could be included in a broader plan involving all the company's energy assets, should the restructuring go in that direction, the sources said. Larger Segments Expected **********But any breakup of USX, the sources said, is likely to be into larger business segments, with no one oilfield or asset being singled out. All sources contacted yesterday requested anonymity. **********One source said two or three restructuring options, some of which have several variations, were under consideration. **********The most obvious, the source said, would be to split the company up into two or more parts in an effort to realize greater value for its energy operations.

That date represented the one month that USX said it would take its advisers to report back with a reorganization plan. **********The complexity of the situation, the sources said, is causing Goldman and First Boston to miss the ''deadline.''

''The goal was to have as many Europeans as possible in Nicaragua and to increase the danger of an American intervention,'' said Michael Ruder, a 28-year-old activist. ''We offered something like protection.'' **********Since then, more than 1,000 German leftists have trooped off to Nicaragua, volunteering to harvest coffee and build houses, schools and hospitals, acting as a reserve force in the struggle against what they call ''U.S. imperialism.'' **********They style themselves ''brigadistas'' - consciously inviting a comparison between the Sandinista cause and the banner of republican Spain during the 1936-39 civil war - and back home have become effective grass-roots lobbyists for the embattled Central American nation. Headquarters in the Ruhr **********The nerve center for this outburst of overseas engagement is the Nicaragua Information Bureau, situated in a loft in the Ruhr Valley industrial center of Wuppertal. From it, Mr. Ruder and a 13-member staff coordinate fresh contingents of volunteers, who seem to find in Central America challenges and excitment not available in their comfortable West European welfare state. **********Aside from Nicaragua's gentler climate, the brigadistas' two-month stints hardly amount to a holiday. The volunteers pay their own way, work hard and are exposed to the dangers of a land caught up in civil strife. Since 1983, two Germans have been killed in Nicaragua - it appears by American-supported rebels - two women have been raped, and 10 have been kidnapped and subsequently freed. **********Last spring, the kidnapping of eight brigadistas by guerrillas known as contras in southern Nicaragua turned into an awkward confrontation between Bonn and Washington. As the kidnapping dragged into its third week, legislators from several parties in Bonn began to say that American-subsidized ''terrorists'' were holding Germans at a time when the Reagan Administration was demanding a crackdown on terrorists supported by Libya. **********Finally, after 25 days, the eight West Germans were freed by guerrillas from the Nicaraguan Democratic Front, apparently after decisive intervention by the United States Embassy in Honduras. Even within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government, which broadly supports the Reagan Administration in Central America, officials bitterly complained that the eight could have been freed much sooner if Washington had given the orders. Question of Bearing Arms **********The kidnapping was a propaganda coup for the Marxist-oriented activists in the Nicaragua Information Bureau, and, if anything, it added to the luster of becoming a brigadista. ''The contra chiefs told us during our interrogation that the kidnapping was planned as a deterrent to others,'' said Reingart Zimmer, a 20-year-old Hamburg student who was one of the hostages. ''So their violence took on a new quality.'' **********The eight Germans repeatedly denied accusations by their rebel captors and the State Department in Washington that they had been armed. Yet the question of the brigadistas' combatant status was revived last month when three German men from another group of volunteers admitted on a West German television program that they had carried AK-47 rifles as members of a Nicaraguan militia unit. **********Like many brigadistas, the three men had been conscientious objectors in West Germany, which seemed to pose questions about the consistency of their convictions. The Information Bureau here weighed in with a three-page press release denying that it was exporting Germans to fight abroad but arguing that even conscientious objectors had the right to defend themselves when attacked. The Aura of Danger **********As a result of the kidnapping episode, the Nicaraguan Government gave in to urgings from the Kohl Government and withdrew West German brigadistas from projects that had been consciously placed in areas where rebel bands are active. But an aura of danger still clings to the young Germans' enterprise. **********''My parents were shocked when I told them,'' said Stefan Franke, a 21-year-old student in West Berlin, who was setting off the other day for Nicaragua. ''But they had to run from war during the Third Reich, and now they understand that I want to go Nicaragua and declare that I am against the war that is being fought there.'' **********Mr. Franke was chatting in a cafe in West Berlin's rundown Kreuzberg district with two women who wore the black clothes that are the unofficial uniforms of the West German far left. The conversation was filled with denunciations of American ''imperialism'' and justifications for the Sandinistas' crackdown on their domestic foes and the newspaper La Prensa. **********Rita Muckenhirn, a 22-year-old, said she wanted to go to Nicaragua so that she could ''do better political work'' when she returned to West Berlin. A Thorn in Kohl's Side **********The brigadista phenomenon is an irritant to the Kohl Government, which has cut off most development assistance to Nicaragua while allowing 29 experts to finish projects in the Central American nation. Bonn officials express dismay that the West German Protestant churches and the Green Party subsidize development projects proposed by the Wuppertal Information Bureau, which says it has an annual budget of $100,000. **********Volkmar Kohler, state secretary in the ministry for aid to developing countries, said West Germany's tiny Communist Party played a relatively minor role in the export of brigadista to Nicaragua, which he characterized as an undertaking mainly of ''the radical left.'' **********''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Kohler said, ''for 20 years there has been constant criticism of the United States and its foreign interventions that goes back to Vietnam. Since Vietnam turned out to be a disappointment for these 'idealists,' Nicaragua is the perfect place to go.'' **********''But,'' he added, ''this isn't just pro-Nicaragua sentiment. This is anti-American sentiment.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/world/us-looks-at-ways-to-free-hostages.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 898, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. LOOKS AT WAYS TO FREE HOSTAGES", "print_headline": "U.S. LOOKS AT WAYS TO FREE HOSTAGES", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration said today that it was pursuing the release of the remaining American hostages in Lebanon through many channels. **********A senior Administration official confirmed that the United States was working with other countries to try to free the hostages and refused to rule out that Iran might be one of them. **********Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, said that the United States was ''using many different channels'' to gain the hostages' release, but that it would not give in to outrageous demands. **********''Negotiation means many things to many people,'' he told Cable News Network. ''Are we giving into demands? No. But are we willing to talk and discuss and things of that nature? Yes.'' **********An Israeli Role Is Reported **********The speculation on Iran came amid reports on the Israeli radio that Israeli sources might have played in a role in providing military spare parts to Iran in a complicated deal designed to free the American hostages. **********The account, which American officials would not confirm, suggested that such an arrangement had been one of the avenues explored in recent months by Robert C. McFarlane, President Reagan's former national security adviser, to gain the hostages' release. **********Administration officials, while maintaining secrecy, left open the possibility that they had been working through intermediaries with Iran and that the discussions had focused on such issues as providing Teheran with military spare parts in return for its help in persuading captors in Lebanon to free the hostages. It was unclear if the equipment would be provided directly. **********According to the Israeli radio, Mr. McFarlane met with Israeli operatives, including David Kimche, who was director general of the Foreign Ministry until last month. **********Mr. Kimche, reached today by telephone, described himself as a ''personal friend'' of Mr. McFarlane, but would not say if they had met recently or what they might have discussed. **********Mr. McFarlane, who resigned as security adviser in December, is counselor for the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University. He did not return phone calls today. Teheran Modifies Account **********The confusion over whether secret negotiations were under way increased today after the Iranian press agency modified a report that Mr. McFarlane and four companions had been arrested on a secret mission to Iran and had been confined to a hotel room in Teheran before being expelled. That assertion was made Tuesday in a speech in Teheran by the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament. **********Today the press agency quoted the Speaker, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, as saying the mission leader had ''claimed'' to be Mr. McFarlane. But it added that the Speaker was unsure if the man was indeed Mr. Reagan's former national security adviser. **********Mr. McFarlane has refused to comment on the Iranian assertions. **********Some foreign policy experts speculated that the seeming shift by the Iranian Speaker had been prompted by a premature disclosure of the McFarlane mission, which they suggested had been made by a rival Iranian faction that was opposed to bargaining with the United States. **********In reports broadcast by the Teheran radio and monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, for example, the Iranian Prime Minister, Mir Hussein Moussavi, rejected negotiations with the United States because of America's ''crimes against the Islamic revolution.'' **********But in London, the Iranian charge d'affaires, Seyed Jalal Sadatian, suggested to The Associated Press that Teheran could be willing to work to free the Americans in Lebanon on ''humanitarian grounds'' if the United States ended its hostility toward Iran and released frozen Iranian assets. A Critical Stage Is Seen **********Administration officials said their refusal to comment, in sharp contrast to the abundant statements from Teheran, was based on the belief that the efforts to gain the release of the hostages were at a critical stage. They suggested, without confirming Iran's participation, that the attempts could be impaired if confirmation of a McFarlane mission led Teheran to pull back. **********''Our feeling is that anything said at this stage runs the risk of affecting the hostages,'' a senior White House official said. **********Similarly, Mr. Regan, the White House chief of staff, warned that premature disclosures could stifle opportunities to free the hostages. ''There are lives at stake here,'' he said. **********White House officials said Tuesday that the United States would not lift its arms embargo against Iran, which is in dire need of military supplies in its war with Iraq, on the grounds that Teheran continues to foster terrorism. But some American sources said today that the position left open the possibility that the United States policy could shift as a result of an Iranian denunciation of terrorism or through other steps. **********For example, they said, the United States could make available spare parts already purchased by Iran and stored in American warehouses. In addition, the Administration could ease its increasing pressure on other countries not to provide equipment to Iran. **********The Israeli radio account said Mr. McFarlane and Mr. Kimche had met in London and Paris and were joined by a wealthy Israeli businessman with contacts in Iran. The businessman, who was not identified, then received the approval of high-ranking Israeli officials to provide spare plane parts to Iran, the radio report said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/22/world/a-arms-cuts-stir-concern-at-nato-parley.html": {"writer_name": "John Cushman", "pub_date": "1986-10-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 638, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A-ARMS CUTS STIR CONCERN AT NATO PARLEY", "print_headline": "A-ARMS CUTS STIR CONCERN AT NATO PARLEY", "body_text": " **********Defense ministers of the Atlantic alliance told American delegates to a meeting here today that European support for sharp reductions in strategic nuclear forces hinged on further steps to insure a balance in conventional arms between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. **********As the first day of a two-day meeting of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group wore on, the Europeans, especially the West Germans and the British, emphasized that their enthusiasm for nuclear arms control was tainted by concern over the potential loss of the protection afforded by nuclear weapons. **********In a news conference at the end of the day, Britain's Defense Minister, George Younger, repeatedly warned that the elimination of strategic ballistic missiles would not be wise unless conventional arms, including chemical weapons, were also controlled. 'Extremely Concerned' **********The British Government, he said, ''would be extremely concerned at a final agreement to abolish strategic ballistic missiles altogether if there was not at the same time a very effective and appropriate reduction in conventional forces.'' **********''When substantial reductions have been achieved, there is then a new phase'' at which point all types of armaments would have to be considered, Mr. Younger said. ''A further deal that only looked at strategic ballistic missiles would be very questionable.'' **********At the same time, Mr. Younger said the meeting here had produced ''extremely solid support for the stance taken by the President'' in his talks with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. **********In the recent Iceland meeting, the United States proposed that strategic missiles be eliminated over a 10-year period, and the Soviet Union responded with a proposal to eliminate all long-range arms. **********There were also understandings regarding the elimination of all Soviet and American medium-range missiles from Europe and a phased program aimed at a halt of nuclear testing. **********Tentative accords on some of these issues collapsed, however, over the basic dispute of how much research and testing the United States would be permitted in its program to develop a space-based missile defense. **********After Mr. Younger's remarks, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger told reporters that he understood and supported the European position. **********''There has never been any slight suggestion that it would be done on other than a timed, phased basis,'' he said. ''There would be full recognition that you would have to maintain a deterrent.'' **********But although Mr. Younger and the ranking West German delegate, Lothar Ruhle, State Secretary for Defense, spoke of the need to reduce conventional forces to parity, Mr. Weinberger said the goal could be achieved by building up allied conventional forces. **********Although the Europeans came to this Scottish golf resort somewhat confused by the rapid events in Reykjavik, officials said, they quickly fell into line in support of the American stance. **********Officials at the meeting here suggested that the final communique would make this support plain. **********Mr. Weinberger said the worries over the long-term strategic implications of the dramatic arms reductions contemplated in Iceland were understandable. Those concerns first came to light last week when military commanders complained that they had not been adequately consulted over the arms reductions. **********''Everybody, uniformed, civilian and otherwise, understands that the military implications of the proposals that were discussed in Iceland need to be considered,'' Mr. Weinberger said. **********The Americans have tried to reassure the Europeans by pointing out that some nuclear weapons would remain in any event, including bombers and cruise missiles. Short-range battlefield nuclear weapons also would be major factors in the balance of power. **********''We need to compute the equations of deterrence,'' Mr. Weinberger said. ''If you change these balances, you have to look at the equations.'' **********This, he suggested, still remains to be done in detail."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/world/from-a-nigerian-pen-yoruba-tales.html": {"writer_name": "Edward Gargan", "pub_date": "1986-02-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FROM A NIGERIAN PEN, YORUBA TALES", "print_headline": "FROM A NIGERIAN PEN, YORUBA TALES", "body_text": " **********Witch herbalists and strange round shadows, river ghosts and water spirit women swarm in the universe of Amos Tutuola. In one place he finds the crazy removable-headed wild man. In another, the abnormal squatting man of the jungle. **********There are towns where the dead dwell, white trees filled with musicians and mountains where dancing creatures live. And on Wraith-Island, Amos Tutuola finds a creature as big as an elephant. **********His fingernails were long, about two feet, his head was bigger than his body 10 times. He had a large mouth full of long teeth - these teeth were about one foot long and as thick as a cow's horns - his body was almost covered with black long hair like a horse's tail hair. He was very dirty. There were five horns on his head that were curved and leveled to the head. His four feet were as big as a log of wood. **********''There are thousands of folk tales,'' Mr. Tutuola said of his world. ''The ones I like the most, well, I prefer frightening folk tales.'' The Living and the Dead **********For more than three decades Mr. Tutuola has written of beasts and ghosts, of the dead and the living, of mortals negotiating terrifying worlds they cannot comprehend yet somehow conquer. Through seven novels, he has exposed the depths of Yoruba tradition and imagination. Of his work, V. S. Pritchett once wrote, Tutuola's voice is like the beginning of man on earth, man emerging, wounded and growing. **********His writing, Mr. Tutuola says, is rooted in his village, in the folk tales he heard as a child and collected as an adult. **********''Old people would tell tales in the village,'' he said. ''Every night people would tell folk tales. During those days in the village, people had rest of mind. People were happy. After they returned from the farm, after dinner people would sit in front of houses. As amusement people told folk tales -how people of days gone by lived, how the spirits of people lived. So we learned them.'' **********Mr. Tutuola has just sent to his publishers his eighth novel, ''Pauper, Brawler and Slanderer,'' a tale of two men, the magic of juju and their destiny in the struggle to win a wife. ''I write about my tribe, the Yoruba,'' Mr. Tutuola said. ''This book is about Yoruba culture, how they ruled the country, how they punish offenders, how marriage goes on.'' Far From the Village **********Ibadan, the city where Mr. Tutuola works, was by the 19th century the largest city in Africa. Today its valleys are carpeted with the rusting brown tin that roofs the mud-walled houses that crowd together as if seeking comfort in closeness. It is, Mr. Tutuola laments, a very distant place from the village. **********''The people who live in town have more money than the people who live in the village,'' he said. ''The people who live in town are more civilized than villages and have European ways. In the village they drink palm wine. In the village they consult babalawo. In the town, most people do not.'' **********Babalawo, he explained, is the village herbalist doctor, the representation of God on earth. **********Away from the dense valleys, on the city's northern edges, a jumble of two-story masonry buildings make up a neighborhood called Odo-Ona. Down a row of passageways guttered with cement runoffs, off a corn-yellow dirt road called Aronomi Street, Mr. Tutuola sits in the front room of his apartment, tugging constantly on his metal-stemmed pipe. ''When I am writing I must smoke,'' he said. 'Bush Here, Bush There' **********''When I was 12 or 13,'' he said, ''I followed my grandmother here. The road was not tarred. Ibadan was very, very rough. There was no water. Bush here, bush there. It was very small.'' **********The bush plays a central role in Mr. Tutuola's work. The bush is that place between villages, between destinations, an expanse of unknown, whether jungle or plain, that must be traversed. In many of his novels, the bush is where his characters confront life, their own doubts and fears, their destiny. **********''I did not know the time that I entered into a dreadful bush which is called the 'Bush of Ghosts,' '' he wrote in one novel. ''This 'Bush of Ghosts' was so dreadful so that no superior earthly person ever entered it.'' **********When he was a teen-ager, he went to Lagos and learned the blacksmith's craft. With World War II breaking out in Europe, Mr. Tutuola joined the Royal Air Force, for which he worked as a coppersmith. After the war he took a minor civil service position. How He Started Writing **********''After some months,'' he said, ''I bought one magazine and turned to a page where I saw a story book written by a Yoruba man. It reminded me of telling folk tales. The following day I took up my pen and began to write folk tales into a long story.'' **********He submitted his first manuscript, ''The Palm-Wine Drinkard,'' to a missionary society press in London, which told him politely that the elaborate folk tale was not the sort of literature it published. The society did, however, send the novel to Faber & Faber, the publishers that have printed his novels since 1952. **********That work, the tale of a young man's search for a dead palm-wine tapster in a world of bizarre creatures, magical potions and supernatural locales, represented, he said, a village view of life. In his later works, that same absorption with the mysterious, the inexplicable and apparently irrational continued to constitute the core of his effort. **********That view, that attachment to the unknown so deeply rooted in the village mentality, is at the same time, he said, dissipating in Yoruba culture. He hopes to preserve it. 'Not So Familiar' **********''I think people are not so familiar with such things anymore,'' he said. ''In Ibadan, they don't have good folk tales. Consider Lagos. People cannot tell good folk tales there. People who could tell folk tales go to town and they don't have time to tell them. These kind of tales are dying down.'' **********He tugged at the sleeve of his gown and stared for a moment at a slowly turning ceiling fan. **********''Perhaps in years to come, only at the university can we get folk tales,'' he said finally. ''People watch TV. They are more interested in things from other countries. It's very bad. If we let our traditions die, it is very bad. We don't have rest of mind.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/28/business/advertising-molson-golden-duo-to-be-heard-not-seen.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-05-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 135, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Molson Golden Duo To Be Heard, Not Seen", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Molson Golden Duo To Be Heard, Not Seen", "body_text": " **********Fans of the couple who have been making those wonderfully relaxed Molson Golden Beer and Ale radio commercials will hear that the brand is testing television advertising and think they will at last get the opportunity of seeing their camera-shy hero and heroine.

Occasionally, an American or French military vehicle would rumble across the bridge from Potsdam, making a seemingly effortless transit from a Soviet command post behind the Berlin wall to the American sector of West Berlin. **********On Tuesday at about noon, if there are no last-minute hitches, Anatoly B. Shcharansky, the Soviet dissident, and three Germans accused of spying for the West will arrive at the Potsdam side of the snow-dusted Glienicke Bridge and be inspected by Francis J. Meehan, the United States Ambassador to East Germany. **********On the American side of the divided bridge, Wolfgang Vogel, a dapper East Berlin lawyer, will check the identities of five Warsaw Pact intelligence agents, who will be driven to the wintry site in United States Mission vehicles. **********A Well-Known Ritual **********The ritual is well known to both Mr. Vogel and Mr. Meehan, who as a young Foreign Service officer served in West Berlin in the 1960's in what was called ''the Eastern Affairs Section'' of the United States Mission. **********In 1962, the two men secretly negotiated the exchange of Francis Gary Powers, the American pilot of a U-2 reconnaissance plane downed over the Soviet Union, for Col. Rudolf Abel, a convicted Soviet spy. The pilot and the colonel were exchanged on what the East German Communists call ''the bridge of unity,'' but which might be better called the ''bridge of spies.'' **********Because of the Glienicke Bridge's hoary association with espionage, United States diplomats say they believe the Soviet Union attaches great symbolic importance to the fact that Mr. Shcharansky, arrested in 1977 and later convicted of treason and spying for the Central Intelligence Agency, should cross it on Tuesday. **********But to rob the exchange of this very symbolism, the United States Ambassador to West Germany, Richard R. Burt, will whisk Mr. Shcharansky away from his three companions and escort the Russian to a private limousine, according to a source involved in the exchange planning. Will Fly to Frankfurt **********The choreography calls for Mr. Burt and Mr. Shcharansky to be driven to Tempelhof Airport, and from there to be flown to Rhein-Main Air Base outside Frankfurt in a United States Air Force C-130. There, as one American official put it, the Russian ''will be in Israeli hands,'' and the Israelis are being tight-lipped about a man whose freedom they hope may be a harbinger of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and a resumed flow of Jewish emigration. **********American officials say they assume Mr. Shcharansky, who will probably be reunited with his wife, Avital, in Frankfurt, will be flown directly to Israel, where Mrs. Shcharansky has lived since emigrating from the Soviet Union in 1974. It has not gone without notice that the Israeli airline El Al has ''canceled'' Flight 358 from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv, which would normally depart on Tuesday at 3:05 P.M. **********If the exchange takes place as planned, it will crown months of probing and patient negotiating involving Mr. Vogel, Mr. Meehan, Mr. Burt and Ludwig Rehlinger, a senior Bonn official who has long experience in winning the freedom of East German political prisoners and others who wish to immigrate to West Germany. **********The negotiations have entailed numerous secret displacements. In recent days, for example, Mr. Vogel has been in New York and has met with Mr. Rehlinger, an old friend, at the Austrian ski resort of Ellmau to settle final details of the exchange, according to well-placed American and German officials. Soviet Resistance on Sakharov **********The American side, and apparently Mr. Vogel himself, initially hoped to craft a deal that would free both Mr. Shcharansky, who was a spokesman for the Jewish emigration movement, and Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet Nobel Prize laureate who has been banished to the city of Gorky. But the notion of freeing Mr. Sakharov met with Soviet resistance, according to those close to the negotiations. **********The decisive impulse for the exchange, according to various accounts, was the Geneva summit meeting in November, when President Reagan privately urged Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, to release Mr. Shcharansky as a gesture of good will. **********American and German sources would not disclose the identity of the three Germans who are expected to be released with Mr. Shcharansky. But they said the Warsaw Pact agents to be freed include Karl Koecher, who was arrested in the United States in 1984 and accused of passing secrets to Czechoslovakia; his wife, Hana; Yevgeny Zemlyakov, a former member of the Soviet Trade Mission in Cologne convicted last year of high-technology espionage in West Germany, and Jerzy Kaczmarek, a lieutenant colonel in Polish intelligence arrested in Bremen last year while working under an alias in an office responsible for the resettlement of ethnic Germans from Poland. **********The fifth Warsaw Pact agent involved in the exchange, according to a German source, is Detlef Scharfenorth, a 43-year-old East German convicted last year of spying for the East German Ministry for State Security."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/business/british-telecom-net.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Telecom Net", "print_headline": "British Telecom Net", "body_text": " **********British Telecommunications P.L.C. said today that earnings in its first quarter rose 20.6 percent, to $:304 million, or $465 million at the exchange rate at the end of the quarter, from $:252 million a year earlier. **********The company, which was sold by the state in 1984 to private investors, said revenue increased by 12.5 percent, to $:2.25 billion, or $3.45 billion, from $:2 billion a year ago.

He singlehandedly shattered a delicate compromise between the two allied parties on the relatively abstruse issue of whether Britain should remain a nuclear power in the late 1990's. **********Despite the longstanding commitment of many of their rank-and-file to the idea of unilateral nuclear disarmament, the Liberals had agreed that Britain's existing Polaris missile system would be maintained after the next election. In return - before their leader spoke out - the Social Democrats seemed ready to agree that there was no pressing need to worry the voters about what would happen after the system wore out. **********A substitute compromise more or less on Dr. Owen's terms was then hastily worked out with the other David in this would-be duumvirate - the Liberal leader, David Steel - only to be narrowly voted down in September by the top policy-making body in his party. **********Now the substitute is being floated again, but not before the idea that the Alliance was seriously at odds with itself and less than serious as a contender for power had soured many potential supporters. 'A Serious Defense Policy' **********This convoluted dispute has probably had more to do with the outlook for the election than any other development or trend in recent months, but, looking back, the man at the heart of it remains firm in his conviction that it was a fight that had to happen. **********In an unusually blunt interview, in which he reflected on both the political and strategic aspects of the emerging military issue, Dr. Owen spoke about his Liberal partners and his efforts, as he put it, ''to get them to accept a serious defense policy.'' **********''I've always known this was going to be one of the hardest tasks in my political career,'' he said. ''I've always known that there would have to be a crunch on it, and I've always known that it was no use going on talking about the Alliance as being a great partnership in principle and trying to ignore the fact that there was a fundamental divider in defense matters.'' **********Dr. Owen still has his doubts, he says, about how firmly the Liberals will adhere to the latest Alliance position on defense, which involves a commitment to an unspecified ''European minimum deterrent,'' a post-Polaris system for Britain that would be somehow coordinated with the independent French deterrent. 'Feel Better About the Alliance' **********''I feel better about the Alliance, in many ways,'' he declared, ''although I would say this - I am not yet convinced. We've got to make this stick. I think it will stick. I think many more Liberal candidates will endorse this policy.'' **********Unlike the Conservatives, the Alliance would not go ahead with the $13 billion Trident system Mrs. Thatcher plans to acquire from the United States. Unlike Labor, it would not move unilaterally to give up the British deterrent or demand the removal of American nuclear weapons from Britain. **********Dr. Owen is conceded even by those who blame him for the recent fuss to be the Alliance's most serious student of strategic issues. Lurking behind both his attachment to a British deterrent and his opposition to the Trident system are doubts about the consistency of American arms control policies and the firmness of the American commitment to Europe. **********President Reagan's readiness to talk at Reykjavik with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, about eliminating all ballistic missiles ''without any discussion with his NATO partners,'' he said, ''is again an example of the arbitrary way in which Presidential policy is made and then becomes fixed.'' 'Too Dependent a Position' **********One of the difficulties with the Trident system, beyond its cost, he said, was that it put Britain in ''too dependent a position on the United States.'' **********But the immediate significance of where the Alliance takes its stand on the nuclear issue, he pointed out, is political rather than strategic. If, as he still hopes, neither the Tories nor Labor achieve a working majority after the next election and the Alliance therefore holds the balance of power, its stance on the issue could determine the outcome of any negotiations for a coalition. **********''If the Alliance was nonnuclear it could not work with the Tories,'' Dr. Owen said. A commitment to maintain Britain as a nuclear power amounts, he said, to ''a very important statement of keeping open the option of coalition with the Conservatives.'' **********''Also, for some of us, a vital thing was that in any coalition with Labor, they would have to change their defense policy,'' he said. Britain and the World **********Beyond such considerations, he went on, was the larger question of what Britain amounts to in the world. **********''It's a deeper question,'' he said. ''We punch more than our weight, and we can't go on doing this. The question is do you decide that you are played out and that you should give up your commitments?'' That he characterized as ''Kinnockery'' - the position of Labor's leader, Neil Kinnock. **********Dr. Owen expressed confidence that the Alliance had now ''bottomed out'' and would gain in strength from now until the election. **********Asked what would happen if it again failed to win enough seats to be a major factor in British politics, he did not go out of his way to lay to rest frequently expressed doubts about his personal commitment to the movement he now heads with Mr. Steel. Instead, he predicted that the Social Democrats and Liberals would probably then merge, a move he has so far resisted. **********''Whether I would be a part of that merged body is a very open question,'' said the former physician, who is 48 years old. ''I'm not part of the soft center of British politics. I'm not part of splitting the difference on every issue. I've got other things to do in my life.'' Although the last six months have been painful for the Alliance, they gave the Social Democrats and their Liberal partners - and the electorate as well - a valuable object lesson in ''what coalition politics are all about,'' he said. **********If the Social Democrats and Liberals could present a consistent policy on defense, he was saying, a coalition government in which they would be playing a leading role might eventually do the same after the next election."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/business/market-place-gpu-payout-termed-likely.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1986-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 850, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; G.P.U.

But shares of the General Public Utilities Corporation, which pays no dividend, have climbed more than fivefold in the last four years. **********After selling as low as $4.50 in 1982, G.P.U.'s price reached a recovery high of $25 in the late summer of this year. On Friday, the stock closed at $22.875, up 50 cents for the week, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********But this stellar performance, of course, is only part of the story for the holding company whose three operating subsidiaries sell electricity in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. After the accident that shut down its Three Mile Island No. 2 nuclear generating unit in 1979, G.P.U. suffered a financial crisis involving a substantial cash drain and a severe earnings decline. **********The other part of the story is that G.P.U.'s stock tumbled to $7 from $18.875 during 1979 and reached a low of $3.375 the next year. Dividends totaled $1.77 a share in 1978 and $1.20 in 1979, when they were suspended that November. And, reflecting the company's uncertain prospects, its stock then became an investment suitable only for the most stouthearted speculators. **********''But now a dividend appears in sight,'' according to Leonard S. Hyman and Richard C. Toole of Merrill Lynch. Most other utility analysts agree. **********In fact, premature hopes for a dividend resumption have periodically helped to bolster the price of G.P.U.'s stock in recent years. Only a year ago, the shares sold at around $15. More importantly, the undamaged Three Mile Island No. 1 unit - which was not involved in the 1979 accident - returned to the rate base last November. This is expected to provide an enormous lift to G.P.U.'s 1986 profits. **********The company's cash flow and financial condition also have vastly improved and, two months ago, the Standard & Poor's Corporation raised its credit rating on $1.9 billion of G.P.U.'s systemwide debt. **********In July, the Merrill Lynch analysts raised their rating on the stock from ''neutral'' to ''above average.'' ''We think the company could resume a dividend within six months, and our bet is that it won't start out with a big number,'' Mr. Hyman said last week. ''The initial quarterly payment might be 20 cents a share.'' **********Even though G.P.U. now enjoys ample cash flow and has no burdensome capital construction program, one reason for resuming dividends with a relatively small payment, analysts said, is that the company must still complete the cleanup of its damaged reactor. **********''We believe that G.P.U. is in a position to resume a modest dividend payout and are tentatively estimating a quarterly payout of 25 cents a share at year-end,'' said Peter W. Lin of the Value Line Investment Survey. ''However, the utility may elect to postpone any dividend payments until mid-1987, when it expects to finish removing nuclear fuel from the ill-fated No. 2 reactor and assess the damage. In addition, a premature dividend payout may endanger approvals for promised funding of the cleanup project.'' **********G.P.U. reported earnings of $1.54 a share last year and, thanks largely to the restart of its undamaged reactor, profits are expected to double in 1986. In this year's first half, it earned $1.51 a share, up from 75 cents a share a year earlier. Merrill Lynch estimates this year's earnings at $2.80 a share, while Value Line is projecting $3 a share. **********''We estimate 1986 earnings at $3 a share and continue to recommend the stock, although its capital appreciation potential in coming years won't compare with the recent past,'' said Daniele M. Seitz of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''The stock is attractive because of the prospective resumption of the dividend. We think a quarterly payment of perhaps 35 cents a share is possible around year-end.'' **********In Chicago, Linda S. Caldwell of Duff & Phelps is estimating 25 cents a share as the initial dividend payout - ''probably in the first quarter of 1987'' -and she believes earnings this year will reach $3.10 a share. ''We view the stock as above average in attraction,'' she said. **********Analysts say that G.P.U.'s cash flow now runs about $6 a share and they also note that the stock is selling below its book value - estimated variously at $26 to $28 a share. **********But, despite their relatively optimistic assessment of the company, analysts at Merrill Lynch point out that ''G.P.U. is not completely out of the woods.'' They added: ''Uncle Sam wants to collect back taxes of $120 million. Furthermore, one can't be sure that the reactor cleanup will stay on budget, and there also are related lawsuits.'' In addition, according to Mr. Lin of Value Line, ''Proposed changes in utility accounting rules may require a write-off.'' **********A dividend resumption, however nominal at the outset, may serve to attract certain investors who, because of policy restrictions, are not permitted to buy a stock that does not pay a cash dividend."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/business/china-price-rise.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "China Price Rise", "print_headline": "China Price Rise", "body_text": " **********China is pushing ahead with increases in prices of key consumer goods despite promises of a freeze following discontent over inflation last year.

Although outdoor cafes and newly designed malls are bustling with visitors, most conversations are in the Australian idiom, with relatively few Americans or Europeans in the crowds. **********''People expected a lot more,'' said Barbara McKeown, manager of the Oasis women's clothing store in Fremantle. ''Before the races started, everybody was saying it was going to skyrocket, and it never did.'' **********A port town of 24,000 people, whose salty flavor has not been covered by many new layers of paint, Fremantle has been preparing for three years for the America's Cup races. In 1983, a yacht owned by an Australian businessman, Alan Bond, defeated a New York Yacht Club vessel off Newport, R.I., to win the America's Cup. It ended a 126-year American hold on the cup and brought the next 12-Meter competition to Fremantle, a suburb of Perth in Western Australia. A Million Were Expected **********With the expectation of more than a million visitors to the area, spending hundreds of millions of dollars, rents shot up and nearly every building in Fremantle was refurbished, or at least repainted. Federal, state and local governments spent some $70 million on roads, sewers and telecommunications, among other improvements. **********But since the races started Oct. 5, the turnout has been somewhat disappointing. Americans have stayed away in droves, and some shopkeepers say that those who did come have not been easily separated from their cash. **********''We have a small number of rooms, and they're not full,'' said Bruce Ewart, manager of the Orient Hotel in Fremantle. ''We've had a few Americans, but nothing to shout about.'' **********Most hoteliers and shopkeepers do expect more tourists, particularly foreigners, over the next two months as the races draw to a climax, with the finals scheduled for Jan. 31 to Feb. 15. Suddenly a Fashionable Place **********But even if the foreigners do not show up in the numbers anticipated, Fremantle has suddenly become one of the most fashionable places to shop or dine in all of Western Australia. New malls have made it even more of a walking town, and attractive new shops and restaurants are filled with young Perth residents who never used to pay much attention to Fremantle. **********''Part of the night life of Perth has come to Freemantle, and it will be here for the next four or five years,'' said John Catallini, the Mayor of Fremantle. **********Mr. Catallini said that on weekends as many as 150,000 visitors wandered this small town's streets and market, drinking cappuccino and eating seafood salad, while admiring the boats in the harbor. An erstwhile earthy undercurrent in Fremantle - with topless barmaids inside some pubs, and inebriated patrons outside - has been replaced by hordes of young people who sip wine and are well, if minimally, dressed. **********The Australians are keeping restaurants hopping, but they are not making up for the lack of Americans in other respects. For example, the Australians have not snapped up such novelties as bottled sea water or canned sea breeze, which local entrepreneurs packaged as souvenirs to entice foreigners. **********No one knows how well the new shops and hotels in Fremantle and Perth will do when the America's Cup races are over. Although officials are sanguine, saying that business will continue to prosper because of the town's chic atmosphere, some shop owners are concerned. Other Races Are Expected **********In any case, other yacht races are likely to be held here, because of the boatyards that have been built for the record 13 syndicates from six countries competing for the America's Cup. **********''Although there is a slight possibility that Australia will not retain America's Cup, Fremantle will remain a major location for yachting series,'' said Ken Hitchcock, who has just opened a new cafe near the harbor. **********Mr. Hitchcock also expressed a concern common in Perth: New Zealand's entry is doing well and may eliminate American rivals from the final one-on-one series. If the final pits a New Zealand 12-Meter yacht against an Australian defender, many people say, that would reduce American interest and the flow of American tourists. **********''From a business point of view, people would like an American boat'' to be in the finals, Mr. Hitchcock said. **********Although visitors to Fremantle may enjoy strolling around the streets and eating seafood, there is little opportunity to enjoy the races themselves. The yachts race far off shore, and even with binoculars it is difficult to discern what is happening. Some people hire boats to follow the yachts, but most enthusiasts simply watch race highlights on television. **********''If you think cricket is a boring sport, you should see the America's Cup races,'' said Barbara J. Goldflam, a Perth schoolteacher. ''Even if you go out on a boat, you can't tell who's ahead until the very end.

Daniloff, the correspondent of U.S. News & World Report, wandered into a restaurant in Frunze, the capital of Kirghizia, That evening in the Ala-Too restaurant Mr. Daniloff met a Russian who has been identified only as Misha. They began a friendship that ended 12 days ago when Mr. Daniloff was arrested in a Moscow park moments after Misha handed him a package that he said contained newspaper clippings. It was actually stuffed with what the Soviet authorities described as secret materials. **********Mr. Daniloff, who has been charged with espionage, has not seen Misha since he handed over the package and hurriedly walked away. On Monday, the Government newspaper Izvestia said Misha had viewed Mr. Daniloff as a suspicious character not long after they met. **********The paper said Misha had also been arrested and was under investigation. **********Misha was the kind of Soviet source Western correspondents and diplomats try to cultivate - someone curious about the West and willing to risk contact with foreigners. **********Mr. Daniloff and his wife, Ruth, trusted Misha enough to invite him to dinner at their apartment. On the day of his arrest, Mr. Daniloff had planned to bring Misha back to his office to introduce him to Jeff Trimble, the new U.S. News correspondent. **********Misha told the Daniloffs that he was married, had a 2-year-old child, and hoped to be admitted to a Moscow Teachers College. **********He said he was an avid reader of Stephen King novels. Mr. Daniloff, who was getting ready to leave the Soviet Union when he was detained, gave Misha two King novels as a farewell gift. **********Mrs. Daniloff said Misha was in his late 20's, about six feet tall with blond hair and a ruddy complexion. **********''He had a very nice smile,'' she said. **********It is not clear to what extent Misha figures in the espionage charges against Mr. Daniloff. **********Another Russian, whose advances to be a friend Mr. Daniloff had rebuffed, does figure in the charges. **********The priest, who has been identified only as Roman, was ''a bogus priest the K.G.B. sicked on Nick around the end of 1984,'' Mrs. Daniloff said, referring to the Soviet intelligence and internal security agency. **********In his first conversation with Mr. Daniloff, Roman ''described himself as a priest who was very interested in Christianity for young people,'' she said. Roman also told Mr. Daniloff that he had been jailed for two years. **********But two things struck Mr. Daniloff as incongruous. The priest gave a convoluted and barely credible description of how he had obtained Mr. Daniloff's name, and he said that, while imprisoned, he had worked in the prison offices, a privilege denied most dissidents. **********Mr. Daniloff's relationship with Roman was mentioned Monday by the newspaper Izvestia. The paper quoted from a letter to Roman from Paul M. Stombaugh, an American diplomat who was expelled by the Soviet Union on espionage charges in 1985. The letter mentioned an unidentified reporter who on Jan. 24, 1985, had purportedly passed on a letter from Roman. Izvestia said the reporter was Mr. Daniloff. **********While the K.G.B. may have seen a subsidiary benefit in Mr. Daniloff's arrest - discouraging contacts between Western correspondents and Russians - it may have backfired in the case of the Daniloffs. **********Many of their friends have rallied around, at some risk to themselves. **********In one case, a friend familiar with sending parcels to prisoners, helped out after the authorities had rejected a cake-size tin full of food for Mr. Daniloff. **********The jailers, the friend said, never allow prisoners to get anything in tins. Items have to be wrapped individually, and the person delivering the food must have the ability to do bargain with the jailers. **********The friend showed Mrs. Daniloff how to slice a salami into chunks, so that if the jailer rejected the whole thing, the prisoner's relative could remove one chunk at a time until eventually the jailer would allow some portion of the sausage to pass. **********The offices of U.S. News & World Report here are one floor up from the correspondent's apartment in a Soviet apartment building on Leninsky Prospekt. Unlike most foreigners in Moscow, the Daniloffs have not been confined to a special partment building for foreigners with a Soviet police guard at the gate. **********By Soviet standards, the U.S. News office is spacious - large enough to allow Nicholas and Ruth Daniloff to turn the apartment over to Mr. Daniloff's replacement, Jeffrey Trimble, and stay comfortably in a bedroom off the offices upstairs. **********While the two families were still in mid-move - the Daniloffs' household furnishings mostly shipped back to the United States, the Trimbles still living out of suitcases stuffed with 2-year-old Elsa's diapers - Mr. Daniloff was arrested. **********In an instant, Mr. Trimble found himself not just a correspondent but a press secretary. Mrs. Daniloff, a writer who has done research on Soviet archaeology, was transformed from a working wife trying to move a household to the outside world's link to Mr. Daniloff. **********Mrs. Daniloff has appeared several times on television news shows in the United States, sometimes live, sometimes in interviews taped in the magazine's offices. Each time she sees Mr. Daniloff or hears from him, she telephones or visits the United States Embassy. **********The telephones in the apartment and the home ring constantly. The family dog, Zeus, barks each time he heard the doorbell ring, turning chaos to cacaphony. Zeus has now been boarded out, and the fleas he harbored have found homes elsewhere in the apartment. **********When Mr. Daniloff telephoned from prison last weekend, Mr. Trimble's wife, Gretchen, told him of this misfortune. **********''Zeus has fleas,'' she said. The line was instantly cut off. The connection was later re-established. **********Worse than the chaos they know is the anticipation of the unknown, Mrs. Daniloff and the Trimbles have said. **********The night of Mr. Daniloff's arrest, Mr. Trimble stayed in the office while Mrs. Daniloff, Mrs. Trimble, 16-year-old Caleb Daniloff and 2-year-old Elsa stayed in the apartment. **********''I think Elsa was the only one who slept,'' Mrs. Trimble said later. As she told it, the emotions she felt were real, yet she kept equating them with ''a third-rate thriller.''

Millions Return to Work **********Nonetheless, the authorities described events Monday as demonstrating the Government's success in preventing even more bloodshed on the anniversary of the Soweto uprising, which began in 1976 with protests against the educational system for blacks and lasted for nearly a year. **********This morning, in cities around South Africa, millions of blacks who stayed away from work on Monday once again jammed trains and buses that brought them into city centers. Johannesburg's streets, which had been almost deserted on Monday, were crowded with black office workers, laborers, young people and shoppers. **********The deaths Monday brought to 42 the number of blacks killed since the state of emergency was declared. **********''The incidents were nowhere near that anticipated,'' said Leon Mellet, a spokesman for the newly established Bureau for Information. ''Nowhere was there mass unrest. The incidents of violence were isolated.'' Mr. Mellet said the ''massive violence'' that he said had been planned by the African National Congress for June 16 ''did not materialize and it never would have either.'' **********Meanwhile, the Government announced the ban on live broadcasts, requiring that all television news material to be sent out of the country be submitted on videotape. This was seen as an effort to hold journalists directly responsible for everything they transmit from South Africa. **********For example, reporters would be held responsible for the content of interviews containing statements that the Government deemed to be subversive. In a live broadcast, they might have been able to assert that they had no control over what had been said. **********At the same time, the Newsweek correspondent in South Africa said the latest issue of his magazine had been banned from the country. **********The Government also ordered the expulsion of four foreigners, apparently West Germans.

However, the A.N.C. will now become more desparate. For this reason the security forces will continue to take the necessary measures to maintain law and order.'' **********The most serious incident on Monday occurred in New Brighton and Kwazakele, black townships outside Port Elizabeth, according to Mr. Mellet. He said two black men trying to throw gasoline bombs at a police patrol vehicle were shot dead. **********Another man was killed in Balfour, he said, when the police fired to disperse what were described as two fighting groups. A fourth man was shot and killed by the police in Fort Beaufort during a gasoline bomb attack on a police vehicle, he said.

Another man was shot to death in Umlazi, near Durban, according to Mr. Mellet. **********News organizations have been prohibited by the Government from reporting about protests and the activities of the security forces.

The president of G.M., F. James McDonald, told reporters on May 23 that spending will ''start to taper down'' from between $9.5 billion to $10 billion this year to between $6 billion to $7 billion by 1989. **********In recent weeks, trade journals have reported that G.M. is cutting the number of models in a broad midsize car program; has dropped a plan to build a ''world'' van, which would have been assembled in G.M. plants abroad as well as domestically, and has suspended a program to bring out a line of Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models with plastic outer bodies, code-named the GM-80 project. These developments have since been confirmed, directly or indirectly, by company officals. **********Conventional Steel Bodies **********The Camaro and Firebird, when redesigned as part of G.M.'s normal product cycle, will evidently have conventional steel bodies, rather then the higher technology plastic-over-steel approach used on the Pontiac Fiero. **********The shifts, which involved models not to be introduced until the 1990 or 1991 model year, reflect G.M.'s efforts to adjust its model lineup for an era in which most Japanese auto companies will have factories operating in this country and even more import competition, analysts said. It is also seen as an effort to improve short-term financial performance. **********''GM-80 was postponed two times already,'' said Ronald Glantz, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. ''They were talking about problems in styling and market potential. I think there are two groups in G.M.: one that wants to go ahead with all these programs and another that thinks the company has to shrink a bit and cut the break-even point.'' **********G.M. officials have been sensitive to charges that the company has the highest costs per car of the Big Three. The apparently higher costs, they have said, are actually investments in plants and car models that will pay off as new cars come to market. Not Gaining Market Share **********G.M.'s new models do not appear to be gaining much market share for the company, however, and its robot-filled plants have had extensive technical problems. ''The real question is whether this is a normal re-examination of a massive capital spending program or if it is a reaction to all the production problems they have been having,'' said Ann C. Knight, an analyst with Paine Webber. ''They may be reassessing how much of the car they want to make themselves.'' **********G.M. has traditionally been the most vertically integrated of the American automobile companies, producing about 70 percent of the contents of a car, compared with about 50 percent for the Ford Motor Company and about 30 percent for the Chrysler Corporation. The emergence of low-cost overseas suppliers has given the smaller companies at least a temporary advantage over G.M. **********G.M., in particular, has been wrestling over how to compete in the crowded car market of the 1990's. On one hand it has been developing ''niche'' models, such as the Cadillac Allante, intended to sell in volumes well below what was considered necessary for profitability. At the same time, company executives have been saying they would like to simplify the lineup for production efficiencies. **********''Bringing out a lot of new lines of cars is the wrong solution to their cost problems,'' said Maryann Keller, an analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney Inc.

Zakharov, a Soviet physicist arrested in New York last month, was allowed to leave the United States today after pleading no contest to espionage charges. Exchange for Dissident **********Under the arrangement, Yuri F. Orlov, a prominent Soviet dissident who has been living in exile in Siberia, and Irina L. Valitova, his wife, will be allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union. **********Mr. Daniloff said he was ''absolutely thrilled'' by the plan for Mr. Orlov's release. **********Mr. Daniloff said he saw nothing equivalent in the handling of his case and that of Mr. Zakharov. **********''In my case the investigation was concluded with no trial,'' he said. **********On the eight-hour flight to Washington from Frankfurt, where Mr. Daniloff spent Monday night after departing from Moscow, he said he hoped to return to the Soviet Union some day. **********He said that Monday morning, before he knew he would be able to leave the Soviet Union, he visited the Moscow grave of his great-great grandfather, Aleksandr Frolov, who spent 30 years in exile in Siberia after participating in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Czar Nicholas I in 1825. 'This Outrageous Incident' **********''I hope someday I can return to place more flowers on his grave,'' Mr. Daniloff said. ''As an optimist, I would hope that this outrageous incident would fade into history,'' Mr. Daniloff said of his arrest and indictment on espionage charges. **********Despite spending 13 days in prison and another 17 days restricted to Moscow under threat of standing trial, Mr. Daniloff said he did not feel bitterness toward the Soviet Union. **********''I spent many years in the Soviet Union and I have many dear friends there,'' he said. **********''The K.G.B. is the K.G.B.,'' Mr. Daniloff said of the Soviet intelligence and internal security agency. **********When the pilot of Pan Am Flight 61 announced over the public address system that Mr. Daniloff and his wife were aboard, the several hundred passengers aboard applauded. **********With his wife seated by his side in the first-class compartment, Mr. Daniloff spent part of the trip responding to questions from American and Western European reporters who made the trip with him. They included correspondents and camera crews from CBS, NBC and ABC as well as reporters from The Associated Press, The New York Times and Der Spiegel, the German news magazine. **********Mr. Daniloff provided some new details during the interviews about his arrest on Aug. 30 in a Moscow park moments after he met a Soviet friend. **********Mr. Daniloff said that shortly after accepting a black envelope from the friend, who told Mr. Daniloff it contained newspaper clippings, a white van pulled up beside him and six men jumped out. **********Mr. Daniloff said, ''They pinned me to the side of the van, forced my hands behind my back, and put handcuffs on me.'' **********''They never said one word of explanation why I was being seized,'' he added. **********After being taken to Lefortovo prison, Mr. Daniloff said, an interrogator from the K.G.B. opened the envelope in the presence of a photographer and two men who were identified as impartial witnesses. **********''When the package was opened, some newspaper clippings, photographs and a number of maps marked secret tumbled out,'' he recalled. **********Mr. Daniloff said the interrogator then began asking questions ''in somewhat theatrical terms.'' **********''What have we here, secret maps?'' Mr. Daniloff quoted the interrogator as saying. **********Not knowing when he would be able to communicate with the Western community in Moscow to assert his innocence, Mr. Daniloff said he raised his middle finger and held it near his face and then near the maps so that this gesture of defiance, not understood by his Soviet captors, would be recorded by the photographer. **********He said he remembered that the crew of the Pueblo, an American intelligence-gathering ship that was seized by North Korea in 1968 had used this tactic to demonstrate that they were resisting their captors."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/world/quotation-of-the-day-367686.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 32, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Quotation of the Day", "print_headline": "Quotation of the Day", "body_text": " **********''We were down 3-0, then we came back to 3-2.

Support of I.R.A. Challenged **********The critics have maintained that President Reagan's backing for the rebels in Nicaragua is an example of ''state-supported terrorism'' and have stressed that Irish gunmen get more support from America than they do from Libya. **********In a long BBC radio interview dwelling almost entirely on the subjects of terrorism and the raids, the Prime Minister noted that the Reagan Administration had been ''very, very active'' in its support for the extradition treaty. Then, repeating the case that British representatives have been pressing in Washington, she said, ''If you're fighting terrorism, you can't fight it just on one front and not another.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher advanced various arguments in defense of her decision to allow the use of British bases, which has made the secret security arrangements that govern the use of American tactical aircraft based here an emotional issue in British politics. ''We must never forget,'' she said, ''that the United States forwent regional interests in Latin America to give us fantastic help on the Falklands.'' A Bulldog, Not a Poodle **********But recalling earlier differences with President Reagan over supplies to the Siberian pipeline and the American invasion of Grenada, she denied that she had allowed herself to become the President's ''poodle,'' She described herself as ''more a sort of bulldog.'' **********Diplomatic sources have said that informal signals have been sent to Washington making it clear that another request for the use of the bases in Britain would not be welcomed by Mrs. Thatcher's Government. But the Prime Minister refused to commit herself when asked what she would do if Mr. Reagan sought to use American F-111's here in reprisal strikes against Iran or Syria. ''No one will ever hear me say,'' she declared, ''that a tyrant can be certain that this Government will not take action against him, because that would be the green light for terrorists to go ahead.'' **********She also indicated that she remained skeptical about the possibility of effective economic sanctions against the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. ''It would be very effective if everyone would say, 'We will not pick up oil from Libya,' '' she said. ''But you know, Europe isn't even saying that now.'' No Action on Libya Contracts **********Government spokesmen today denied a report in The Sunday Telegraph that a decision had been made to force British companies that still have contracts with the Libyan armed forces to withdraw from the country. **********Britain halted the sale of arms to Libya when it broke diplomatic relations with the Qaddafi regime in 1984. While forbidding any new military contracts, it took no action on contracts already in existence. **********According to an official source, only two now remain. One was described as a contract for spare parts for military vehicles, excluding tanks. The other is a service contract held by the Plessey Corporation on British-made radar equipment. **********Plessey has three engineers stationed in Libya, according to a company spokesman here. A fourth Plessey radar engineer, James Abra, is being held in Libya on espionage charges."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/business/market-place-near-term-favorites.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1986-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 810, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Near-Term Favorites", "print_headline": "Market Place; Near-Term Favorites", "body_text": " **********IN light of the recent weakness in stock prices, many investors are wondering how professional money managers regard near-term prospects for the market. Henry M. Greenleaf and Scott M. Black, two New England-based managers with good track records, share some similar views. **********Both managers believe that equity prices over all have climbed too high for comfort. Nonetheless, they still favor property-casualty issues and also hold regional bank stocks - but no money-center banks - in their portfolios. However, since every money manager marches to his or her own drummer, the two men are pursuing different investment strategies. **********For Mr. Greenleaf, chief investment officer of HT Investors Inc. in Providence, R.I., his belief that ''the market is losing steam'' has dictated aggressive selling of some stocks in order to raise cash reserves. As a subsidiary of the RIHT Financial Corporation, HT Investors manages about $1 billion for corporate pension funds and other institutional clients. **********Mr. Black, president of Delphi Management Inc. in Boston, follows a policy of remaining fully invested. ''We don't try to pick turns in the stock market,'' he said. For Delphi, with $550 million under management for institutions and endowment funds, this means a bit of selective pruning while sticking pretty much with issues already in the portfolio. **********Last week, Mr. Greenleaf changed his asset guidelines for balanced accounts - those containing bonds as well as stocks - that are geared to a 6-to-12-month time horizon. ''During the first quarter of 1986, the typical allocation for these accounts consisted of 70 to 75 percent equities, 25 percent in fixed-income securities and a minimal cash position,'' he said. ''But now we are aiming for 60 percent in stocks, with 20 percent in the fixed-income sector and 20 percent in cash equivalents.'' **********HT Investors has sold off a number of blue-chip issues, including J.P. Morgan, Citicorp, McDonald's, Gillette, Bristol-Myers, Kimberly-Clark and Pillsbury. It also cut back holdings in American Express, Pfizer and Eli Lilly. ''It's not that we don't like these stocks,'' Mr. Greenleaf said. ''At some point we hope to buy them back, but we believe these issues are overpriced relative to the general market.'' **********HT Investors recycled some money generated by recent sales into stocks such as Xerox and Eastman Kodak that came under pressure because of earnings reports and other disappointments. **********''In addition, we're buying a basket of smaller electric utility stocks that we believe will be considered good acquisition candidates eventually by large utilities in their respective geographical areas,'' Mr. Greenleaf said. ''We foresee a situation whereby moderating capital outlays and rising cash flow for the larger companies will dictate that they expand market share and growth of generating capacity through the acquisition route.'' **********His buy list includes Savannah Electric and Power, the Scana Corporation and TECO Energy in the Southeast, along with Dayton Power and Light, Cincinnati Gas and Electric, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, Pennsylvania Power and Light and Orange and Rockland Utilities. **********At Delphi Management, the basic strategy of Mr. Black is to emphasize companies that have a minimum of long-term debt, generate excess cash and show a return on equity consistently better than 15 percent. As a general rule, he avoids high-technology companies and likes to pay under nine times estimated earnings for a stock. **********''We own three super-regionals among the Southeast banks - First Union Corporation, Sun Trust Banks and Citizens and Southern of Georgia,'' he said. ''Smaller banks in our portfolio include First Florida Banks, South Carolina National, First Tennessee National and Third National Corporation.'' **********''Some time ago, when we ran our computer screens, we found almost no domestic stocks that fit our criteria, so we went overseas to find new commitments,'' he added. ''In March, we purchased Akzo, the Dutch specialty chemical company. Among Japanese stocks we bought are Toyota and Taisho Marine, a major property-casualty insurer. In April we added Mitsubishi Estate, a leading real estate developer, and we now expect to buy Nippon Suisan, the world's largest trawling company.'' **********Several domestic property-casualty companies - including Hanover Insurance, Ohio Casualty and Physicians Insurance of Ohio - are still attractive commitments, in Mr. Black's estimation. In other industry sectors, he also favors Lockheed and Teledyne. The latter is the largest single holding in Delphi's portfolio. ''On a two-year time horizon,'' the money manager said, ''I can see Teledyne's stock at between 450 and 500.'' Yesterday, Teledyne fell 1 1/4, to 343 1/4. **********In the first quarter of this year, Delphi's accounts showed a total return, or market appreciation plus reinvested dividends, of 14.7 percent. This compared with 14.1 percent for Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. At HT Investors, a typical balanced account had a total return of 15 percent in the same period, according to Mr. Greenleaf."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/business/data-bank-november-2-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 303, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DATA BANK: NOVEMBER 2, 1986", "print_headline": "DATA BANK: NOVEMBER 2, 1986", "body_text": " **********THE ECONOMY Gross National ProductIII Q'86II Q'86Year Ago In billions, annual rate$3,683.3$3,661.4$3,603.8 Real G.N.P.

Weinberger said the development of carriers able to launch jet fighters represented a major step in the evolution of the Soviet Navy into a more aggressive force that could range far from home. **********Some Navy officers and private experts, however, predicted that the carriers would be primarily used in the Norwegian Sea and other waters near the Soviet Union, to hold the United States Navy at bay in the event of a conventional war. **********Pentagon officials said today that the new carrier would not be fully operational until the early 1990's. Navy officials and Defense Intelligence Agency analysts have publicly said that it will most likely be 10 years before the carrier and its aircraft are able to operate proficiently. **********The Pentagon announcement of the new Soviet ship came as Mr. Weinberger prepared for a renewed struggle with Congress to preserve the United States military buildup, including a plan to increase the number of Navy ships to 600, centered on 15 carriers. **********United States intelligence satellites have been following the construction of the new carrier in a shipyard at Nikolayev for several years, and intelligency analysts have been predicting that it will usher in a new era in Soviet naval power. **********The Pentagon predicted that the second carrier, whose existence had not been previously disclosed, would be ready for launching within three years. **********The Soviet military, traditionally a land power, has gradually expanded its navy in recent years, building a deep-water fleet able to range into the Pacific and the Mediterranean. The Soviet Navy has three 37,100-ton small carriers that can handle only helicopters and vertical-takeoff aircraft. **********Pentagon officials said the new, 65,000-ton, 1,000-foot carrier, launched in December, had a ramp on its bow similar to a ski jump that could be used for launching some types of fighter planes. The carrier also has a long, angled flight deck similar to American carriers, but it is unknown whether Russian shipbuilders have installed the complex system of catapults and arresting gears necessary to launch and recover high-speed fighters. **********The vessel is believed to use both nuclear and steam propulsion. **********Adm. James D. Watkins, Chief of Naval Operations, said last year in a report on Soviet naval developments that the Russians ''lack experience in operating fixed-wing aircraft at sea.'' **********''Consequently,'' he said, ''it could be about 10 years before the new carrier and its air group are capable of operating proficiently.'' **********Pentagon officials said the carrier would enable the Soviet Union to extend its military might beyond the protection of land-based fighter planes, which are usually considered able to provide protection for about 300 miles, and to project its power into third-world conflicts. **********''An aircraft carrier is a floating base,'' Mr. Weinberger said Tuesday night in an interview on the ABC News program ''Nightline.'' **********''This will start giving them a capability to engage in conflict and aggression much farther from their shores in a way that will challenge very severely our own naval strength,'' he said. **********A Navy official said a Soviet carrier could complicate American operations in the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific and even the Caribbean. ''Put a Soviet aircraft carrier off Libya and see how that changes the situation,'' the Navy officer said. **********Michael K. MccGwire, a Brookings Institution fellow who is a specialist in Soviet naval affairs, said today that the Soviet Union had always treated its navy as an extra layer to protect its homelands in a general war against the United States. **********''It is not an indication of a Soviet intention to move forward into the third world,'' he said. ''That is not to say it could not be used for that. But the Soviet Navy was built for world war.'' **********In private, some United States Navy analysts have also belittled the idea that the Soviet carrier would be used far from home."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/world/british-ship-crushed-in-antarctic-pack-ice.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 204, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "British Ship Crushed In Antarctic Pack Ice", "print_headline": "British Ship Crushed In Antarctic Pack Ice", "body_text": " **********The British Antarctic expedition mother ship Southern Quest sank in the Ross Sea Saturday night, trapped and crushed by pack ice while on its way to pick up three men who spent a year walking and skiing to the South Pole. **********Spokesmen for the Footsteps of Scott expedition and the United States Antarctic program said all 21 people on the ship were unhurt and had been rescued by American helicopters. **********The 142-foot Southern Quest was heading for McMurdo Sound to collect the three British explorers who reached the South Pole on foot Saturday after retracing the route followed by Capt.

Botha was forced to cancel a rally by the governing National Party tonight after the police lobbed tear-gas at hundreds of right-wing white militants who besieged the meeting hall. **********While the cancellation seemed a humiliation for the Government, it is also bound to be depicted by the white authorities to outside critics as an illustration of the domestic political constraints slowing their program of limited racial liberalization. **********The clash took place in Pietersburg, a trading center in the conservative Northern Transvaal region, where many whites have consistently opposed any shift away from the apartheid policies of total racial separation. **********Right-wingers, under the swastika-like banner of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, battled Government supporters in fist-fights and hoisted their leader, a former policeman named Eugene Terre Blanche, onto the stage before the police threw tear-gas canisters inside the packed hall, witnesses said. More tear gas was thrown outside the hall after hundreds of whites fled the building and right-wingers milled around policemen, the witnesses said. **********Use of Tear Gas **********There have been few, if any, instances in recent years in which the police have used tear gas against an all-white political gathering. **********Right-wingers took exception to the use of tear gas by the police, saying the police were treating them in the same manner as black protesters.

Apartheid is for me!'' **********The two sides fought for control of the stage, witnesses said, in a battle that seemed to show whites as factionalized as the white authorities like to depict the black majority.

But the conflict also seemed to fuel the Government's argument that it cannot move faster with reform than its white, Afrikaner constituency will permit. **********The Government has said it is seeking to share power with the black majority, but will not relinquish total control over whites' destiny. **********In Cape Town today, for instance, Chris Heunis, a senior Government minister, said a proposed multiracial council chaired by President Botha, represented the beginnings of ''a government of more national unity than we have at present'' that would bring ''power-sharing among all South African communities.'' Council Rejected by Blacks **********No black leaders with credibility in the nation's segregated black townships have publicly agreed to participate in the council, which has been rejected by more radical blacks. But such utterances are depicted by white right-wingers as a betrayal of what they see as the Afrikaners' right to total dominance. **********Some right-wingers, calling Foreign Minister Botha by his nickname, chanted tonight: ''Pik, you are digging the white grave!'' Foreign Minister Botha is regarded as representing the relatively liberal wing of the governing National Party. **********Mr. Terre Blanche's movement, which displays strong anti-black and anti-Semitic sentiments, was launched in 1972 and was initially depicted by the authorites as an inconsequential fringe movement. In recent months, however, Government officials say, it has grown in strength, fueled by a white backlash against the Government's liberalization program. **********Mr. Terre Blanche was given a suspended jail sentence in 1983 on charges of terrorism and illegal possession of arms. His followers dress in khaki uniforms and are frequently armed with handguns. His organization has never tested its popularity at the polls, but right-wing political parties have made gains against Mr. Botha's National Party in recent local elections. Botha's Foes to the Right **********The strongest of Mr. Botha's adversaries to the right is the Conservative Party, led by Dr. Andries Treurnicht, who broke with Mr. Botha in 1982 over his liberalization program. **********Right-wing white movements seek to evoke a rekindling of what is perceived as pioneering, Afrikaner resolve, and so some of Mr. Terre Blanche's supporters tonight waved the banners of the Afrikaner republics that existed in the 19th century. Women clad in the bonnets and wide skirts of Afrikaner pioneer times also joined the protest. ----Argentina Breaks Relations BUENOS AIRES, May 22 (Reuters) - Argentina broke off relations today with South Africa over Pretoria's raids on three black-governed African states, the Foreign Ministry reported. **********A communique was issued as Foreign Minister Dante Caputo informed Pieter Wolvaardt, charge d'affaires at the South African Embassy in Buenos Aires, of the decision. **********It said the break would be effective today and that South African diplomats would have until May 31 to leave. **********''The Argentine Government is convinced that these incidents are a direct consequence of a institutionalized regime of racial discrimination, which is totally unacceptable in the framework of the contemporary international community,'' the communique said. ----Security Council Meets UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., May 22 -The Security Council met this afternoon at the urgent request of Senegal to consider the South African raid Monday into three neighboring countries. **********Diplomats said the African countries hope to have a resolution condemning South Africa passed before a special General Assembly session on Africa opens here Tuesday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/22/business/briefs-277686.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Citicorp sold $50 million of 91-day commercial paper at an average rate of 7.750 percent, down from 7.874 percent last week, and $50 million of 182-day paper at an average rate of 7.701 percent, down from 7.869 percent. *********** Illinois Power Co. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf offering of $200 million of first mortgage bonds. *********** Merrill Lynch & Co. is issuing $200 million, up from $150 million, of 9 percent Eurobonds due in 1989 at 100 3/8 through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. *********** Southmark Corp. is offering $150 million of 8 1/2 percent convertible subordinated debentures due in 1998 at par through Drexel Burnham Lambert; the debentures, callable after two years, are convertible to Southmark common at $12.8625 a share. *********** TRW Inc. is issuing $100 million of 9 3/4 percent, seven-year Eurobonds at par through Morgan Guaranty Ltd. *********** Walt Disney Productions is issuing 10 billion yen of 6 5/8 percent Eurobonds due in 1996 at 100 1/2 through America International Ltd."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/29/business/advertising-jwt-group-s-profits-drop-38.6-in-quarter.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JWT Group's Profits Drop 38.6% in Quarter", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; JWT Group's Profits Drop 38.6% in Quarter", "body_text": " **********JWT Group yesterday reported that its net income for the third quarter declined 38.6 percent, to $2.7 million, or 29 cents a share, from $4.4 million, or 47 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter, while revenues increased 10 percent, to $149 million, from $136 million. **********In the nine-month period, net income was up 10 percent and revenues increased 13 percent."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/25/business/business-people-inman-will-head-electronics-venture.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Frank", "pub_date": "1986-09-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 508, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Inman Will Head Electronics Venture", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Inman Will Head Electronics Venture", "body_text": " **********Adm.

But Linell McCurry, first vice president with Butcher & Singer Inc., in Philadelphia, recently recommended the stock. **********Because of sharp operating cost reductions, she believes, SSMC could be earning $3 a share in three to five years. Her tentative projection for 1987 is 25 cents to 75 cents a share. She said that ''management has identified savings of $24 million in manufacturing and overhead costs over the next three years.''

''It doesn't take much change in operating income to swing earnings per share dramatically,'' Miss McCurry said. The stock has been trading for half its $29.31 book value, and long-term debt equals only 7 percent of the company's capital. ''SSMC was put out by Singer in quite good shape,'' Miss McCurry said.

Carbide, which is in the process of selling its consumer products business, rose 4 3/8, to 97 3/4, while its when-issued stock was the third most heavily traded issue, up 1, to 19 1/2. The when-issued shares represent Carbide after a 3-for-1 stock split and after the sale of the consumer products division, according to a Carbide spokesman. **********Closes Below Record **********Carbide and Kodak together accounted for 8 Dow points. If both stocks had been unchanged, the index would have fallen 4 points on the day. Even with their help, the Dow closed below the record 1,698.28 set Monday. **********Both gains were linked somewhat to the GAF Corporation. Carbide fought off a takeover attempt by GAF earlier this year by announcing that it was selling its consumer products business. Proceeds will go mostly to shareholders, and investors have become excited in recent days as they try to calculate the amount to be reaped. **********Since GAF stands to make a large profit on the Carbide transaction, speculators figure it may be making plans for using the funds, perhaps through another takeover attempt. Kodak, the speculators figured yesterday, might fit the profile of an undervalued company with some chemical operations in which GAF might be interested. Kodak Movement **********One Wall Street source, however, said GAF had not been buying Kodak stock. At Kodak, a spokesman said of the stock movement, ''We're simply at a loss to explain it.'' **********GAF stands to gain from the Carbide transaction because it still holds about 10 percent of Carbide's stock. As a result, GAF improved 2 1/2, to 68 7/8.

There are more than 150,000 of them, and scores more are being set up every day, according to Government officials and corporate lawyers. **********The companies usually consist of no more than a few typed pages in a manila folder, but they enable their foreign owners to do business anywhere in the world anonymously and tax-free. **********In the last week, three Panamanian companies have been linked to the United States' sale of weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits to the supply network of the Nicaraguan rebels or contras. Other Panamanian companies may also be involved. **********It is typical of the Panamanian corporation, a type of financial vehicle that is also provided by Switzerland, Hong Kong, the Channel Islands and several Caribbean countries, that although the names of the three companies and some of their connections to the arms scandal have been discovered, the identity of who ordered the creation of the companies and the details of how the companies operated remain a mystery. A Maze of Baffles **********Experts in the field say the structuring of a Panamanian corporation is usually done with so many baffles and cut-outs that it is highly unlikely that the lawyer who set up the three companies linked to the arms deals knew who he was actually working for or how the companies were to be used. **********The Panamanian lawyer who set up the three companies linked to the Iran affair, Julio Antonio Quijano, will not talk about the companies but other lawyers here say his involvement may be explained by his apparent business relationship with a Swiss accountant who is listed among the directors of two of the companies. **********About the only way to find out what a Panamanian company has been doing and whom it has been doing it for is to stumble onto a transaction or to persuade someone familiar with the operation to talk. That is how the three Panamanian companies, Udall Resources, Lake Resources and Stanford Technology Corporation, were connected to the contra deal. **********Setting up a Panamanian company is relatively easy and inexpensive. The leading law firms here charge $800 to $900 to draw up the papers; some lawyers will do it for as little as $300. The lawyers will go to work on instructions by telephone or telex and the corporation can be doing business in three days or less, buying, selling and operating bank accounts almost anywhere in the world. The actual founder of the company never has to identify himself or to set foot in Panama and there is no income tax to be paid in Panama as long as the transactions are consummated outside the country. **********The corporate business, along with strictly secret banking and the registration of commercial ships, forms the leading edge of a financial services industry that is one of the most dynamic and prosperous sectors of Panama's economy. Up to a billion dollars a year is involved. Wide Range of Uses **********Cuba and Nicaragua have used Panamanian companies to circumvent the United States' trade embargoes against them. At least two former dictators, Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines and Jean-Claude Duvalier of Haiti, channeled money through Panamanian companies. Exporters sell goods to their own corporations in Panama and resell them elsewhere in the name of the Panamanian corporation because the profits are not taxable. **********Some rich husbands heading for divorce court set up Panamanian corporations and transfer into them assets that might otherwise be awarded to their wives. Even the Vatican has done business through Panamanian corporations. **********Panamanian corporate law was patterned on United States corporate law and some of the same secret structures can be created in both countries. In the United States, however, the Internal Revenue Service and other Federal agencies can cut through most of the secrecy. These agencies have no authority in Panama and Panama, believing it is in its interest to keep the scrutiny of its international corporations and banks to a minimum, has resisted pressure from the United States to join in information-sharing treaties. **********Many Panamanian lawyers say the United States would find it much harder to freeze secret bank accounts here than has so far been the case with the accounts in Switzerland that appear to have played a role in the arms deals. A Few Figureheads **********Panamanian law firms usually provide two people, often clerks in the law office, to serve as formal authors of the corporation. For an annual $150 or $200 per person, the firm also provides the names of three more clerks to be listed as directors and principal officers of the corporation. **********Two of the three companies linked to the arms deals listed as board members Swiss nationals and an American who had previously been identified with some of the principals in the sale of weapons to Iran. Lawyers here say the Swiss and American directors may have been used to facilitiate day-to-day operations of the companies. The result, however, was a compromise in secrecy. **********Incorporation documents in Panama usually authorize a capitalization of $10,000. But there is no minimum capital requirement and most often no money is actually put up. **********A key element in the secrecy of the corporation is that, unlike in the United States and many other countries, there is no requirement to disclose the names of the principal shareholders. In most instances, a single certificate for 100 percent of the corporation is issued in behalf of ''the bearer.'' **********Quite often, said Gabriel Castro, a 46-year-old lawyer who has twice served as Panama's Minister of Finance and twice served on its Banking Commission, a person seeking to set up a Panamanian corporation will work through two or three intermediaries, most commonly bankers and lawyers, so that the person approaching the Panamanian lawyer does not know the client's identity. **********Typically, he said, the figurehead board of directors issues a broad power of attorney that can be endlessly passed on to others. Thus, the figurehead directors are unaware of what the corporation is doing or who is doing it. **********Under Panamanian law, the directors are liable only for their own direct actions and not the consequences of a power of attorney. Panama does not require annual reports or the registration of most transactions. North's Modus Operandi **********It was apparently with such a power of attorney that Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, the dismissed National Security Council official, was able to operate a checking account at a branch of Credit Suisse in the name of the Panamanian company known as Lake Resources. **********An Iranian, Manucher Ghorbanifar, and a Saudi Arabian, Adnan Khashoggi, two intermediaries in the Iran arms transactions, have said in broadcast interviews that Colonel North and Richard V. Secord, a retired Air Force major general, told them to deposit money in the Lake Resources' Swiss bank account. One of several bank accounts that the Swiss Government has frozen at the request of the United States was a Lake Resources account in Colonel North's name. **********A special feature that many lawyers in Panama offer is known as the ''vintage'' company. **********Like a vintner who holds certain wines until they mature, the lawyers create a batch of corporations each year with sisters, brothers, employees and friends as directors. They pay the annual tax of $150 to keep the corporation in good standing and wait for a client who wants a company with a history. **********''Some people want a company that's been established 15 or 20 years and has never done anything illegal,'' said Mario J. de Obaldia, a retired lawyer and former member of the National Assembly who is now a newspaper and radio commentator. ''Some people trust an old company more than a new company,'' he said. **********In his lawyering days, Mr. de Obaldia said, ''I didn't do many of these, maybe 90 or 100.'' **********''I have a friend,'' he added, ''who did thousands.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/07/world/navy-says-in-a-nonnuclear-war-it-might-attack-soviet-a-arms.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Gordon", "pub_date": "1986-01-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 854, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NAVY SAYS IN A NONNUCLEAR WAR IT MIGHT ATTACK SOVIET A-ARMS", "print_headline": "NAVY SAYS IN A NONNUCLEAR WAR IT MIGHT ATTACK SOVIET A-ARMS", "body_text": " **********The Navy has officially acknowledged that if a major nonnuclear conflict broke out between the United States and the Soviet Union, it might seek to attack Soviet submarines that carry long-range nuclear missiles. **********The contemplated action, using conventional weapons, would be intended to tip the nuclear balance in favor of the United States and induce the Soviet Union to end the conflict on terms favorable to American forces, according to the Navy. **********In the past, some senior Navy officials have declined to commit themselves publicly to such a strategy. In an interview in November, the Secretary of the Navy, John F. Lehman Jr., said it was ''not necessarily'' United States strategy to attack Soviet strategic submarines in a nonnuclear war.& Policy Has Critics Some critics have said that Navy attacks using conventional weapons against Soviet submarines carrying long-range nuclear missiles would put pressure on the Soviet Union to use nuclear weapons in response and would increase the risk that a conventional conflict would turn into a nuclear war. **********The acknowledgment that this element was part of naval strategy came in a recent article by Adm. James D. Watkins, who as Chief of Naval Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the Navy's highest officer. Navy officials said today that they had decided, after careful deliberation, to outline the strategy publicly to rebut criticism that the service lacks a clear vision of how to fight a naval war. **********The officials said the article by Admiral Watkins did not signal a new strategy but was the most explicit articulation of Navy thinking on the issue. Navy officials said the article had been submitted to Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger's office for clearance before publication. **********In the article, ''The Maritime Strategy,'' published by the United States Naval Institute, Admiral Watkins notes the potential for using Navy forces to ''alter the nuclear equation'' in favor of the United States before either side had used nuclear weapons. **********This, he said, could be done by ''destroying Soviet ballistic missile submarines'' and by deploying United States aircraft carriers and other vessels that carry nuclear weapons ''around the periphery of the Soviet Union.'' 'Not Without Risk' **********Admiral Watkins wrote that the strategy ''is not without risk'' and that ''neither we nor the Soviets can rule out the possibility that escalation will occur.'' **********But, he adds, ''Escalation solely as a result of actions at sea seems improbable given the Soviet land orientation.'' **********One critic of the strategy, Barry R. Posen, an assistant professor at Princeton University, who formerly worked in the Defense Department. called the strategy unduly provocative. **********''We are being asked to spend billions of dollars to buy ammunition and modernize our conventional weapons in order to raise the nuclear threshold in Europe and reduce the risk of nuclear escalation there,'' he said. ''And here the U.S. Navy has selected a strategy that works diametrically in the opposite direction. **********''Of all the possible Navy strategies,'' he said, ''this one is the most likely to cause the other side to reach for nuclear weapons.'' Debate Within the Navy **********A naval expert said there was still debate within the Navy over the wisdom of the strategy and the decision to advertise it. **********''Strategic submarines are the Soviet Union's strategic reserve force,'' the naval expert said. ''If we start killing their strategic submarines, they may go after our aircraft carriers with nuclear weapons. If anything, this strategy will promote escalation.'' **********A Defense Department official, however, defended the Navy strategy. He said the Navy was not saying it would seek to destroy the entire Soviet strategic submarine force in a conventional conflict. He also argued that Soviet military writings suggested that United States strategic submarines could be the target of a Soviet attack in the early stages of a war. **********In recent years, there has been growing interest in the Navy in developing the ability to attack Soviet strategic submarines. Operating Under the Ice **********The Navy, for instance, has taken steps to improve its ability to operate under the Arctic ice, where it is thought Soviet strategic submarines would try to hide. **********Last April, Admiral Watkins went to a Navy base in the Arctic and visited a Navy attack submarine that surfaced through the ice, a Navy official said. **********Admiral Watkins later spoke about the trip in an interview with reporters. ''An effort was made to make sure that the word got out about the trip,'' a Navy official said, in order to send a signal to the Soviet Union about the Navy's intention to improve ''deterrence'' by adding to its ability to operate in polar regions. **********The Navy has conducted tests of sonar and torpedoes in Arctic regions in recent years, military experts said. The Navy is also trying to give some of its Los Angeles-class submarines more ability to operate under the ice and plans to develop a new attack submarine, the SSN-21, that is more effective than existing submarines in Arctic regions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/world/fearless-students-keep-up-european-travel.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 644, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FEARLESS STUDENTS KEEP UP EUROPEAN TRAVEL", "print_headline": "FEARLESS STUDENTS KEEP UP EUROPEAN TRAVEL", "body_text": " **********Young Americans - students and recent graduates 18 to 25 years old -have not been as afraid to visit Europe this summer as have most other tourists from the United States, according to travel-industry experts. **********''Our findings are that percentagewise, they appear to be going to Europe with more frequency than older groups,'' said Colleen Zarich, deputy executive director of the Council on International Education Exchange, a nonprofit organization that specializes in youth travel. **********Although the total number of young Americans visiting Europe is down from last year's record tally, Ms. Zarich said, her indications are that the reduction has not been as substantial as it has been for older tourists. **********For example, sales of the group's international student identification card were down by more than 20 percent in the spring, Ms. Zarich said. But that decrease compares favorably with the declines of over 90 percent in some parts of the tourist industry, she said. **********Hostel Memberships Off **********Similarly, purchases of international youth hostel memberships by Americans going to Europe are off by 33 percent from a year ago, according to Jeff Yeager, director of education for American Youth Hostels. **********''In a way, we can thank our lucky stars, because the dropoff hasn't been as severe as in other parts of the travel industry,'' Mr. Yeager said. **********Robert Whitley, executive vice president of the United States Tour Operators' Association, added, ''The youth market was the least affected, because the youth market was the least afraid.'' **********Travel-industry experts say that although business seems to have improved in the last month, the European tourist industry, plagued by negative publicity and a weakened dollar, has experienced a general decline in American visitors of 50 percent or more this summer. Not So 'Vulnerable' **********Mr. Yeager, among others, suggested that young people had not been as strongly influenced by the potential hazards of European travel - such as terrorist incidents and radioactivity from the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the Ukraine - that have prompted many other Americans to stay away from Europe this summer. **********''I don't think they were as vulnerable to media input as the general public,'' Ms. Zarich said. **********Young people, who often spend years making plans and saving money for a European journey, have been more hesitant to cancel a trip they considered to be a ''once in a lifetime opportunity,'' Mr. Yeager said. **********''Most of the people who've canceled their trips said something to the effect that their parents didn't want them to go,'' said Andrea Campbell, manager of Let's Go Travel Services in Cambridge, Mass.

''It would have been absurd not to do this trip at essentially the perfect time for me.'' **********Mr. Schillinger said he experienced stringent security measures throughout his trip. In London, for instance, his backpack was searched thoroughly by guards at the Hard Rock Cafe, a popular nightclub and restaurant. **********Cynthia Holzman, 22, of Tucson, Ariz., found this year a good time to be visiting Europe on a tight budget. **********''I'm sure it would have been much more difficult to find an inexpensive hotel, a place to eat and a seat on the trains if the dollar were stronger,'' she said, ''and if the terrorists had not caused so many people to stay away.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/11/world/huge-chemical-spill-in-the-rhine-creates-havoc-in-four-countries.html": {"writer_name": "Paul Lewis", "pub_date": "1986-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 816, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HUGE CHEMICAL SPILL IN THE RHINE CREATES HAVOC IN FOUR COUNTRIES", "print_headline": "HUGE CHEMICAL SPILL IN THE RHINE CREATES HAVOC IN FOUR COUNTRIES", "body_text": " **********A huge discharge of toxic chemicals into the Rhine is confronting Europe with one of its worst ecological disasters in recent years. **********Tonight, French television reported that more than 1,000 tons of chemicals, including eight tons of mercury, spilled into the river 10 days ago after a fire at a chemical storage warehouse in Basel, Switzerland. The environmental protection office in Basel has put the figure at 10 to 30 tons of chemicals. **********Spokesmen in France, West Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland -the four countries through which the Rhine flows - said today that it was in danger of becoming a ''dead'' river as the chemicals kill off fish and destroy the ecological system of the vital waterway. **********Water Plants Closed **********The four countries have shut down all plants processing Rhine water for drinking. They have also banned fishing in the river and closed sluices and locks to stop polluted water seeping into estuaries, streams and underground water courses. **********In West Germany, 24,000 villagers along the Rhine are being supplied with drinking water from fire trucks. **********Environmental ministers from the four countries will hold emergency talks in Zurich on Wednesday. #34 Different Chemicals The four governments have taken defensive action in the last two or three days as they have gradually realized the gravity of the crisis. **********According to the environmental protection office in Basel, water used to douse a fire at the riverside storage building of the Sandoz chemical company carried 10 to 30 tons of toxic substances into the river. At least 34 different chemicals were washed into the Rhine, some of which may have fused into new compounds as a result of the high temperatures created by the blaze. **********The chemicals included dyes, insecticides and mercury, a highly toxic substance. A second discharge of mercury-tainted water took place from the same plant last Friday. Many Fish Perish **********Dead fish are being removed in large quantities from the Rhine in Switzerland, France and West Germany. But scientists fear that fauna and microscopic organisms that serve as the basis of the huge river's ecosystem are being destroyed as well. **********In West Germany, the villages of Unkel and Honningen are being supplied with water by fire truck because all their supplies come from the river. **********The French Enviromental Minister, Alain Carignon, called the pollution ''an ecological catastrophe.'' He accused Switzerland and Sandoz of failing to warn other countries bordering the river in good time. And he said France would seek ''financial compensation'' from Switzerland and from Sandoz. **********The West German Enviromental Minister, Walter Wallman, said the chemical leak would cause ''serious damage to our largest and loveliest river,'' although he said it was too early to estimate the full extent of the catastrophe. **********Mr. Wallman reported that Swiss fishery authorities believe the Rhine's ecosystem has been ''destroyed'' for at least two years. He estimated that about half a million fish have perished so far. **********Reinhard Goehner, a member of the West German Parliament's Enviromental Committee, said the German Government was likely to demand financial damages from Switzerland and Sandoz. **********In Basel, Sandoz executives who had called a public meeting today to discuss the accident were forced to flee from the conference hall to escape angry crowds protesting the spill. **********On Sunday, more than 10,000 people marched through the streets of the city to protrest the pollution, shouting such slogans as ''We don't want to be tomorrow's fish'' and ''Chernobale'' - a pun linking the French version of the city's name with the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union earlier this year. **********On the Zurich Stock Exchange, Sandoz shares have lost 14 percent of their value in the last two days as investors anticipate big liability suits against this leading Swiss chemical company. **********Today, a Sandoz spokesman, Marc Sieber, denied allegations that the company had violated regulations on the storage of dangerous chemicals. He said the chemicals had been kept in a building that was designed in the 1960's as a machinery store but that was converted for chemical storage in 1979 with the consent of government and local authorities. **********Besides being Europe's biggest commercial waterway, the 820-mile Rhine, which flows from the Swiss glaciers to the North Sea, is also a major tourist attraction and a source of legend and folklore. **********Jan Essing of the Dutch Water Monitoring Service said the first traces of the pollution are now sweeping into the North Sea from the mouth of the Rhine near the Hook of Holland. He said the tail of the pollution was still moving through West Germany and estimated it would be 40 more hours before the bulk of the toxic substances has been swept out to sea."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/17/business/at-t-cutback.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 41, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.T.&T.

A Generation Under Scrutiny **********Mr. Waldheim says the enrollment grew out of harmless student activities and denies he had anything to do with, or even heard about, wartime atrocities. But the charges and countercharges have opened old wounds and renewed bitter discussions. The terms used now are whether Mr. Waldheim, in glossing over his wartime past, was not somehow representative of a generation of Austrians who passed from subservience to the Nazis to postwar posterity with what appeared to be little introspection or regret. **********Some people say the Western Allies are partly to blame. After the German surrender, the Allies decreed in December 1945 that Austria, unlike Germany, was not responsible for the outbreak of war in Europe, but indeed, through annexation by Hitler in 1938, became the war's first victim. **********''There was a disadvantage,'' said Fritz Molden, a retired publisher and author, who fled the German Army and joined the Austrian resistance fighters. ''While the Germans were forced to face the past, and there was Nuremberg, the Austrians immediately felt themselves as liberated.'' **********The Allies, he said, ''laid a cloak over all Austria.'' **********''It's clear to me that it was a grave misfortune,'' he said, ''because we were never forced, as the Germans were, to face up to ourselves.'' **********Austrian political parties competed in the first round of national elections in 1949 for the favor of 500,000 former Nazi Party members who were denied the vote in the first ballot in 1945. **********''There were just too many Nazis for any party to think it could ignore them,'' said Prof. Kurt Schubert, an expert on Judaic studies at the University of Vienna who left the Conservative People's Party over its policy of supporting former Nazi candidates. **********A process of assimilation began in all the parties that some say hindered a critical discussion of the past. In the first Cabinet of Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, a Social Democrat and a Jew, four ministers were former Nazi Party members. **********Mr. Waldheim touched a raw nerves of the discussion last week when he described how he became a soldier in Hitler's armies, ''just as hundreds of thousands of other Austrians did their duty.'' **********Ivan Hacker-Lederer, the 79-year-old retired lawyer who acts as spokesman for Austria's Jews, said it was that remark ''that hurt most.'' 'To Comrades in Arms' **********To be sure, Mr. Waldheim, backtracking in a fashion that has become almost habitual in the campaign, later insisted the reference was to the duty of soldiers ''to the homeland, the country, other people, their comrades in arms,'' and not to the Nazis. **********But the damage had been done. ''If there is one thing I cannot forgive him,'' Mr. Hacker-Lederer said, ''it is saying that he did his duty.'' **********Hate mail, 60 or 70 letters, some addressed ''To the Jewish Community, Division Swines,'' has come in, threatening violence if Mr. Waldheim loses. The number is small, in a population of seven million, but there are police guards at temples and Jewish homes for the elderly. **********Still, Mr. Hacker-Lederer chides ''the form'' in which the World Jewish Congress chose to investigate and disclose details of Mr. Waldheim's past, raising serious charges but not being able to supply proof that he actually took part in war crimes or atrocities. **********At the head of a small group of Jews, Mr. Hacker-Lederer recently visited Mr. Waldheim in a gesture of conciliation. **********But the name Waldheim was a buzzword at Chajmi Junger's bar mitzvah, as it is throughout Vienna. The Austrian Jews, 7,000 mostly elderly people, compared with 220,000 before the war, appear deeply split over how to react. ''There won't be pogroms, and there won't be persecution, but that was not the way to go about it,'' said Leon Zelman, a teacher and surviver of Auschwitz, who bitterly opposed the delegation to Mr. Waldheim. **********Some Jews say they hope Austria's incumbent President, Rudolf Kirchschlager, who agreed to examine the secret United Nations file on Mr. Waldheim, might join Roman Catholic Church figures in an appeal that he withdraw his candidacy. **********Encouraging that view, Austrians who supported Mr. Waldheim, like former Chancellor Kreisky, have fallen away, but the hope of a Waldheim withdrawal appears nevertheless to remain wishful thinking. Mr. Waldheim's supporters in the Austrian People's Party insist the disclosures are all part of a smear campaign to wreck his presidential chances. **********They accuse the Socialist Party of Mr. Waldheim's opponent, Kurt Steyrer, of engineering the attacks by researching and leaking documents to the World Jewish Congress. Challenged, however, by Mr. Steyrer during a television debate tonight to provide specific evidence of such tactics, Mr. Waldheim was unable to do so."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/02/business/treasury-focus-on-short-term-bills.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 819, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Treasury Focus on Short-Term Bills", "print_headline": "Treasury Focus on Short-Term Bills", "body_text": " **********Treasury financing this week is confined to the short-term bill market, with no note auctions expected until the middle of the month. **********In advance of today's regular auction of new three- and six-month bills, the outstanding three-month issue was bid late Friday at 6.31 percent while the six-month issue was at 6.43 percent.

Domestic financings will consist of an auction next Tuesday of $9 billion of three-year notes, followed on Wednesday by a $7 billion auction of 10-year notes and a $7 billion auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday. **********Late yesterday, government securities dealers offered the three-year issue on a when-issued basis with a yield of 8.33 percent, while the 10-year notes were at 9.10 percent and the 30-year bonds were at 9.32 percent. Among outstanding Treasury issues, prices fell by 3/32 for two-year notes, which closed with a yield of 8.02 percent, and by 3/4 point for the 9 7/8 percent bonds due in 2015, which were offered at 105 7/32 to yield 9.35 percent. **********Rates Higher on Bills **********In the short-term market, rates on Treasury bills rose nearly a tenth of a percentage point in some cases, with the six-month issue closing at a bid rate of 7.12 percent. In the Federal agency market, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation announced a $1 billion offering of 7 3/4 percent bonds due in six months at a price of 100. **********Government securities dealers said it was far too soon to estimate investor demand for the new issues, but many said that commercial bank demand could be good for the three-year note, while foreign buyers, especially Japanese, should buy a large portion of the 10-year and 30-year issues. **********According to the Securities Dealers of Japan, net purchases of foreign bonds in that country totaled $41.9 billion in 1985, or more than double the net purchases of 1984. The yield advantage of United States Treasury issues over Japanese Government issues is not as high as it was during much of 1985, but the American securities are still paying well above the 5.88 percent yield for 10-year Japanese Government bonds on Thursday. **********The possibility that the Japanese yen may rise to 180 to the dollar from 194 yesterday may deter some buyers, but analysts doubted that the yen could stay that high for long. **********However, the hope of good foreign demand was not enough to keep the outstanding 9 7/8 percent bonds from falling steadily from the day's high of about 105 30/ 32. 'Skittish All Day' **********''The market was skittish all day, with most of the price declines seeming to come in response to unconfirmed rumors,'' noted William Sullivan, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. **********According to one rumor, which was denied by a Federal Reserve Board spokesman, the Fed's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, had said the central bank would not reduce the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions. The discount rate has been at 7 1/2 percent since May. The reduction in the Bank of Japan's discount rate to 4 1/2 percent had led to renewed speculation that the Fed might cut the rate. **********Prices for short- and long-term issues were also depressed by rumors that soon-to-be-released economic data will point toward rapid growth. For example, a rise of two percentage points was rumored for the index of leading economic indicators, which is scheduled for publication today; many economists have been forecasting a gain of 1 1/2 percent. In addition, reports were circulating that the January report from purchasing managers, due out Monday, would show a strong increase in activity. **********''Evidence that the economy is strengthening is unmistakable,'' said Larry Kudlow, chief economist at Rodman & Renshaw, a securities firm in Chicago. He estimated that signs of the economy's vigor will be widespread enough by the second quarter to start a sustained rise in interest rates that will lift bond yields by about two percentage points. **********Before rates begin rising, however, Mr. Kudlow said the bond market rally might be extended briefly by enthusiasm over the prospects of reductions in Federal spending.

I know: your choice transcends me. This both frightens and pleases me. It frightens me because I wonder: do I have the right to represent the multitudes who have perished? Do I have the right to accept this great honor on their behalf? I do not. That would be presumptuous. No one may speak for the dead, no one may interpret their mutilated dreams and visions. **********It pleases me because I may say that this honor belongs to all the survivors and their children, and through us, to the Jewish people with whose destiny I have always identified. **********I remember: it happened yesterday or eternities ago. A young Jewish boy discovered the kingdom of night. I remember his bewilderment, I remember his anguish. It all happened so fast. The ghetto. The deportation. The sealed cattle car. The fiery altar upon which the history of our people and the future of mankind were meant to be sacrificed. 'Can This Be True?' **********I remember: he asked his father: ''Can this be true? This is the 20th century, not the Middle Ages. Who would allow such crimes to be committed? How could the world remain silent?'' **********And now the boy is turning to me: ''Tell me,'' he asks. ''What have you done with my future? What have you done with your life?'' **********And I tell him that I have tried. That I have tried to keep memory alive, that I have tried to fight those who would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices. **********And then I explained to him how naive we were, that the world did know and remain silent. And that is why I swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. 'Sometimes We Must Interfere' **********Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant. Wherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion or political views, that place must - at that moment -become the center of the universe. **********Of course, since I am a Jew profoundly rooted in my people's memory and tradition, my first response is to Jewish fears, Jewish needs, Jewish crises. For I belong to a traumatized generation, one that experienced the abandonment and solitude of our people. It would be unnatural for me not to make Jewish priorities my own: Israel, Soviet Jewry, Jews in Arab lands. **********But there are others as important to me. Apartheid is, in my view, as abhorrent as anti-Semitism. To me, Andrei Sakharov's isolation is as much of a disgrace as Iosif Begun's imprisonment. As is the denial of Solidarity and its leader Lech Walesa's right to dissent. And Nelson Mandela's interminable imprisonment. **********There is so much injustice and suffering crying out for our attention: victims of hunger, or racism and political persecution, writers and poets, prisoners in so many lands governed by the left and by the right. Human rights are being violated on every continent. More people are oppressed than free. Palestinians and Israelis **********And then, too, there are the Palestinians to whose plight I am sensitive but whose methods I deplore. Violence and terrorism are not the answer. Something must be done about their suffering, and soon. I trust Israel, for I have faith in the Jewish people. Let Israel be given a chance, let hatred and danger be removed from her horizons, and there will be peace in and around the Holy Land. **********Yes, I have faith. Faith in God and even in His creation. Without it no action would be possible. And action is the only remedy to indifference: the most insidious danger of all. Isn't this the meaning of Alfred Nobel's legacy? Wasn't his fear of war a shield against war? **********There is much to be done, there is much that can be done. One person -a Raoul Wallenberg, an Albert Schweitzer, one person of integrity, can make a difference, a difference of life and death. As long as one dissident is in prison, our freedom will not be true. As long as one child is hungry, our lives will be filled with anguish and shame. **********What all these victims need above all is to know that they are not alone; that we are not forgetting them, that when their voices are stifled we shall lend them ours, that while their freedom depends on ours, the quality of our freedom depends on theirs. 'Every Hour an Offering' **********This is what I say to the young Jewish boy wondering what I have done with his years. It is in his name that I speak to you and that I express to you my deepest gratitude. No one is as capable of gratitude as one who has emerged from the kingdom of night. **********We know that every moment is a moment of grace, every hour an offering; not to share them would mean to betray them. Our lives no longer belong to us alone; they belong to all those who need us desperately. **********Thank you Chairman Aarvik. Thank you, members of the Nobel Committee.

It now looks as though this year's economic summit conference, to be held in Tokyo from May 4 to 6, may be overwhelmed by debates over how to deal with international terrorism following the United States air attack on Libya and the refusal by France, and Spain as well, according to a member of the Spanish Cabinet, to let the American planes use their airspace. **********President Reagan has said that at Tokyo he will press for stronger joint action against Libya and terrorism. France's denial of its airspace to American planes, he added, was ''a subject that must be discussed.'' Mr. Reagan said some European nations were already talking about ''a wider-based and more all-out effort'' against Libya. **********The political issue of how to deal with terrorism, in the opinion of some foreign officials, could be a distraction from the economic business of the Tokyo talks. But the political issue of collective action to fight terrorism is actually linked to the major economic issues facing the industrial countries. That is the way Lord Lever of Manchester, a leading British economist and financier, sees it. **********Lord Lever, who as Harold Lever served in the Cabinets of Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, believes there is a vital connection between Libya and the solutions to the crucial economic problems of the industrial nations: preventing a worsening of protectionism, reordering the world monetary system and heading off a financial catastrophe in the third world that could jeopardize the solvency of Western banks. **********In a new book, ''Debt and Danger: The World Financial Crisis,'' published by the Atlantic Monthly Press, Lord Lever and his co-author, Christopher Huhne, economics editor of The Guardian, stress the need for collective action to prevent a widespread financial catastrophe. In a dinner discussion in New York, Lord Lever insisted that he was not ''predicting'' a catastrophe but warning that it could happen if corrective measures by the major countries were not taken to prevent it. He believes there is sufficient knowledge and experience to take the necessary measures, provided the will exists among the major industrial countries. The real need is for statecraft. **********What he and Mr. Huhne have in mind for forestalling a financial disaster is a contemporary version of the Marshall Plan. That flow of capital from the United States to Europe, which absorbed 4 1/2 percent of the American gross national product from 1949 to 1952, was not an act of ''noblesse oblige'' but, they say, served the true interests of both America and Europe. Today, they see the industrial countries risking their own future by pursuing niggardly policies toward the third world, with poor countries forced to chop back their imports and send capital back to the rich countries. Lord Lever and Mr. Huhne want to reverse that flow from poor to rich, to foster international development and save the trading system. **********Lord Lever thinks Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker 3d clearly understands how essential increasing the flow of capital to the third world has become to prevent a disaster. But he said Mr. Baker has had to go slowly in the face of resistance within the Administration, national budgetary constraints and the lack of adequate support from other industrial countries. **********The obstacles to a constructive solution are not just on the side of the rich countries. Lord Lever recognizes that transferring more capital to the third world also requires that those nations put their own houses in order, especially to overcome the problem of capital flight, whether caused by inflation, stagnation or corruption. **********A longtime skeptic on floating exchange rates, which he warned more than a decade ago would lead to excessive volatility of currencies and economic instability, Lord Lever strongly supports Mr. Baker's initiative, backed by President Reagan, to move to a system of managed exchange rates. Mr. Reagan, in an interview with reporters, said this week that the Tokyo conference should focus on what can be done to stabilize currencies ''and quit having this volatility and ups and downs.'' He added that ''we are at the point now of discussing with our allies whether we all feel'' that an international monetary conference would be helpful. **********Strikingly, the conservative Reagan Administration appears to be trying to regain the kind of international leadership, both in economic and national security affairs, favored by old-style liberal American interventionists - and by an old-fashioned British Laborite like Lord Lever.

They killed and kidnapped the people of her village, and what property they could not carry away they set afire. **********''We have a large village but we all had to leave because of the Maralheen,'' said Gobana Akot, standing amid other bedraggled displaced people at a food distribution center on the outskirts of this hot and dusty town in the southern Sudan. **********''They came and they killed the people and they took cows,'' she said. ''They took the girls and the boys. If they saw people, they shot them. Our people ran. We don't have guns, so we ran. The Maralheen have guns.'' **********The Maralheen, Arab tribesmen from the Sudan's north, have a long history of clashes with the African Dinka tribe in the largely Christian and animist south. The conflicts, traditionally over grazing land, water and raiding of cattle, were once played out with spears and settled by tribal chiefs. But over the last three years, according to local government officials, clergy and witnesses, the Maralheen have come armed with rifles, submachine guns and mortars. Their mission, the witnesses say, has been to cut a wide swath of destruction through the land of the Dinkas. Death and Slavery **********Riding into villages on camels, horses and donkeys, groups of as many as 1,000 raiders have reportedly shot to death hundreds of Dinka tribesmen, castrated, raped and dismembered others, drowned more than 200 children and abducted hundreds of children and women, selling some of them as slaves in Arab countries. The captives' hands were pierced and they were chained to each other to make escape virtually impossible, some witnesses said. **********Officials and townspeople say whole villages have been burned - in one district with a population of about 186,000 the intruders were said to have destroyed 80,000 homes - and hundreds of thousands have been left homeless. Many of those displaced face starvation or have died from undiagnosed diseases. Others have reportedly been eaten by lions as they tried to shelter themselves under bushes or trees. **********Several theories on why the tribal clashes have become ''merciless attacks,'' as one person put it, are being turned over by residents of this capital of Bahr el-Ghazal province, where much of the destruction has taken place. What all the theories have in common is complicity, at the very least, by the national Government in the Sudan's largely Arab north, a charge that Government officials and some Dinkas deny. Soldiers in Civilian Clothes **********Witnesses have told of Government troops in civilian clothing plundering villages with the Maralheen. As pleas for help from the Government mount, some residents say, so does the brutal intensity of the raids. **********Some local officials and clergy say the Arab tribesmen are being armed and supported by the Government to try to weaken the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, a rebel group that is waging a widening bush war in the south against Government troops and becoming increasingly entrenched in areas of Bahr el-Ghazal. **********The guerrilla force is drawn mainly from the Dinka. The raiders have reportedly left behind posters warning of total destruction unless the leader of the rebel army, John Garang, is brought to them. The change to the ''merciless attack'' tactics first came in 1983, some officials here say, the year the rebel army was formed. **********Another theory holds that the Government is using the Maralheen to drive the Dinka from mineral-rich areas, so Khartoum can claim the land for the north. According to some officials here, the deposed President, Gaafar al-Nimeiry, sought to exploit part of the south for the north's benefit. Threatening to Dislodge Dinka **********After protests, he announced that the plan had been scrapped, these officials said, but instead he recruited ex-soldiers, policemen, prison guards and other young men, armed them and ordered them to dislodge the Dinka. Mr. Nimeiry was ousted last April in a coup, but the new military Government continued the practice, they said. **********''Once the Dinka get arms, this tribal problem may outlast the political solution,'' said Brig. Albino Akol, military governor of the Bahr el-Ghazal administrative area and a Dinka. ''Both tribes are warriors. The only difference is unequal arms. When they get equal arms, I don't know what devastation they will do among themselves.'' **********Mr. Akol said that in attacks in the eastern stretch of the province since 1984, 900 people had died, 500 children had been abducted and another 600,000 people had been displaced, nearly half the population in the region's east. In addition, he said, 340,000 head of cattle had been looted and countless graneries burned to the ground. **********Brigadier Akol said the need to use limited resources against the rebel forces left the army incapable of mounting a major offensive against the raiders. The local police have tried to stop the raids, he said, resulting in the deaths of 30 police officers. **********''The Government has a duty to chase them away or disarm them,'' said Chan Malual Chan, chairman of a committee trying to ease the situation. He said 14 of his relatives, including his 70-year-old stepmother, had been killed by the raiders in the Twic area, about 100 miles north of Wau. **********''But the Government is turning a deaf ear to our request,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/01/business/why-gm-wants-tiny-lotus.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1286, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHY G.M. WANTS TINY LOTUS", "print_headline": "WHY G.M. WANTS TINY LOTUS", "body_text": " **********There was excitement late in January in this quiet village 120 miles north of London when Roger B. Smith, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, swooped down in a helicopter for a tour of Group Lotus Cars P.L.C. Just five days earlier, on Jan. 22, G.M. announced that it had acquired 58 percent of the tiny sports car and engineering company for $18.5 million. **********In two packed hours, Mr. Smith tramped through the factory here where 450 workers make some 850 of the sleek high-performance cars each year, all by hand. He peeked into the lab, where Lotus creates advanced suspension systems, high-powered engines, composite materials and other innovations. He took a spin at 100 miles an hour-plus on the test track and, as Lotus's chief executive, Michael Kimberley, later put it, he went away pleased. **********''Even though they're a large company, G.M.'s attitude to a small company like us is one of total understanding,'' Mr. Kimberley, 47 years old, said in an interview. ''There's an innovative spirit here, a lot of brain power, and you need a special environment to generate it. G.M. wishes to keep us a separate company with our own product identity. And they want us to build up our R.&D.'' **********Lotus's importance to G.M. could be greater than its tiny size might suggest. ''We can use their engineering talent and expertise,'' said Robert Eaton, G.M.'s vice president for advanced engineering, pointing especially to innovations derived from Lotus's race cars. Money and Image **********''It's an important deal,'' said Ann Knight, auto analyst for Paine Webber. ''G.M. is really serious about improving its technology. Lotus has some good technology.'' She added: ''It's hard to stay afloat when you're pumping money into research. G.M. can bring money to Lotus; Lotus can bring image and performance to G.M.'' **********The company dates back to 1946, when Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman, who died in 1982, started souping up old Austin cars in his London garage. Mr. Chapman incorporated the business in the early 1950's. During that decade, he designed and made sports cars for racing, and in 1963, Stirling Moss steered Lotus to fame in the first of a long string of world Grand Prix manufacturers' championships. **********Mr. Chapman started building rough-and-ready road cars in 1957, but steadily pushed his range upward. Now Lotus makes four versions of two models, the Excel and the Esprit, which range in price in Britain from $23,000 to $33,000. **********Lotus sells only the top-of-the-line Turbo Esprit in the United States, about 130 cars a year, and the price is $54,000. Next year, it plans a new, lower-priced sports car, the X100, which will sell in the United States for about $20,000. Sells Expertise **********Like West Germany's Porsche, Lotus sells its engineering expertise to major auto makers around the world. It works closely with Team Lotus, a separate company, on Formula 1 racers for world championships. Lotus is famous for the aerodynamic wedge shape of its cars, its powerful engines and the Chapman strut suspension, which many auto makers adopted for their regular models. **********But Lotus has never really enjoyed financial security. ''It's no secret that's been a problem,'' Mr. Eaton observed. **********Though the company went public on the London Stock Exchange in 1969, it often had to struggle to cover the next year's development budget. It plunged into real financial trouble in 1982, when the rising pound caused Lotus's American market to collapse and losses mounted to $3.3 million. Then Mr. Chapman died and the company was unable to obtain new bank credits. **********Lotus, which designed the DeLorean sports car, also faced a messy British tax investigation connected to funds missing from John Z. DeLorean's bankrupt company, but the investigation was later dropped. The DeLorean Motor Company had a factory in Northern Ireland. Rescue Effort **********Only Lotus's consulting business, and a rescue bid by British Car Auctions Group P.L.C., saved the company from going under. David Wickins, chairman of British Car Auctions, bought 25 percent of Lotus at 56 cents a share in 1983, became Lotus's chairman and sold his stake to G.M. in January for $1.80 a share. The stock is now trading at about $1.78. **********G.M. also bought stakes from two other major shareholders, and on Feb. 14 the company made a formal offer for the rest of Lotus, also at $1.80 a share. The largest remaining shareholder is the Toyota Motor Corporation, which has a 22 percent stake. So far, Toyota has not said whether it would sell. **********''We would like to own 100 percent,'' Mr. Eaton said, ''but if Toyota decides to remain a shareholder, they will keep their representation on the board.'' **********G.M. and Lotus have worked together since 1982, when Lotus began developing a new ''active suspension,'' a computer-controlled system that senses bumps in the road and instructs hydraulic jacks instead of shock absorbers how to adjust to provide a much smoother ride. Secret Contracts **********''Bob Eaton was really the first person to see the benefits of active suspension and the first to sign a contract with us'' in the United States to develop the system, Mr. Kimberley, an engineer himself, said. Since then, G.M. has supplied Lotus with several mostly secret research contracts, equal to about half the company's $45 million consulting orders for the next four years. **********The consulting business is Lotus's key asset and, right now, its only consistent profit maker. ''The car business is only sort of break-even,'' Mr. Kimberley said, adding, ''We're building it up now,'' through dealer networks in Europe and the United States, ''to get greater volume.'' **********In 1984, according to the company's most recent published reports, the consulting business represented 23 percent of Lotus's $23 million in sales and more than half of its operating profit. Pretax profits were $666,000 in 1984 and $455,000 on $13 million in sales for the first six months of 1985. Military Projects **********Lotus also works for Chrysler and a clutch of other auto companies, as well as on secret medical and military-related projects, the latter for the British Government. **********Lotus will continue to do this type of work, including handling assignments for auto companies that are competitors of G.M., the American auto maker has said. **********Neither G.M. nor Lotus would disclose in detail their future plans. But generally, they said, G.M. units will farm out engineering projects to Lotus that are too cumbersome and expensive to do in-house. Mr. Eaton said Goals Listed Mr. Kimberley said his goal is for sales of $85 million by 1990. The consulting business is expected to grow at a rate of 60 percent to 70 percent a year, he said, adding that next year Lotus would begin building the X100, working toward annual sales of 3,000 units. That, he said, should swing the car side of the business solidly into the black. **********G.M.'s stake in Lotus, the company's latest and smallest move in a recent list of purchases, came after another company - which neither G.M. nor Lotus would name - apparently approached British Car Auctions about acquiring its stake in the sports car maker. **********''There was a series of negotiations with three sets of people; G.M. offered the best deal all the way around,'' said Alan Curtis, Lotus's deputy chairman, who is expected to replace Mr. Wickins as chairman. **********At Lotus's headquarters, a worker testing a high-powered engine in the lab agreed. ''With G.M., we might get some technology we wouldn't have been able to afford,'' he said above the noise from the engine. ''And now our jobs are more secure.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/business/washington-watch-conrail-dispute-growing.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Stuart", "pub_date": "1986-02-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Conrail Dispute Growing", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON WATCH; Conrail Dispute Growing", "body_text": " **********The House is gearing up for battle with the Reagan Administration over the Transportation Department's plan to sell the Government's 85 percent interest in Conrail to the Norfolk Southern Corporation, although it will be late March or April before hearings on the proposed sale resume in the House. **********That does mean things are quiet. **********Representative John D.

Seven Up and Dr Pepper, the No. 3 and No. 4 soft-drink companies, each has about 7 percent of the market. Strong Action on Merger **********Antitrust experts said the F.T.C.'s vote was the strongest action taken by the Reagan Administration against a corporate merger and was the first time the Administration had clearly defined the limits of its laissez-faire antitrust policies. **********While Philip Morris, which bought Seven-Up in 1978 for $515 million, said it was still seeking a buyer, analysts predicted that any purchaser would face a daunting task trying to recapture Seven-Up's falling market share. They said few beverage concerns had the marketing clout to match either Coke or Pepsi in the soft-drink market and to rejuvenate the Seven-Up line. **********''If Philip Morris, one of the nation's great consumer marketing companies, with a bankroll that could choke a horse, cannot beat Coke's or Pepsi's distribution system, I would be hard pressed to say what buyer could,'' said George E. Thompson, beverage analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities. Mr. Thompson predicted the ''Seven-Up brand will continue deterioriating at a fairly rapid pace.'' **********Sources close to the merger talks said that Philip Morris was concerned that litigation, which could take several months, would reduce Seven-Up's value to another potential bidder. ''Seven-Up is in bad shape and Philip Morris could not afford to leave it in limbo much longer,'' one source said. Speculation on Buyers **********Wall Street sources speculated about possible buyers for Seven-Up, including Anheuser-Busch and the Seagram Company. But a source close to Seagram said there was ''little possibility'' the company would be interested. Anheuser-Busch declined to comment. **********''The Federal Trade Commission threatened to take the matter to court, and we've decided to terminate the agreement,'' said George Knox, director of communications for Philip Morris, the cigarette and consumer products company. **********''We're disappointed that the F.T.C. objected to the acquisition,'' said James Griffith, a spokesman for Pepsico. ''We think clearly that Pepsico had the best chance of rejuvenating the Seven-Up brand.'' Mr. Griffith added that Pepsi was still interested in buying Seven-Up's international operations. **********In its short filing seeking a preliminary injunction against the proposed $470 million acquisition of Dr Pepper by Coke, the F.T.C. argued that any combination of the two would increase market concentration in certain unspecified geographic areas, make entry by other companies into those markets more difficult and ease ''collusion among participatants in the relevant markets.'' **********The commission also argued that other companies' cost of doing business would rise and competitiveness would decline, ''all of which increase the likelihood that firms in the market will increase prices and restrict output of carbonated soft drinks.'' Mixed Opinion on 2d Deal **********Opinion was divided on the chances of the Coke-Dr Pepper merger. Some analysts predicted that Coke would call off the deal, even though the company indicated today that it planned to follow through. ''Their plan was to frustrate the Pepsi-Seven-Up deal in the first place,'' asserted Martin Romm, analyst at the First Boston Corporation. **********Others predicted that with the cancellation of the Pepsi sale, the Coke-Dr Pepper merger would mean less market concentration and might therefore be less objectionable to the Administration and the courts. **********Sources close to the Seven-Up talks said Philip Morris attorneys called Pepsico attorneys Monday night to tell them the company was pulling out. **********The sources said the F.T.C.'s opposition, as well as a temporary restraining order granted last week by a Federal District Court in Columbus, Ga., in a case filed by the Royal Crown Companies pressed Philip Morris to act. They said the company had exercised a clause in the agreement that allowed it to cancel anytime after June 1 if the merger had not been completed by then."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/01/business/safeguards-set-by-eastern-air.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 172, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Safeguards Set By Eastern Air", "print_headline": "Safeguards Set By Eastern Air", "body_text": " **********The directors of Eastern Air Lines yesterday approved measures aimed at protecting shareholders in the event of a proposed takeover and to guard against a partial tender offer. **********There have been no takeover bids for the carrier, which is in the midst of a struggle with its three main unions to cut its labor costs in order to avoid default with its lenders. **********A large loss in the fourth quarter and the danger of default have depressed Eastern's stock, which could make it an attractive target if it succeeds in its effort to restructure costs.

But despite the gains posted by most companies, they added, earnings as a whole were unsatisfactorily low because of continued stiff foreign competition and a general sluggishness in the economy. **********A compilation by The New York Times of third-quarter results from 303 companies shows that 185 posted profits that were higher than last year. But 72 companies had a decline in earnings, 44 reported losses and 2 were unchanged. **********The Commerce Department releases its official tally on third-quarter earnings this month, and economists have estimated that overall earnings would increase between 5 and 8 percent for the period, to around $240 billion before taxes. **********''We should not be surprised to see somewhat higher corporate profits in this, the fourth year of economic recovery, but overall profits are still not what they should be considering the mature phase of the business cycle,'' said Walter Joelson, chief economist for the General Electric Company. **********Although many companies reported improved earnings during the quarter, such gains often were offset by sharp declines posted by other companies within the same industry. **********Economists said that some industries were beginning to feel the effect of the decline in the dollar, which should make imports more expensive and exports more attractive. **********The chemical and paper industries, for example, have clearly benefited from the dollar's fall, making them more competitive in both foreign and domestic markets, economists said. The decline of the dollar also had a favorable impact on earnings derived from foreign subsidiaries, they added. **********Nonetheless, the continuing influx of products from overseas kept prices down in many industries during the quarter. That lowered profit margins and thus limited capital spending, the economists noted. **********Also helping to fuel the modest growth in profits was a sharp decline in mortgage rates from a year ago, economists said. **********The lower rates spurred construction of new homes and sales of existing homes. That in turn caused an increase in sales of major appliances and furniture during the quarter. **********Manufacturing, finance, airlines and telecommunications were other industries that performed well during the quarter. **********Industrial and energy sector profits were down, as many domestic oil and gas companies, railroads, computer makers and auto manufacturers performed poorly. **********A dip in crude oil prices hurt exploration and production activities at major oil companies, computer companies continued to suffer from an industry-wide slump and the auto makers used expensive financing incentives to unclog large inventories. **********There were notable exceptions within these industries, however.

The Big 3 Magazines **********Although there are more than 100 magazines covering one aspect or another of the automobile business, the general interest segment of the market has been dominated in the past, like the domestic auto industry, by a Big Three - Car and Driver, Road & Track and Motor Trend. **********But just as new entries are pushing into the American car market, the ''buff book'' field is also becoming more crowded. Later this month a new magazine called Automobile will hit the newsstands. It is the product of David E. Davis Jr., the former editor and publisher of Car and Driver, and of Rupert Murdoch's magazine group. Since Mr. Davis is given credit for developing Car and Driver's distinctive style, Automobile is attracting more interest than most fledgling magazines. **********And earlier this year, Autoweek, a weekly publication from Crain Communications, switched from a tabloid newspaper to a magazine format. Autoweek's editors say their aim is to attract readers with more up-to-date information than the monthly publications can provide. Broad Influence Seen **********Auto executives say there is little doubt that these magazines sway car buyers' decisions and the car companies stage elaborate advance previews in hopes of winning favorable reviews for new models. **********The magazines also have an influence on what kinds of models will be produced. Enthusiastic advance reporting on the project that became the mid-engined, plastic-skinned Pontiac Fiero has been credited by General Motors officials with keeping the project from being killed in corporate-level reviews. **********Similarly, executives of foreign car companies say the auto magazines gave American buyers a reason to try previously unknown makes. ''The immediate impact of the buff books is not as important as the long-term effect,'' said A. B. Shuman, an official of Mercedes-Benz of North America. ''They are thought leaders who influence the attitudes of people other people turn to for advice on cars.'' Opinions Solicited **********''Don Petersen, our chairman, has met with the buff press in the past and will do so in the future,'' said Louis E. Lataif, Ford's vice president for sales. ''We let them see some ideas we have for future products and ask them for their comments.'' **********For all their acknowledged influence on auto design and public attitudes, however, the enthusiast publications generally shy away from social issues, such as air pollution, highway safety and suburban sprawl. **********Nor is their endorsement enough to make a car model a success if the hardware is not right for the market. The Merkur, a car Ford is importing from West Germany, was widely praised by the buffs when it was introduced in 1985, but sales fell far short of expectations. Ford officials have since said they erred in making the car appear too European for American buyers. ''Long term, a product succeeds or fails on its merits,'' Mr. Lataif said. **********Although their franchise is cars, the Big Three magazines are not aimed at people with grease under their fingernails. They are aimed at readers affluent enough to buy expensive cars and pay somebody else to service them. They even have literary aspirations. A Stress on Quality **********''I don't understand why people get all warm and moist about magazines that write about politics or ballet and then dismiss us as 'just car magazines,' '' Mr. Davis said. ''We're working to provide quality in the prose, in the photography and in the design.'' **********Recent issues of the magazines have included articles on a father's attitude toward the risks of teaching his son to ride a motorcycle at high speed, a retrospective on the death of James Dean, the actor, in a Porsche Spyder and a mathematical model for calculating how long traffic jams will last. **********The magazines' staffs drive and evaluate almost all cars on the market, but they devote disproportionate attention to high-priced exotic models that most readers could not aspire to own, because experience has shown that even reading about high-performance cars has an appeal. The cover of a recent issue of Road & Track featured an article on a speed competition among a Ferrari GTO, Lamborghini Countach 5000S and Ferrari Testarossa. The minimum price for one of the cars: $115,000. Top speed: 181 miles an hour in the Ferrari Testarossa. Individual Personalities **********Each of the Big Three magazines has developed a personality over the 30 years or so that they have been in existence. Motor Trend bills itself as ''the world's automotive authority'' and limits itself largely to car tests, future product reports and a small amount of racing news. Road & Track gives extensive coverage to the international Grand Prix racing circuit and classic cars. Car and Driver projects an image of smart-alecky wildness and devotes long accounts to such events as ''One Lap of America,'' a marathon drive around the periphery of the continent. **********''The Road & Track reader dresses in tweeds and smokes a pipe,'' said Leon Mandel, the editor of Autoweek and a former member of the staffs of two of the monthly publications. ''The Car and Driver reader wears a tattersall vest with a Bill Blass suit for the shock value, and the Motor Trend reader wanders around the house in a cardigan sweater.'' **********According to Mr. Davis, who, by his own account had ''part of my face scraped off'' in an auto racing accident years ago, the aim of Automobile is to showcase the upper end of the automobile market for affluent readers. **********''I wouldn't know what to write for semiliterate drag racers,'' he said at the magazine's headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''I want guys who made a bundle when their computer company went public and are thinking about buying a new Ferrari to be reading the magazine. The whole theme is that we are having the time of our lives with cars.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/business/japan-air-rival-s-debut.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japan Air Rival's Debut", "print_headline": "Japan Air Rival's Debut", "body_text": " **********All Nippon Airways made its debut today as Japan's second international carrier, breaking Japan Air Lines' 30-year monopoly.

Aquino ended her presidential campaign with a mammoth rally here that drew hundreds of thousands of singing supporters, the Government announced that the military was prepared to deploy troops on election day. **********The announcement reversed an earlier assurance by the armed forces Chief of Staff, Gen. Fabian C. Ver, that the armed forces would remain in their barracks during the voting on Friday, and it raised immediate protests here that the military would now be poised to influence the outcome. **********The move puts General Ver, President Ferdinand E. Marcos's cousin and most trusted military officer, in a controlling position during the election. **********The rally in central Manila for Mrs. Aquino, which drew as many as a million people according to some estimates, was one of the largest in Philippine history. **********It occurred as some highly placed backers of President Marcos conceded that Mr. Marcos might be facing defeat by Mrs. Aquino. They expressed concern over what might follow the election. **********The Government announcement published today said the commission on elections had deputized General Ver to direct the armed forces in overseeing election procedures. **********''You add a whole new element when you bring the military with their weapons and their tradition of abuse into the electoral process,'' a Western diplomat here said. Growing Uncertainty on Result **********Uncertainties surrounding the result of the voting Friday have grown, and the election appears beyond safe prediction. **********The major factors will be the popular vote, the effect of fraud and the role of the military. **********Some Filipinos say the United States could also play a decisive part by pressuring the loser to accept defeat. If Mrs. Aquino wins, some say, a quick recognition of her victory by the White House could help block any plans to resist the result. **********It is not yet clear how Mrs. Aquino's obvious popularity among both urban and rural voters will translate into votes. **********Local loyalties, two decades of political debts and traditional respect for a strong leader are expected to exert a strong pull for Mr. Marcos. **********It is also not clear how thoroughly the President's forces might be able to influence the result by fraud at various points, from the ballot box through several stages of counting and transmission of results. **********The focus is on the municipal and provincial transmission points, where election experts say local officials, mostly Marcos backers, can switch tally sheets recording hundreds of thousands of votes. Role of the Military **********The role of the military in each of these stages could be decisive. Based on the experience of previous Philippines elections, soldiers could be used to intimidate opposition voters from entering polling places, to create diversionary disturbances that would facilitate fraud, or to engage directly in the removal or switching of ballot boxes. **********The chairman of a nationwide citizens' group that will monitor the vote said Monday that his organization could help reduce both ''retail'' cheating at polling places and ''wholesale'' fraud in the canvassing of tally sheets. But the chairman, Jose Concepcion, who heads the National Movement for Free Elections, added, ''Of course, if guns are used, the story is different.'' **********The role of the military in the election appears to be complicated by a split in its ranks that was first publicly disclosed by Mr. Marcos in December. He said the split was between troops loyal to General Ver and those loyal to his deputy, Gen. Fidel Ramos. **********At a news conference this morning that followed the announcement of the deputization of General Ver, General Ramos said that only the Philippine Constabulary, which he heads, has the authority to police the elections. **********Asked whether he believed the entire military supported honest elections, General Ramos replied, ''I cannot speak for the entire officer corps.'' **********The subject of possible military influence on the outcome of the election has come to the fore in recent days as some backers of Mr. Marcos have begun to express pessimism. Contacts With Opposing Camp **********An indication of this nervousness is that a number of Marcos supporters seem to be hedging their bets. Some are said to have sought private contacts with members of the Aquino camp. **********According to airline sources, many others have bought tickets out of the Philippines for themselves, their families and even their servants during the period of the election. **********At a luncheon address today before the Makati Business Club, Mr. Marcos signed a string of decrees benefiting business interests. But he received a markedly cooler response than Mrs. Aquino did in an appearance there the day before. **********He challenged Mrs. Aquino to meet him Wednesday in a debate under conditions that she rejected earlier as favoring the President. In a later statement, Mr. Marcos also said he would not take part in a debate that had been scheduled this week on American television.  [ Advisers to Mr. Marcos notified ABC News that the debate, scheduled for broadcast by ABC Wednesday night, would be canceled, spokesmen for ABC said.  [ Mr. Marcos's American public-relations advisers apparently told producers for the ABC News program ''Nightline'' in Manila of the decision. But Laura Wessner, spokesman for ABC News, said that Ted Koppel, the ABC anchorman for the program, received a personal commitment from Mr. Marcos last weekend and that ABC would not consider the event canceled until it heard from Mr. Marcos himself. ]  The possibility of fraud in the voting has become so accepted that election projections take it into account. **********Mrs. Aquino says her backers have told her she must get about two-thirds of the votes to overcome cheating. **********One of Mr. Marcos's own close associates made an elaborate projection the other day, based on private opinion polls that give Mrs. Aquino an edge of about 60 percent to 40 percent. **********If 2 million of the nation's 27 million votes are ''pre-cooked'' through pre-election fraud, he said, and 80 percent of the remaining voters cast ballots as they have in the past, Mrs. Aquino would win about 12 million to the President's 8 million votes. **********Give Mr. Marcos another 2 million votes ''already in the boxes'' through further fraud, he said, and have his backers ''pay off, buy off, scare off'' another million to switch from her to him, and the vote would be deadlocked. **********One official close to the President said references last week by Mr. Marcos to polls that showed him ''way high, way high'' were ''pure fantasy.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/09/business/business-people-new-melville-chairman-to-keep-to-strategies.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 351, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "New Melville Chairman To Keep to Strategies", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Melville Chairman To Keep to Strategies", "body_text": " **********The Melville Corporation, the giant specialty retailer associated with such names as Thom McAn shoes, Marshall's and Kay-Bee Toy and Hobby Stores, has named Stanley P.

A glance upward from the basement provides an interesting perspective - a fireplace on the second floor hangs precipitously from the side of a wall with no apparent support. **********The activity is part of an ambitious preservation program that by the end of the year will restore 82 buildings, most of them abandoned, as rental housing in the Arbor Hill section of Albany. The section, one of the most devastated in the city, sits near its northern edge. **********The Vulcan Development and Management Corporation of Albany, the project's developer, purchased most of the properties from Albany County, which had obtained them in tax foreclosures. The buildings, most of them only shells, cost an average of $4,000 apiece. **********Funding for the $13 million project, called Historic Arbor Hill, came from private and government sources, said Mark Simmons, Vulcan's president. About $9.5 million was provided by the State Housing Finance Authority and Urban Development Action Grants from the Federal Government. Vulcan raised another $3.5 million by tapping equity syndicators, who sought the project's historic tax credits. **********The project is part of the ever-continuing urban cycle, which this time is seeing Arbor Hill's two major thoroughfares, Clinton Avenue and Ten Broeck Street, moving upward again. **********In 1850, according to William Kennedy's ''O Albany!'' a man using the pseudonym Knickerbocker wrote, ''Arbor Hill is rapidly improving.'' **********''A great many fine residences have been built within a few months, and now that the park is to be enclosed men of taste are attracted thitherward, we shall expect it soon to become the most fashionable part of town,'' Knickerbocker concluded. **********When first developed, Arbor Hill was, indeed, the home of wealthy Albany merchants, who built large and luxurious houses there. This time around, few expect Arbor Hill to become the most fashionable part of the city. But the change is clearly going to be dramatic. **********More than 35 buildings, with about 100 apartments, have been restored so far. Examples of delicate lattice work, grand entrance hallways and oriel windows line the project area, which stretches for more than a mile and a half. **********Mr. Simmons, who is 34 years old, said he saw the Arbor Hill area, the scene of some of Albany's most serious drug and crime problems, ''as the last downtown neighborhood that had not been rehabilitated.'' **********For decades, Arbor Hill has had a large minority population, and when Mr. Simmons first started talking about such a large rehabilitation project, many residents were concerned about the area's gentrification. **********Primarily, the community wanted guarantees that some of the apartments would be made available to low-to-moderate-income people. It also wanted neighborhood residents hired for some of the construction jobs. **********Negotiations with community groups - and some state and Federal regulations - have resolved some of the issues. Mr. Simmons, for example, says he will set aside 40 percent, or 93, of his apartments for households making less than $24,000 a year. He also guaranteed that 15 percent of the total construction budget would go to minority businesses and another 6 percent to businesses owned by women. **********While those agreements quieted most critics, some activists still question the project. Roger Markovics, coordinator of United Tenants of Albany, said that reserving 40 percent of the units - which is 20 percent more than required by law - for families with low and moderate incomes was not enough. **********But Mr. Markovics acknowledged that his group was ''much more angry and upset at developers who do not have any units reserved for low-to-moderate-income people.'' **********The renovation of the buildings is costing Vulcan Development about $42 a square foot, or $110,000 a building. Monthly rentals in the project are running about $350 to $450 for a large one-bedroom apartment, with two-bedroom units at $475 to $550. **********Renovating the Arbor Hill buildings has been complex because the developers must preserve as much of the original ornamentation as possible and yet remain within a budget that will keep the units affordable. **********Walking through the apartments, Albert DeSalvo, Vulcan's senior project manager, pointed to some of the ways the developers had saved features and money. **********In several buildings, for example, the cornice work in some rooms winds only around half or three-quarters of the ceilings. The other sections, Mr. DeSalvo explained, had been lost to water or fire damage. **********The developers were not obligated, he said, to completely restore the cornice work. ''This is historic preservation,'' Mr. DeSalvo stressed, ''not restoration.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/17/business/zondervan-stake.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 75, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Zondervan Stake", "print_headline": "Zondervan Stake", "body_text": " **********An investment group said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it holds a 7.3 percent stake in the Zondervan Corporation and may seek control of the Bible-publishing company.

Marcos from the Philippines has been altered to read, ''Pinochet Resigned and Went Into Exile.'' **********But those who write or post such things and those who spend most of their waking hours analyzing Chilean politics consider it unlikely that Gen. Augusto Pinochet could be so easily removed after 12 years as Chile's ruler. **********The explanation for that belief may lie in the other Halley-Pinochet line making the rounds in Santiago: As the comet began its movement away from Earth in its 75-year cycle, the 70-year-old President bade it farewell with the words, ''Until next time.'' **********While there is continuous public debate in Chile, with encouragement from the United States, about the possibility of freely electing a new president in 1989 or sooner and reinstituting all the trappings of democratic pluralism, General Pinochet himself has given no sign that he finds such ideas appealing. **********Violent Coup in 1973 **********He came to power in a violent coup in 1973, toppling the elected coalition Government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a Marxist, at a time when many Latin American countries were falling to military control. **********But the general has so far successfully resisted the recent cycle that has seen other Latin American Governments return to civilian rule. And, in his effort to end the appeal of Marxism to a significant part of the Chilean population, General Pinochet has used tactics that have earned him an international image as a notorious violator of human rights. **********Human rights groups in Chile have documented the cases of about 700 people who disappeared after being detained by security forces, mostly during the mid-1970s. **********In addition, torture and arbitrary detention have been widely reported, although human rights groups say the degree of torture being used has declined in recent years. Political opponents have been regularly sent into exile, both abroad and to remote sections of Chile. **********During the Carter Administration, the Pinochet Government was directly implicated in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington that killed Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United States who had begun an international campaign against General Pinochet. An American associate, Ronni Moffitt, also died in the explosion. Efforts by the United States to extradite three Chileans in the case were rebuffed. A Hard Man to Persuade **********But despite his reputation and the pressures on him, people who know the general or study him believe he intends to occupy the Moneda presidential palace for the rest of his days. **********The Reagan Administration, like many Chileans, has already learned the difficulty of trying to persuade General Pinochet to do something he does not want to do. **********Langhorne A. Motley, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, decided after a meeting with the Chilean leader that he was ''the toughest nut I've ever seen.'' **********''He makes Somoza and the rest of those guys look like a bunch of patsies,'' Mr. Motley added, referring to the late Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. **********When he came to Chile in February 1985 to seek an end to a recently imposed state of siege, Mr. Motley recalled in an interview in Washington, he was received cordially at the Moneda by General Pinochet, and they posed together for news photographers. Then the niceties ended. **********''The photographers were not even out the door,'' Mr. Motley said, ''when he put his finger under my nose and said, 'We're not a colony of the United States, relations have not been very good between us for a long time, we almost went to war in the last century, and I don't take advice.' '' **********''I told him I was not there to lecture but that I wanted to tell him what the reaction was outside, in Europe and the United States,'' Mr. Motley continued. ''I told him that if he were writing the script for the Communists, he couldn't write it better than he was doing then. **********''He responded with a long lecture about how he was the No. 1 Communist target in the world. I said I agreed but that he was helping the leftists in places like Washington and Paris and that he ought to do something to let the air out of their balloon.'' **********Several months later, when United States support for a major World Bank loan hung in the balance, General Pinochet lifted the state of siege. **********Aside from the toughness that General Pinochet has demonstrated to more than one high-level Washington envoy, Chileans say he has a number of qualities that set him apart from most other authoritarian rightist rulers. The corruption issue is always at the top of their list. **********''I don't think Pinochet is corrupt or that this is a corrupt Government,'' said one of the countless civilians who have served in the Pinochet Cabinet until falling into disfavor. **********''There's a little corruption,'' the former minister added, ''but it's not a way of life in Chile. We do not have an Imelda. You are not going to find Gucci shoes all over the place when they open up the Moneda.'' **********But whether corruption is a significant factor may hinge on whether the Pinochet administration is judged against other countries or against Chilean history. Beach and Weekend Houses **********The Chilean tradition has been for presidents to live in threadbare gentility, occupying their own homes and, in some cases, walking to their office. One wealthy critic of General Pinochet said, ''We've been accustomed to presidents who couldn't afford to buy a bicycle when they left office.'' **********General Pinochet occupies a comfortable house, in the affluent Las Condes neighborhood, that is officially the army commander's residence, but it has been substantially improved during the Pinochet tenure. He has a beach house and a weekend house in a scenic rural area near Santiago. A presidential mansion built in recent years in a Santiago suburb was not occupied after Israeli security experts said it would be an easy target for terrorist attack from nearby mountains. **********There have been a few charges that the Pinochet family - which includes the general's wife, Lucia, their five grown children and the children's spouses - has used its position to expand holdings in real estate. **********A civil complaint was filed by a group of lawyers from the opposition Christian Democratic Party two years ago charging that the general acquired land for the weekend house at far less than the market value, after using the Government as the intermediate buyer. The Government responded that it had merely sold the President some leftover pieces of road right of way and had done the same for other homeowners in the area. The complaint has not proceeded to the investigation stage. **********Although polls indicate Chileans have a strong desire to return to elected government, General Pinochet still has his defenders. They are people who believe he did, in fact, save Chile from Communism and chaos by overthrowing President Allende, and who still fear the uncertainty of a future that would bring back the freewheeling politics of the past. **********Gen. Gustavo Leigh Guzman, the former air force commander, who played a leading role in organizing the military coup that led to President Allende's death, said the question of how long the military Government would remain in power was not discussed in the confused days before the armed forces made their move. **********General Leigh, who was forced out of the Government and military leadership by General Pinochet in 1978, said he had expressed the view soon after the coup that ''three or four years ought to be enough time to reorder the country.'' **********''At first, Pinochet was in agreement,'' General Leigh said, ''but he rapidly began to change. He came up with the phrase, 'Goals and not timetables.' '' **********Many people say that General Pinochet's role model is Franco and that he wants to leave Chile in the hands of a completely new generation cleansed of the political sins of the past. But in a recent interview with a French magazine writer, one of his rare encounters with foreign journalists, he was quoted as having said his favorite personality in French history was Louis XIV, the monarch who proclaimed himself and the state to be synonymous. **********General Leigh said that when he read the reprint of the interview in a Chilean magazine, he thought General Pinochet ''must have been drunk.'' Then he remembered that drinking was not one of the President's habits."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/business/business-digest-monday-june-16-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, JUNE 16, 1986", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, JUNE 16, 1986", "body_text": " **********The Economy Further declines in interest rates this summer are seen in light of weak economic data for May, but a discount rate cut by the Fed may hinge on Japan and West Germany acting first.

He and his wife, Miriam Bocock Selva, have a daughter, Miriam Elizabeth, 16 years old, and two sons, Jose Simon and Javier Enrique, 13 and 8 years old. Mr. Azcona says quiet pursuits such as table tennis, books and movies are his favorite ways of relaxing. **********Despite being seen as a somewhat stiff disciplinarian, Mr.Azcona's family appears to bring out his softer side. When asked just before winning the presidency if he would be emotionally crushed should be fail to emerge the victor, Mr. Azcona responded with seeming conviction that he would accept defeat in a good grace and enjoy life at home. **********''If I win,'' he said, ''I'll have to send my daughter to the United States to university since she will be pestered here for being the daughter of the President. I don't look forward to having to send her away.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/04/world/the-un-today-june-4-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 43, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

In the cash market, the price for the long bond was 100 29/32, down 27/32, to yield 7.17 percent. **********The shorter end of the Treasury cash market took less of a beating, and by late in the day prices were off by 3/32 to 10/32 for actively traded issues. The rate on three-month Treasury bills was 5.81 percent, up 4 basis points, and the rate on six-month bills was 5.85 percent, also up 4 basis points. **********''The market was actually pretty strong until about 2:30 P.M., then it all came apart in five minutes,'' said one trader, who contended that a price correction was not a particular surprise given the generally firm tone of the last several trading sessions and the long rally that preceded last Thursday's cut in the discount rate. **********Prices actually spurted earlier in the day in response to rumors that Paul A. Volcker, Federal Reserve Board chairman, and the head of the Bank of Japan had agreed to let the dollar fall further. The rumors apparently stemmed from advance word on an article published today in Japan's Nihon Keizai Shimbun that previews the Fed chairman's July 23 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Advance summaries of the major articles to be carried by the Japanese publication are available to many of securities houses. **********Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities, said that a separate article in the same paper based on an interveiw with an unnamed source at the Bank of Japan is perhaps more significant. Mr. Brusca said the article quotes the Bank of Japan source as saying that the Japanese central would come under very strong pressure to cut its discount rate if the dollar falls to 155 yen, the first time Japanese officials have publicly stated such a target level. The dollar was trading last yesterday below 158 yen. Speculation on Japanese Moves **********Mr. Brusca said that speculation about a Japanese move on the discount rate was unlikely to spark much improvement in the longer end of the Treasury market, where, he said, investors have become more concerned about long-term inflation prospects. **********''I would expect the speculation to help the short end some, because short rates are the ones most sensitive to discount rate cuts, but I think the main result will be a steepening of the yield curve,'' he said. **********In recent weeks Japanese investors in United States Treasury securities, who generally prefer issues with longer maturities, have been selling such issues and concentrating on issues with seven- and ten-year maturities. **********In the municipal bond market, investors and analysts are looking for a surge of new issues and refundings over the next several months on the assumption that uncertainty caused by the pending tax revision legislation will soon be cleared up. With House and Senate tax conferees scheduled to hold their first meeting today, state and local officials have moved into high gear on their lobbying campaign to knock out provisions in the House bill that greatly restrict the use and sale of tax-exempt municipal bonds. **********Harrison J. Goldin, the Comptroller of New York City, has written to key members of the House and Senate outlining what he described as the most troublesome positions of the House bill and urging adoption of the less restrictive Senate measure. Mr. Goldin's letter cited as ''especially onerous and harmful'' House provisions that would require 5 percent of the proceeds of a bond issue to be used within 30 days and that all proceeds be spent within three years. If such requirements are not met the entire issue would lose its tax-exempt status. Urban Renewal Projects **********Mr. Goldin said other House restrictions on use of tax-exempt bond proceeds by nongovernmental entities could threaten financing for urban renewal projects, cultural centers, libraries, museums, theaters and zoos that are owned by municipalities but operated by nonprofit corporations. **********In Pennsylvania, Gov. Dick Thornburgh signed special legislation last week that will allow suspension of various provisions in state laws on tax-exempt bond allocation in order to accommodate financing that might otherwise be curtailed by proposed Federal restrictions. Alaska, Louisiana and Minnesota have responded to the House proposals, which currently have an effective date of Sept. 1, by turning to the taxable markets for some of their financing needs. **********For example, the Louisana Housing Finance Agency, offered $150 million of taxable multifamily housing revenue bonds yesterday through underwriters led by Drexel, Burnham Lambert. The bonds, which mature on July 1, 1996, were priced at par to yield 8.61 percent. Managers for the deal at Drexel Burnham said that the yield was about 100 basis points higher than what it would have been if the issue could have been offered in the tax-exempt market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/13/business/advertising-this-time-an-agency-split-up.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1986-08-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 623, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; This Time, An Agency Split-Up", "print_headline": "Advertising; This Time, An Agency Split-Up", "body_text": " **********AFTER a seemingly endless series of mergers and strategic alliances among advertising agencies, something different happened yesterday: An agency split up with one of its subsidiaries. **********The Ogilvy Group announced that it would sell its 40 percent stake in Hal Riney & Partners to Mr. Riney, whose San Francisco-based shop now becomes a fully independent agency billing about $120 million a year. **********The sale would complete a slow separation of Mr. Riney from Ogilvy. After building Ogilvy's San Francisco office from scratch starting in 1977, Mr. Riney arranged to have the unit spun off as a subsidiary under his name in late 1984. It is now one of the nation's hottest shops, best known for its popular and award-winning commercials for Gallo Winery's Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers. **********The companies declined to disclose the sale price, but they said the amount had been based on a formula that considered future earnings. **********Both Ogilvy and Mr. Riney cited account conflicts as the primary reason for the split. Ogilvy handles General Foods' Maxwell House coffee, while Riney handles Nestle's MJB coffee. And more important, Ogilvy is a major agency for Seagram, handling its wine coolers and other brands, while Riney is Gallo's main agency. **********''We had some unresolved client conflicts,'' Mr. Riney said in a telephone interview, citing the Seagram-Gallo situation as the major problem. ''There was so much overlap there that we felt that could develop into a very uncomfortable situation.'' **********It was also clear that while under the Ogilvy umbrella, Mr. Riney's agency would never be able to grow significantly because its parent already had clients in most product categories, putting them off-limits as new business possibilities. **********''One of the frustrations of working with Ogilvy is that they have covered most of the bases in the business, so we couldn't talk to a lot of companies,'' Mr. Riney said. ''We've turned down discussions for $70 million worth of business in the last year and a half.'' **********Mr. Riney said there were many categories he would like to expand in, including packaged goods. Gallo is the agency's biggest client; Riney also handles Swanson's dinners for Campbell Soup and does corporate and new product advertising for Anheuser-Busch. **********Mr. Riney's agency now will undoubtedly be courted by other agencies and agency groups that would love to have his creative talents and strong West Coast representation. But he said that he was looking forward to escaping the mega-agency trend and that he had no plans to sell out elsewhere or seek another partner. **********''It's an opportunity for someone to get rich quickly, but it's honestly not something I foresee,'' he said. **********One client category that Mr. Riney may be able to fill in the next year is that of Presidential campaigns. He was the main creative force behind some of President Reagan's 1984 campaign spots, and with the 1988 campaign beginning to heat up, it is not at all unlikely that one of the aspirants may seek him out. **********''It's something I'd be interested in if the right candidate came along,'' he said, noting that his involvement in politics was another thing that made Ogilvy uncomfortable. So far, though, he remains unattached. ''George Bush hasn't called yet,'' he said. **********William E. Phillips, chairman and chief executive of the Ogilvy Group, was philosophical about the split. ''Our business has always been a tapestry of combinations and separations,'' he said. And, invoking one of Mr. Riney's best-known lines - written and spoken by Mr. Riney himself at the end of Gallo wine commercials - Mr. Phillips wished Mr. Riney ''all the best'' in his independent venture."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/17/business/advertising-us-news-to-publish-edition-in-chinese.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Stevenson", "pub_date": "1986-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. News to Publish Edition in Chinese", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; U.S. News to Publish Edition in Chinese", "body_text": " **********U.S. News & World Report said yesterday that it would publish a Chinese-language version of the newsweekly in conjunction with United Daily News in Taiwan, which will translate the magazine's contents and print the Chinese edition. **********U.S. News said the agreement would make it the first American news magazine with a Chinese-language edition.

Acid Rain a Top Issue **********Airborne pollutants, better known as acid rain, topped his agenda when Mr. Mulroney met Mr. Reagan for the first time a year ago in Quebec City.

Silverman, 23, an investor, who held a trading account at Moseley. **********The charges of insider trading involved securities in six takeovers, three of them unidentified. **********It was the second major insider trading case to be brought in the last two weeks. On May 12, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Dennis B. Levine, a former Wall Street takeover executive, of using inside information to buy or sell 54 different securities. **********United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who sought the indictments with the cooperation of the S.E.C. and the Postal Inspection Service, said in a news conference yesterday that the new case did not appear to be related to the Levine case. **********He did say for the first time that the Levine case was ''before the grand jury.'' Wall Street lawyers have said repeatedly that they expected the grand jury to indict Mr. Levine soon. **********Mr. David was arrested on the charges two months ago but was released on $25,000 bail. The criminal complaint related that the S.E.C. learned of the scheme through Arthur Ainsberg, a Marcus Schloss arbitrager who overheard Mr. Solomon talking on the phone about stocks. **********Mr. Ainsberg, the complaint said, taped a conversation in which Mr. Solomon spoke of the scheme, saying that Marcus Schloss & Company traded in Union Carbide on the inside information. **********In one example, the grand jury charged yesterday that two months ago, while Paul, Weiss was working for one of the unidentified clients, Mr. David, Mr. Shapiro and their mutual friend, Mr. Silverman, bought call options in the client company, a takeover target. They sold the options three days later, the indictment said, for a $139,750 profit. The indictment did not estimate total profits from the alleged insider trading. **********But Mr. Solomon and Mr. Salsbury apparently did not profit personally, and for that reason Wall Street took the view that the Government was trying to break new ground in the kind of individual who could be considered an insider. **********All except Mr. Silverman, who gave his address as Cranston, R.I., live on the East Side of Manhattan. **********Mr. Salsbury left an message on his answering machine saying that he would have no comment. A phone call to the number listed as Mr. Shapiro's was not returned. Mr. David's phone was said by New York Telephone to be out of order. Calls to the number listed as Mr. Solomon's were not returned. Mr. Silverman's phone at his Rhode Island home was not answered. Arraignments will be June 5. **********Mr. Giuliani said he could not identify three of the six securities involved in the scheme because they related to transactions that have not yet been announced. He identified the other three as Carbide, Avondale Mills and Damson Oil. Mr. David's employer at the time, Paul, Weiss, represented the GAF Corporation in its bid for Carbide, Dominion Textile in its bid for Avondale, and Damson, which was sought by Seaborg. **********One Wall Street figure, asking not to be identified, said that under long-standing practice, an individual who received inside information and made money with it - called a tippee - could be accused of using inside information. Now, he said, the Government appeared to be attempting to broaden this doctrine so that a tippee would be breaking the law, even if he personally did not profit, if he passed along information to someone else who then acted on the information. **********That is what appeared to be the case with Mr. Salsbury and Mr. Solomon.

The damage to burned-out luxury hotels and nightclubs near the Great Pyramids totaled hundreds of millions of dollars. **********What was more difficult to calculate was the damage to President Hosni Mubarak's shaky Government, already beset by an overwhelming economic breakdown and a growing lack of public confidence. **********Army tanks and armored vehicles stood in the main roads and intersections for a third day as soldiers manned roadblocks and checkpoints. **********More than 3,000 paramilitary policemen have been arrested, the Government says, along with at least 700 civilians who were said to have been involved in the uprising. Sporadic Gunfire Still Heard **********The situation appeared to be calming down today, although there was still sporadic gunfire in several areas. **********Even as Government officials gathered to meet President Mubarak near the Pyramids just southwest of the capital to inspect the damage this afternoon, heavy machine-gun and automatic weapons fire broke out nearby. **********The gunfire, rattling over the ridgeline as a procession of official black Mercedes limousines climbed the hill to the Pharaohs' tombs, came as soldiers subdued and captured another group of rebellious policemen at one of their camps in the area. **********His visit delayed until the gunfire died down, a grim-faced Mr. Mubarak said nothing to reporters as he viewed the destroyed Holiday Inn on a 13-minute tour of the area, while helicopter gunships circled overhead. **********About 20 burned-out automobiles rested on their axles in the parking lot; other hulks had been towed away. The hotel was a shambles of broken furniture and fixtures, blackened debris and scorched walls. A knotted white bedsheet, still hanging from one balcony railing, indicated where some guests had made a hasty exit. **********Mr. Mubarak was later overheard telling aides that the policemen involved should be court-martialed. A New Interior Minister **********Earlier in the day, Mr. Mubarak personally swore in Maj. Gen. Zaki Badr, a career internal security officer, as his new Interior Minister to replace Mr. Rushdi. General Badr now controls the the powerful security apparatus. **********General Badr, 60 years old, had previously been Governor of the city of Asyut, known as a stronghold of Islamic fundamentalism and the site of attacks against Coptic Christians. He had been named to curb violence there after Islamic fundamentalists assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981. **********The Government relaxed its curfew for six hours in the middle of the day to allow for the Moslem Sabbath prayers. There were no reports of trouble, and in a number of mosques, prayer leaders warned against the destruction of property and the spreading of rumors. Often here, mosques are surrounded by the riot police on Fridays for fear of fundamentalist disturbances, but today it was the police themselves who were being subdued. **********Tonight the Government announced the curfew would be cut back to dawn to dusk Saturday, although schools and universities were to be kept closed for another week.

''They test out lowest on the scores.'' After the initial outburst, the policemen appeared to have been joined by crowds of youthful Islamic fundamentalists who sacked and burned the nightclubs near the Pyramids which feature belly-dancers and are frequented by Saudi and and other Gulf Arabs seeking entertainment unavailable in their own countries. **********Witnesses said the youths cried ''Allah-o-Akhbar!''

Perelman, the multimillionaire investor, has sold his stock in CPC International Inc., Wall Street sources said yesterday, thus ending what appeared to be a hostile takeover attempt. In response to the news, the big food producer's shares plunged. **********In its announcement, CPC said (without mentioning Mr. Perelman) that it had agreed to buy some four million CPC shares from its own investment adviser, Salomon Brothers. According to Wall Street sources, Salomon had bought the stock from Mr. Perelman. **********With CPC no longer considered a takeover target, its stock plunged $6.50, to $78 a share. It was the day's most active issue, with nearly 8 million shares changing hands. **********Wall Street professionals, apparently taken by surprise, are believed to have been caught with as many as five million CPC shares, many bought at prices as high as $80 apiece or more. That would indicate total losses on the stock of at least $10 million. Goldman, Sachs & Company was reported to have held as much as one million shares. Phone calls to a number of Wall Street executives late in the day were not returned. **********CPC had announced late Tuesday, following a meeting of its directors, that it had asked Salomon Brothers to develop a plan to restructure the company. The board also authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million of the 48.7 million outstanding CPC shares, to be financed initially through borrowings but eventually repaid through a sale of assets. **********Reacting to that news, traders bid up the price of CPC stock early yesterday as high as $88.50. But by 1 P.M. came the company's announcement, saying that as part of its stock repurchases it had agreed to buy - at the market price - some four million of its shares. CPC said it understood that most of the shares were formerly held by a partnership, which it did not identify. CPC added that it planned further purchases under its buyback program. **********Neither Salomon nor Mr. Perelman would comment, but executives familiar with the development said Salomon initiated it, asking Mr. Perelman if he were willing to sell. These sources said Wall Street professionals, gambling that Mr. Perelman would pursue CPC tenaciously, had pushed up the price of the stock so sharply that it was, as one said, ''too high to play.'' **********Mr. Perelman is believed to have sold his stock early yesterday at $88.50, the high for the day. Two blocks totaling 3.95 million shares were traded yesterday at that price - one of 3.6 million shares and one of 350,000 shares. Arbitragers estimated yesterday that Mr. Perelman had paid roughly $70 a share, thus giving him a profit of about $18.50 a share, or $73 million. **********Mr. Perelman is expected to file papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing his position, presumably now sold. He is understood to have told CPC in the last few days that he had an interest in buying the company. He is also understood to be saying that when the price rose in the wake of CPC's restructuring announcement on Tuesday he concluded that the stock had risen higher than he wanted to pay and therefore decided to sell. **********The move is expected to open new possibilities for takeover targets unwilling to pay greenmail as well as for Wall Street raiders unwilling to accept it. In this instance the question of greenmail did not arise because apparently Salomon Brothers simply asked the investor if he would sell. CPC would not say when it would buy the stock from Salomon. **********Wall Street professionals, even so, are understood to be ''screaming,'' as one of them expressed it. **********Mr. Perelman, who took over the Revlon cosmetics business last year, also owns 15 percent of the Transworld Corporation, a hotel and food services company, and has said he intends to seek control of it."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/business/offices-move-boldly-backward-or-playfully-forward.html": {"writer_name": "Joseph Giovannini", "pub_date": "1986-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 882, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "OFFICES MOVE BOLDLY BACKWARD OR PLAYFULLY FORWARD", "print_headline": "OFFICES MOVE BOLDLY BACKWARD OR PLAYFULLY FORWARD", "body_text": " **********TECHNIMETRICS Inc. may only produce what amounts to sophisticated mailing lists, but its offices, which occupy a five-story brick building near Wall Street, are boldly charismatic. The entrance is filled with closely spaced, salmon-colored columns, one of which is broken in the middle; the top half hangs from the ceiling. **********Chief executive James Uffelman presides over the 60-person firm from a resolutely Egyptian-style wooden desk crafted by Wendell Castle. A white, shallow plaster frieze by sculptor Tom Otterness hovers in the ceiling of a conference room. A large portrait of several fat women looks out over the nautilus equipment in the company's gym. The painting is one of dozens chosen by Mr. Uffelman for the post-modern interior, which was designed by New York architect Peter Gluck and built at a cost of $4.5 million. **********It is a far cry from the typical corporate interiors of white walls and beige and gray carpets that were the design rule for well behaved corporations from the early 1960's through a few years ago. ''The major question then was whether the woods would be light or dark, and whether the art program would dictate oils or lithographs,'' said Patricia Conway, a partner in Kohn Pedersen Fox Conway, a New York interior design and architecture firm. ''It was acceptably, unmistakably corporate, and completely safe.'' **********Lately, many corporations have been seeking more exciting design alternatives, and finding that revitalizing their interiors can also revitalize their work forces. ''The kind of work we do, keeping data bases, can be monotonous and routine,'' says Carrie Thomas, vice president of research at Technimetrics. ''The environment is very important in keeping us stimulated - visually and, with the recreational facilities, physically.'' **********Interior designers and architects, encouraged by adventurous clients, are diversifying their approach to the corporate look. ''My clients said they wanted to make a statement with interiors,'' says Michael McDonough, a New York architect who recently completed offices with sloping ceilings and canted walls, surfaced in strongly patterned woods, for a real estate firm on Lexington Avenue. **********Other strong architectural statements of the last several years included post-modern interiors for Home Box Office, by Kohn Pedersen; highly elaborate, spatially complex interiors by Henry Smith-Miller for Solomon Equities, New York City developers; richly marbled interiors by Gatje Papachristou Smith for the Park Avenue offices of the Bank of Siena, and diaphanous interiors, with movable glass office cubicles, by Emilio Ambasz for the Financial Guarantee Insurance Company in Manhattan. **********Broadcast Arts, an animation and special effects company, furnished its downtown New York offices with props from commercials it films. For example, a peppermint green desk on roller skates, with two clocks set to different times, greets visitors. **********What distinguishes these interiors, many of which were done by some of the best architects in the country, from previous designs is that they are elaborate, spirited, singular, often even opulent. Most were done for middle-sized companies with a strong chief executive who can approve unique designs without having to submit them to executive boards. **********But large corporations have changed their look, too, though not in a radical direction. Instead, they have moved away from modern and back to traditional. For example, Kohn Pedersen Fox Conway created executive suites similar to Thomas Jefferson's own 18th-century designs for his home, Monticello, for Equitable Life Assurance's new Manhattan headquarters; its associated firm, Kohn Pedersen Fox, did interiors reminiscent of Vienna in the early 20th century for Procter & Gamble's newly expanded Cincinnati headquarters. Other traditional interiors include Merrill Lynch's corporate campus office at Princeton, N.J., Connecticut Bank and Trust in Hartford, Dillon, Read's headquarters in New York, Bally Manufacturing in Chicago, and the American Express office in New York. Many of them resemble old-guard men's clubs or English country houses. **********It was, perhaps, A.T.&T.'s new headquarters in Manhattan that was most responsible for establishing the traditional alternative to the modernist corporate image, breaking the assumption that corporations had to look progressive, cool, vaguely futuristic and alike. In 1979, New York architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee surprised the architectural and corporate worlds with their Chippendale-clock design for A.T.&T.'s high-rise. Inside was, of course, a Chippendale interior, done by ISD Inc. of New York. While there have always been traditional Morgan Bank-like interiors in American banking and law firms, what was different at A.T.&T. - and at Manufacturers Hanover and others that followed - is that architectural firms with national reputations were accepting commissions for interiors that were not modernist. **********Even Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the architectural firm that in the 1950's was largely responsible for inventing the glass and steel, beige-gray look that for a generation signified the American corporation, now also does traditional work. The firm recently completed the executive floors of Manufacturers Hanover Trust on Park Avenue in a traditional style, with crown and door moldings, wall paneling and patterned marble floors -all inside a glass and steel building that the firm had completed in 1961 for Union Carbide. The art includes Audubon prints; there are silver and crystal accessories on desks and bookshelves. The plate glass windows are covered in dark wood shutters that close off the view. Space is contained rather than open, traditional rather than modern."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/14/world/pakistani-visits-us-this-week-amid-reports-of-surge-in-opium.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1986-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 745, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PAKISTANI VISITS U.S. THIS WEEK AMID REPORTS OF SURGE IN OPIUM", "print_headline": "PAKISTANI VISITS U.S. THIS WEEK AMID REPORTS OF SURGE IN OPIUM", "body_text": " **********A sharp increase in the illegal crop of opium poppies in Pakistan this year will be a major topic of discussion during Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo's visit with President Reagan and other officials in Washington this week, according to Pakistani officials. **********Mr. Junejo is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Tuesday. **********The increase in poppy production has stirred concern that the recent lifting of martial law has contributed to a slackening in the Government's enforcement drive against narcotics. **********Pakistani officials said Mr. Junejo, who took office last year after parliamentary elections in February, wanted to use the American visit to spread the word that he and his Cabinet had in fact taken control of the Government after martial law was lifted Dec. 30. **********Poppy Growers and Police Clash **********Pakistani and Western narcotics experts say that their worries about the narcotics situation spread in the spring when a dozen growers and their supporters were reported killed in a clash that erupted with the police at a rally where poppy growers were protesting the Government's destruction of their fields. **********The deaths touched off a wave of anti-American feelings in the area, which is near the Afghan border. The United States had contributed aid to the crop destruction and substitution programs there. **********A senior Pakistani narcotics official said poppy growers in the Northwest Frontier area ''had high hopes this year that their own political leaders would protect them'' from law enforcement. To some degree, he said, that occurred, but he added that production had also increased because of unusually good rainfalls, high demand and high prices. Jump in Domestic Consumption **********The jump in the amount of opium -estimates put the crop at 100 to 160 metric tons this year, compared with 40 tons last year - is also causing an increase in domestic consumption of heroin. Experts say there may be 400,000 addicts in Pakistan now, compared with almost no addicts ten years ago. **********Pakistani officials said the Government had stepped up its drive to encourage crop substitution in the Northwest Frontier and had warned farmers that their crops would be destroyed if they allowed another bumper crop of poppies. **********''We are prepared to assure the United States that we will take all measures to eradicate poppy cultivation and interdict narcotics traffic,'' a senior Pakistani official said. ''We will tighten enforcement, increase punishments and do more to cooperate with the United States.'' **********Most political analysts here said Mr. Junejo was running the day-to-day affairs of the Government, but that President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who retains the title of Army Chief of Staff, remained behind the scenes as a senior partner, particularly in regulating political activity and curbing disorder. **********General Zia seized power in a coup in 1977, and before lifting martial law he selected Mr. Junejo, a relatively unknown former Cabinet minister, as the new Prime Minister. **********Pakistani and American officials said Mr. Junejo's visit would be important in establishing his credibility in Washington, especially since President Reagan will be asking Congress next year to renew American military and economic assistance to Pakistan. **********The Reagan Administration recently agreed to a new six-year $4 billion aid package to replace the $3.2 billion package that expires next year. A Shift in Request **********A senior Pakistani official said today that Islamabad would seek a shift in its military aid request, asking for help in rebuilding its army and navy with new ships, tanks and artillery. Most of the previous package financed 40 F-16 jet fighters for the air force. **********Pakistani officials say they hope Islamabad's lifting of martial law will ease the political concern in Congress about giving aid to Pakistan, which the Administration has justified by citing the presence of 120,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan. **********But Pakistani and American officials said they recognized that Congress was still concerned about Pakistan's nuclear program. Many experts and members of Congress reject Islamabad's denial that it is making a nuclear bomb. **********The heroin issue, meanwhile, was said to be underscored by the United States effort to extradite at least one prominent Pakistani national on a narcotics conspiracy charge. **********The United States is also pressing Pakistan to strengthen enforcement by using wiretaps, enacting its own conspiracy legislation, seizing income derived from heroin production and using more informants."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/05/business/patents-a-world-clock.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1986-04-05", "snippet": "A world clock described as displaying the exact time at every location on earth simultaneously was patented this week by Thomas D.

''I do not, however, wish to minimize the number and significance of the differences that still divide us.'' **********He confirmed reports that the two sides would hold interim talks in December to try and overcome differences. **********His comments ran counter to statements by Soviet officials and appeared to reflect attempts by the United States to portray the talks in the best light possible. **********The chief Soviet negotiator, Viktor P. Karpov, said in a statement issued earlier through the Tass press agency that the United States ''has done all it could to cross out'' agreements reached during the Iceland summit meeting in October. He said the negotiations ''are at a standstill.'' **********Mr. Karpov said that if the United States was serious about continuing the arms talks it must ''display readiness to take practical measures to work out an agreement on eliminating all strategic nuclear weapons within 10 years.'' **********In the Iceland meeting, Mikhail S. Gorbachev argued for eliminating all offensive long-range arms by 1996, while the formal American proposal was for the elimination of all ballistic missiles, of all ranges, within the next 10 years, leaving long-range bombers and cruise missiles. **********In the interim, Mr. Kampelman said, the two sides were in agreement on the first phase of the potential arms-control accord - cutting back all long-range arms by roughly 50 percent over five years, to 1991, which would leave each side with no more than 6,000 warheads and 1,600 missiles and bombers. The Soviet Union now has about 10,000 warheads, and the United States 11,700. **********He also said that there was agreement on eliminating Soviet and American medium-range missiles from Europe, and reducing the number of warheads on such missiles elsewhere to 100 each. **********This would remove 810 Soviet medium-range warheads from Europe, and 80 percent of a Soviet medium-range force of 513 warheads in Asia. The United States has deployed 108 Pershing 2 missiles and 128 ground-launched cruise missile in Europe, but has none in Asia. **********Mr. Kampelman also said Moscow had agreed ''that British and French nuclear systems have no place in these negotiations.'' The previous Soviet position was that British and French national arsenals would have to be counted on the American side. **********Finally, Mr. Kampelman noted, the Soviet Union and the United States were ready to adhere to the 1979 ABM treaty for 10 more years, although ''conditions surrounding that commitment continue to divide us.'' The Soviet Union has been pressing for strict limitations on research and testing of new missile defenses under the United States' Strategic Defense Initiative program. **********Mr. Kampelman said one of the most serious obstacles to overall agreement was Soviet insistence that all arms control aspects were now linked and could be agreed upon only in a single package.

The first is a glaring lack of oversight over its own operations, and the second is a calculated risk by new managers to get problems behind them. **********This gamble could backfire, they said, because the whopping $640 million loss, the second largest in banking history, shakes the company's credibility in a way that could damage its relationships with investors and hurt its efforts to compete. The bank attributed the loss to problem loans in energy and real estate brought on by falling oil prices. **********''Their credibility was lousy to begin with, and it just gets lousier,'' said Stephen Berman, banking analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. **********Doubts About Management **********''I'm not sure that current management knows what's going on,'' said James L. Shelton, an equity analyst for the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, which is one of BankAmerica's largest stockholders, with 1.2 million shares. **********The lack of credibility is likely to increase pressure for the removal of Samuel H. Armacost, the company's president and chief executive officer, analysts said. **********But there are several reasons that Mr. Armacost, who appears to have the backing of directors, may avoid being removed. One is that some loan problems that plague the bank originated from loans and policies set in motion before he took over as chief executive in 1981. In addition, Mr. Armacost has brought in new management directly under him that already runs much of the day-to-day operations. Finally, removing him and bringing in a new chief executive could lead to months of transition and turmoil at the bank, which needs desperately to get about its business. **********Still, analysts say, Mr. Armacost, who has long been overly optimistic about the bank's prospects, has come to symbolize a lack of credibility. He could also be faulted for not putting in place before this a management that is able to avoid unpleasant surprises. Mounting Pressure on Directors **********Moreover, Mr. Armacost, whose cash compensation last year was listed by the company as $575,000, might be removed because of mounting pressure on its board of directors, which faces the threat of litigation from stockholders and which has been criticized by analysts for not acting independently from management. **********''You're almost in the situation where someone at the top has to be removed as a symbol that 'we're alive on this board and we're functioning,' '' Mr. Berman said. **********Some, however, say the real issue is not what happens to Mr. Armacost, but whether the Bank of America will suffer from lost business and an ability to compete. Analysts say that both consumer and commercial customers could shy away from the bank. In addition, management's attention could be so diverted by the loan problems that the bank, the nation's second largest, will lose its competitiveness in day to day business. **********''The loss of momentum could kill them in the next game,'' said Douglas F. Stone, banking analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. The next game, he said, is for BankAmerica to compete in global merchant banking with such banks as Citicorp and with investment banking houses. Huge Addition to Reserves **********It is precisely a desire to get on with business that was one reason for the big loss in the second quarter, according to analysts and banking officials. **********The loss occurred because the bank management decided to make a huge addition to the reserves set aside for future loan losses. The bank suffered $388 million in loan losses in the quarter but made a provision for loan losses of $988, thereby increasing the reserve by $600 million. **********One reason was that the bank figured out that, compared with other banks, its reserve was not unusually large in relation to total loans or to nonperforming loans that might turn into loan losses. The addition brings the reserve to $2.2 billion, which is 2.67 percent of total loans and 53 percent of loans not accruing interest. These percentages seem on a par with other big banks or even larger. **********But bank officials were also being somewhat tough in order to take a hit all at once. New Slate of Managers **********The bank has brought in, mostly since the first of the year, a whole slate of managers to turn it around. These include Thomas A. Cooper, the president and chief operating officer of the Bank of America; John S. Poelker, the chief financial officer of BankAmerica Corporation, and two top officials involved with loans: Glenhall E. Taylor Jr. and Lewis W. Coleman. **********Analysts and officials say these newcomers were more skilled than their predecessors at rooting out bad loans. Also, because they were new to the job and could not be blamed for loan losses, they tried to create as clean a slate as possible now, so the bank will not have to suffer big losses in the future. **********The bank apparently assumed the worst when it came to estimating how low oil prices would remain and decided to reserve on that basis. **********Analysts said that some banks have been increasing their reserves because tax deductions for such reserves might be eliminated in the tax reform bill now before Congress. They said, however, that this probably was not a big factor for the BankAmerica because its huge losses insure it will not have to pay taxes for a long time. Caught by Surprise **********Still, a big question remains as to why BankAmerica could not have predicted its loss earlier. As late as April and May, bank management was expressing hope that the corner had been turned. As recently as late June, analysts, based on intimations from bank officials, were predicting the company would break even or perhaps post a slight profit. **********One reason for the sudden reversal apparently was the realization late in the quarter that oil prices were not going to rise. There were also some external surprises, such as a suit in late June by the Hunt brothers of Texas against their bankers, which indicated banks might not collect on the loans to the Hunts. Analysts estimated that BankAmerica had about $100 million in loans to the Hunts. There were also problems with loans to other energy-related companies, such as Zapata and Dome Petroleum, and with real estate developments in Texas and California. **********One problem, BankAmerica officials concede, is that the 1,100 field loan officers make detailed reports only at the end of each quarter. So it was not until the 11th hour that the bank headquarters knew the magnitude of the problems, according to Mr. Poelker, the chief financial officer. **********Some analysts find this lack of reporting incredible. Other banks have more continuous reporting, according to Lawrence W. Cohn, banking analyst at Merrill Lynch. **********This, analysts say, has been BankAmerica's biggest problem over all - inability to monitor its own operations. The bank has been hurt by unexpectedly huge quarterly losses three times in the last two years. **********It has also been victim of several embarrassing frauds, including a mortgage-backed securities scandal that led to a $95 million charge against 1984 earnings, a scheme by an employee in Paraguay to defraud the bank of $60 million and a scheme in Indonesia to skim money from the traveler's check operations. It was also fined $4.75 million in January for violations of the law requiring banks to report large cash transactions to help cut down on money-laundering."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/24/world/respite-for-south-africa-a-royal-wedding.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 511, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RESPITE FOR SOUTH AFRICA: A ROYAL WEDDING", "print_headline": "RESPITE FOR SOUTH AFRICA: A ROYAL WEDDING", "body_text": " **********At an office here, the secretary said that the boss had been generous: Television sets were provided to view the event and the staff was permitted to bring cucumber sandwiches and champagne to celebrate. **********The cucumber, the secretary added with some pride, was not just any old cucumber, but English cucumber, flown in for the day.

For himself, he denies the venality he attributed to other Reaganites in his famous interview with William Greider in The Atlantic, in which he charged that the supply-side tax cuts were simply a Trojan horse for raiding the Treasury in behalf of the rich. Rather, he portrays his conversion to the new supply-side doctrine as an act of burning idealism -''a reincarnation of my old social idealism in the form of a new and, I was inclined to think, more mature ideological garb.'' **********But soon, for the former divinity student and Congressman, disillusion set in. It became clear to him that the cardinal tenet of the supply-side doctrine - that cuts in marginal tax rates would cause revenues to grow so much that the budget would be balanced - was a snare and a delusion. He found that budget balance would either require a continuation of double-digit inflation or huge spending cuts - more than $100 billion per year. ''The fabled revenue feedback of the Laffer curve,'' he writes, ''had thus slid into the grave of fiscal mythology 40 days after the supply-side banner had been hoisted at the G.O.P. convention.'' **********He became the point man for the Administration in slashing social programs to make room for the big tax cuts and military budgets Mr. Reagan was determined to preserve. But Mr. Stockman knew that the claim of a balanced budget by 1984 (the date had quietly been set back from the campaign pledge of budget-balance by 1983) also would require rapid economic growth. **********But was rapid, noninflationary growth possible? Murray L. Weidenbaum, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, thought it would be impossible to achieve: either growth would be modest and inflation would slow down, or growth would be rapid and inflation would stay high. **********He says Mr. Weidenbaum came to him on Feb. 7, 1981, and ''we made the worst possible bargain; if he agreed to keep the growth rate 'reasonably high,' I would go along with whatever figure he thought he could live with.'' This is a technique of economic forecasting they don't teach at the Harvard economics department. At a forecasting session of high-level Administration supply-siders and monetarists, Mr. Weidenbaum unveiled what later was called ''the Rosy Scenario,'' and he was asked what ''model'' it had come out of. Mr. Stockman says Mr. Weidenbaum glared at the questioner, slapped his belly with both hands, and answered, ''My visceral computer.'' This, Mr. Stockman says, was the slap heard round the world, as Mr. Weidenbaum's visceral computer added $700 billion to money G.N.P. over five years and generated nearly $200 billion ''in phantom revenues.'' **********Interviewed by telephone yesterday at Washington University in St. Louis, Mr. Weidenbaum compared Mr. Stockman's tale to the Japanese film ''Rashomon,'' in which all participants have a different version of the same events. He denies that he slapped his belly; he says he just pointed at it, but acknowledges he called it his ''visceral computer.'' **********More fundamentally, Mr. Weidenbaum disputes Mr. Stockman's contention that, if the forecasting had been ''purist,'' the Reagan Revolution would ''not have been launched on Feb. 18 - and perhaps never.'' The staggering domestic budget cuts required to balance the budget, according to Mr. Stockman, ''would have caused the White House politicians to lurch out of their slumber.'' **********But Mr. Weidenbaum insisted that President Reagan, committed to his tax cuts and military buildup, would not have been deterred by a less optimistic forecast. ''The President is a great optimist,'' he said. ''With his optimistic nature, the economic assumptions are going to be of an optimistic nature.'' The Council of Economic Advisers, he added, ''is there to serve the President.'' **********The Stockman account of the Reagan Revolution and how it to came to be helps one to understand how the enormous string of budget deficits came about; the huge tax cuts of 1981 have made far more difficult the task of reforming the tax system without funds available for winning the support of affected taxpaying groups. The huge budget deficits also lie at the root of the nation's dependence on foreign capital, the overvalued dollar, the record trade deficit and the struggle to re-establish order to the budget and the national economy. **********Yet the fundamental issue remains whether the Reagan Revolution, for all its improvisations, failed theories and lost gambles, has nevertheless given the American economy a powerful thrust forward, or has undermined its growth and stability, and endangered both the national and world financial system.

It was not until he and his wife, Marion, were awoken at 5 A.M. yesterday by a telephone call from an official of the prize committee that he knew the newspaper was right. **********Still, Mr. Wiesel, 58 years old, saw some mystical significance in his winning perhaps the world's most prestigious prize right after Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. **********''In Jewish history there are no coincidences,'' he said at a crowded news conference at the 92d Street Y, where he has lectured for 20 years. ''If it happens after Yom Kippur here, then some of my friends and myself have prayed well.'' A Chance to Speak Louder **********For Mr. Wiesel, the $270,000 prize will mean, as he said, a chance to ''speak louder'' and ''reach more people'' for the causes that have driven him through his adult life. **********Chief among those is his role as the articulator of the often inexpressible experience of the six million Jews who were killed by the Nazis and of those who survived. Mr. Wiesel, a slightly built man whose eyes mingle intensity and sadness, survived Auschwitz and Buchenwald as a teen-ager, having watched his father beaten to death and losing his mother and one of his three sisters. **********But after many years of silence, he wrote ''Night,'' the story of his ordeal and the first of his 26 books. He began talking widely to synagogue and other groups and slowly found himself gaining an international audience. **********''I decided to devote my life to telling the story because I felt that having survived I owe something to the dead,'' he said. ''That was their obsession to be remembered, and anyone who does not remember betrays them again.'' Help for the Living **********But, as Mr. Wiesel said, he has also turned his experiences to helping the living who suffer - the victims of oppression in Cambodia and South Africa. And for 21 years, he has urged greater emigration of Soviet Jews. **********The Nobel prize, which he dedicated to the survivors of the Nazis for teaching ''humankind how not to succumb to despair,'' will not change him, Mr. Wiesel said. ''If the war did not change me, you think anything else will change me?'' he told a questioner. **********Eliezer Wiesel was born on Sept. 30, 1928, in the town of Sighet, Rumania, near the border with Hungary, to Shlomo Wiesel, a middle-class shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah. Family members were followers of the Vizhnitsa Hasidim and the young boy studied the Torah, the Talmud and, at night, the mystical doctrines of the cabala. **********In the spring of 1944, the town's 15,000 Jews were rounded up on the orders of the Germans and Mr. Wiesel and his family were deported to Auschwitz. **********In the years during and after his terrible losses, Mr. Wiesel said he went ''from despair to despair'' - an emotion he said he still sometimes battles with. ''But,'' he said, ''we have to go into the despair and go beyond it, by working and doing for somebody else, by using it for something else.'' A Central Theme **********He says he often questioned why God would have allowed such a catastrophe, a theme that became central to his work. ''I have not answered that question,'' he said yesterday, ''but I have not lost faith in God. I have moments of anger and protest. Sometimes I've been closer to him for that reason.'' **********After his liberation at 16, Mr. Wiesel was part of a train of war orphans that was intercepted by the French and he settled in France. He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, earning his living as a choir director. Mr. Wiesel still entertains friends with songs, particularly Hasidic melodies remembered from boyhood. **********Mr. Wiesel became chief foreign correspondent for the Israeli daily Yedioth Aharonoth and in 1954 he interviewed the writer Francois Mauriac, who urged him to write his story. Two years later, ''La Nuit,'' or ''Night,'' appeared in French. **********Other books include ''The Jews of Silence'' (1966), about his encounters with Jews in the Soviet Union, ''A Beggar in Jerusalem'' (1970), a novel about the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, and ''Souls on Fire'' (1972), a collection of Hasidic tales. An Appeal to Reagan **********Perhaps the moment for which he will be most remembered came in 1985 at a White House award ceremony where he appealed directly to President Reagan to cancel his visit to the German cemetery of Bitburg because members of the SS were buried there. ''That place, Mr. President, is not your place,'' he told Mr. Reagan. **********Mr. Wiesel spends much of his week at Boston University, where he has been a professor of humanities for 10 years. He writes in French and his work is translated into English by his Viennese-born wife, whom he married in 1969 in a ceremony in Jerusalem. **********The couple have one son, Shlomo-Elisha, who is 14 and who is a student at Ramaz School, a Hebrew day school in Manhattan, and a dauighter, Jennifer Rose, by Mrs. Wiesel's previous marriage. The dark-haired Elisha was at the news conference yesterday wearing a Yankee baseball jacket, which perhaps has for Mr. Wiesel a mystical significance of its own."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/29/world/1000-radiation-cases-now-reported-in-soviet.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 258, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "1,000 Radiation Cases Now Reported in Soviet", "print_headline": "1,000 Radiation Cases Now Reported in Soviet", "body_text": " **********A Soviet press agency indicated today that as many as 1,000 people, including residents of the immediate area around the Chernobyl nuclear plant, had suffered radiation in the accident last month. **********The report by the Novosti press agency, a feature syndicate, said: **********''Four hours after the disaster, a special medical team was ready to fly from Moscow to the nuclear power station. **********Within 24 hours, they selected the hundred most serious cases out of a thousand.

Israel Is Blamed **********He said recent attacks in which United Nations soldiers had been killed or wounded were a result of a lack of cooperation, ''in particular Israel's refusal to withdraw completely from territory occupied during its invasion in Lebanon in 1982.'' **********Israel has kept forces in a narrow enclave along the border, calling it a ''security zone.'' The strip is also patrolled by an Israeli-backed Christian militia known as the South Lebanon Army. **********In recent weeks, militant Shiite Moslems have staged several attacks on French soldiers and other contingents in the United Nations forces, saying that the peacekeepers were preventing the militants from attacking the Israelis and the South Lebanon Army. Demonstrators organized by the mainstream Shiite movement Amal, however, have supported the United Nations presence in Lebanon. **********Mr. Perez de Cuellar called for the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, adding, ''If progress is not achieved soon, I believe the Council may be compelled to give serious consideration to withdrawal of the force, despite the very damaging consequences that would result.'' Border Security Cited **********Mr. Peres, meanwhile, said the United Nations had tried but failed to find a Lebanese military force that could secure the border between Lebanon and Israel. ''Until and unless we see a Lebanese force acceptable to us, we cannot risk the security of the northern border of Israel,'' he said. **********The United Nations force cannot keep peace in southern Lebanon, he said. ''This is not a normal army that will stop terrorism or terrorist activities,'' he said. **********Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the United Nations force ''is making a contribution, because if you take out Unifil, who will come in in its wake?'' **********He said that if the Party of God, the Iranian-backed Shiite militia believed responsible for many of the recent attacks, were to fill such a vaccum, ''it would be a catastrophe for Lebanon.'' **********To help combat the spread of terrorism around the world, Mr. Peres proposed an international alliance to share intelligence, pass legislation, inspect diplomatic mail and create specialized units. The first priority would be to investigate the financial sources of terrorism.

One White House official said the longer Mr. Daniloff remained in detention, the worse it would be for Washington-Moscow relations. U.S. Aides Called 'Furious' **********He said ''a lot of people in this Administration are furious'' about what he called the ''frame-up'' of Mr. Daniloff, who is under investigation in a Moscow prison by the K.G.B., accused of espionage. Mr. Daniloff was seized in Moscow after a Soviet acquaintance gave him an envelope that contained two maps marked ''top secret.'' **********''The White House will not make any deals for Daniloff's release, since he is not a spy, and to do so would make any American hostage to this kind of frame-up,'' a senior official said. ''Moscow must learn it cannot keep doing this.'' **********Officials said there was a whole range of political, economic and cultural moves that could be taken to put pressure on the Kremlin, but they did not say which ones might be applied. Links to Arrest in New York **********A senior State Department official said that ''there is no doubt'' but that the arrest of Mr. Daniloff was directly linked to the arrest by the F.B.I. on Aug. 22 of the physicist Gennadi F. Zakharov, a United Nations employee. Mr. Zakharov, who does not have diplomatic immunity, was charged with espionage. **********''We can't rule out that the Soviets are seeking to bring pressure on us in the Zakharov case by arresting Daniloff,'' said Peter Martinez, a State Department spokesman. **********''Such tactics will be as unsuccessful as they are unscrupulous,'' he said. ''Zakharov's case is in the courts and will be prosecuted on its merits in strict conformity with U.S. laws.'' **********Officials here said that even though it might be difficult for Mr. Daniloff, the Administration was ready for a prolonged standoff with Moscow on the issue. Under Soviet law, a person may be imprisoned for up to a year while charges against him are investigated, officials said. **********''But you can be assured,'' an Administration official said, ''that we will not let the matter hang there, and limit ourselves to diplomatic protests. We will take appropriate steps if Daniloff is not freed quickly.'' **********''There will be meetings in coming days on what to do and we're going to step up the pressure. There are many ways for them to feel the pinch. The longer this goes on, the greater the impact this will have on ties.'' Doubts on Future Meetings **********The incident occurred at a particularly sensitive time in relations. The two Governments are in the midst of a Meries of high-level meetings in advance of a planned session on Sept. 19 and 20 in Washington between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. That meeting is supposed to discuss the timing of a second summit meeting between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. **********Officials said it did not seem likely that previously scheduled official meetings, such as the arms control session in Washington on Thursday and Friday, would be canceled, but said that if the problem is not resolved soon it could begin to affect such meetings. **********Officials said they did not know why Mr. Daniloff was singled out. And they refused to speculate as to whether Mr. Gorbachev was aware of any plan to seize Mr. Daniloff. **********On Saturday, Michael H. Armacost, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, summoned Oleg M. Sokolov, the No. 2 official at the Soviet Embassy, to demand the immediate release of Mr. Daniloff. 'Clumsy Effort' by K.G.B. Today Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who spent eight years on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said he could affirm that Mr. Daniloff was not a spy. Mr. Moynihan said the arrest was ''a clear and clumsy effort by the K.G.B. to retaliate for the arrest last week of their agent in New York.'' **********''It is the unwavering and inflexible rule of the United States Government not to employ American journalists in any intelligence capacity for any reason whatsoever,'' Mr. Moynihan said. **********''The Soviet Government must immediately assert control over its secret police and release Mr. Daniloff immediately,'' the Senator said. ''If not, no summit, no grain sales. None but minimal relations for as long as necessary. This now is their choice.'' Similarities to Past Incidents **********American officials noted two cases similar to that of Mr. Daniloff. **********The first began on Oct. 30, 1963, at a time of improved Soviet-American relations, when three Russians and an American engineer, John W. Butenko, were arrested in the United States on espionage charges. Two of the Russians were attached to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations and had diplomatic immunity and were allowed to leave the country. But the third, Igor A. Ivanov, a driver for Amtorg, the Soviet trade organization, did not have immunity and remained in prison. **********A day later in Moscow, Prof. Frederick C. Barghoorn of Yale University was arrested on spying charges. He later said a man approached him and thrust what appeared to be a rolled-up newspaper into his hands. Soviet security agents immediately seized him and charged him with possessing classified information. **********Professor Barghoorn's arrest was not made public until Nov. 12, 1963. It provoked a crisis in relations, with President John F. Kennedy declaring on Nov. 14 that Professor Barghoorn was ''innocent of any intelligence mission.'' On Nov. 16 Professor Barghoorn was released. Andrei A. Gromyko, then Foreign Minister and now President, said Professor Barghoorn was released because of ''the personal concern'' of Mr. Kennedy. **********Although the Soviet side asked for the similar release of Mr. Ivanov, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in 1964 but was allowed to remain in Soviet custody while on bail, pending an appeal. He was permitted to return to Moscow in 1971. **********Another such episode occurred in 1978. On May 20, the F.B.I. arrested two Soviet employees of the United Nations, Valdik Enger and Rudolf Chernayev, on espionage charges. Like Mr. Zakharov, they lacked diplomatic immunity. On June 13, an American businessman in Moscow, F. Jay Crawford, was arrested in Moscow and charged with smuggling, which he denied. **********After spending 13 days in prison, Mr. Crawford was turned over to United States Ambassador and the two Russians were handed over to the Soviet Ambassador to Washington. On Sept. 8, Mr. Crawford was found guilty of black-market dealings and allowed to return to the United States. The two Russians were convicted of espionage and sentenced on Oct. 13 to 50 years in prison. They were eventually traded in April 1979 for five prominent imprisoned dissidents. MAGAZINE'S OWNER TO MOSCOW  David Gergen, editor of U.S. News and World Report, announced yesterday that the magazine's owner and editor in chief, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, would travel to the Soviet Union Monday to seek the release of Mr. Daniloff. **********''U.S. News is engaged in a full-court press to obtain the release of our correspondent,'' Mr. Gergen said. ''This detention, now going on its second day is unprecedented and cruel, both to Mr. Daniloff and to his family. Unless the Soviets quickly release Mr. Daniloff, they will send a chilling message to the world about the new Gorbachev regime and about their commitment to greater cooperation in U.S.-Soviet relations.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/business/market-place-wall-st-deals-ante-is-raised.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1986-11-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 953, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Wall St. Deals: Ante Is Raised", "print_headline": "Market Place; Wall St. Deals: Ante Is Raised", "body_text": " **********TWO recent takeover plays in which investment banks have made commitments to put up billions of dollars of their own capital to see the deals through have suddenly intensified the already heated battle on Wall Street to compete with capital, and not just wits. **********Even some of the players making the decisions admit to occasionally stepping back and realizing, with a bit of shock, just how much and how quickly the stakes are escalating. **********One such instance occurred at 7 P.M. on Thursday, Oct. 23: Bruce Wasserstein and Francis P. Jenkins Jr., two of the top officers at the First Boston Corporation, placed a conference call to Peter T. Buchanan, chief executive of First Boston, and its chief financial officer, William E. Mayer. By the time the telephones were hung up, they had agreed to back the Campeau Corporation's $3.5 billion bid for Allied Stores by committing $1.8 billion of First Boston's own capital to back the deal. **********''Gentleman,'' Mr. Jenkins, who is in charge of First Boston's trading operations, had said to his colleagues in concluding the conference, ''we're in the merchant banking business.'' **********First Boston is not alone, either. Merrill Lynch & Company, America's largest securities firm, has made a commitment to lend Sir James Goldsmith, the British investor, $1.9 billion of its own capital if he makes a takeover bid for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. **********For several years, analysts have stressed that the winners in this era of change in the securities industry will be those firms with the greatest financial heft. The Allied Stores bid and the play for Goodyear illustrate just true this has become, and the radical shifts that this trend is provoking on Wall Street. **********''There's no question that this is escalating to a new level, and that it requires a response,'' said Richard B. Fisher, chief executive of Morgan Stanley & Company. ''It makes it necessary to be bigger to be competitive.'' **********The trend, analysts say, is producing a number of shifts and potential changes: *********** It allows big investment banks to challenge Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which had spirited away from the old-line firms a major share of the takeover market with its ''junk bond'' expertise. *********** The merger and acquisition business is likely to be concentrated into the hands of fewer and fewer large securities firms - firms that have immediate access to billions of dollars in capital. *********** There are likely to be be more mergers between investment banks, or between investment banks and commercial banks, as they seek more financial muscle. **********Drexel is clearly the target of some of the highly capitalized firms that are now both arranging and financing transactions. It rose to the forefront in the takeover field with its ability to finance transactions with junk bonds - low-grade, high-yield debt securities. **********By having a ready force of potential junk bond buyers, Drexel could issue letters to corporate raiders in which it stated that it was ''highly confident'' it could raise the capital to undertake an acquisition for a buyer, such as T. Boone Pickens or Carl C. Icahn, who might not have had enough money alone. **********The other Wall Street firms were caught off guard, and lost a great deal of business to Drexel at first. Now, they are fighting back - not by playing the same game, but by doing Drexel one better. **********''We don't say we're confident,'' said Peter Solomon, a vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which made a commitment to lend $1.6 billion to the losing bidder in the Allied Stores battle. ''We say, 'Here's the money, now.' Period.'' Once the investment bank makes the temporary loan, it is paid back by selling junk bonds on behalf of the new corporation. **********''No question, there is a revolution taking place under our noses,'' said Joseph R. Perella, co-head of investment banking, with Mr. Wasserstein, at First Boston. ''This is part of a structural change in our business that is enhancing the position of those firms with the ability to get the deals done by putting up their own money.'' **********Mr. Solomon noted: ''What this simply says is that the big boys are going to separate themselves more and more from the others. If you can't put up the capital to make the deal happen, you could lose the business.'' **********The reason for this scramble is simple: The money to be made in financing these transactions is on a scale never before seen. **********Merrill Lynch, for instance, stands to make well over $100 million, and perhaps as much as $200 million, if Sir James actually acquires Goodyear. **********First Boston already stands to make close to $60 million for seeing through the Allied Stores acquisition, even though it only actually provided $865 million of the financing it promised; the rest of the $1.8 billion needed was provided by Citibank. First Boston will rake in significantly more, though, when the temporary financing it provided is replaced with permanent financing, and when, as expected, some of Allied Stores' assets are sold off. **********The loans provided by the investment banks are short-term, and do not come directly out of their capital. A firm will generally sell commercial paper, in effect borrowing against its capital base, to raise the funds - which it then lends at a higher interest rate than it has paid. **********Of course, if a deal sours, the investment bank that has lent out millions could suffer. **********''The potential for revenues is greater,'' Mr. Perella said, ''but so is the potential for losses.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/25/business/machine-tool-orders-fell-by-6-percent-in-july.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 436, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MACHINE TOOL ORDERS FELL BY 6 PERCENT IN JULY", "print_headline": "MACHINE TOOL ORDERS FELL BY 6 PERCENT IN JULY", "body_text": " **********New orders for American-made machine tools dropped 6 percent in July from June's level, according to a report to be released today by the National Machine Tool Builders' Association. **********The association and industry analysts attributed the decline to the nation's weak industrial growth and seasonal sluggishness. Orders in July totaled $189.2 million. **********''Summer is traditionally a slow period for the machine tool industry,'' said James A. Gray, president of the association. ''In addition, buyers frequently defer purchase decisions in the months immediately preceding our International Machine Tool Show.'' He was referring to the industry trade show that begins next week in Chicago. Confidence on Pickup in Fall **********Mr. Gray added: ''Therefore, we remain confident that the situation will improve as we move into the fall and industrial activity picks up.'' **********John P. Reading, a spokesman for Cincinnati Milicron Inc., said that many customers ''postpone new orders until after the show, to see what's new in the industry.'' **********Still, orders for machine tool have, throughout the year, remained consistently below their year-ago levels. Analysts generally predict that order levels will remain sluggish for the remainder of the year. **********Machine tools are power-driven devices used to shape most metal parts, from tractor gears to vacuum cleaner motors. Their sales are an important indicator of capital spending by producers of metal products, mainly the automobile, aerospace and manufacturing industries. Imports, Taxes Cause Concern **********These have been difficult times for American machine tool makers, who have complained that imports accounted for about 41 percent of the domestic machine tool market in 1985, up from 34 percent in 1983, when the trade association began to press for import restraints from the Government. **********The trade association said that new orders for metal-cutting machine tools, which include lathes and boring mills and account for about 75 percent of the industry, fell 4.5 percent from June, to $149.9 million. Orders for metal-forming tools, such as large presses to make sheet steel, dropped 11.2 percent, to $39.4 million in July. Machine tool order backlogs for July stood at $1.52 billion, down slightly from the $1.53 billion in June. **********Mr. Gray expressed concern about the impact of the proposed tax revisions: ''The bill that emerged from the conference, in effect, rolls capital recovery provisions back to their pre-1981 levels, which were considered woefully inadequate by both Government and industry.'' **********He said he hoped Congress would give additional consideration to the long-range effects of capital recovery provisions ''so necessary to the ability of American industry to keep pace with the rapid technological changes taking place today.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/30/business/walker-set-to-sell-home-oil.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1986-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 421, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WALKER SET TO SELL HOME OIL", "print_headline": "WALKER SET TO SELL HOME OIL", "body_text": " **********Hiram Walker Resources Ltd. announced an agreement in principle today to sell its Home Oil Ltd. unit to Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. for about $1.1 billion (Canadian), or about $793 million (United States). **********Ninety-three percent of Hiram Walker is owned by the Gulf Canada Corporation.

''I figured,'' he said, ''if the people I worked and lived with could learn to use programs, I could too.'' **********Karen Flisek, a labor negotiator in the New York City Mayor's office, used to painstakingly calculate complex pay raises on paper until she took a one-day spreadsheet program class a year ago. **********And a year and a half ago, Lynn Obee, a communications specialist, switched from an electric typewriter to a computer. ''When I saw how easily my secretary was able to make changes using a word processor,'' she said, ''I decided to learn the software myself.'' **********Like these three professionals, more and more employees, in fields ranging from graphic design to purchasing and nursing, are discovering that their employers want them to use computers and applications programs - software designed for a specific function such as word-processing, filing or calculating -to save them time and effort on the job. **********Most employees need not worry about having to know computer languages like COBOL and FORTRAN, said a study published by the National Institute for Work and Learning. In fact, the only people who need extensive training are those who design, repair and program computers. Employees who are expected to use programs that perform a specific function usually get their training on the job, according to the study. **********In 1984, businesses spent about $100 million on computer training for their employees; within four years that figure will climb to about $615 million as the number of personal computers in the workplace increases, according to the International Data Corporation, a market-research concern covering the information industry. **********Anyone who has the interest and determination to learn can master applications programs within a matter of months, according to training experts. ''The best learning motive is having a project that needs to be done fast,'' said Vincent Esposito, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., the brokerage firm. Mr. Esposito, who has taught a variety of programs to employees there, has found that people don't learn unless they know how they're going to use a program on their job. **********Training by instructors is considered the fastest way to develop computer skills. Most people need a structured approach to learning computers, said the report, ''because they are either terrified to touch one . . . or too impatient to monkey around till they get the hang of it.'' Seven to ten hours of instruction gives learners the basic help to build up software knowledge on their own. **********Anyone taking a course that is not offered in house should learn the specific applications program that is used by fellow employees and learn it on the type of computer available at work, according to the trainers. The ideal computer-to-student ratio is 1 to 1; the ideal instructor-to-student ratio is 1 to 3. **********Some executives often are reluctant to learn applications programs because they don't want to embarrass themselves in front of colleagues or lower-level staff people who may catch on faster. Many opt for private instruction. ''The disadvantage is that the student often wants to set the agenda rather than leaving it up to the instructor, which can slow down the learning process,'' said Joel Bondy, president of The Productivity Center, a New York-based consulting firm that teaches executives at major companies. **********Taking an off-premises class designed for executives or professionals in a field is a better option. One advantage is that the sample problems used in class are often more relevant to your interests or work. In its spreadsheet classes for executives, for example, The Productivity Center offers analyses of personal budgeting and compensation. **********Because instructor-led training is expensive, many employees, especially those at medium-size and small companies, train informally. Like many employees, Miss Obee learned Multimate, a word-processing program, with the aid of a colleague, a tutorial (self-paced lessons on the computer) and a user manual. ''I knew I didn't have to catch everything as she explained it because the tutorial would repeat her instructions,'' said Miss Obee, who does public relations for an insurance company. **********Like a good teacher, a tutorial won't move on to new material until the learner understands everything up to that point. Correct responses to test questions, which are often rewarded with a ''You're doing great!'' message, allow the learner to continue. TUTORIALS and user manuals cannot answer questions or explain what a learner is doing wrong. That's when it's necessary to have someone who knows the program well nearby or available by phone; manufacturers and computer-user groups often provide such services. ''Nothing beats the human touch when a neophyte hits a learning roadblock,'' said Marcia Brooks, an International Data analyst. **********Mr. Zier agreed. Although he learned the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3 in a class, he taught himself Wordstar, a word-processing program, by using a manual and a little help from a son. **********A major challenge for neophytes to overcome is the fear of losing data. ''You have to realize that words or figures you've entered haven't been irretrievably zapped to electronic heaven when you flip a page or create a new document,'' said Sharon Effroymson, an instructor with The Productivity Center. So becoming adept at moving backward and forward in a file is essential. When Miss Flisek of the Mayor's office was learning, she had to get used to seeing only a small portion of her 50-row, 250-column spreadsheet on the screen. ''It was disconcerting until I learned to label the sections with names so they'd be easy to find,'' she said. **********Those whose keyboard skills are weak experience the greatest difficulty. ''Familiarity with a keyboard isn't a requirement, but it helps,'' said Mr. Bondy of The Productivity Center. One remedy is a typing tutorial. **********Familiarity with computer concepts, such as RAM and ROM, vocabulary, such as ''enter'' or ''escape,'' and general procedures, such as loading a disk, also helps speed the learning process. Taking an introductory course, many of which are offered or paid for by employers, is a good way to get a head start. ''If you have had your hands on a keyboard and understand the basics, you'll have more confidence when you start learning a program,'' Miss Effroymson said. **********Mr. Esposito of Dean Witter and other experts recommend using the program every day, preferably doing real work rather than practicing problems from user manuals or make-work projects. **********Many people reach a learning plateau once they master what they need to know to use the program. Those who are self-motivated, trial-and-error types can go the extra distance on their own. But many people find it easier to go back for advanced training. When Miss Flisek took advanced Lotus 1-2-3 training, she found that she had already taught herself much of what was being covered, so she signed up for an even more advanced class. ''When you're using a program a lot, you want to know all the tricks and shortcuts,'' she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/business/general-dynamics-delays-on-cessna.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "General Dynamics Delays on Cessna", "print_headline": "General Dynamics Delays on Cessna", "body_text": " **********The General Dynamics Corporation, citing its suspension last month from the award of future Government contracts, said it had indefinitely postponed a merger plan with the Cessna Aircraft Company. **********General Dynamics had said previously that it owned more than 95 percent of outstanding Cessna common stock as a result of a $30-a-share cash tender offer that expired last Friday. **********The company said it intended to purchase the remainder of Cessna's 22 million shares on the open market or in private transactions.

He was responding to a question posed at the outset: Did he see anything in the Greece of 1986 that resembled what he was fighting for 40 years ago high in the mountains of northern Greece? It was his first interview with an American since 1948, and he said he was disclosing some of his experiences for the first time. **********He returned to Greece in March 1983 under a Government amnesty for Communist exiles. **********''We have changes in so many sectors,'' Mr. Vafiadis said, ''a decisive change. What is happening today is that Greeks with a chip on the shoulder from the past are beginning to get over it, are starting to think of reconciliation and friendship.'' Jail Terms, Combat And Exile in Soviet Mr. Vafiadis spent most of the interview recounting his youth, his activities in the 1920's and 1930's as a Communist Party activist and strike organizer, his two prewar jail terms and two sentences to internal exile, his wartime resistance fights, his civil war experiences and episodes of his long exile in the Soviet Union. **********''I could summarize, but I explain all this to justify myself,'' he said. He spoke in a strong baritone, chuckling occasionally at one of his deft turns of phrase, sipping syrupy Greek coffee, eating a pistachio. His deeply set light blue eyes almost disappeared in the wrinkles of his face when he laughed. Several times he used the stock jargon of Marxism-Leninism, but for the most part, according to the interpreter, Dina Kyriakidou, his language was ''plastic and vivid.'' **********''To start with, I speak of two Greeces, the prewar Greece and Greece at the time of German occupation and the civil war,'' he said. ''Before the war, we were a bit backward as far as industry goes and were completing the bourgeois revolution as a precondition for creating socialism. This was mainly expressed in terms of class struggle against exploitation by the ruling class and capital.'' **********He went on to describe laws imposed against Communists, the dissolving of labor unions, the internal exile imposed on 3,000 Greek leftists, police brutality and political killings. **********He was born in January 1906 in the small Greek community of Theodosia near Ankara and was deported to Salonika in 1923 in the great exchange of populations at the end of the Greek-Turkish war. His father had died in poverty in 1917, his mother in 1920. He became a tobacco worker and joined the Communist youth movement. **********His motive: ''The reason Greece was underdeveloped was that after independence in 1821 the country remained under foreign domination. Even its political parties were known as the French party, the English party, the Russian party. Our struggle, the backbone of it, was national liberation, for freedom and independence. Unfortunately we were not able to accomplish this. British imperialism was very hard on Greece.'' **********His only formal military training came when he served as a conscript in 1926 and 1927, but he was ''kicked out of the noncommissioned officers' school because I was known'' as a Communist youth activist. He became a full party member in 1928. Jailed for 2 Years, Then Escaped Exile A militant, Mr. Vafiadis was continually arrested, tried and imprisoned. His first sentence, for organizing a tobacco workers' strike in Volos, lasted from 1932 to 1934. Arrested again in June 1936, he was exiled to the island of Agios Evstratios, from which he escaped in September. He then ''went underground.'' **********Captured in Piraeus in 1938, he was imprisoned at Acronauplion and then exiled to the island of Gavdos, near Crete. On the final day of the German invasion of Crete, ''six of us managed to escape in a small boat and spent three or four days at sea.'' **********They landed in Athens ''and started to organize the resistance.'' **********''In this phase of the occupation, the Communists were the soul of this resistance,'' he said. ''The other parties dissolved. This resistance, which was also a national liberation movement, involved countless sacrifices, executions, deaths.'' **********''At the end of 1941, I was put in charge of the Andartes,'' he said referring to the guerrilla fighters in Macedonia. He was formally appointed kapetanios of the 10th Division of ELAS, the Greek National Liberation Army. From his headquarters in the rugged Pindus mountains, he commanded about 1,000 guerrillas in western Macedonia and 200 more in Thrace and eastern Macedonia. By 1944 there were 27,000 under him. **********''Maybe we could have avoided civil war,'' he reflected. ''What was needed was reconstruction, making the country liveable again. But we started the armed struggle once more with a people weary of war.'' Blames British For the Civil War In his memory, the civil war was predetermined by the return of the British at the end of 1944, when the German Army had fled from almost all of Greece and he himself had led the liberation of Salonika. The ELAS formations had taken over nearly all of Greece, but the British had decided to back the small monarchist, anti-Communist forces, including Greeks who had collaborated with the Germans. **********''I have to underline the role of the British,'' he said. ''Their objective was to provoke us to armed conflict. We were forced to armed struggle. Under the British, 1,300 resistance fighters were murdered by Government police. So we had to go back to the mountains. It was our mistake to allow ourselves to be provoked.'' **********He went back to the mountains with misgivings, especially when the United States took over from the British in Greece. ''I never believed we could win an armed struggle,'' he said, ''but without United States support of the Government forces we could have reached some sort of compromise, to verify human freedom and make Greece a more democratic country.'' **********At their peak, he said, his forces numbered 47,000 to 48,000, while the Government fielded 200,000 troops backed with American-supplied tanks and warplanes. **********He found himself disagreeing more and more with Nikos Zachariadis, the Stalinist secretary of the Greek Communist Party, over goals and strategy. Mindful of the size of his forces, General Markos argued for fighting a guerrilla war rather than engaging in frontal combat, with the goal of extracting a compromise from the Government. **********He said he realized the end was coming when he and Mr. Zachariadis received a letter from Stalin in March 1948 demanding that the Greek Communists line up with Moscow against Tito of Yugosalvia, who was nearing a break with the rest of the Soviet bloc. **********''Zachariadis said we should oppose Tito instantly,'' Mr. Vafiadis said. ''I differed. I said it was to our benefit not to take a stand because all the material support we got at that time was from Yugoslavia.'' **********Mr. Zacharaidis then flew to Moscow and denounced Mr. Vafiadis. ''A stab in the back,'' he said. ''He made me out as anti-Soviet.'' Sent to Albania, Returned in Handcuffs The Vafiadis-Zachariadis struggle continued through 1948. He was ousted from his command on Aug. 22 and sent into Albania under guard, though orders were still issued in his name. ''But I was like a prisoner,'' he recalled. **********He was brought back handcuffed to Greek territory in November and again in January 1949 for discussions of his purported apostasy before the politburo and the central committee. **********''They asked me to repent,'' he recalled. ''I said no. Then they said I was a Trotskyite agent, a Titoist, a Westerner, but we won't shoot you now because we have to root out your collaborators.'' **********Attending one of these sessions were Mehmet Shehu, a top Albanian Communist leader, and a Soviet envoy named Petrov, he said. **********He was then held in a cell in Albania until March 1949, when he was examined by three Soviet psychiatrists ''as if I had gone mad.'' Then a special plane was sent to fly him from Tirana, the Albanian capital, to Moscow. **********The collapse of Mr. Zachariadis's strategy and of the Communist army brought an end to the civil war, which cost 70,000 lives. ''My position was justified by what happened in Greece,'' Mr. Vafiadis said. ''From that moment on, they couldn't kill me.'' **********In Moscow, he found himself a captive, in his words, ''of the Central Committee'' of the Soviet Communist Party, regarded as a renegade and ''treated like a second-class citizen.'' But he quickly learned Russian and a new trade as a watchmaker. **********In 1956, when Khrushchev was in power, Mr. Vafiadis was briefly reinstated in the Greek Communist Party, but in meetings with other exiled leaders in Bucharest he got into quarrels and was expelled once more. On his return to the Soviet Union, he was told to choose a town for exile where there were no Greeks. He selected Penza, where there is a watch factory. Married a Russian And Had a Son He had married a Russian woman and in Penza they brought up their son, Vladimir, who is now 29. Mr. Vafiadis worked full time at the watch factory until he was 68 and part time for 10 more years. ''I refused to take money without working,'' he said. **********When the amnesty was announced in Athens, his wife and son decided to remain in the Soviet Union, but they have visited him since in Greece. **********Is he still a Communist? ''I believe in the ideology of Communism because only under Communism can humanity rid itself of the oppressive practices of bourgeois society based on profit and exploitation.'' **********He has offered to act as a mediator between the two bitterly opposed wings of the Greek Communist Party, but was turned down because each wished to dominate, he said. **********He has been writing his memoirs -one volume on the period before the civil war has been published - and has sought to work for reconciliation among Greeks. **********Eighteen months ago he appeared on a television program to shake hands with one of the Government generals he had fought in the mountains, Thrasyvoulous Tsalokos. ''I did this symbolically,'' he said, ''to put an end to the atmosphere of hatred.'' **********''I feel I am in my element,'' he said. ''I find in this changed Greece the ideals for which I fought in the resistance and in the civil war.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/business/c-correction-393886.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORRECTION", "print_headline": "CORRECTION", "body_text": " **********A profile of the economist Robert Mundell in this section last Sunday misstated his son Bill's title.

He had been a writer for two of them. **********Now the publisher of one of those two, Globe Communications, has decided to complete the circle and bring out a monthly magazine inspired by the show. It is called Celebrity Focus and is scheduled to show up at checkout counters late next month carrying a January cover date. **********Jack Linder, vice president, corporate development of Globe and now publishing director for Celebrity Focus, said yesterday that the rate base to start would be 250,000 and the four-color ad page rate $6,000. **********The magazine will feature - unpaid - television celebrities in all of its many fashion and service features, and every product they are pictured with will be identified. An ''800'' telephone number printed in the magazine will help readers find retailers selling all of the products appearing in both editorial and advertising material. **********''Manufacturers these days want more and more promotions that have a direct effect on sales,'' Mr. Linder said. **********This is called merchandising, and magazines do it for their customers in many ways, although rarely like the old-fashioned ''as advertised in . . .'' posters and hangtags on garments. **********But that's part of what Globe executives have in mind for Celebrity Focus. And, according to Mr. Linder, there will probably also be a merchandise club - joined either by subscribing or by filling out a coupon from a newsstand copy - that will enable members to get a discount on products appearing in the magazine. **********In keeping with its current merchandising bent, Globe Communications has made some changes in the Bridal Guide quarterly magazine it recently acquired. First, it increased that magazine's frequency to six a year to bring it up to the two leading bridal magazines and then it introduced ''Hope Chest,'' a promotion that enables readers to get mailed packets of brochures and samples. **********Working closely on these and other capers is Richard Seiderman, president of Richard Seiderman & Company, the Globe Communications agency. He was at the client's yesterday as Mr. Linder put in a nutshell the history of the supermarket tabloid, whose major entities are the Florida-based National Enquirer, Rupert Murdoch's National Star and Globe. **********Globe Communications' parent company is Globe International of Montreal, and Mike Rosenbloom, the big boss in Montreal, is listed as publisher of Celebrity Focus. **********There was a time 20 or more years ago, when Globe was named Midnight, Mr. Linder said, that the tabs were much more sensationalistic than they are now. Pressure from the supermarket chains forced them into a more restrained mold so that they became publications largely covering the entertainment industry. **********But then when sales leveled, Mr. Linder said, publishers in need of better sales got the go-ahead for less highbrow publications. **********These, Mr. Linder said, were The Enquirer's Weekly World News and Globe's National Examiner and Sun. **********''The Sun, like the Weekly World News, is about as far down as you can go - the baby with two heads, UFO aliens,'' he noted, ''and I would have to hope that the majority of people buy it because it's fun. **********''It is fantasy journalism - if you allow the use of the word journalism - at its utmost.'' **********One-time publisher of the magazine Find, of the Federation of Jewish Agencies, Mr. Linder has some interesting thoughts about tabloid publishing. For example, he said: ''If you come out with something really crummy, you find you're getting big circulation gains. Start to upgrade and you'll find yourself losing.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/11/world/the-white-house-crisis-us-jury-in-miami-looks-into-charges-contras-broke-laws.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 276, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. JURY IN MIAMI LOOKS INTO CHARGES CONTRAS BROKE LAWS", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS; U.S. JURY IN MIAMI LOOKS INTO CHARGES CONTRAS BROKE LAWS", "body_text": " **********A Federal grand jury in Miami is examining evidence of gunrunning and Neutrality Act violations by Nicaraguan rebels and some American backers, a Federal official said today. **********The official said the grand jury investigation started last month and was not connected to the inquiries into the diversion of $10 million to $30 million in profits from arms sales to Iran to the rebels, known as contras. **********But the official added that the grand jury investigation might ultimately be tied into a larger inquiry that an independent counsel is expected to conduct on the Iran affair and related matters.

But that burden will fall unevenly. **********In the real estate industry, long addicted to investment generated by preferential tax treatment, there will be a decline in values of existing properties and fewer new buildings constructed. Military contractors, on the other hand, may enjoy a windfall in the short run by paying taxes at the new lower rates on income deferred from previous years. **********For the entertainment industry, there could be a loss of billions of dollars in annual revenue even though industry executives are relieved that the tax bill did not impose even tighter limits on business expense deductions. **********At the same time the new tax bill would make it more costly for heavy manufacturing industries such as steel, appliances and farm equipment to undertake the modernization they see as essential to compete with foreign producers. **********The following is a more detailed examination of how the new tax legislation would affect the overall economy and specific key industries. **********Economists yesterday were virtually unanimous in their praise of the tax bill as a significant step in making the nation's tax system more fair. But predictably, they differed widely in assessing its ultimate impact on growth, inflation, interest rates and investment. **********Some expressed concerns about the short-term disruptions in an already weak domestic economy, and others warned that over the long term, the legislation's shift of a $120 billion tax burden from consumers to businesses could have a devastating impact on America's ability to compete abroad. **********''Whenever you get winners and losers, as you have with this bill, the losers react first by curtailing activity, so there is probably going to be a slight negative impact over the next 12 to 18 months,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of Chase Econometrics. **********Mr. Chimerine predicted that the bill would shave about one-quarter to one-half a percentage point from economic growth in 1987 as lower business investment is only partly offset by consumer spending. ''The bill won't by itself push us into recession, but it reinforces a sluggish economy and certainly pushes us in that direction,'' he said. Over the long term, Mr. Chimerine said, he expects little change in growth or interest rates as a result of the bill. **********Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, who called the bill ''a tremendous positive'' for individual taxpayers, agreed that it might reduce growth about a half a percentage point next year but said that the economy would recover that in the second half of 1988 as business's capital spending begins to respond to increased consumer demand. ''American households are going to have more after-tax income to spend or save than ever before,'' Mr. Sinai observed, adding that the millions of low-income individuals who will be removed from the tax rolls altogether are those who traditionally spend the most out of their income. ''For the tax bill to work, consumers are going to have to spend very heavily for the next several years to stimulate business investment. It's sort of a reverse trickle-down theory,'' he said. **********To Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and public policy at Carnegie-Mellon University, this is precisely the problem with the tax legislation. ''The bill has many good features, but it is the wrong bill for the United States at this time,'' he said. ''The people who wrote it are oblivious to our problems in manufacturing and trade and to United States' relations with the rest of the world.'' **********Edward Guay, chief economist for the Cigna Corporation, said the immediate impact of the tax bill would be a burst of economic activity in the final months of this year as businesses and consumers scramble to make investments and purchases that benefit from the current law's tax treatment. The result, he said, could be as much as a percentage point more of economic growth in the fourth quarter. **********Mr. Guay said the added growth in the fourth quarter would in turn mean lower growth in the first quarter of 1987 as the loss of various deductions and tax preferences are felt. Commercial real estate investment would suffer the biggest blow, Mr. Guay said, predicting that the less favorable depreciation rules would mean a decline of as much as 2.5 percentage points a year in investment returns on new projects. The spillover effects would also mean a decline in the value of existing commercial real estate and possibly lower rents, he said. **********At the same time, however, the decrease in commercial real estate activity would lessen credit demands and lower interest rates. ''Long term interest rates could fall sharply, at least a percentage point and perhaps a percentage point and a half,'' Mr. Guay said. **********Such a decline in turn could substantially weaken the dollar against other currencies, Mr. Guay said, unless United States trading partners respond by easing their monetary policies. ''If foreign central bankers respond by easing their interest rates, it would be a tremendous boon to world trade and would greatly benefit the less developed countries who are struggling with debt problems,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/12/business/strauss-retires-at-internorth.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 128, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Strauss Retires At Internorth", "print_headline": "Strauss Retires At Internorth", "body_text": " **********HNG/Internorth Inc. said yesterday that Willis A.

One reason the loans are needed is that Egypt has fallen $4.3 billion behind in payments on its huge foreign debt. **********Egypt Owes $38.6 Billion **********The I.M.F. approval would be an important step toward Egypt's efforts to reschedule payments on its debts of about $38.6 billion, mainly to Western creditors. **********Western diplomats said the Cabinet changes had been planned for several weeks and reflected mounting concern over continuing economic deterioration. **********A team of I.M.F. experts is in Cairo reviewing the Egyptian position and is expected to begin talks shortly. The Fund has been pressing for several changes, including rationalizing a multilevel exchange rate for the Egyptian pound. One dollar will buy 1.35 pounds at a bank, for example, but 1.90 pounds at Pepsi-Cola stands and in other informal mediums of exchange around Cairo. **********The I.M.F. also wants Egypt to give banks more flexibility in setting interests rates for attracting investment and to raise prices for fuel, electricity and other forms of energy. **********A financial source said today that there was still a ''long gap'' between the Egyptian and I.M.F. positions despite the long talks that have already occurred. Consumer Subsidies Costly **********Another problem is the system of consumer subsidies, mostly for food, that costs about $1.47 billion a year and appears to be gradually bankrupting the country. **********But, remembering widespread street riots in 1977 the day after President Anwar el-Sadat raised prices on 25 commodities, Mr. Mubarak's Government is reluctant to cut subsidies or raise prices. Instead, it has been resorting to more stealthy measures, such as reducing the size of a loaf of bread. **********Western and Egyptian sources said one of Dr. Lutfi's main problems was inability to establish his authority over the rest of the Cabinet, which includes several powerful independent figures, including the Defense Minister, Field Marshal Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala, and the Minister of Financial and Economic Affairs, Planning and International Cooperation, Kamal Ganzouri. Both men have the rank of Deputy Prime Minister. **********''He was unable to work with the Cabinet,'' an Egyptian official said. ''The Cabinet was too independent.'' Ministries Said to Overlap A Western diplomat said: ''The problems may be organizational and procedural. The portfolios of the ministers overlap, and it's unclear who speaks for the Government.'' **********In his letter of resignation after 14 months in office, Dr. Lutfi, 50 years old, said, ''We find it is our duty to announce that public interest calls for giving a chance to another group of Egypt's children to continue the march.'' **********Dr. Sedki, the new Prime Minister, has been head of the Government's central auditing agency since 1981 and is a former professor at the Cairo University law school. He assumes a daunting task, since many of Egypt's economic problems are beyond its control. **********Badly hit by the recession sweeping across the Middle East because of falling oil prices, the country has seen three of its major sources of revenue fall sharply. **********In addition to the cut in oil prices, Egypt is facing the return of large numbers of the two million expatriate workers from Persian Gulf states. Tourism has dropped sharply because of fears of Middle East terrorism. Had Become Butt of Jokes **********Dr. Lutfi had become the butt of the jokes by which Egyptians traditionally ease the grimness of their daily lives. **********During the Moslem fasting period of Ramadan last spring, for instance, many of the sweets Egyptians eat when the fast is broken at night were unavailable. A joke making the rounds centered on a favorite rich desert swimming in milk known as an Umm Ali, or the Mother of Ali, the fourth Caliph. **********''You call that an Umm Ali?'' a diner protests when a waiter slaps down an ugly leather-like dish. **********''That,'' replies the waiter, ''is an Umm Ali Lutfi.'' **********Several people were arrested as they altered a poster for a movie called ''Hunger,'' the newspaper Al Shaab reported in September.

The Banking Committee's chairman, Fernand J. St Germain, Democrat of Rhode Island, said the bill represented a ''major step forward in delivering a knockout blow to the nerve center of international drug trafficking.'' **********Failed-Banks Issue **********In another banking development, lawmakers in both chambers continued to grapple with the question of how to restore to regulators the power to sell failed banks to bidders from another state. Legislation, already extended for 90 days, expired on Monday night just after the authorities used it to transfer a major Oklahoma institution to a California bank holding company. **********The F.S.L.I.C. recapitalization plan, which has widespread political support and the basic approval of the industry, is financed essentially by surplus funds of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks that would be used as collateral for borrowings in the open market. The proposal would have no effect on the Federal budget, according to Congressional and industry sources. **********The Congressional Budget Office held that the measure, in its original form, would raise Government outlays by $12 billion because F.S.L.I.C. payouts, unlike those of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, are part of the Federal budget. **********The plan calls for creation of an entity called the Financing Corporation, which would be used as the vehicle for tranferring equity to the insurance fund. The corporation would get $3 billion from the Home Loan Banks' surplus of about $11 billion and would use most of that to buy zero coupon bonds from the Treasury. The bonds, in turn, would be used as collateral for borrowing in the capital market. **********These open-market borrowings could total $10 billion to $15 billion over a four-to-six year period, according to Mark F. Clark, an official of the United States League of Savings Institutions. **********The zero coupon bonds would be used to retire the open-market borrowings used in the early years to resolve problem cases through mergers and payouts to depositors in failed institutions. The Financing Corporation would disappear after 40 years. Penalties on Laundering **********The money-laundering bill, inspired by the activities of drug dealers and organized crime that have already led to fines for 14 banks and current investigations of 65 others, would impose criminal and civil liability on anyone who fails to report currency transactions of more than $10,000 at financial institutions. **********It also provides for the seizure of cash or property of those who participated in such a scheme and would authorize regulatory agencies to use cease-and-desist powers and fines to require institutions to comply with new reporting procedures. **********Moreover, there would be new requirements to assure a full background investigation of those acquiring banks. ''In addition to stopping crime figures from laundering funds at the teller's window, we must make certain this element cannot come in through the back door as owners of these institutions,'' Mr. St Germain declared. **********As for the lapsed authority to sell failing banks to out-of-state buyers, an aide to Mr. St Germain said that the chairman had informed Jake Garn, the Utah Republican who heads the Senate Banking Committee, that he was amenable to a ''short-term'' extension of the measure.

At the 1 P.M. auction of new 10-year 8 7/8 percent Treasury notes, the Government sold the $7 billion of securities at an average yield of 8.97 percent. On Tuesday, the 10-year issue was offered at about 8.93 percent. **********In advance of today's $7 billion auction of new 30-year Treasury bonds, dealers offered the bonds at 9.20 percent, up from 9.17 percent. **********At a time when economists and investors are divided between forecasts of higher and lower interest rates, market participants offered varying assessments of yesterday's trading. **********''The market rallied before the refunding, and now the street is holding a lot of securities which have not been distributed,'' said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers. He said yesterday's price declines, and the inability of the market to improve despite a drop in overnight interest rates was indicative of ''weak retail demand and nervousness.'' **********The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market fell to 7 1/2 percent late yesterday after trading around 7 5/8 percent most of the day. The decline may not last long, some analysts said, noting that the Fed temporarily drained reserves for five days by selling securities. **********S.

He noted that the highest accepted yield at the 10-year note auction was 8.99 percent, ''or less than the 9 percent or more some people expected.'' **********Mr. Rawls said foreign demand could be strong at today's auction, particularly from Japanese buyers. The 30-year bond yields more than 3 1/2 percentage points more than 10-year Japanese Government bonds, ''and the stabilization of the dollar and drop in gold prices'' could attract more investors, Mr. Rawls said. Tax-Exempt Securities **********Dealers in tax-exempt securities said prices fell modestly yesterday in sympathy with the Treasury market. While securities dealers approve of President Reagan's suggestion to delay the effective date of the tax bill, traders noted that a delay would lead to increased supply and perhaps weaker prices. **********Joel R. Mesznik, senior vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert, said yesterday that Congress will set a later effective date, and that ''we will start seeing very soon'' an increased supply of new issues. He estimated that bond sales this year could total $80 billion to $100 billion, with the greatest activity in the second half of the year. **********So far, local governments have been issuing only bonds for what the tax bill calls essential government functions, and are exempt from the proposed state volume limits and the proposed 25 percent alternative minimum income tax. However, Mr. Mesznik said nonessential kinds of bonds (including issues for housing, hospitals, mass transit and other purposes according to the tax bill passed by the House of Representatives) will come to market later this year. **********The Drexel official predicted that about half of the $80 billion of new local government financings expected on average in future years might be arranged in the taxable market. Higher interest rates on taxable bonds would increase interest expenses for local governments by about $1 billion annually, he estimated. **********In the corporate market, officials at Shearson Lehman Brothers offered the third issue this week of what they call ''step-up coupon puttable bonds,'' which allow investors to redeem their bonds at a stated date, or accept a new higher coupon. A $100 million, 10-year issue for the American Express Credit Corporation was offered at par with an initial coupon of 8.45 percent, rising to 9.45 percent after five years. Because of the prospect of a higher interest rate in the future, investors were willing to buy the notes with a yield about equal to five-year Treasury notes. **********Following are results of yesterday's auction of new 10-year Treasury notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures) Average Price#99.379 Average Yield#8.97% Low Price#99.249 High Yield#8.99% High Price#99.573 Low Yield#8.94% Accepted at low#76% Total applied for$15,765,424 Accepted$7,013,484 N.Y. applied for$13,430,438 N.Y. accepted$5,869,518 Noncompetitive$453,000 Interest set at#8 7/8% The 10-year notes mature Feb. 15, 1996."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/01/world/soviet-says-reagan-endangers-2-key-arms-pacts.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1986-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 664, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET SAYS REAGAN ENDANGERS 2 KEY ARMS PACTS", "print_headline": "SOVIET SAYS REAGAN ENDANGERS 2 KEY ARMS PACTS", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union said today that President Reagan's decision to go beyond negotiated limits in nuclear arms was an ''exceptionally dangerous measure,'' and it warned that if he went ahead, Moscow would no longer consider itself bound by the treaties on strategic weapons. **********The Government statement, made public by the Tass press agency, was in response to Mr. Reagan's announcement Tuesday that he would base future nuclear weapon decisions on the United States' military needs and not on the terms of a strategic arms treaty signed in 1979. **********Specifically, he said he intended to continue deploying cruise missiles on B-52 bombers without dismantling older weapons. By year's end, this would take the United States beyond limits on offensive weapons set by the 1979 pact, which followed a second series of strategic arms limitation talks commonly known as SALT II. **********The treaty, signed in Vienna by President Carter and by Leonid I. Brezhnev, was not ratified after Soviet forces intervened in Afghanistan, but each side tacitly agreed to adhere to the terms of the agreement as long as the other did. The United States has been accusing the Soviet Union of undercutting some of the treaty provisions, and Moscow has denied this. **********The first series of strategic arms limitation talks, or SALT I, ended in two accords - an open-ended treaty on defensive arms that limited antiballistic missile systems, and a five-year interim accord that covered some aspects of offensive arms. **********The Soviet statement today said that if Mr. Reagan went ahead with his intention no longer to be guided by the process of strategic arms limitation, the 1972 and 1979 treaties on offensive nuclear arms would be dead and the Soviet Union would do whatever it deemed necessary to maintain a military balance. **********''The American side should have no illusions that it will manage to get military advantages for itself at the expense of the security of others,'' the Government statement said. **********''As soon as the U.S.A. goes beyond the established levels of arms or otherwise violates the other main provisions of the mentioned agreements, observed by the sides until now, the Soviet Union will consider itself free from the relevant commitments under the the 1972 interim agreement and the SALT II treaty and will take the necessary practical steps to prevent the military-strategic parity from being upset.'' **********The statement said Washington's move was contrary to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's insistence that a second meeting with Mr. Reagan's required concrete results on arms control and a conducive political atmosphere. **********The statement still did not rule out a summit meeting, to which the two leaders agreed at their first meeting in November in Geneva, but by underscoring Mr. Gorbachev's conditions, the Soviet Union indicated that Mr. Reagan's decision further jeopardized a second meeting. **********The Soviet Union denied American charges that it had violated the terms of the 1979 treaty, for example, by developing two new types of land-based missiles rather than the one permitted under the treaty. **********''Such assertions are unfounded from beginning to end,'' the statement said. ''There have not been and are no such violations.'' **********Mr. Reagan said Tuesday that the United States would technically continue to be within the 1979 treaty limits for several months, and he urged the Soviet Union to ''use this time to take the steps necessary to alter the current situation.'' **********A White House spokesman said future arms decisions would take into account Soviet observance of arms agreements, steps to reverse the purported Soviet nuclear build-up and indications that the Russians are negotiating seriously in the current Geneva arms talks. **********Mr. Reagan's decision has met with opposition from the North Atlantic allies.

Gray to muster support from the agency's two other members, both Reagan appointees, may have even neutralized his tough regulatory stance on the industry's widespread problems, some experts said. **********In the agency's packed boardroom last Thursday, Mr. Gray had argued for a two-year extension of a measure limiting direct investment in real estate ventures to 10 percent of a thrift institution's assets. But after two hours of debate, he lamented: ''Ladies and gentlemen, there has been some consultation as to where the various board members are coming out. I have indications that the other two members do not want to extend it. So it seems somewhat ridiculous for me to make that motion.'' **********Over the next hour Mr. Gray eventually bowed to a compromise proposal requiring the bank board to study the issue for another three months. **********To close watchers of the agency that regulates the nation's 3,400 savings and loan institutions, it was the first major policy defeat for Mr. Gray and his strong regulatory approach - what some have called a reregulatory policy - since he took over as chairman in mid-1983. ''In years of attending these meetings, I've never see a chairman lose a big vote such as this,'' one industry lobbyist remarked. **********Mr. Gray's loss was good news for the Reagan Administration, which has long been frustrated by his policies. The White House had installed through the recess-appointment process two dereguatory-minded officials who could now outvote the chairman on any issue. **********And coupled with the recent disclosures that Mr. Gray and other top bank board officials had been reimbursed by industry organizations for tens of thousands of dollars in extensive travel, entertainment and personal expenses, experts were questioning whether he would be able to lead the agency effectively through the final six months of his tenure. **********As many as four investigations into the expense reimbursements are now under way, including two by Congressional committees, one by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and one by the Justice Department into possible criminal violations. **********''I think it is going to be very hard for chairman Gray to lead the bank board while he has to keep looking back over his shoulder,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a member of the House Banking Committee. Number of Prominent Backers **********Still, the bank board's two Reagan appointees may not find it easy to neutralize Mr. Gray's regulatory initiatives. The bank board chief has a number of prominent Democratic and Republican supporters in Congress, including Senator William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who is the incoming chairman of the Banking Committee, and Fernand J. St Germain, the Rhode Island Democrat who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee. **********Perhaps more important, however, the apparent stymying of Mr. Gray comes at a time when a deep ideological debate has split the industry, and it sorely needs leadership. More than 400 thrift institutions are essentially bankrupt and a Government insurance fund, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, has seen its assets dwindle from more than $6 billion two years ago to slightly more than $2 billion now. **********The rift has pitted a small, aggressive segment of the industry that believes in further dereguation and expanded powers, embodied by the National Council of Savings Institutions, against a much larger body more committed to traditional home mortgage lending and generally tighter regulations, represented by the United States League of Savings Institutions. **********It has also pitted the Reagan Administration against Democratic members of Congress who are concerned that the White House policies of deregulation and free markets have been taken to an extreme. A Significant Change **********And now, with the two new appointees - Lee H. Henkel Jr., a former Atlanta attorney, and Lawrence White, a former economics professor, who appear to be considerably more deregulatory minded - it has pitted the bank board's chairman against the two other voting members, a significant change from previous bank board members who seemed to rubber-stamp Mr. Gray's policies. **********The greatest fear concerning such internal discord, however, is that such disarray in both the industry and among regulators will stall, for a second year, legislation to inject $15 billion to $25 billion of new funds into the F.S.L.I.C., a step almost everyone in the industry appears to agree is paramount. **********Bank board officials say that the insurance corporation funds will drop to near $1 billion by the end of January and that keeping so many thrift institutions open only increases the long-term losses it will have to suffer from closing down these institutions, paying off insured deposits and trying to liquidate the billions of dollars in bad assets. **********Mr. Gray has estimated that the total cost of bringing health to the industry will be more than $20 billion, and perhaps as much as $50 billion. Some place the figure even higher. Slight Crack in Unanimity **********And the unanimity over the insurance corporation's recapitalization plan has been cracking slightly of late. The League of Savings Institutions has recently begun withdrawing its support in favor of a solution that would be less costly to the industry's healthiest thrift institutions. **********If the trade group eventually withdraws its support and no legislation passes, some fear it could give Congress little alternative than to take a step that would eventually lead to the disappearance of the thrift industry itself - the merger of the drained insurance corporation into the much stronger, $19 billion Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits up to $100,000 at the nation's commercial banks. **********Already, some prominent regulators and members of Congress see that as the only long-range alternative. Last week, Comptroller of the Currency Robert E. Clarke told a group of hostile thrift executives that he saw ''no public policy reason'' for maintaining a separate thrift industry. Mr. Clarke's remarks reflected wording in the 1986 Economic Report to the President that was written by Beryl W. Sprinkel, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. **********But even more neutral regulatory experts have been saying that such a merger is inevitable. According to Congressional sources, the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, has been saying privately in recent weeks that a merger is the only workable alternative. And even Senator Proxmire has speculated that it may be the only answer. 'Bit of a Distraction' **********Mr. Gray, an opponent of a merger, contends that the issue of his expense accounts will not deter him from lobbying successfully for the insurance corporation recapitalization program. ''I think it has been a bit of a distraction,'' he said, ''and it has meant a good deal of work for some members of my staff. But come the first of the year, I'm going to begin pushing for the F.S.L.I.C. recap.'' **********Moreover, he said, he has accomplished most of the regulatory actions he sees necessary, including regulations that limit excessive growth at thrift institutions, limit new investments and require the industry to accumulate greater levels of capital, eventually placing it on a par with the banking industry. **********He added that the only major remaining regulation he planned to propose would be a limit on how much a thrift insitution can lend to one borrower. Currently, thrift institutions can lend up to 100 percent of their net worth to a single borrower, compared with 15 to 25 percent for banks. Mr. Gray said his goal would be a limit more like the curb on banks. League Balks on Records **********With such a tough stance, Mr. Gray has made many enemies in the industry, and thus rejects charges that he is ''in bed with the industry,'' charges that arose particularly after an article in The Wall Street Journal last summer catalogued large travel and other personal expenses by Mr. Gray that were paid for by the League of Savings Institutions. The league has refused to hand over its records on the Gray expenses and has indicated it would only do so in response to a Justice Department subpoena. **********And though parts of the industry may be privately wishing that Mr. Gray would leave before his term expires in June, it is not the first time he has felt pressure to resign and has dug in his heels, refusing to leave. In the summer of 1985, Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, upset by Mr. Gray's policies, began pushing for his ouster. **********Some have speculated that the appointments of Mr. Henkel and Mr. White were the product of Mr. Regan's inability to nudge Mr. Gray from his position 18 months ago. Support by Proxmire **********Senator Proxmire has consistently backed Mr. Gray's tight regulatory initiatives and says he is not about to abandon him over the issue of the expense accounts. An aide said Senator Proxmire was perturbed by the apparent attempt last week to scuttle the direct investment regulation, and promised to make the 10 percent limit part of any legislation this year. **********But the bank board's chairman admits that the expenses dispute has made life much more difficult for him and has chipped away at his credibility. ''They were excessive and inappropriate, and I have apologized to Congress for that excess,'' he said. **********In addition, Mr. Gray has issued orders to bank board personnel to limit excessive business expenses, has forbidden agnecy employees from taking reimbursement from any industry group and has called for all business meetings to be held ''in ordinary business places with modest hotel accommodations.'' **********''I have been singled out for the heat on this,'' Mr. Gray said, adding that previous bank board officials accepted similar reimbursement of travel expenses from industry groups and the regional banks. ''My sin, however, was not paying attention to the level of these expenses.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/business/disney-is-sued.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Disney Is Sued", "print_headline": "Disney Is Sued", "body_text": " **********Saul P.

When he protested, the gunmen told him: ''You are a militia leader; we are thieves. You have to do your job, and we have to do ours.'' **********A bank manager who had two of his cars stolen from the same spot within three months drew incredulous looks when he told friends that he had reported the thefts ''to relieve myself of responsibility.'' **********''If my car is used as a car bomb,'' he said, ''the police have it on record as stolen.'' **********For 11 years, the Lebanese capital has been run by what its own leaders call the law of the jungle. The city, divided into Christian and Moslem halves, barely functions in the normal sense. **********Even the Prime Minister, Rashid Karami, has admitted that the latest measures to maintain law and order have been ineffectual. There is no hope, Mr. Karami has repeatedly said, unless the private armies that dominate East and West Beirut step aside and allow the legitimate authorities to resume their proper functions. Kidnappers Against Kidnapping **********Since the last time Mr. Karami made that statement, at the beginning of May, the security situation has got even worse. Artillery and rocket exchanges a week ago between Moslems and Christians across the Green Line that divides the city left more than 50 people dead. A day after the artillery exchanges, three explosions in Christian suburbs killed 13 civilians. **********In West Beirut, there was more mayhem. A Lebanese Christian professor at the American University was kidnapped May 7, prompting the 120-year-old institution to suspend classes for two weeks in protest. Amazingly, the kidnappers identified themselves as the Movement for Liberating Kidnap Victims. **********The group, previously unknown, said it had abducted the professor, Nabil Matar, to put pressure on Christian militiamen to free Moslem hostages. The same organization later took responsibility for a campaign of assassinations against Christian Armenians in the Moslem part of the capital. Four Armenians were shot dead within 24 hours. **********Large-scale fighting broke out May 23 around Palestinian refugee districts in southern Beirut between Palestinian guerrillas and their opponents in Amal, the principal Moslem Shiite group. The violence, in which 25 people have been killed, continues. It comes a year after similar clashes, in the same area and between the same combatants, lasted a month. Urban Living Gone Mad **********When there is no artillery bombardment and militiamen are not shooting it out on the streets, people go to their shops and offices, and students to their schools, only to rush home in the early afternoon, and certainly before dark. **********Traffic jams build up in the morning and at lunchtime. There are no traffic lights; they were shot out long ago, and the authorities stopped replacing them. **********Traffic policemen stand at intersections to help untie traffic snarls, but they stand aside when militiamen fire their guns in the air, warning motorists to clear the way for them. **********The police and the army are still here, but they are outnumbered and outgunned by militiamen on both sides of the Beirut line. ''We know everything that happens when it happens, but we are helpless to prevent incidents,'' a police officer said. **********The police, who since late last year have dressed in gray uniforms to distinguish them from khaki-clad militiamen, do not interfere when armed men steal cars at gunpoint in broad daylight. **********Every bank has private guards armed with machine guns to protect them against robbery. There were 225 bank robberies in the last 16 months in West Beirut. Police Are Terrorized **********Police stations are open and try to help the public as much as they can. But their function often does not go beyond filing reports about incidents. **********A police officer said arrests were made ''when we are allowed by the militias to do so.'' The few prisons that are left are full of inmates awaiting trial, but courts have not been able to convene because of the worsening security situation. **********The Minister of Justice, Nabih Berri, is the leader of Amal. He has his office in West Beirut while the Justice Palace, where the courts are situated, is in the Christian east. **********The Government is split, and its Moslem and Christian leaders are not on speaking terms. The Cabinet, which was formed two years ago in an attempt at national unity, has not met for six months. At the beginning of the year, Mr. Karami and four Moslem ministers declared a boycott of President Amin Gemayel, a Christian, for his rejection of a Syrian-brokered peace plan for Lebanon. **********Although the civil service barely functions, salaries have to be paid each month to about 150,000 Government employees. But 60 percent of the Government's former tax base is now in the hands of the militias, which collect their own tariffs in the areas under their control. So the state treasury borrows from the central and local banks to meet its financial needs. Inflation and Fuel Shortages **********Sometimes the line of credit runs short. Last week, Lebanon ran out of gasoline because the Ministry of Oil did not have the money to import the fuel. The public debt has risen to the equivalent of about $2 billion. And with the borrowing comes inflation: the United States dollar, which used to sell for 3 Lebanese pounds on the foreign-exchange market here, now sells for 30 pounds. **********Tax cuts of up to one-third have not been effective in getting Lebanese to pay income tax to the Government. ''We cannot pay to the Government and the militias at the same time,'' a businessman said. **********In the Christian districts, the militia known as the Lebanese Forces has set up a computerized taxation system, effectively replacing that of the central Government. Businessmen, shopkeepers and housewives have to pay taxes to the Lebanese Forces. **********In Christian sectors, even sanitation is run by the militia. The streets are cleaner there because the garbage-treating plant is in East Beirut. **********In the Moslem half, municipal trucks pick up the garbage, but it is all piling up in dumps at the city outskirts or thrown into the Mediterranean."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/business/some-bond-restrictions-postponed.html": {"writer_name": "Gary Klott", "pub_date": "1986-03-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 822, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOME BOND RESTRICTIONS POSTPONED", "print_headline": "SOME BOND RESTRICTIONS POSTPONED", "body_text": " **********In a first attempt to ease some of the uncertainty surrounding tax-revision legislation, Congressional tax writers and the Administration reached an agreement today on postponing the effective date of some of the proposed restrictions on tax-exempt bonds issued by state and city governments. **********The bill passed by the House of Representative would have all of its restrictions take effect as of Jan. 1, 1986. Today's agreement would delay the effective date of some until either Sept. 1 or the date of enactment of the tax-revision bill, whichever is earlier. **********Securities dealers, responding to the announcement, said they were examining the possibility of bringing to market some refinancings of bond issues to take advantage of the reprieve. **********But bond market analysts did not expect an avalanche of offerings because the scope of the postponement agreement was narrow. For instance, it did not apply to bonds to finance student loans, mortgage subsidies, private hospitals, private universities or to industrial development bonds. **********No 'Big Onslaught' Seen **********''I don't think there's going to be a big onslaught,'' said Aaron Gurwitz, vice president of bond market research at Salomon Borthers. **********Jeffrey L. Esser, executive director of the Government Finance Officers Association, which represents state and local finance officers, said beneficiaries of the agreement were likely to be state and local governments that have been eager to refinance their older bonds to take advantage of the recent sharp drop in interest rates. Many of them held off because of the House bill's restrictions on advance refunding of bond issues. **********The delay in the effective date was announced in a joint statement by Secretary Baker; Dan Rostenkowski, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman; Bob Packwood, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, and the ranking minority members of the two tax-writing committees, Senator Russell B. Long, Democrat of Louisiana, and Representative John J. Duncan, Republican of Tennessee. **********The agreement came one day after Mr. Packwood, Republican of Oregon, disclosed his draft tax proposal with effective dates generally set for Jan. 1, 1987. Most of the effective dates in the bill passed by the House last December were Jan. 1, 1986. **********The House bill would generally place severe limits on the amounts and types of tax-exempt bonds that could be issued for private purposes. The Packwood proposal also imposes restrictions, albeit milder ones, on private-purpose bonds. Thus some restrictions are likely to be included in any final tax-revision measure. **********Plans for large construction projects by state and local governments across the country have been disrupted by the uncertainty over when and if the House proposal would take effect. **********Today's agreement, however, was not considered a signal that House leaders were ready to bend to a wholesale postponement of the Jan. 1, 1986, effective dates in other provisions of the House bill. Mr. Rostenkowki, an Illinois Democrat, had previously said he was willing to make changes in only a few areas, with municipal bonds being one of them. **********Mr. Packwood issued a separate statement saying he was ''glad the House has so quickly examined the Finance Committee proposal, and moved toward our position on effective dates.'' The statement added, ''I hope the House committee will continue to see the merits of the Senate proposal.'' Limits on Further Change?  But the language of the three-page joint statement on tax-exempt bonds indicated that any further changes would be limited. **********Tax-exempt financing by state and local governments ''is an area where we support a selective postponement of effective dates,'' the statement said. **********The agreement, citing the concerns of ''many members of Congress'' about ''recent dramatic increases'' in the volume of tax-exempt financings for private activities, did not extend the effective dates for restrictions on these types of bonds. **********As a result, Henry Kaufman, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, predicted that the agreement would have a ''minimal impact on the supply and demand for municipals.'' **********He said the House bill's restrictions would continue to apply to many private purpose bonds and most projects run by public-private partnerships. In addition, he said in his weekly ''Comments on Credit'' newsletter that the joint statement ''is silent on provisions affecting major institutional investors and tax-exempts such as banks and property-casualty companies.'' **********''The postponement makes life easier,'' he added, ''for issuers of general obligation and traditional revenue bonds, but these are the types of securities that have been coming to market so far this year anyway.'' **********Mr. Esser of the Government Finance Officers Association said another reason the agreement was likely to have little impact was that, under the Packwood proposal, the interest from all newly acquired municipal bonds - even those previously issued -would be subject to the alternative minimum tax. ''So who's going to buy the bonds now?'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/15/world/as-mexican-chief-ends-visit-the-first-notes-of-discord-are-heard.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Meislin", "pub_date": "1986-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 780, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AS MEXICAN CHIEF ENDS VISIT, THE FIRST NOTES OF DISCORD ARE HEARD", "print_headline": "AS MEXICAN CHIEF ENDS VISIT, THE FIRST NOTES OF DISCORD ARE HEARD", "body_text": " **********As he concluded his visit here, President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico offered and received his first criticism today in what has been an unusually harmonious three-day encounter with United States officials. **********Addressing reporters and guests at a luncheon sponsored by the National Press Club, the Mexican President called for greater protection for the rights of migrant workers in this country, and cautioned the United States to ''avoid taking unilateral decisions on problems of common interest that consequently affect both sides of the border.'' **********While the issue has been played down in official meetings here, Mr. de la Madrid also took the opportunity to reiterate his country's differences with the United States over policy in Central America. **********''Violence will not take care of the problems,'' he said. ''Violence in Central America also implies the risk that there will be political agitation in the rest of Latin America to the detriment of relations between the United States and the countries of Latin America.'' **********Positive Aspects Emphasized **********On the whole, however, as he has throughout the visit, Mr. de la Madrid underscored the positive aspects of the United States-Mexican meeting. Today Reagan Administration officials declared Mr. de la Madrid's visit a success in its overriding goal - to restore a sense of cooperation between the two countries that had been seriously damaged by critical remarks made in recent months by members of Congress and of the Administration. **********Mr. de la Madrid, speaking in the even, formal manner characteristic of his public appearances, assailed those who have been critical of his Government's efforts in combating narcotics trafficking, saying their statements were ''harmful to cooperation between the two countries.'' **********''Mexico's image and its Government's efforts are attacked,'' Mr. de la Madrid said, ''while little is said or written about the significant progress achieved in this struggle.'' He said that over the last three years his country had destroyed drug fields ''whose production would have been enough to intoxicate a population twice that of the United States.'' Criticism Before Helms **********The President, who can speak English fluently, listened in English to questions submitted in writing by reporters, but responded to them in Spanish. **********On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, listened to testimony at an informal hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee room from a group of about 25 Mexicans who complained that their charges of election fraud and corruption in northern Mexico were being ignored by President de la Madrid and other Mexican officials. **********The leader of the group, Alfredo Corella, a chemical engineer who is a leader of the conservative opposition National Action Party in the northern industrial city of Monterrey, said, ''In Mexico we do not have a democracy; we have a facade of a democracy.'' **********He said the group was presenting its views in the United States in the hope that Mr. de la Madrid might hear about them. **********Mr. Helms, whose hearings last May provided a forum for some of the sharpest attacks against Mexico, said that ''Mexican citizens are no longer willing put up with fraud and deceit,'' and that the ''triple oppression'' of political power, corruption and narcotics trafficking ''hides a deep instability that could affect all persons on this continent.'' A Change in Tactics **********The Senator's tone was in stark contrast to that of Reagan Administration officials. After a long period of taking a critical tack in trying to promote change in some Mexican policies, these officials are now seeking the same end through assistance and cooperation. President Reagan told Mr. de la Madrid on Tuesday that the United States was ''ready to lend a hand when and where it can make a difference.'' It was the fifth meeting of the two leaders since 1982. **********''We're very sincere,'' one ranking Administration official said. ''There is a unanimous view at the Cabinet level and held by the President that what we've been saying we're going to do, so long as Mexico meets its part of the bargain too.'' **********That would include compliance with Mr. de la Madrid's expressed goals of opening Mexico's economy to foreign competition as well as strengthening the country's fight against drug trafficking. These were two of the key issues the two countries discussed. **********''The general Administration view is not to share the view that de la Madrid is not strong enough to do this politically or personally,'' the official said, adding, ''We have the sense that de la Madrid plans to move ahead with these reforms.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/30/world/around-the-world-airliner-crash-kills-21-people-in-mexico.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Airliner Crash Kills 21 People in Mexico", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Airliner Crash Kills 21 People in Mexico", "body_text": " **********An AeroCalifornia DC-3 slammed into a hill and burst into flames today when it tried to land at a small, foggy airstrip on the Pacific coast.

The Commonwealth report, made public here at the same time that a state of emergency was being proclaimed in South Africa, called for ''concerted action of an effective kind.'' **********Mrs. Thatcher insisted that this did not represent a call for sanctions. ''They didn't say you have to go into full economic sanctions, nowhere but nowhere in that report,'' she said. She then argued that the report's reference to ''effective economic measures'' did not point to sanctions because there was no proof that sanctions could be effective. Doubts Over Effectiveness **********In any case, Mrs. Thatcher argued, mandatory sanctions stand a chance of working only if all industrial and trading nations join in enforcing them. ''Even then there is some doubt if they would work,'' she said, citing the British experience over 15 years in Rhodesia after the Government in Salisbury unilaterally declared its independence from Britain. **********The report issued by the seven-member Commonwealth mission never uses the word ''sanctions'' but contends that any possibility of peaceful change in South Africa will vanish if the South African authorities gain the impression that they do not have to fear ''effective economic measures.'' **********When the report was issued, the two co-chairmen of the mission - a former Nigerian head of state, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, and former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser of Australia - asserted that far-reaching sanctions by the West offered the only hope to avert a cycle of terror and counterterror. **********Mrs. Thatcher said she was still studying the report and would consult widely, not only in the Commonwealth but also in the European Community and among the seven nations that attend the economic summit meetings, before setting British policy. Even if the Commonwealth were unanimous, she appeared to be arguing, it would make no sense to support sanctions until they had the support of the rest of Europe, the United States and Japan. Attempt at Persuasion **********The British Prime Minister had been deeply involved in persuading President P. W. Botha of South Africa to respond positively to the overtures from the Commonwealth group. Official sources here say she maintained a regular correspondence with Mr. Botha during the six months that the panel, known as the Eminent Persons Group, searched for a basis for negotiations in hopes that a confrontation between South Africa and the West could be averted. **********The sanctions issue is particularly difficult for Britain, which earned an estimated $5.9 billion last year on investments and services in South Africa as well as trade. Mrs. Thatcher said this evening that 120,000 British jobs could be lost if an attempt were made to impose full sanctions. In addition, officials note, there are 250,000 British passport holders in South Africa plus 600,000 white South Africans eligible to claim British citizenship, many of whom might be expected to seek to settle here in the event the Commonwealth group's forecasts of a ''bloodbath'' came true. **********The issue of sanctions against South Africa is also particularly difficult for Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party, which reflects practically the full range of British opinion on the issue and thus could easily be divided by any sudden lurch. Nevertheless, there was a widely held view in political circles that Mrs. Thatcher's arguments against ''full sanctions,'' which not even the Commonwealth leaders are asking, might eventually provide a basis for a retreat to limited sanctions. **********Despite the emergency in South Africa, Britain still appears to hope that the Botha Government will reopen the door to talks before Mrs. Thatcher faces the moment of decision on sanctions. British diplomacy succeeded in deferring that moment after it became clear that the Commonwealth mission had failed. **********The Commonwealth secretariat sought to hold Mrs. Thatcher to a commitment to meet six other heads of government here this month to consider the report. The British, arguing that time would be needed to digest its conclusions and consult widely, suggested September instead. The meeting was finally scheduled for early August. **********The British press was divided this morning on the question of whether far-reaching sanctions were now an inevitability. If Mrs. Thatcher continues to hold out against them, The Guardian asserted, ''Britain will be tainted with the bloodshed that inevitably must follow.'' The Daily Mail took an opposite view. It said, ''It is better to do nothing than to rush into measures which may do more harm than good.'' ----Waite Is Refused Entry LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) -Terry Waite, the Church of England envoy who has made trips to Libya and Lebanon, said today that he had been refused entry to South Africa, where he planned to meet Bishop Desmond M.

Its announcement came hours after Sperry disclosed, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that it had considered selling itself to another company, divesting itself of its principal assets and forming a joint venture with another concern to thwart Burroughs. **********The two events were precisely what Wall Street had been expecting. Sperry's tough talk and forceful actions, including a novel self-tender offer announced Wednesday, were thought by takeover specialists to have been devised primarily to force Burroughs to the bargaining table. **********''We wish to maintain the integrity of both the Burroughs and Sperry organizations and the businesses they represent,'' W. Michael Blumenthal, the chairman and chief executive of Burroughs, wrote to Gerald J. Probst, his counterpart at Sperry, in a letter delivered yesterday. ''We do not want to see Sperry dismembered or engaged in complex financial maneuvers to frustrate what we believe to be an ideal marriage.'' **********Mr. Blumenthal added, ''We are ready to commence negotiations immediately.'' **********Sperry did not respond yesterday to the Burroughs overture and there was no sign as to how the drama would unfold. Sperry's stock rose 37.5 cents, to $73.25, on the New York Stock Exchange in active trading. **********Wall Street had been buzzing in the last week with unconfirmed reports that Sperry was searching for a business transaction or merger partner that would block Burroughs's $70-a-share takeover bid, worth more than $4 billion. **********With yesterday's S.E.C. filing, Sperry confirmed the financial community's suspicions. Left unanswered, however, was what success Sperry was having in finding an ally in its struggle against Burroughs. **********Sperry indicated indirectly that it had been searching for a friendly bidder by saying that its board decided not to disclose the names of any of the other parties involved. **********Spokesmen for Sperry and its financial adviser, the First Boston Corporation, declined to comment beyond what they told the S.E.C. **********In that filing, Sperry said it would continue to examine possible actions, depending on the success of the Burroughs tender offer. These included buying another company or business, issuing additional securities that presumably would make a takeover more costly and buying back some of its stock. Burroughs's Offer **********The takeover fight began earlier this month when Burroughs made its second attempt to acquire Sperry in two years, offering to buy the company's more than 62 million shares outstanding at $70 apiece. Soon afterward, and before Sperry responded, Burroughs began a tender offer under which it would purchase 55 percent of Sperry's stock for $70 in cash and the rest for securities that it said would be worth $70 a share. **********On Wednesday, Sperry rejected the bid and said that if the Burroughs tender offer were successful it would purchase whatever shares Burroughs did not buy for $80 a share in cash. **********Such a self-tender offer would allow Burroughs to gain control of Sperry, but only at a higher price - between $74 and $75, which would have to be paid entirely in cash. According to takeover specialists, Burroughs would then have a choice of negotiating with Sperry, walking away from the deal or allowing both tender offers to take place as planned. The most sensible option, the specialists said, would be to try to negotiate. **********Burroughs had indicated all along that it would be willing to negotiate. **********Wall Street analysts said there had been clues from the beginning that Burroughs was willing to raise its $70 bid. Most important, they said, was that Burroughs had raised $3 billion in cash, when it needed only $2.7 billion for its tender offer."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/business/company-news-cnw-job-plan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 67, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CNW Job Plan", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; CNW Job Plan", "body_text": " **********The CNW Corporation said that it would offer an early-retirement incentive program to 1,200 nonunion employees at its rail subsidiary, the Chicago and Northwestern Transportation company.

The President said his intent was to ''send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between us with a new relationship.'' **********It is ''utterly false,'' the President said, to assert that the United States sent weapons to Iran as ''ransom'' for Americans held in Lebanon. He said at another point that one of the reasons for the diplomatic initiative was ''to effect the safe return of all hostages.'' **********U.S.-Iranian Financial Talks **********Before Mr. Reagan spoke, Treasury officials said American and Iranian financial officials met two weeks ago in The Hague to discuss the return of nearly $500 million to the Teheran Government. The money represents overpayments by Iran when it settled bank claims in 1981 as part of the arrangements that ended the hostage crisis that began in 1979.  [ Page A9. ]  Several Democratic members of Congress said that despite Mr. Reagan's assertions to the contrary, they still believed that the United States exchanged arms with Iran for the release of American hostages.  [ Page A8. ]  Bipartisan Criticism The President's speech was apparently designed to respond to a wave of bipartisan Congressional criticism that secret American arms shipments to Iran had undercut Administration policy that ostensibly sought a worldwide embargo against weapons to Teheran. But he did not cite Congressional opposition so much as press reports that he said had distorted ''the facts.'' **********The first disclosure that the United States had secretly sent military equipment to Iran was made by a Lebanese weekly magazine, Al Shiraa. **********In his speech, Mr. Reagan also made these key points about his decision 18 months ago to establish secret contracts with Iran: *********** He said the United States had not violated its policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists. Instead, American emissaries, including Robert C. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, sought to press the Teheran Government to use its leverage over the pro-Iranian group that seized some of the American hostages. *********** The President said Iran's ''strategic importance'' and its influence in the Islamic world made it crucial that the United States seek to ease the ''bitter and enduring disagreements'' between the two countries. *********** Mr. Reagan acknowledged that one goal of his efforts to improve relations with Iran was to press Teheran ''to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of all hostages held there.'' He said that ''some progress has been made'' and that since the United States began its contacts with Iran there had been ''no evidence'' of Iranian involvement in terrorism against Americans. Another goal, he said, was to bring an ''honorable end'' to the six-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. Unusually Defensive Tone **********Mr. Reagan's speech, marked by an unusually defensive tone, depicted American contacts with Iran, and the establishment of a secret arms relationship, as the central elements of a strategy to improve ties with a strategically pivotal Persian Gulf country. **********''The United States has not made concessions to those who hold our people captive in Lebanon - and we will not,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''The United States has not swapped boatloads or planeloads of American weapons for the return of American hostages. And we will not.'' **********''Our Government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands,'' Mr. Reagan continued. ''That 'no concessions' policy remains in force - in spite of the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments.'' **********''We did not, repeat, did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages - nor will we,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''Those who think we have 'gone soft' on terrorism should take up the question with Colonel Qaddafi.'' **********''We have not, nor will we, capitulate to terrorists,'' Mr. Reagan said. Seems Somber During Speech **********Mr. Reagan appeared somber during his 15-minute speech, which represented an effort to justify American dealings with Iran as part of the broader national security needs of the United States. **********In this context, Mr. Reagan seemed to be arguing that United States policy was intact because his Administration had not dealt directly with radical groups holding the American hostages, but with the Iranian Government, which had leverage over these groups. **********''Our interests are clearly served by opening a dialogue with Iran and thereby helping to end the Iran-Iraq war,'' the President said. **********Mr. Reagan made his speech tonight reluctantly, according to aides, and largely because of reports that have deeply embarrassed the White House about the establishment of secret contacts with Iran and the supply of American military equipment to Teheran. **********Publicly, Washington has long called for a worldwide arms embargo against Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980. **********An angry Mr. Reagan told reporters earlier in the day at the White House, ''You've made it all necessary for me to speak out at this time because I've never heard such dissemination of misinformation since I've been here as has been going on for the last several days.'' He made that comment at a meeting with United States ambassadors on the Administration's plans to curb drug abuse. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Reagan decided to make the speech because he ''feels it is appropriate in view of all the speculation, some of it inaccurate, that he wants to set the record straight for the American people once and for all.'' **********The decision to make the speech also marked an end to a sharp debate within the Administration in which Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, argued forcefully for a speech to end the wave of criticisms about the secret arms relationship with Iran. The White House national security adviser, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, urged Mr. Reagan not to make the speech, according to Administration officials. **********Mr. Reagan did not mention the role of Israel, which is reported to have sent arms to Iran and is said to have played a role in reopening the Administration's contacts with Teheran. **********The President also made no mention of the European allies, which have been under intense American pressure to act against countries supporting terrorism and have in recent days criticized the Administration's Iran policy. Sent McFarlane to Iran **********Mr. Reagan acknowledged that he sent Mr. McFarlane, the former national security adviser, on a secret four-day mission to Iran last spring ''to raise the diplomatic level of contacts'' with Iranian officials. **********''Since then, the dialogue has continued, and step-by-step progress continues to be made,'' the President said. **********''For 18 months now we have had under way a secret diplomatic initiative to Iran,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''That initative was undertaken for the simplest and best of reasons.'' **********The United States, he said, sought to gain ''some degree of access and influence within Iran - as well as Iraq. **********''At the same time we undertook the initiative, we made clear that Iran must oppose all forms of international terrorism as a condition of progress in our relationship,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''The most significant step which Iran could take, we indicated, would be to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of all hostages held there.'' **********Three American hostages out of a group of five have been released over the last 14 months. Those five Americans were believed held by a Lebanese pro-Iranian group. In addition, three other Americans have been seized in recent months, apparently by a pro-Libyan group. **********Mr. Reagan insisted that he had never wavered from his ''firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands.'' He reiterated, ''That 'no concessions' policy remains in force - in spite of the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments.'' **********Mr. Reagan compared his diplomatic move toward Iran to President Nixon's decision in 1971 to send Henry A. Kissinger on a secret mission to establish ties to China. **********In authorizing the transfer of what he termed ''small amounts of defensive weapons and spare parts for defensive weapons to Iran,'' Mr. Reagan said he was seeking to convince the Iranians ''that our negotiators were acting with my authority.'' **********He said that the ''modest deliveries'' of American arms ''could easily fit into a single cargo plane.'' Mr. Reagan added, ''They could not, taken together, affect the outcome of the six-year war between Iran and Iraq - nor could they affect in any way the military balance between the two countries.'' 'Send a Signal' **********Mr. Reagan said he wanted ''to send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between us with a new relationship.'' **********''It is because of Iran's strategic importance and its influence in the Islamic world that we chose to probe for a better relationship between our countries,'' the President said. **********Before the President's speech tonight, Congressional Democrats called for hearings on the Administration's contacts with Iran. **********Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Reagan should ask for the resignation of Admiral Poindexter, the national security adviser, and a central figure in the Iranian operation. But Admiral Poindexter told reporters at the White House, ''I have no plans to resign.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/business/quarter-net-up-49.7-at-at-t.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1986-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 602, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "QUARTER NET UP 49.7% AT A.T.& T.", "print_headline": "QUARTER NET UP 49.7% AT A.T.& T.", "body_text": " **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said today that earnings for the first quarter of 1986 rose 49.7 percent because of strong results in its long-distance business and a significant accounting change involving pension fund expenses. **********The earnings, announced at the start of the company's annual shareholders meeting here, exceeded most Wall Street expectations and sent A.T.&T. shares up $2.125, to close at $24.50.

With its four residential towers above a five-story base of 300,000 square feet of office space, the Zeckendorf development is expected to become the anchor for a broader transformation around Union Square. **********That may take time, even though two substantial sites just south of the Zeckendorf block, which runs from 14th to 15th Streets between Union Square and Irving Place, are already in developers' hands. **********But on the west side of the square, on a T-shaped site that had been a parking lot, the transformation is already under way. There the M.D. Carlisle Construction Corporation, an investment building company based in Bayside, Queens, has started construction of three new midrise residential buildings that reflect the zoning revisions for the Union Square district made last year. Square Industries, a garage operator and real estate investment company that bought the 28,000-square-foot site two years ago, is Carlisle's partner. **********The 80 feet of frontage on Union Square West is flanked by a 12-story loft building and a five-story commercial building, both of them built to the lot line. Behind these buildings, the site extends from 15th Street to 16th Street. **********One purpose of the Union Square rezoning was to put more emphasis on residential development and less on commercial. Another was to eliminate the bonuses for plazas and encourage buildings to be built out to the street line. That helps make new buildings on ''infill'' sites more compatible with older developments on surrounding sites. **********But the Union Square rezoning extended only to a depth of 100 feet west of Union Square West. It would in theory have been possible on the Carlisle site to erect a tall tower well set back on the lot, with open space on all three sides. **********Instead, the Manhattan office of the Department of City Planning initiated a midblock rezoning for about a two-block strip of land just west of the Union Square district. This allowed the developer to put up three midrise residential buildings - a 13-story at 25 Union Square West, a 12-story at 21 East 15th Street and another 12-story at 20 East 16th Street. **********All three will extend to the streetline and share a landscaped interior court. Interior apartments will have balconies facing the court, and there will be a 48-car garage underneath. Liebman Liebman Associates is the architect. **********Building in this manner means a diminished ability by the developer to market views from high floors, which is important in condominium projects or rentals seeking the top of the market, but less important in standard rentals. In this case the changed zoning also brings the project an increase of about 50,000 square feet over the development potential in the earlier zoning. **********''The planners convinced us that the extra square footage would offset the usual value that the towers have,'' said Jules Demchick, a general partner in the project, who is president of a consulting firm, Environmental Solutions Ltd. **********''It's not a glitzy, high-profile project, but it shows much about what is happening here,'' said Con Howe, director of the Manhattan planning office. ''Our goal in Union Square is to encourage residential construction at the right scale and character, and this fits.'' **********In the building fronting Union Square West there are to be 92 apartments - 40 studios and 52 one-bedrooms - plus ground-floor retail space. The two side-street buildings will have 74 apartments each - 20 studios and 54 one-bedrooms. Studios are expected to rent for about $1,000 to $1,100 a month, and smaller one-bedrooms for as low as $1,450 a month, although the average-sized one-bedroom will be about $1,650 a month. Occupancy is expected early next spring. **********The president of Carlisle Construction is Harry Feldman, who has built many residential and commercial projects in and outside the city over the last 40 years. He has operated independently since 1972 from former partners at a development company based in Manhattan - the Carlyle Construction Corporation. **********Elsewhere in the Union Square area, Philips International Ltd., a development company, has acquired the square block from East 13th to East 14th Streets between Broadway and Fourth Avenue, according to Philip Pilevsky, president. One of the properties on the site is 842 Broadway, in which The Village Voice has its offices. **********Redevelopment probably would involve renovating the office building and connecting it at the lower level with new development on 14th Street, Mr. Pilevsky said. But the project is not imminent. **********Another development company with long-term plans in Union Square is the Glick Construction Company, which purchased the 18,000-square-foot midblock plot on 14th Street east of Fourth Avenue on which Luchow's restaurant once stood. There are no immediate redevelopment plans, Jeffrey Glick said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/business/company-news-sharon-steel-loan.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Sharon Steel Loan", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Sharon Steel Loan", "body_text": " **********The Sharon Steel Corporation said it would receive an $85 million asset-based loan from the American Financial Corporation.

Rates for Treasury bills fell slightly.  ''The decline in the Federal funds rate helped the tone of the market, especially in the short end,'' said Doug McAllister, a sales manager in the government securities department at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Among longer maturities, Mr. McAllister said, fears of a quick rise in inflation have subsided, but that has not been enough to entice many institutional investors. **********Federal Funds Rate at 5 3/4% **********The Federal funds rate, which measures the rate for overnight bank loans and is a closely watched benchmark for other short-term rates, averaged 6.36 percent in the week ended Oct. 1, up from the 5 7/8 percent rate that had prevailed since late August. But in recent days, the funds rate has fallen to about 5 3/4 percent or less, reassuring securities dealers that the Federal Reserve is not trying to raise rates. **********Rates for Treasury bills continued to fall, with the three-month issue down to 5.07 percent, from 5.08 percent at Monday's auction. Analysts said that central banks in West Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, which have recently bought dollars, might invest their funds in the bill market. **********In the Treasury note and bond market, dealers are still looking forward to a revival of demand from Japanese investors, whose fiscal year ended on Sept. 30. Among outstanding issues, the 6 3/4 percent notes due in 1990 were unchanged, with a 6.60 percent yield, and the 7 1/4 percent bonds due in 2016 were offered at 96 5/8, down 3/32, to yield 7.53 percent. Outstanding seven-year notes, corresponding to an issue the Treasury is expected to sell next week, offer a yield of about 7.04 percent. Ford Tries Book-Entry System **********The Ford Motor Credit Corporation broke new ground yesterday with the first offering of corporate bonds available only in book-entry form. The Ford unit was one of the large, frequent issuers of corporate bonds that have been urged by the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, John S. R. Shad, to adopt a book-entry system, where records of ownership are maintained electronically and no paper certificates are available. **********Just last month the Treasury completed its conversion to book entry for all new securities, and the concept is spreading to other sectors of the credit markets. Elimination of paper certificates reduces expenses for issuers and securities firms. **********''There is a slight cost savings by using a book-entry system, but the principal reason is that it simplifies the whole process of issuing debt,'' said Wayland F. Blood, treasurer at Ford Motor Credit. He said that about 60 percent of the company's commercial paper was now issued in book-entry form, and estimated that the practice will spread for short- and long-term securities in coming years. Investor Acceptance Noted **********Although some analysts have expressed concerns that certain kinds of investors will shun securities that are not available in certificate form, there is little evidence of such discrimination. John P. Curtin Jr., vice president in the corporate syndicate department at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who oversaw distribution of the $200 million issue of three-year notes yielding 7.17 percent, said, ''The book-entry feature had no impact on the price of this issue.'' **********Robert C. Apfel, a consultant specializing in applications of book-entry systems to securities firms, said that archaic requirements that some instititions hold securities in physicial form must soon be revised if they have not already. Holders of outstanding Treasury bonds may elect to hold engraved certificates, but that option will not be available at the next Treasury bond auction in November. Use Seen Spreading **********According to Mr. Apfel, about $8.7 billion of money-market preferred stock and money-market notes are outstanding in book-entry form only, along with $7.25 billion of recently issued tax-exempt bonds and another $2.5 billion of tax-exempt issues that were insured after their original issuance. About $24 billion of certificates of deposit are outstanding in book-entry form, primarily high-yielding issues that are distributed far beyond their local market area by securities brokers who offer them in amounts of $100,000 or less so that the issues are Government-insured. **********The use of a book-entry system is separate from the issuance of debt securities in registered form, where paper certificates may be delivered but records of ownership are maintained by a registrar. Corporate bonds, for example, have been issued in registered form since the mid-1960's. Since the middle of 1983 all new tax-exempt issues and all new Treasury issues have been sold in registered form."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/business/bank-asks-that-bid-be-withdrawn.html": {"writer_name": "Andrew Pollack", "pub_date": "1986-11-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 859, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANK ASKS THAT BID BE WITHDRAWN", "print_headline": "BANK ASKS THAT BID BE WITHDRAWN", "body_text": " **********The board of the BankAmerica Corporation today asked the First Interstate Bancorp to withdraw its takeover proposal until new management at BankAmerica can complete a thorough review of the bank's strategic plans. **********John R. Beckett, the chairman of the board's executive committee, said the BankAmerica board was not rejecting First Interstate's offer but needed more time to weigh its options. Mr. Beckett's statement seemed to suggest, however, that the board would like to keep the bank independent and give the new management more time to return the troubled bank to profitability. Request Applied to All Bids **********The board also asked other parties that have expressed interest in buying all or part of the bank or who have made other proposals for ''extraordinary transactions'' to withdraw them. **********First Interstate, in a brief statement, said it was ''very disappointed'' with the decision, adding that it is ''reviewing its alternatives.'' **********In his statement, Mr. Beckett said: ''The board, after consultation with management and with the advice of its investment banking advisers, is aware of nothing that would justify a decision to merge the bank at this time. The board is encouraged by the aggressive approach being taken by the new management team to address the bank's problems and put it on the road to recovery.'' **********Mr. Beckett said it would be ''inappropriate'' to decide on a merger while the review is in progress, and he said BankAmerica requested the proposals be withdrawn ''as friendly responses to friendly proposals.'' Decision to Keep Seafirst **********BankAmerica, which is the nation's second-largest banking company after the New York-based Citicorp, did not indicate how long the review would take. It did say that its review has progressed far enough that it has decided to keep its Seafirst Corporation subsidiary, the largest bank in Washington State. **********Seafirst was one of the biggest assets it could sell to raise money. At least one bid for it - of $850 million from Oregon's U.S. Bancorp - has already been received. **********The statement did not say anything about the Charles Schwab & Company discount brokerage business, another key subsidiary that the bank's previous management wanted to keep. The omission of Schwab from the statement indicates the new management is willing to sell the subsidiary if the price is right, sources said. **********Many analysts had expected the banking company to ask for more time. The request for a withdrawal of the offer was something of a surprise, however, and analysts termed it a clever move. **********''They are not saying they are rejecting the proposal; they are just asking it to go away,'' said Donald K. Crowley, analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. **********Analysts and banking industry sources said the board could buy time because it has only recently installed new management. The board three weeks ago ousted the chief executive, Samuel H. Armacost, and replaced him with A. W. Clausen, Mr. Armacost's predecessor. The chief financial officer, Frank N. Newman, has also been on the job only about a month. More Options Noted for Bank **********''The options available to the bank are rapidly expanding,'' said Joseph T. Arsenio 2d, an analyst with Birr, Wilson & Company. Mr. Arsenio said that the maneuvering for a possible takeover is far from over and may indeed get more heated in the future. **********BankAmerica did not name the other parties that had expressed interest in holding discussions, but Citicorp is known to be one of them. At least two investor groups have put forth plans for infusing capital into the bank. Several other banks have expressed interest in buying pieces of BankAmerica, such as Schwab and Seafirst. **********Both the management and the board of BankAmerica would prefer to keep the bank independent, though they could face shareholder lawsuits if they rejected a good offer. First Interstate has offered a package of securities it values at $22 a share, or a total of $3.4 billion. No Outright Rejection **********Some sources speculated that the reason the bank did not reject First Interstate's bid outright was that BankAmerica's financial adviser, Salomon Brothers Inc., did not find the bid to be clearly inadequate. **********The announcement of the bank's decision came after the close of stock trading. BankAmerica shares rose 62.5 cents today, to $16.125, with 1.6 million shares traded. First Interstate dropped $1, to $53.375. **********The BankAmerica decision would normally be expected to lead to a sharp drop in BankAmerica's stock on Tuesday. The drop, however, might be minimized because the takeover threat is clearly not over and because First Interstate could begin a hostile bid. **********The request for withdrawal throws the ball back into First Interstate's court. **********First Interstate could let its bid stand. Or it might go even further and make a tender offer. If First Interstate withdraws and waits, it could get another chance if BankAmerica's situation does not improve. If it does improve, however, a takeover would become less likely. **********Few outsiders expect First Interstate either to sweeten its bid or to give up entirely."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/business/futures-options-crude-oil-continuing-drop-on-world-market.html": {"writer_name": "Lee Daniels", "pub_date": "1986-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 474, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Crude Oil Continuing Drop on World Market", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; Crude Oil Continuing Drop on World Market", "body_text": " **********Crude oil prices slumped further yesterday on the world oil market, and oil analysts in the United States said that the failure of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree on production quotas is likely to keep them in this low range for the next several months. **********OPEC's inability to reach an accord and the expectation that gasoline inventories would increase over last week ''delivered a one-two punch to the market today,'' said Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********But the market assumption about gasoline supplies was mistaken.

Shortly after the advertising agency was founded 16 years ago, by two brothers in their 20's with a grubstake of less than $40,000, Charles Saatchi sent takeover proposals to some large, established London agencies. **********''People in the industry laughed at them then as uppity pups,'' one London advertising executive recalled today. **********These days, nobody laughs at Saatchi & Saatchi, which today agreed to buy Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. for $450 million, becoming the world's largest advertising agency. After the Bates acquisition, Saatchi will have total billings of $7.5 billion, operations on five continents and a client roster that includes more than half of the 100 biggest corporations in the world. **********Saatchi's explosive growth has been fed by a string of more than two dozen acquisitions. This penchant for picking off other firms has earned it the nickname ''Snatch-it & Snatch-it.'' The acquisitions have diversified the company geographically and especially into the United States, adding such firms as Compton Inc. in 1982, McCaffrey & McCall Inc. in 1983, and this year both Dancer Fitzgerald Sample Inc. and Backer & Spielvogel, as well as Bates. Expanding Beyond Ads **********The purchases in recent years have taken Saatchi well beyond its original advertising base into such fields as management consulting, with the 1984 purchase of the Hay Group, and market research, with the acquisition in the same year of Yankelovich, Skelly & White. **********''Saatchi is now a broad-based marketing and management services company,'' said Neil Blackley, an analyst for James Capel & Company, a London brokerage. ''It enables Saatchi to offer a package of services and international scope to its multinational clients.'' **********The Bates acquisition, most analysts say, is an astute move, bringing into the Saatchi fold a formidable operation in terms of quality and size. **********Yet the Bates purchase and the torrid pace of acquisitions that Saatchi has maintained for the last few years have raised questions about its ability to assimilate the various units smoothly. The 'Pregnant Man' **********Outsiders doubt whether Saatchi can avoid the pitfalls of corporate bigness, with size tending to breed bureaucracy and bureaucracy stifling the creativity that has been the agency's hallmark and has produced such memorable items as the ''pregnant man'' poster for a birth control campaign by Britain's Health Education Council asking, ''Would you be more careful if it was you who got pregnant?''; a 90-second science fiction spot for British Airways, showing the island of Manhattan coming in for a landing at Heathrow Airport, and the hard-hitting campaign for Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in 1979 with the motto ''Labor Isn't Working.'' **********Some competitors contend that there has been a dearth of striking material coming out of Saatchi in recent months and they suggest that the company's attention is shifting from the story board to the balance sheet. Such comments, several analysts said, reflect wishful thinking on the part of Saatchi's rivals, not reality. **********''Saatchi is a very creative agency, despite its size,'' said Mark Shepperd, an analyst for Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage. ''And I don't see why that should change.'' **********To maintain the small-company atmosphere often associated with creativity, Saatchi insures that the companies it buys remain separate operating units. But the corporate headquarters staff in London require regular and strict financial reporting from each of the operating entities, monitoring cash flow and balance-sheet positions. Steady Growth for 8 Years **********So far, the results show this approach to be extremely effective. During the last eight years, Saatchi's earnings have grown at an average annual rate of 38 percent. Last year, the company's pretax profit more than doubled to $62 million, on revenues of about $2 billion. For the current fiscal year, ending in September, Saatchi is forecasting pretax profit of about $105 million, with most analysts now projecting earnings of $175 million in 1987 including the Bates acquisition. **********Last month, the company sold more than $600 million in new stock to raise funds, mainly for its acquisition program. **********The company is directed by the brothers Saatchi - Charles, the 42-year-old creative spirit, and Maurice, the 39-year-old business manager. Reared in an affluent family in north London, the two came together as partners in 1970 from divergent paths. Charles quit school at 18 and worked his way up in various ad agencies to become one of the highest-paid copywriters in London.

It is expected to have sales of about $8 billion this year. **********The other company will be formed from four less stellar performers: Tupperware, West Bend consumer products, Hobart food equipment and the Wilsonart plastics. This company - as yet unnamed - is expected to have annual sales of about $2 billion. **********'Represents Reversal of Merger' **********''To a large extent this represents a reversal of the merger with Dart,'' said Robert J. Cummins, an analyst with Wertheim & Company. ''The only part of Dart that Kraft will keep is Duracell. **********''One strong motivation of the decision,'' Mr. Cummins added, ''was that the two parts of the company separately would be valued by the stock market at a higher value than Dart & Kraft combined.'' **********Based on today's trading, Wall Street obviously agreed. Dart & Kraft's stock rose $3.25, to $60.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. **********Company officials denied that they were dumping their weaker busineses and insisted that all the operations of the smaller company would be strong in their own right. Most Said to Be Pleased **********Analysts said most company officials were pleased about today's decision. Executives on the Kraft side felt their earnings strength, as reflected in the stock price, was dragged down by Tupperware, Hobart and the other units that had less impressive results. At the same time, executives on the Dart side were frustrated that their businesses were increasingly dominated by Kraft. **********''The key thing is that Dart & Kraft could never isolate the value of the food business and of Duracell to investors as long as there were things like Hobart and Tupperware,'' said William Maguire, a food analyst with Merrill Lynch. He suggested that some officials on the Dart side were happy to be spun off because they might be planning to take certain units private and the new set-up would make it easier to do so. **********Analysts said that the merger of Dart with Kraft was part of the food industry's trend toward forming conglomerates, such as the Beatrice Companies. Today's move is seen as part of the industry's back-to-basics trend, such as the move by General Mills last year to spin off its toy and fashion divisions. **********Dart & Kraft, which is based in Northbrook, a Chicago suburb, said the transaction would be carried out through a pro rata distribution of the shares of the smaller company. John M. Richman, Dart & Kraft's chairman, said the company had not decided how many shares of the smaller company would be distributed to shareholders for each share of Dart & Kraft. **********Mr. Richman, who will be chairman and chief executive of the new Kraft, said today's move was not inconsistent with the 1980 merger of Kraft Inc., which he headed, and Dart Industries, which was headed by Justin Dart, the industrialist. 'Heck of a Deal' **********''The original merger was a heck of a deal for shareholders,'' he said, noting that a $100 investment in the original Dart & Kraft had appreciated to $534 as of last Tuesday. **********But he said circumstances have changed since 1980. ''The time is right this time to create two separate companies that can be evaluated on their own solid merits,'' Mr. Richman said. **********Analysts said Kraft officials were happy to merge with Dart Industries in 1980 because they were discouraged by the food industry's growth prospects. In addition, they were impressed by the performance of Dart's Tupperware division. **********Mr. Cummins, the analyst, said, ''Today's move represents the conclusion in retrospect that Kraft, that the food business, is a better business than they realized.'' **********At a news conference in Chicago today, Mr. Richman said the Kraft food division's earnings have been rising by 10 percent a year. They were $699.5 million last year - or about 70 percent of the parent company's operating earnings - on sales of $7.06 billion. The parent company had $466 million in net income last year on sales of $9.94 billion. **********Mr. Richman said that Duracell's earnings have been rising by more than 20 percent a year. That division had sales of about $860 million last year. **********In explaining the spinoff, Mr. Richman said, ''the performance of Kraft and Duracell is increasingly overshadowing that of the other businesses whose combined profit is becoming a smaller percentage of the Dart & Kraft whole.'' Tupperware Boom **********When Dart merged with Kraft, Tupperware was booming, and had operating earnings of $212 million, representing about 30 percent of Dart & Kraft's operating income. By last year, however, Tupperware had sales of $761.7 million but its earnings had fallen to $112 million - or just 11 percent of the company's earnings. Tupperware parties and earnings have been hurt by the trend of more women working outside the home. **********Warren L. Batts, Dart & Kraft's president and chief operating officer, will become chairman and chief executive of the smaller company, which will have $1.3 billion in assets and 23,000 employees. **********Dart & Kraft officials said that the other businesses - Tupperware, Hobart, Wilsonart and West Bend -may not be glamorous, but that they were strong performers in their respective industries. **********''They won't generate as much cash as a food company,'' Mr. Batts said. ''But we don't see any problem going off on our own.'' **********Company officials noted, for example, that Tupperware was slowly turning around, helped by new products and increased advertising.

In recent months the Reagan Administration has generally concluded that such an approach is not succeeding, the officials said. **********Rebels Seize More Territory **********They said one area of concern was that Communist insurgents, despite the peace overtures, had been seizing additional terrority to strengthen their bargaining position. **********In addition, they said the Administration, unlike the Aquino Government, was convinced that many of the insurgents had no wish to end their rebellion. **********''There are real concerns in certain quarters,'' said a ranking Administration official who did not want to be identified.

Under Pressure From Military **********Mrs. Aquino, who will meet Mr. Reagan on Sept. 17 in their first face-to-face talks and who will also address a joint session of Congress, is under some pressure from her own military not to take a soft line with the Communists. In July a group of military officers supported a short-lived takeover of a Manila hotel and the proclamation of a regime loyal to the deposed President, Ferdinand E. Marcos. **********The officers raised the specter of Communism and it is accepted by Philippine commentators that if the armed forces were to turn against Mrs. Aquino they would probably claim that she had failed to take aggressive action against the Communists. **********Mrs. Aquino's discussions in Washington are expected to focus on the economic plight of the Philippines, which has lagging economic growth, a $1.3 billion deficit and no pledges of additional United States economic or military aid in light of Federal deficit pressures, the Administration officials said. Private Investments Sought **********On a visit to Manila in June, Secretary of State George P. Shultz signed an agreement to turn over to the new Government $200 million in United States aid that had been authorized but was delayed when President Marcos fled office in late February. **********Administration officials said Mrs. Aquino is to appeal for increased American private-sector investment to help the Philippine economy rebound. She is to address business groups in several cities, including New York and Boston. **********''There is an understanding on their side what our own financial situation is,'' said another senior Administration official. ''Thus the emphasis and the success of the visit will be in getting the message of aiding the Philippines across to our private sector.'' **********One of Mrs. Aquino's first acts after taking office was to free about 500 political detainees, including Jose Maria Sison, the founder of the Communist Party, and Bernabe Buscayno, the first leader of the Communist New People's Army. But in recent months she has told the guerrillas to end their rebellion or risk being pursued by a ''reformed and reinvigorated fighting force.''' **********Communist rebels, estimated by the United States to number 20,000, have been fighting for 17 years to seize power while Moslem separatists in the south of the country have also been in conflict with the Government. **********A senior official said that the Administration had at first supported the peace overture, but that time had elapsed without tangible results. The Philippines Army, the officials, was now trained and able to conduct counterinsurgency efforts. **********The official said the Administration believed the Communists rebels had been trying to seize as much terrority as possible in recent months to be in a better bargaining position with the Aquino Government. #2 Views of the Conflict At the same time, he said the United States and the new Government viewed the conflict somewhat differently, with Mrs. Aquino believing it could most effectively be countered through economic and political changes and the United States believing a military approach was also required. **********''We think Mrs. Aquino was right in her assessment that many people went over to the Communists in total despair and that the best way to head that off is through economic reforms,'' the official said. ''But we also believe that there is a hard core in which military force is the only way it can be combated.' **********''There will be no demands on our part,'' the official continued, ''but there will be expressions of concerns.'' **********The official and other Reagan aides said Mrs. Aquino's approach had had some positive results, particularly with Moslem separatists, who signed a regional cease-fire agreeement on Aug. 14. **********Mr. Reagan has voiced support for Mrs. Aquino's Government through diplomatic messages and a personal telphone call, but has not met her. 'Genuine Support' for Aquino **********''The key thing is that it is a get-aquainted session and an opportunity for her to understand the very genuine support she has within the Administration,'' another senior Reagan Administration aide said. **********Recently, Senator Richard G. Lugar, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, tried to pave the way for a successful meeting by presenting Mrs. Aquino with a letter from Mr. Reagan assuring her that the Administration stood firmly behind her Government, the officials said. **********But even so, some Administration officials said, Mr. Reagan's relationship with Mr. Marcos, to whom he has offered a haven in the United States and with whom he spoke on the telephone in May, could strain the discussions. **********The Administration has tried unsuccessfully to find a permanent home outside the United States for Mr. Marcos, who is living in Hawaii, and has warned him against interfering in Philippines domestic politics. **********''We have made clear that Marcos is not part of the present or future and we have said it every way we can,'' another senior Administration official said. ''If Marcos himself hasn't understood it, everyone else has.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/01/world/around-the-world-laotian-president-quits-health-reasons-cited.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 88, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Laotian President Quits; Health Reasons Cited", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Laotian President Quits; Health Reasons Cited", "body_text": " **********Prince Souphanouvong has stepped down as President of Laos for health reasons, the Laotian state radio said today. **********The radio, monitored in Bangkok, gave no details about the health of the Prince, 77 years old, the Communist Government's last link with the 700-year-old monarchy it abolished in 1975. **********Prince Souphanouvong led the Communist Pathet Lao to power in 1975 after more than two decades of fighting against governments led by his half-brother, Prince Souvanna Phouma."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/01/business/money-fund-assets-up.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Up", "body_text": " **********Assets of the nation's 363 money market mutual funds rose $543.8 million, to $231.54 billion, for the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday. **********Assets of the 90 broker-dealer funds decreased $296.2 million, to $103.29 billion.

In addition, the Treasury plans to sell $9.5 billion of one-year bills at its regular monthly auction of this maturity on Thursday. **********The most pronounced losses yesterday were in the longer-term maturities. Despite a modest late rally, the bellwether long-term bond, the 7.25 percent issue due in May 2016, was down 1 24/32, to 96 7/32, for a yield of 7.57 percent. Last Friday, the bond closed at 97 31/32 and yielded 7.42 percent. **********Little Selling Pressure **********But there was little selling pressure yesterday, dealers said. Rather, the price markdowns and trading level owed more to the upcoming refunding and concern over the economy. **********''There is no doubt that next week's record refunding is a major factor that is depressing the market, but it is not the only one,'' said David M. Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, government securities dealers. ''Another is that the Office of Management and Budget is expected to confirm next week that the Federal deficit for fiscal 1986 may be a record $220 billion, which would top the previous record of $212 billion of fiscal 1985.'' **********Mr. Jones said that unexpectedly heavy military spending by the Government, as well as increased aid for farmers, could swell the budget deficit even further. **********''The credit market also fears that, if the Government's forecasts for improved economic growth in the second half and in 1987 are realized, it could stimulate demand for credit even more,'' Mr. Jones said. Bill Rates Advance **********Meanwhile, the average discount rates climbed at the Treasury's weekly bill auctions yesterday. The average rate on the 90-day issue rose to 5.86 percent, from 5.72 percent a week earlier, while the companion six-month bill rate increased to 5.89 percent, from 5.77 percent. The discount rate on the current one-year bills fell 4 basis points, to 6.02 percent. **********Although the Federal Reserve indirectly injected liquidity into the banking system by effecting $2 billion of repurchase agreements on behalf of a customer, dealers said it had little if any impact on short-term rates. **********In late trading in the secondary market for Treasury coupon issues, the 6.625 percent notes due in 1988 fell 5/32, to 99 27/32, for a yield of 6.71 percent, and the 7.5 percent notes due in 1991 plunged 16/32, to 101 9/32, and a yield of 7.18 percent. **********The 7.375 percent notes due in 1996, which became popular with Japanese investors recently, dropped 27/32, to 99 9/32, for a yield of 7.48 percent, and the 9.375 percent notes due in 2006 tumbled 2 1/32 points, to yield 8.17 percent. A point is equivalent to $10 per each $1,000 of face value. **********But the most watched long-term issue, the 7.25 percent bond due in May 2116, plunged to an offered price of 96 7/32, down 1 24/32, for a yield of 7.57 percent. The bond had been down 2 2/32 before the modest late rally. **********As a result, the closely watched yield curve between the 10-year notes due in 1996 and the long-term bond became slightly more positive at 9 basis points, compared with 7 basis points late last Friday. At that time, the yield on the 10-year notes was 7.35 percent, while that on the long-term bond was 7.42 percent. A widening spread, or a more positive yield curve, is considered bullish for longer-term issues by many analysts. **********Addressing another concern of investors in fixed-income securities, Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said: **********''Many are worried about reports that Japanese financial institutions, which have been important buyers of Treasury debt, will be discouraged from future investments because they fear the dollar's steep decline against their currency will erode the value of these investments. We think this is a needless concern because Japanese institutions, such as insurance companies, are more interested in interest income than gains from trading or other forms of appreciation from their investment portfolios.'' **********Indeed, Mr. Kellner noted that Japanese insurers cannot pay dividends out of capital gains, only from interest income. ''So as long as domestic interest rates remain above those available in Japan, which is certainly the case today, we can expect their continued investment in Treasury debt,'' he said. **********Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills: (000 omitted in dollar figures) #3-Mo.

Volcker, and concluded that the Fed is not likely to push for lower short-term interest rates in the near future. **********Besides stating that there was no significant change in monetary policy at last week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Mr. Volcker told the House Banking Committee that a cut in the discount rate was not warranted because the economy is in good condition, inflation has not been eliminated, and money supply growth was rapid until recently. **********''Mr. Volcker's comments indicate that there is no reason to expect Fed policy to change in the direction of ease,'' said Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Thomson McKinnon Securities. He estimated that short-term rates ''are anchored at about their current levels, while the long bond market can still benefit from lower inflation and falling oil prices.'' **********''After a 3 1/2 point rally the past week, the bond market was due for a stumble, and Volcker's comments indicating no immediate easing in monetary policy was just the excuse that was needed,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified.

Among shorter maturities, the Treasury's new 8 percent notes due in two years were auctioned at an average yield of 8.02 percent, and were offered late in the day with a yield of 8.03 percent. Five-Year Note Yields **********In advance of next Wednesday's auction of new five-year Treasury notes, government securities dealers offered the notes on a when-issued basis, with a yield of 8.32 percent, up from 8.25 percent. **********In the tax-exempt market, local government officials and securities dealers are stepping up their efforts to fight the provisions of the tax overhaul bill approved by the House of Representatives in December. That bill, which set an effective date of Jan. 1, 1986, imposes stricter limits on the amount and kind of tax-exempt bonds local governments may sell, and says that the interest on some kinds of bonds may be subject to the 25 percent alternative minimum income tax. **********In Utah, a bill was recently introduced in the state Senate calling for the state income tax to be levied on interest from Treasury securities and directing county assessors to tax Federal property, including national parks, military installations, and post offices. **********''Taxation of the Federal property and interest is outrageously unconstitutional, but it is the appropriate response to the equally unconstitutional provisions of the tax bill,'' said Edward T. Alter, treasurer of Utah. ''But we want to call attention to the fact that the House bill strikes at the core of local governments' ability to provide services.'' **********Mr. Alter, and many other analysts, claim that the House tax bill violates the ''doctrine of reciprocal immunity'' where local govenments do not tax Treasury securities and the Federal Government does not tax local government securities. The exemption of local government bond interest from Federal income tax is not spelled out in the constitution, but has evolved provisions in the constitution separating the powers of the state and Federal governments, and from many court decisions. **********Mr. Alter and other officials from Salt Lake City plan to hold a press conference today to discuss the hardship imposed by the House tax bill. The state treasurer noted that the House bill imposes a $250 million limit on the total amount of bonds governments in Utah can sell for various purposes including housing, education, hospitals, waste disposal, and some kinds of water and sewer bonds. That limit is about a third of the amount of such financing the state is accustomed to, he said. **********In Chicago, meanwhile, John Nuveen & Company, Van Kampen Merritt Inc., and Clayton Brown and Associates - three firms that are normally fierce competitors - have joinced forces to create the Municipal Finance Industry Association to lobby against the tax bill. **********Richard J.

Bronfman, the president of the congress, Mr. Waldheim reiterated his argument that documents that led to the charges had been ''deliberately misinterpreted.'' **********He said such action was aimed at damaging his current campaign for the presidency of Austria, and added: **********''The timing two months before election day and the fact that during 30 years of service for my own country and 10 years as Secretary General of the United Nations such accusations had never materialized or been substntated are self-explanatory.'' **********A copy of Mr. Waldheim's letter was also telexed to The New York Times. Documents Were Cited **********A report in The Times on Tuesday said German military documents and Austrian Government archives showed that Mr. Waldheim had served in the military as an interpreter under Gen. Alexander Lohr, head of a German command that fought Yugoslav partisans and deported Greek Jews from Salonika in 1942-43.

Besides gains of as much as 7/8 point in long-term Treasury bonds, securities dealers noted that demand was good yesterday for corporate and tax-exempt issues. **********Short maturities have value, market participants said, because another cut in the Federal Reserve discount rate before the elections in November would help reduce rates on Treasury bills, which in turn would help pull down yields on Treasury notes due in two years or so. **********Rates Lowest Since '77 **********At yesterday's auction of new Treasury bills, which was reduced to $11 billion from the $13 billion announced earlier, the average three-month rate fell to 5.60 percent from 5.70 percent a week earlier, while the six-month rate of 5.60 percent was down from 5.73 percent. Both rates were the lowest since the summer of 1977. **********Among longer-term Treasury issues, demand from domestic and overseas investors was enough to raise the 7 1/4 percent bonds due in 2016 by 7/8 point, to 98 7/8, where the yield is 7.34 percent. Analysts noted that the bellwether Treasury bond yield was still higher than the 7.11 percent low of July 15, even though short-term rates have declined since then. As recently as last Thursday the 7 1/4 percent issue was auctioned at an average price of nearly 95 17/32, to yield 7.63 percent. **********In the tax-exempt market, nervousness about the tax bill being prepared in Washington did not prevent prices of outstanding issues from rising in moderately active trading. Conferees in Washington yesterday agreed on a plan that may make interest on some kinds of local government bonds issued on or after Aug. 8, 1986, subject to the alternative minimum income tax for individuals. Making some kinds of local government bonds subject to Federal income tax is not popular with securities dealers or sponsors of tax-exempt mutual bond funds, and they have lobbied against the idea since it arose in the House of Representatives last year. **********Bonds that would be exempt from the alternative minimum tax treatment include general obligation bonds, as well as bonds for hospitals and higher education. The status of other kinds of bonds, such as those for resource recovery or industrial development ''is not clear at this time,'' said Heather Ruth, executive director of the Public Securities Association, a trade group representing securities dealers. **********Underwriters of tax-exempt bonds are also greatly concerned about a new proposal in Washington to put a 2 percent limit on the cost of issuing non-governmental tax-exempt bonds. Mrs. Ruth noted that it was unclear exactly which kinds of bonds would be affected, and exactly how the cost of issuance would be defined. Issuing expenses - underwriters' fee, bond counsel fee and expenses such as printing - vary from issue to issue, but average about 2 percent, excluding fees for feasibility studies, underwriters said. **********Good investor demand for long-term Treasury issues has spread to the corporate market, where a handful of unscheduled notes and bonds have been offered or been added to this week's calendar. Prices of Treasury bonds, which did not rise so sharply as Treasury issues earlier this year, when interest rates were falling, have performed slightly better than the Treasury market in the last few weeks. **********Among yesterday's larger financings, Pacific Bell offered $350 million of 8 3/4 percent debentures due in 2025 at a price of 95 5/8, to yield 9.16 percent, through underwriters led by the First Boston Corporation. **********Elsewhere in the corporate market, the Ford Motor Credit Company offered $200 million of 8 percent notes due in 1993 at a price of 100 through Goldman, Sachs. The notes, rated A-1 by Moody's and A by S.&P., yield nine-tenths of a percentage point more than seven-year Treasury notes. **********A $200 million issue of the Hospital Corporation of America's seven-year notes was offered at 99 with a 7 7/8 percent coupon, to yield 8.065 percent, through Morgan Stanley & Company.

His remarks came less than three weeks after Congressional conferees reached agreement on a sweeping tax bill that would sharply lower income tax rates. **********Mr. Rostenkowski has previously asserted that some form of tax increase in the future is inevitable. But today he specifically proposed raising rates as the fairest way to generate new revenues. In doing so, the Illinois Democrat firmly rejected the idea of imposing a new consumption tax, saying it would hit lower-income individuals who tend to spend a large portion of their income on necessities. **********''Everyone knows we'll need a tax increase to reduce the deficit,'' Mr. Rostenkowski told a symposium exploring the tax outlook after the new tax revision law is adopted. ''But the increase in revenue should be through higher progressive rates on income - not by a low, regressive tax on need.'' **********No move to raise income tax rates is likely, Mr. Rostenkowski implied, until President Reagan changes his opposition to tax increases. Asked when a future tax increase might occur, Mr. Rostenkowski replied, ''When I see the President marching to the same drummer that I want to march to.'' **********Even before Congress has voted on the final tax revision bill, which it is expected to do in two or three weeks, many people in Washington are already looking ahead to the next tax battle. Some 200 lobbyists, economists and Government and corporate tax specialists have assembled for a three-day conference sponsored by the American Council for Capital Formation. This business group is headed by Charls E. Walker, one of Washington's top tax lobbyists who was a Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Nixon Administration. **********The conference seeks to focus attention on the idea of consumption taxes in hopes of influencing the next Congressional tax debate, which many lobbyists and politicians believe will be prompted in the next couple of years by a need to find new ways to try to reduce the budget deficit. Looking for Alternatives **********Few members of Congress have been attracted by consumption taxes, but sponsors of the conference believe that many will become more interested in the idea when they come to grips with the available options. **********''There are other alternatives, but the consumption tax is the least worst option,'' said Mark A. Bloomfield, president of the council. Many leading economists were brought to the stage to support this view. **********Senator David Durenberger, a Minnesota Republican and a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said Congress ''can't squeeze any more from the budget'' and has gone as far it is prepared to go in curtailing tax preferences now. He also rejected imposing an income tax surcharge. ''The only viable option to solve the budget problem,'' he said, ''is to phase in a national consumption tax.'' **********Many people in the business community strongly support a consumption tax as a way to avoid being hit themselves with higher taxes on their future profits. Some, including Mr. Walker, also hope that a consumption tax could provide enough new revenues to restore some of the investment incentives that would be eliminated by the tax revision legislation. An Uphill Battle Is Seen **********Many economists embrace consumption taxes as a way to avoid higher income taxes, which could further discourage investment and saving. But proponents face an uphill battle generating support among lawmakers for some form of consumption tax, such as a national sales tax or a European-style value added tax. **********''At this point, Congress is no more likely to pass a value added tax than the Montana Legislature is to pass a law outlawing fly fishing,'' said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat on the Finance Committee. **********Democrats generally oppose value added taxes - which are levied on businesses at each stage of production and thereby are built into the price of goods - on the ground that they hurt lower- and middle-income individuals the most. **********Mr. Rostenkowski said a consumption tax that was designed to appease such concerns would end up as a ''crazy quilt.'' He said, ''Exemptions for food, shelter, medical treatment and education are just openers.'' **********Many Republicans, while opposed to increases in income tax rates, also oppose consumption taxes on the ground that they can be powerful revenue sources and thus make it difficult to restrain Federal spending."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/world/4-die-in-air-force-crash.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 96, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "4 Die in Air Force Crash", "print_headline": "4 Die in Air Force Crash", "body_text": " **********A United States Air Force jet tanker trying to land at Howard Air Base near Panama City crashed into a hill early today, killing all four crew members, officials reported. **********The tanker was based at Grissom Air Force Base in Indiana.

Tower, Edmund S. Muskie and Brent Scowcroft, members of a Presidential panel reviewing the National Security Council, as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of Cable News Network: ... **********Q. How do you see your investigation working alongside, if you will, what's happening on the Hill, what may happen with the special counsel? Could there be a confusion of testimony? **********TOWER: Well, I think what we need to do at the outset is to avoid that confusion. And we've already talked to the Attorney General about sitting down with him as a group and making determinations on how we cooperate. He's already said to us that information that he has gotten that would be of value to use would be made available to us. Senator Muskie has rightfully suggested also that we talk with the Congressional leadership and work out an M.O. with them, which we fully intend to do. **********Q. Senator, was there any discussion at a meeting that just took place - was there any discussion at all about the facts of the Iranian case? **********TOWER: No, there was no discussion of the facts of it. **********Q. Do any of you - all of you certainly must have a preconception, a predisposition that something went wrong. Is that what you're operating on? **********TOWER: I'm not operating on any assumptions or preconceptions. I think that we have to be very coldly objective, and I think that we will be. This is, after all, an inquiry to determine facts. ... Precedent at N.S.C.  Q. General, did anything happen in your Administration that would be tantamount in any way of covert action without the N.S.C. or the President knowing? **********SCOWCROFT. Yep. I hope not. I think to ask these kinds of questions before we've really gotten started is premature. I think we're going into the whole thing - I think one has to separate the substance of what happened with the procedures of how it was made. And that's what we're examining - whether you think the Iranian thing was a good idea. or bad idea. How was it done and, if there were errors and mistakes made, how can we correct them. ... **********Q. Senator Tower, there's been some question raised about your relationship with Mr. McFarlane since he worked for you. Do you think that poses any problem in the conduct of your review board? **********TOWER: I intend to pursue this inquiry with cold objectivity. My loyalty to my country exceeds my loyalty to any individual or any partisan endeavor. ... Problems With Council **********Q. Senator Muskie, you served as Secretary of State in the Carter Administration. In your dealings with the N.S.C., did you have problems such as appeared to have occurred here and that you were cut out of operations run by the N.S.C.? **********MUSKIE: Remember, my term as Secretary of State was very brief. And I don't recall in th at period anything of this kind. **********Q. Senator Tower, to whom do you report other than the President? **********TOWER: We report to the President. Q. Do you report to anyone else? TOWER: Well, I'm sure that others on the Presidential staff will be privy to our reporting. But we are directly responsible to the President, and we report to the President. What Public Will Hear **********Q. Could tell us - Senator, would you tell us how much of your activities are going to be public? What are we going to see of you from now on? **********TOWER: I think it's very difficult to say to what extent we will have public meetings and what extent they'll be closed. Obviously, we'll be dealing with a great deal of sensitive and classified material and of necessity must meet behind closed doors. We will - we will open the commission meetings to the extent possible. **********Q. Senator Tower, pending the outcome of your inquiry, did the President give you any assurances that there won't be any more covert operations run by the N.S.C.? **********TOWER: Yes, He announced that in his opening statement that he made when the press was -... Council's Role **********Q. Senator Tower, given that he has told the N.S.C. staff not to take part in operational activities and given that your inquiry is ongoing, does the N.S.C. have anything to do in the intervening months? Are they basically out of business for the time being? **********TOWER: Well, the primary function of the N.S.C. is to - is to reinforce the national security adviser and the National Security Council and - and providing information to the President on which conclusions can be drawn and judgments could be made. I think Brent could probably give a better answer to that than I can. **********SCOWCOFT: The primary function of the N.S.C. and the staff is to provide advice, to plan and to coordinate on the kinds of things you're all interested in - the operations side. Whether or not it should go forward is - is quite separate from the bulk of the activity of the N.S.C. staff. ... **********Q. Senator Tower, will you be trying to find out what the - will you be trying to find out what the President knew about the arms - money to the contras? **********TOWER: We will follow our mandate. And I think that - Q. Will you question the President? **********TOWER: Well, the President will be available to respond to questions from us. He has pledged his cooperation. What the President Knew **********Q. Is that a key question though, Senator, what the President knew about the money to the contras? Will you be trying to find out about that? **********TOWER: Our function is to look in to the past practices and operations of the National Security Council staff. **********Q. In other words, the answer's 'no' to the question asked? **********MUSKIE: No. Let me - I mean, we are not here this morning to begin to list the questions we will put to anybody. We are free to put questions to anybody we choose to within the Government. We will do that. We were not about to list those questions here or list to you the questions we're going to put to particular people. And I assure you we have been promised total access to anybody connected with any of the operations of the N.S.C. now or before today or the past many years that we need in order to make judgment about N.S.C. procedures and activities and operations. That's our mandate and we intend to fully implement that mandate. ... The Key Fact **********Q. Mr. Secretary, when you - but is that subject is the whole question of what the President knew about this operation, is that relevant to your inquiry? Is that the key fact that you're trying to determine or not? **********MUSKIE: I would think this is relevant as all the other facts that we will seek to get. You people - you people of the press really have laid out for us over the past several days now many potential areas for questions. And it is our objective, it is our objective to try to reassure the public when we are through, that we have fully probed this problem. **********Q. General Scowcroft, you said last week that you didn't believe it was credible that a lieutenant colonel could have run this operation on his own. Do you still feel that? **********SCOWCROFT: I said I thought that Colonel North had to have some kind of a charter under which he operated. Yes, I still believe that.  Q. Wouldn't that necessarily follow then that you're going to have to trace where that charter came from no matter high up it went? **********SCOWCROFT: I think you can be sure we will. All the Facts **********Q. Gentlemen, it is not conceivable, is it, that you could finish your mandate without knowing fully all the facts about the Iran-contra funding operation? **********TOWER: I would assume that we will be apprised of all the facts before we complete our inquiry. **********Q. Do you have to know everything about it? **********TOWER: I believe that we do. I think we have to have all relevant facts. And we will earnestly seek to develop those facts. ... **********Q. Senator, are you concerned that this inquiry is so broad and goes into so many different things that it's going to take more time and more staff than any of you gentlemen plan, and is this likely a very long-term involved review? **********MUSKIE: Your question assumes that we have specific plans now. We will have specific plans when we meet later today. But to suggest that we're going to do something more than we now plan begins at point zero. It's like measuring out the 10 yards for a first down. You know you begin very loosely and then very precisely. **********Q. Well, it was suggested to us that it might be 30 to 60 days or 30 to 40 days. Do you have any idea of how long this would take you, any of you gentlemen? **********TOWER: I don't I don't think we can speculate on that right now. After all, we are just getting started. ... **********Q. Senator Tower, is there a difference of opinion between you and Senator Muskie as to whether talking to the President would be relevant? **********TOWER: Well, I think - I think talking to the President is relevant, and the President has pledged his cooperation. **********SCOWCROFT: You know, it seems to me the thing you have to remember is the difference between a culpability investigation and a factual investigation. What we're trying to find out is what the procedures are, what happened so that we can make recommendations as to any changes that ought to be made in the system. **********Q. Senator Tower, would you agree one of the key things is to find out how high up this went? **********TOWER: You may determine then whether people have acted extraordinary to what their mission was or what their charge was or what their legal possibilities were. **********SCOWCROFT: It's quite possible, but it's important to remember that is not our charge. That's not what we're going after. Issue of Culpability **********Q. If you stumble on - if you stumble on culpability, you do nothing about it? **********SCOWCROFT: I didn't say that at all. What we have to separate what we're trying to do with what the Attorney General. **********Q. When is it relevant to look into Achille Lauro and Grenada and all other possible previous N.S.C. operations that was in the charter that the President - TOWER: On the contrary, instructional. In other words we'd look at them as - as cases: how the N.S.C. staff functioned in that particular circumstance. ... Attitude of President **********Q. Sir, can you share with us your impression of the President's attitude toward this situation that confronts him now? He just chatted with you about it for a while. Was he angry, concerned, what - how would you categorize him? **********MUSKIE: Well, he was not angry. He was concerned in that he - and he asked me to read what was in his mind. I can describe his outward demeanor, which was genial and relaxed, as far as I could see. But he also communicated very clearly to me in a statement on Saturday and his statement this morning that he's deeply concerned about this problem and that he is hoping that we can do our job thoroughly, but also finish as promptly as possible so that the public can get whatever answers we can provide. And also so that the Congress can undertake to implement in whatever way it seems wise, whatever recommendations we may have to propose. Yes, the President is concerned that we make him effectively aware of our recommendations as soon as possible. **********Q. You have said, sir, that the press had laid our areas of questions that your panel will go into. Yet the President has told an interviewer that the press has been - he has likened the press to a bloodthirsty shark in blowing up this story. What do you think about - MUSKIE: What I just said wasn't a statement that the press is accurate. I said that the press had laid out the questions. But whether or not the press is accurate, I hope I'll have a better judgment on it when we finish. ... Matter of What Went Wrong **********Q. Senator Tower, you said earlier that you entered this inquiry without any preconceived notions, and yet you described the function of the N.S.C. as primarily one of providing information to the President and the National Security Council. I wonder if each of you could address the question of whether you think it was explicitly wrong for the N.S.C. to do operational things. . . . **********SCOWCROFT: I think the thing to remember is that all the executive branch apparatus serves to provide the President the utmost advice, counsel, options, whatever, to assist him in making decisions. He's the decision maker, and that's what the whole process is designed to do. **********Q. When do you intend to begin the investigations, the hearings? **********TOWER: We have not set a timetable yet. As a matter of fact, as soon as we depart from your company, we are going to meet and try to set up a preliminary agenda and timetable. **********Q. Sir, do you agree with the President that Colonel North is a national hero? **********MUSKIE: Bye, Sam."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/world/duvalier-touring-capital-by-car-says-protests-were-manipulated.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DUVALIER, TOURING CAPITAL BY CAR, SAYS PROTESTS WERE 'MANIPULATED'", "print_headline": "DUVALIER, TOURING CAPITAL BY CAR, SAYS PROTESTS WERE 'MANIPULATED'", "body_text": " **********President Jean-Claude Duvalier toured this capital city today in a heavily armed motorcade and told reporters the anti-Government demonstrations that have shaken Haiti over the last week were the result of Haitians being ''literally manipulated'' by ''the wrong people.'' **********Mr. Duvalier, seeming relaxed and wearing a tan bush jacket, sped along in a high four-wheel-drive vehicle with his wife, Michele, at the wheel. **********It was the first business day after demonstrations on Friday in which security forces, firing guns and swinging riot sticks, chased protesters through the streets. The Government said it had no official count of casualties. Some doctors estimated that 20 people had been killed, but other doctors put the number possibly as high as 50. Doctors and medical workers say dozens were injured. **********When he spoke with reporters, President Duvalier did not say who he believed had ''manipulated'' the people. In the past, Haitian Government officials have said they believe the demonstrations are Communist-inspired, but United States officials say they see no Communist involvement. **********Many businesses opened this morning, but by early afternoon most doors and windows were shuttered. Merchants said that there had been few customers and that they were worried that more disturbances might break out. Security Unit on Patrol **********A state of siege remained in effect for a fourth day and soldiers and members of the special security unit generally known as the Tontons Macoutes patrolled the streets, armed with rifles, submachine guns and clubs. **********Spot checks in other towns indicated that the country was generally quiet but tense. **********Since late November, anti-Government demonstrations have erupted several times in towns across this country of six million people, with protesters calling for the Duvalier Government to step down. **********The state of siege formally suspends the constitutional guarantees in a country where those guarantees, in practice, have often been ignored by security forces. Foreign diplomats said the declaration of the state of siege was one means by which Mr. Duvalier could clearly signal a firm determination to put down the protests. **********Foreign diplomats said that in his tour of the capital, which lasted several hours, Mr. Duvalier was apparently trying to demonstrate again that widespread reports that he fled the country on Friday were false. Skepticism About Address **********Mr. Duvalier went on national radio and television on Friday to deny the reports of his departure, and witnesses said he sped briefly through the city, at one point passing within about 50 yards of a group of demonstrators confronting security forces. **********But only a few people saw the President downtown on Friday, and one diplomat said many people had been saying that the radio and television speeches had been taped and did not prove Mr. Duvalier was still in Haiti. **********Several diplomats said they believed Mr. Duvalier was also trying to underscore communiques issued by the Minister of Commerce and the Chief of Police of the capital late Sunday night pledging that the Government would guarantee the security of offices and shops. Tontons Macoutes in blue denim uniforms as well as soldiers were posted at the entrances of the majority of the few stores that remained open this afternoon. **********When the President's entourage stopped briefly near the sprawling central market and outside an army barracks, reporters who had spotted it asked in French about his plans. ''I'm staying here,'' he replied. One reporter asked, ''What are you going to do?'' The President said, ''As you can see, I am here.'' After the anti-Government demonstration on Friday, in one of his rare public speeches, Mr. Duvalier reasserted the pledge he has made repeatedly, since shortly after he took power nearly 15 years ago, that he would work for the ''democratization'' and ''liberalization'' of Haiti and the ''promotion of human rights.'' No Plans for Elections **********Asked today if he had any plans to hold elections, Mr. Duvalier replied: ''None. We have never considered an election.'' **********He was asked what he thought of the erroneous announcement on Friday by Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, that his Government had fallen. **********''It's equivocal,'' Mr. Duvalier replied. **********Then, referring to the scores of foreign reporters who have come to Haiti to cover the crisis, he added: ''You can see the wrong he has done to us by the presence of the international press here.'' **********Several businessmen said the President's motorcade had passed by so swiftly this morning that most people did not have a chance to react. ----Shultz Calls for Democracy WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 - Secretary of State George P.

They said this was not only because of the decision to put Nicholas S. Daniloff, the Moscow correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, on trial, but also because the Kremlin appeared to disregard President Reagan's personal message to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, assuring him that Mr. Daniloff was not a spy and appealing for him to release the correspondent before Soviet-American relations were dealt a severe blow. **********The White House said this afternoon that continued detention of Mr. Daniloff could have the ''most serious effect'' on relations. A consensus among officials and academic experts interviewed was that the chain of events now under way could lead to an indefinite delay in holding a second summit meeting between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev. **********From what was said on American television by the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, and other private contacts, the Soviet side has left the impression that it would only release Mr. Daniloff in return for the freedom of Gennadi F. Zakharov, a Soviet employee of the United Nations who was arrested for espionage on Aug. 22 in New York. Soviet Man's Indictment Set **********Mr. Zakharov is due to be indicted on Tuesday, and the charges levied against Mr. Daniloff were regarded here as Moscow's signal that it will treat Mr. Daniloff in the same fashion as the United States treats Mr. Zakharov. That was taken to mean that Moscow had rejected Mr. Reagan's insistence that Mr. Daniloff was innocent and that he should be set free without charges being brought against him. Washington has asserted that Mr. Zakharov, who does not have diplomatic immunity, paid for classified information, and was a professional agent of the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence and internal security agency, while Mr. Daniloff is simply a journalist. **********Mr. Gerasimov also said that the authorities would charge Mr. Daniloff with more than being in possession of classified documents that the journaist says were thrust on him by a Soviet acquaintance. American officials have said the documents were part of a ''frameup.'' The Soviet spokesman said he did not know what the additional evidence was. **********The Reagan Administration had been hoping that when Secretary of State George P. Shultz met with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in Washington on Sept. 19 and 20, they would be able to agree on a date later this year for the summit meeting to be held in this country. For the Administration, that was to be the most important foreign policy development of the year. Now there is discussion within the Administration on whether the Shultz meeting should be held, and if it is, whether anything beyond the Daniloff case should be discussed. Doubt Raised on Summit Meeting **********Today a senior White House official said that in his opinion it was inconceivable that a date could be discussed for a summit meeting while Mr. Daniloff was being tried on an espionage charge that Mr. Reagan had personally assured Mr. Gorbachev was unfounded. **********Professor Richard Pipes of Harvard University, a Soviet expert, who has served as Mr. Reagan's top National Security Council adviser on Soviet affairs, said in an interview that the Soviet leadership, in disregarding Mr. Reagan's message, had decided to ''escalate'' the crisis. **********''If they ignore Reagan's statement that this man is not a spy,'' Mr. Pipes said, ''I find it very difficult to see how the summit could go on.'' **********Within the Administration, there was a note of surprise that Mr. Reagan's personal message to Mr. Gorbachev had been given such an apparently rude reception. In addition, State Department officials noted that Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, had sharply attacked the comments made publicly on Friday by Mr. Shultz, calling on the Soviet leadership ''to find the wisdom'' to release Mr. Daniloff quickly. **********Mr. Shultz has been the prime advocate in the Administration for seeking agreements with the Soviet Union, and there was concern at the department that the Soviet handling of the Daniloff affair will strengthen further the position of Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, who has made no secret of his negative view of dealing with the Russians. Message Had Raised Hope **********There was considerable hope on Saturday within the Administration that Mr. Reagan's message to Mr. Gorbachev, which was sent on Thursday, and delivered on Friday, might have the same effect on the Soviet leader that a similar statement made in 1963 by President Kennedy had on Prime Minister Nikita S. Khrushchev. **********At that time, a Yale professor, Frederick C. Barghoorn, was seized on a Moscow street after a passer-by had thrust into his hands a folded newspaper containing classified information. Two weeks after the arrest of the scholars, Mr. Kennedy told a press conference that Mr. Barghoorn was ''innocent of any intelligence mission'' and demanded his quick release. The day before Mr. Barghoorn had been seized, a Soviet driver for Amtorg, the trade organization, had been arrested for spying in New Jersey. **********Mr. Khrushchev, who at that time was pursuing better relations with the United States, ordered Mr. Barghoorn released ''in view of the personal concern expressed by President Kennedy.'' The driver was eventually convicted in 1964 of espionage, and was allowed to return to the Soviet Union in 1971. Eisenhower-Khrushchev Analogy **********But today officials and experts were drawing another analogy, to the collapse of the planned summit meeting between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Mr. Khrushchev, which had been planned for 1960. In 1959, Mr. Khrushchev had visited the United States as Mr. Eisenhower's guest, and the American leader was invited to make a return visit the next year. **********Plans were proceeding for that meeting when on May 1, 1960, Soviet anti-aircraft units shot down a high-flying American U-2 spy plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers. Mr. Eisenhower took full resonsibiity for the flight, and refused to apologize for the incident. That led Mr. Khrushchev to cancel the visit, and also not to meet with Mr. Eisenhower when they both were in Paris at the same time for a heads of state summit. **********Harold J. Berman, professor of Law at Emory University Law School in Atlanta who is an expert on Soviet law, said of the Daniloff case, ''I think it's another one of those incidents that keep cropping up when we begin to make overtures to each other.'' He noted that the U-2 incident ''had killed the Eisenhower-Khrushchev meetings.'' **********Mr. Pipes of Harvard said that relations had taken ''a very ugly turn.'' He said that at first he thought the arrest of Mr. Daniloff was ''a minor K.G.B. operation to spring their man, but if there is indeed a trial,'' relations could worsen. **********''They obviously are escalating it rather than ending it gracefully,'' he said. Impact on Arms Control Talks **********Some experts were concerned about the impact of the Daniloff case on arms control talks. The Administration has said it would retaliate if Mr. Daniloff was not released without charges being levied, but has not said what it would do. Today, Michael H. Armacost, Under Secretary of State for political affairs, said that ''actions may be taken to underscore the seriousness'' of the American concern. **********Spurgeon M. Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association,a public interest group, said today that ''if there are any prospects for arms control, it would be ill-advised to put them aside because of such issues'' as the Daniloff case. But he acknowledged the seriousness of the affair on American public opinion. **********Seweryn Bialer, an expert on Soviet affairs at Columbia University, said that the continued detention of Mr. Daniloff shows that the Soviet Union has ''a very bad public relations management.'' **********''They did not expect, in my opinion, that the repercussions of arresting Mr. Daniloff would be what they are,'' Mr. Bialer said, ''and it blew up in their face.'' **********He said that the American proposal that if Mr. Daniloff were freed, Mr. Zakharov could be remanded to the custody of the Soviet ambassador pending a trial, should have been enough for Moscow to save face. **********Mr. Bialer said that he was ''100 percent sure'' that the decision to seize Mr. Daniloff was taken by the Politburo, the supreme policy-making organ, or at least by several members of that group, and not by the K.G.B. itself. **********Arthur A. Hartman, the United States Ambassador to Moscow, also believed that the decision to retaliate for Mr. Zakharov was taken by the Politburo, which Mr. Gorbachev heads."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/business/jartran-seeks-chapter-11-protection.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 415, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Jartran Seeks Chapter 11 Protection", "print_headline": "Jartran Seeks Chapter 11 Protection", "body_text": " **********Jartran Inc., a nationwide truck and trailer rental company hurt by intense competition and heavy losses, said today that it had filed for reorganization and protection from creditors under Federal bankruptcy laws. **********The announcement came less than three years after the truck renter, based in Miami, emerged from its first bankruptcy reorganization. $114 Million in Liabilities Jartran listed assets of $37 million and liabilities of $114 million when it filed for protection Monday in the Miami branch of United States Bankruptcy Court, the company said. **********The nation's third-largest truck renter, after U-Haul International and Ryder Systems, which is also based in Miami, Jartran was acquired in 1982 by Frank B.

As recently as Feb. 7, the 9 1/4 percent issue was offered at 99 17/32 to yield 9.30 percent. **********''There seems to be scope for further interest rate declines and greater real economic activity without causing inflationary pressure,'' said John R. Williams, a vice president at the Bankers Trust Company. **********In the latest issue of Prospects for the Credit Markets, he estimated that the Federal Reserve had already eased policy enough to reduce the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market to around 7 5/8 percent, and would eventually reduce the discount rate charged on loans to financial institutions. Reports of Easing by Japan **********Reports that Japanese institutions might be allowed to buy more foreign securities also helped raise bond prices. According to the Reuters news agency, Japan's Finance Minister, Noboru Takeshita, said rules limiting foreign investments by pension and trust funds might be eased. **********While bond yields fell, interest rates on issues due in five years or less rose slightly. In advance of today's auction of new two-year Treasury notes, dealers in government securities offered the issue with a yield of 7.93 percent, up from 7.89 percent late last week. An issue of five-year notes that the Treasury will auction next Wednesday began trading yesterday at about 8 1/4 percent. **********In the short-term market, the absence of any overt moves by the Fed to ease policy has kept Treasury bill rates within the range that has prevailed since mid-May of 1985, even after the declines at yesterday's auction. The new three-month bills averaged 6.97 percent, down from 7.18 percent, while the six-month rate fell to 7.03, percent from 7.23 percent. **********Elsewhere in the credit markets, foreign securities firms and banks continue to expand their presence in the American capital market. On Friday, for example, officials at S. G. Warburg & Company announced that Peter Bass, head of the government securities department at E. F. Hutton & Company the past four years, had joined Warburg to set up a taxable fixed income department. Primary Dealer Status Sought **********According to H. N. Millward, a director at S. G. Warburg, the firm aspires to being recognized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a primary dealer in government securities. Currently, 36 banks and securities dealers are recognized as primary dealers, and there are about 10 others who seek the same status. **********Mr. Bass, who is 42 years old, said the change of jobs ''had nothing to do with money or my treatment at Hutton'' but was due to ''my desire to participate in the globalization of the securities markets and be a part of a truly international firm in the 1990's.'' Warburg owns seats on stock exchanges in London, New York and Tokyo. **********In the tax-exempt market, the supply of new issues remains meager as many issuers wait and hope that legislators in Washington will postphone the Jan. 1, 1986, effective date for the tax-revision bill approved by the House of Representatives in December. High-Coupon Bonds Measured **********The lack of supply is an important reason why the Bond Buyer index measuring the yield of long-term bonds has fallen to 8.32 percent from 9.10 percent at the end of 1985. For many new long-term bond issues, however, yields are less than 8 percent. The difference between new issues and the Bond Buyer index is that the index is measuring high-coupon bonds that require more generous yields because some investors are reluctant to pay prices far above par. **********Aaron Gurwitz, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted that many potential issuers can comply with the new tax bill, but are waiting because ''issuing under the old law would be much better.'' He added that many governments wanted to refinance old bonds that were sold when interest rates were higher. **********Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new Treasury bills due in three and six months: (000 omitted in dollar figures) #3-Mo.

Tutu was installed today as the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern Africa. **********The services started with formal rites at the Gothic-style St. George's Cathedral in the elegant old center of Cape Town and shifted to a eucharist service attended by 8,000 people at a muddy stadium in the flatlands where many of the city's blacks live. The dominant theme was the struggle against apartheid that has brought global renown to the newly installed Archbishop of Cape Town. **********In his sermon to 1,400 clerics and invited guests at St. George's, Archbishop Tutu, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, reiterated a commitment to nonviolence. **********But he added, ''It is important when talking about violence to note that the primary violence in this country is the violence of apartheid.'' **********''Our people are peaceloving to a fault,'' he said. ''The miracle of our land is that it has not gone up in flames.'' **********The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Robert Runcie, who was the senior of 22 Anglican bishops from South Africa and around the world who joined in the celebrations, picked up the theme in his sermon at the Goodwood Stadium. **********''Here in South Africa an old order is dying,'' he said. ''As we watch, we experience all the agony, doubt and uncertainty which surround death.'' **********But Archbishop Runcie cautioned against violence, saying, ''As no system based on brutal repression can endure, so no change achieved by violence can escape its damaging infection.'' **********The celebrations, held on a chilly and drizzly day and attended by a multiracial throng that was more devout than militant, passed without incident. **********The congregation at the stadium was considerably smaller than the 25,000 some churchmen had predicted, possibly because of the weather and possibly because Archbishop Tutu is less known in the Cape area than in his former see of Johannesburg. **********The one major diversion during the three-hour service at the stadium was provided by Winnie Mandela, wife of Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress. **********Mrs. Mandela's arrival outside the stadium immediately drew a chanting, dancing crowd of blacks. After stopping briefly, she drove off, presumably to prevent upsetting the ceremonies. Prance Twice Around Track **********But the crowd she had galvanized swirled into the stadium and, swelling to several hundred, pranced twice around the track, singing and raising fists in the black power salute. The service continued without interruption. **********The Archbishop, following a practice established by his predecessors, invited no officials of the South African Government to his installation, and the senior official present was the Mayor of Cape Town, Leon Markowitz. **********The Government showed none of the ceremonies on the state-controlled television. Archbishop Tutu has drawn the ire of the ruling Afrikaner establishment with his fiery denunciations of apartheid and his support for foreign disinvestment. **********The Archbishop, however, followed the protocol of the installation service by praying ''for the State President and those in authority under him.'' **********In his sermon, laced with the humor that is his trademark, he illustrated the preaching that all men are brothers by saying of the President, ''Whether I like it or not, whether he likes it or not, as I have said before, P. W. Botha is my brother, and I must desire and pray for the best for him.'' **********''Can you imagine what would happen in this land if we accepted this theological fact about ourselves - that whether we like it or not, we are members of one family?'' American Guests Attend **********The guests at the cathedral included many of the more prominent campaigners against apartheid, black and white, from South Africa and abroad. From the United States, they included Coretta Scott King, the civil rights leader, Mayor Coleman Young of Detroit and Bishop John T. Walker, the Episcopal Bishop of Washington. **********The original guest list had included a plethora of celebrities such as the singer Stevie Wonder and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the civil rights leader. Mr. Jackson, however, declined to attend when the South African authorities gave him a visa that restricted him to a brief stay in Cape Town and denied him the right to make statements. Others were unable to come for other reasons. Anglican and African Blended **********At the service at St. George's, fanfares sounded, bishops in embroidered miters and glittering copes marched in procession and the singing alternated between classics like Bach's ''Jesu, joy of man's desiring'' sung by the cathedral boys' choir, and a boistrous rendition of traditional African hymns by the Imilonji ka Ntu choir from the black township of Soweto that set Archbishop Tutu and much of the congregation swinging and clapping. **********At the subsequent eurachist service at the Goodwood Stadium, prayers were conducted in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa, the language of most blacks in the Cape area. **********Archbishop Tutu was born in a black township near Johannesburg almost 55 years ago, and he taught briefly in segregated schools before entering a seminary and being ordained a priest. Regarded as a conservative in theology, he served in England and South Africa, rising to Dean of Johannesburg and then Bishop of Lesotho. **********In 1978, on his appointment as general secretary of the South African Council of Churches, the 5-foot 3-inch cleric first gained notice as a spokesman against apartheid.In 1984 he became the second South African black - after Albert Luthulu, founder of the African National Congress - to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1985 he was elected Bishop of Johannesburg. His Position Precarious **********In the violence that has seized South Africa in the last two years, however, Archbishop Tutu's calls for nonviolent change have made his position between the black and white extremes increasingly precarious. **********Young black militants have become frustrated with his opposition to violence, and the white Afrikaners have denounced his calls for international disinvestment and his demands for radical change. **********Archbishop Tutu, too, has become frustrated. **********''Any death is one death too many,'' he said in his sermon, ''and yet it does seem some are more equal than others in life and in death.'' **********''Can you imagine the outcry there would have been had it been a white 4-year-old killed by a police rubber bullet as happened recently, or had it been a white 11-year-old kept in solitary confinement for five months? **********''Why do you do it to us?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/27/business/dollar-at-low-against-yen.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dollar at Low Against Yen", "print_headline": "Dollar at Low Against Yen", "body_text": " **********The dollar opened today at a seven-year low of 195.10 yen, extending its sharp loss on Friday in hectic and nervous trading, dealers said. **********It finished at 196.475 yen in New York and 199.50 here on Friday. **********Market participants said they were encouraged to sell the dollar against the yen after Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita said Friday that Japan should not stop the yen's current upward trend against the dollar, if it reflects market forces. **********Shortly before the opening, the dollar fell briefly below 195.00 yen, but recovered slightly."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/business/business-forum-who-lost-east-hampton-1987-a-year-we-wont-soon.html": {"writer_name": "Roger Altman", "pub_date": "1986-12-28", "snippet": "IF you are a corporate executive who resists planning ahead, consider yourself an enemy of America in the competitive world market.

Yes, it is holiday time and there are more enjoyable diversions. But big changes are in store and the prudent executive must prepare. Here, accordingly, is a not-so-cautious guide for 1987.Debt on Arrival **********Next year, the issue of debt will loom large on Wall Street, Main Street and all along Pennsylvania Avenue. More farmers will go bankrupt, Texas banks will continue to totter, consumer and corporate liabilities will grow and the foreign debt will approach $1 trillion. **********The big event will come sometime in early spring when Mexico, Brazil and Argentina throw in the towel and take the long-feared step of setting up a militant debtor's cartel, reminiscent of OPEC in the 1970's. The Administration and Congress will at first threaten counteraction. But the mood in Washington will shift rapidly. Within weeks, we will join the cartel and, like our neighbors to the south, make debt the centerpiece of our overall economic policy. **********America's first move will be to hire Hernando Paz, the noted Latin American debt specialist, who has advised on 56 separate restructurings. He will immediately call in the International Monetary Fund - the traditional belt-tightener for profligate countries. Braving the howls of America's retailers and teenagers, the I.M.F. will issue its first edict: it will ration junk food.Junk-a-Matic **********During the Reagan years, there has been a sharp shift from the trend toward large industrial combinations designed to expand the range of production to strategies driven purely by financial greed. Mergers and leveraged buyouts have proliferated, and they have frequently been financed by junk bonds. **********To defend themselves against takeovers, companies increasingly will forsake such devices as the ''poison pill'' or ''greenmail'' for the ''cement parachute'' that will intimidate even the most cold-blooded raiders. This provision, which three-quarters of corporate America will adopt overnight, would require any buyer to maintain existing management of the acquired company for a minimum of five years. A Delaware Chancery Court will uphold the cement chute, and it will stick. **********From Cambridge, Washington and Akron will emerge a strange alliance of Ivy-League economists, smokestack Democrats and corporate executives who will crusade for greater control of the junk-bond market. Thus will be born the New Jersey Junk Exchange - through which all trades must be routed. With headquarters in Atlantic City, the N.J.J.E. will begin operations in mid-1987 after developing careful criteria on self-governance. No company whose equity exceeds $5,000, whose leverage is less than 10:1 or that reveals the identity of its owners will be permitted to trade. **********International links with exchanges dealing in similar quality paper - including exchanges in Las Vegas, Monte Carlo and the Cayman Islands - will be forged. The N.J.J.E. board will include a majority of outsiders with S.E.C. and casino ''experience.'' Initially, Billy Sol Estes, Dennis B. Levine, Bernard Cornfeld and Amarillo Slim will occupy key directorships.Pina Colada Rebellion **********Some predict that the new tax law will dampen enthusiasm for the megadeals that abounded in 1986. We disagree. **********Early on, the business world will be stunned by the leveraged buyout of CBS by Crazy Eddie's, the New York City video empire with headquarters in Greenwich Village. Drexel Burnham's junk-bond wizard, Michael Milken, at first tarnished by the Ivan Boesky scandal, will regain his touch by financing the takeover with $3 billion of Crazy Eddie's junk bonds placed with tottering thrift institutions around the country. **********Next, following the failure of T.W.A. and a rapid fall in the price of USX's shares, Carl Icahn will declare bankruptcy. T. Boone Pickens, who will have converted from corporate raiding to caring for the homeless, will take pity on Carl, pay off his debts and engage him as his personal gardener. **********The Iranian scandal will not fade away. Gourmet magazine will reveal that the Export-Import Bank had quietly been financing the purchase of Iranian caviar by Afghan rebels. To divert attention from this latest embarrassment, the President will order an invasion of the West Indies playground of St. Bart's. The natives and vacationers will mount fierce resistance, hurling pina coladas at incoming Marines. After three weeks of inconclusive fighting, the Administration will withdraw the Marines and order a rum embargo.Strict Destructionist **********A pall will descend over the next Congress as it tries again to do something about the budget deficit. Nothing will seem to work. **********Recalling that it was Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d who so smoothly revealed the Iran imbroglio, the President will trot him out on the budget battlefield. Well known for his very strict interpretation of the Constitution, Mr. Meese will declare the Congressional Budget Office unconstitutional, on grounds that the original framers never intended such a thing. The Administration will simultaneously close down the Office of Management and Budget as a major cost-saving measure. With nobody keeping track of the deficit, the furor will subside.Yawning Trade Gap **********A new round of international trade negotiations will resume in the spring, timed to coincide with a major international conference on sleep disorders. **********By midyear, a small group of legislators will produce a startling analysis. It will show that the trade deficit can be reversed only if industrial production can be increased by 5 percent a year over the next five years in markets where the United States already has an edge. After much investigation, a blue-ribbon commission will manage to identify only two areas where we have an edge - fried chicken, with the Colonel's specially patented recipe, and paper shredders, which, since the early 70's have enjoyed large-scale production economies. **********Aside from such bright spots, trade policy will have rough going. Congress will adopt Representative Jack Kemp's 1986 proposal that the World Bank cease lending to all countries that engage in unfair trading practices. By June, the bank will be out of business. **********A new scandal will erupt as the International Trade Commission mounts an unprecedented sting operation in Central America. It will discover that our own Uncle Ben's comes not from the Carolinas, but is grown in Yokohama and transshipped through El Salvador. **********The most spectacular trade problem will involve the ''gray market.'' Quietly, Japan will have made good on its plans, developed within the last 18 months, to establish special communities for their retirees in overseas locations where yen-denominated pensions can buy more. This issue will excite little interest until it emerges, around Memorial Day, that Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has quietly bought up most of East Hampton, Wall Street's weekend retreat. In protest, Goldman, Sachs will threaten to sever its joint-venture links with Sumitomo Trust. Remembering the recriminations in the 1950's over the way China fell into Communist hands, Congress will demand to know, ''Who lost East Hampton?''Executive Suite **********Between the continued public elevation of Lee Iacocca, the exit from General Motors of H. Ross Perrot and Larry Tisch's takeover of CBS, it will be difficult to match the twists and turns that took place in executive suites in 1986. Still, 1987 will not be dull. **********Paul Volcker, the highly respected chairman of the Federal Reserve, will leave on schedule in August. Panic will ensue as interest rates soar and the dollar plummets. To fill the vacancy and calm everybody's nerves, President Reagan will seek out a familiar and reassuring voice. His long-time confidant, Frank Sinatra, will assume the post. **********The Administration's other major vacancy will occur in the Attorney General's office. Mr. Meese will leave early to join the newly formed public interest law firm of Deaver & Boesky. But the Justice Department will not go soft: Clint Eastwood will assume the nation's top legal spot. **********This will also be a landmark year in executive compensation. Trying to deflect a rising public outcry over juicy pay, business will take a bold lead to reform its own compensation patterns. Industry and financial leaders will install an innovative system of tying pay directly to productivity. The average compensation of top C.E.O.'s will drop 50 percent in the first year.The Lit'ry Life **********Stimulated by such chart-busters as ''In Search of Excellence'' and ''Iacocca,'' the market for business books will continue to grow dramatically. Ivan Boesky's latest, ''What They Don't Teach You at Wayne State University,'' will be the pace-setter in 1987's first quarter. But it will be followed in quick succession by ''The One-Minute Crisis Manager,'' by Donald Regan, ''International Trade and Finance for Beginners,'' by Lieut. Col. Oliver North, and ''An Insider's Guide to Detroit,'' by Ross Perot. Lastly, an obscure pamphlet, printed in the mid-1970's, will become the rage on Wall Street -''Life After the S.E.C.: A Retiree's Guide to Havana and Environs,'' by Robert Vesco."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/16/business/key-rates-681586.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/world/ferry-disaster-in-bangladesh.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FERRY DISASTER IN BANGLADESH", "print_headline": "FERRY DISASTER IN BANGLADESH", "body_text": " **********A double-decker ferry sank in a storm in the Dhaleswari River on Sunday night, leaving nearly 500 passengers feared drowned, the authorities reported today. **********Many of the 1,000 passengers aboard the ferry, the Atlas Star, swam ashore.

Newton & Associates and has met with journalists, historians and officials from the Administration, the United Nations and Jewish groups. He testified today in Washington before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. **********''We're not professionals at this game,'' he said in an interview. ''Unlike the World Jewish Congress, we don't have the resources to conduct a manhunt.'' Response to Disclosures **********His mission stems from disclosures last month that his father was once involved in two Nazi-affiliated groups and later served as a German Army lieutenant in the Balkans at a time of brutal campaigns against Yugoslav partisans and the large-scale deportation of Greek Jews to death camps. **********Gerhard Waldheim, in rebutting the charges, is relying heavily on the memories of his father and those who knew him to reconstruct his father's wartime whereabouts and duties. **********He is pitted against the World Jewish Congress, which has issued more than a dozen strongly worded press releases, along with photocopies of hundreds of German war documents, that call Mr. Waldheim a Nazi and a liar. **********Officials of the congress have denied charges by Kurt Waldheim and others that they have manipulated press coverage by releasing only a few documents at a time, have drawn unwarranted conclusions and have presented old information in new forms. **********''We're not a Nazi-hunting organization per se, but this is a matter of historical record,'' said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress. ''It's not as if Waldheim were simply an auto mechanic hiding out in Cleveland.'' Memorandum Is Revised **********Since his arrival in the United States, Gerhard Waldheim has twice revised a detailed memorandum intended to establish his father's innocence, and he has apologized to the Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal for apparently having misquoted him in a statement at the National Press Club. **********The third version of the memorandum omitted a quotation attributed to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that called the allegations against his predecessor ''absurd.'' Gerhard Waldheim said the quotation was taken, without verification, from a paraphrase in two Austrian dailies. **********Mr. Perez de Cuellar's spokesman, Francois Giuliani, denied that such a comment had been made. **********Since the original charges were made, Mr. Perez de Cuellar has remained above the fray. His only public statement came on March 5, when he said Kurt Waldheim ''served the United Nations as Secretary General with great dedication for 10 years.'' **********Gerhard Waldheim has denied that his father purposely concealed much of his military record in accounts to colleagues and in two memoirs. Those accounts said only that he served in the German cavalry on the Eastern front until he was wounded in 1941, then left the military service and went to law school. **********''He has never lied once in this affair,'' Gerhard Waldheim said of his father, ''and the outcome will be that he will be fully vindicated.'' **********But he acknowledged that his father had been less than forthcoming, even with those close to him who knew vaguely that he served in the Balkans between 1942 and 1945. **********''He didn't talk much about his experience on the war front,'' said the younger Mr. Waldheim. ''When I asked my uncle what my father did, he would tell me: 'Your father didn't consider the war very nice. He just wanted to survive it.' '' **********He said he had asked his father ''point blank'' whether he might have blocked out memories of his activities late in the war. ''My father told me, 'I have never been a psychologist and never pondered myself at great depth, but there is some merit to that thought,' '' he said. **********At the hearing today by the House Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, Eli Rosenbaum, general counsel of the World Jewish Congress, disputed an assertion by Gerhard Waldheim that his father was not a intelligence officer for the German Army. In fact, he testified, an intelligence report signed by Kurt Waldheim described mass shootings in Athens and was used as evidence at the Nuremberg trials. **********Gerhard Waldheim submitted a statement written by his father that said he had worked in a section that received intelligence only about the enemy's military maneuvers, not domestic actions. ''This seems to be one of the many reasons why I was not aware of such atrocities as deportations,'' the statement said. 'Extremely Hard on Himself' **********Gerhard Waldheim portrays his father as a man of extreme self-discipline, a perfectionist who always ''put a heavy priority on his work, who is extremely hard on himself.'' **********These qualities, according to several United Nations officials who worked under Mr. Waldheim while he was Secretary General from 1972 to 1982, help to explain why he has sought to defend himself against each new charge. **********''He was always oversensitive to criticism, especially in the media,'' recalled Brian E. Urquhart, a former Under Secretary General who worked closely with Mr. Waldheim for a decade. ''It was his great weakness.'' **********Other aides said that when Mr. Waldheim gave a news conference, he often kept them in his office for hours as he edited, word by word, what would be released the next day as the official transcript. ''He supposedly rewrote the record for grammar, but basically it was because he didn't like what he said in the first place,'' a former aide said. **********The United Nations officials said it was hardly surprising that a man who issued three clarifications in one day of his remarks on the 1976 Israeli raid at Entebbe, and who once demanded that a thank-you note for a box of chocolates be rewritten three times before signing it, would continue to refine descriptions of his war record. **********Gerhard Waldheim said it was important to remember that his father apologized last week for not having acknowledged his final years of military service. But he added that perhaps his father should not have tried to defend himself against each new charge. **********''If he had to do it all over again,'' said Gerhard Waldheim, ''obviously he would have done it differently.

If that report is confirmed, said Dr. Kenneth Mossman of Georgetown University Medical School, it would suggest extremely high levels of gamma radiation. **********Two types of radiation exposure are likely to be involved in the damage at and near the reactor site. **********The first and most immediately dangerous is external gamma radiation, which is similar to X-rays and equally penetrating. Gamma radiation can damage cells, genes and vital tissues, such as the bone marrow and digestive tract. If radiation deaths are occurring, they are probably the result of severe gamma exposure. **********The other major hazard is beta radiation from radioactive forms of iodine and other elements that may enter the body through contaminated air, water, milk or solid food, and do damage internally. The effects could include immediate harm to the thyroid gland as well as cancers that may appear only decades afterward. **********Radiation is the emission of energy or subatomic particles, which can invade the body and in sufficient doses cause physical damage. Gamma rays, like visible light and X-rays, are given off when electrons in atoms of a substance change orbits and lose energy; beta particles are electrons emitted by radioactive forms of matter, such as radioactive iodine, the form - or isotope - that is considered a likely hazard in a reactor accident in addition to the gamma rays. A third form of radiation, the alpha particle, is not considered likely to be present in a reactor accident. Most Serious Threats **********To date no detailed information has been made available from the scene. If radioactive contamination proves to be widespread and serious, milk and crops might be contaminated and farmland rendered useless in the affected vicinity. **********The most serious and immediate threat to life would be from the gamma radiation if the reactor has released it in large quantity. Little can be done after the fact to protect against gamma radiation. Treatment usually consists of supportive measures such as replacement of blood constituents and protection from infections. **********Deaths from severe gamma radiation would begin within a few days of severe exposure and would probably peak in about three weeks, Dr. Mossman said. He added that deaths might continue to occur for several weeks. **********Later effects could include cancers in exposed people and developmental defects in the fetuses of pregnant women who were exposed. There might also be genetic effects in future generations. Most cancers would be expected to appear only after many years. Genetic defects are even more difficult to forecast. **********Less threatening immediately, but potentially dangerous in the long run, are internal exposures from the radioactive isotopes, notably iodine 131, that enter the body through contaminated air, food and drink. If there has been a major release of radioactive fallout from the accident, local water supplies could be immediately affected. The effects of radioactive iodine can be blocked by taking tablets of potassium iodide, but this compound can have ill effects on some people's health. **********The agricultural effects are perhaps the most problematical of all the possible consequences of the reactor accident. Yesterday in Washington, Norton D. Strommen, chief meteorologist of the United States Agriculture Department's World Agricultural Outlook Board, like most other analysts, said that it was too soon to make firm predictions about the agricultural effects of the accident. He and the others pointed out that information was took sketchy for such a forecast. **********''If we go back and look at the meteorological conditions,'' Mr. Strommen said, ''the plume of fallout from that accident would be confined primarily to the area northwest of Kiev,'' away from the main grain-growing regions. **********''At this time,'' he said, ''we have no information on dosage, intensity or duration. Therefore we can really say very little in terms of what it might mean to the future, for the planting of the spring crops and livestock in that area.'' **********Some American Government and private experts said the accident could affect Soviet food production, particularly in Byelorussia, to the north and west of the plant. Prices for wheat, corn and soybeans were up sharply in Chicago today, reflecting some traders' assessments that the disaster will force Moscow to import food. **********''There is a potential for significant negative effects on agricultural production this year,'' a State Department official said, adding that he could not make a firm estimate. **********Jan Vanous, research director of PlanEcon, an economic service that specializes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said there could also be a direct impact on Soviet oil exports. If all four 1,000-megawatt reactors in the Chernobyl station were shut down as a result of the accident, this would mean a loss of one-seventh of the nuclear power generating capacity of the Soviet Union. **********Nuclear power accounts for 11 percent of the nation's total energy production. The loss of the power supplied by the reactors would presumably be made up by oil, Mr. Vanous said, which thus would not go to the Soviet export market."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/world/malaysians-hang-two-australians.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1986-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 553, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MALAYSIANS HANG TWO AUSTRALIANS", "print_headline": "MALAYSIANS HANG TWO AUSTRALIANS", "body_text": " **********Two Australians convicted by Malaysia of trafficking in heroin were hanged this morning. **********The executions, at 6:50 A.M.

Since March, he has been both president of the country's wealthiest black college (endowment: $71 million) and owner of the Pepsi-Cola bottling franchise in lily-white Houghton on Michigan's economically depressed Upper Penninsula. **********Mr. Harvey's new role is of more than passing importance to Pepsi. Two blacks, basketball star Julius Erving and J. Bruce Llewellyn, former head of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, control the Coke bottling franchise in Philadelphia. Pepsi had to respond in kind. **********''Pepsi was simply interested in getting blacks into ownership,'' Mr. Harvey declares. But to him, more is at stake.

''It's an excellent opportunity for me to make some money and to serve as a role model.'' **********Mr. Harvey, who has a Harvard doctorate in college administration, owns rental property in Hampton, Richmond, Florida and Alabama, but the Houghton plant is his first venture into a commercial product. **********Mr. Harvey had declined an earlier offer to invest in the Danville, Va., Pepsi franchise with baseball players Willie Stargell and Bill Matlock, because he would not have had majority control. ''One of the reasons that I've had success is that I've always been totally involved,'' he says. He will not say how much he paid for the franchise, which collects revenues of about $2.5 million a year and whose profits he puts in ''six figures'' annually, except to say it was ''no gift.'' **********Several Pepsi bottlers in the Houghton region are consolidating their filling operations and Mr. Harvey phoned the Houghton mayor to reassure him that he would keep warehousing and distribution facilities there. He also has promised Pepsi not to remove any profits for nine years, a period when he intends to repay debt and invest heavily in new facilities and vending machines in Houghton. **********The cozy connections between Mr. Harvey and Pepsi have not pleased everyone in the conservative Hampton community. Roger Enrico, Pepsi's president, sits on the university's board and Mr. Harvey's wife, Norma, sits on the Houghton bottler's board. **********''I see this as a real conflict of interest for an educator and a scholar,'' says Roy Hudson, a biologist and former Hampton president who is now director of central nervous system disease research at the Upjohn Company. He berates Mr. Harvey for getting the Hampton name involved in the cola wars without any benefit to the university. ''It would have been an excellent opportunity for the school of business to own the franchise, instead of feathering one's own nest,'' he said. **********But Mr. Harvey sees no conflict because Hampton is not in the Houghton franchise's territory.

But many campus papers are discovering that the same computerized editing and printing systems that caused their financial woes can be the remedy. **********At the University of Maryland, for example, The Diamondback has established a profit-making publishing subsidiary that prints other college publications, business cards, newsletters and posters. The subsidiary produces $100,000 a year, 10 percent of the newspaper's total revenues. ''We felt we had a lot more capacity for production than our needs, so it made a lot of sense to get outside work for it,'' said Michael Fribush, The Diamondback's professional general manager. **********Similarly, The Harvard University Crimson uses its offset printing press to publish high school newspapers and to produce a weekly culture magazine that is distributed throughout Boston. The University of Texas at Austin's Daily Texan sells similar services. **********Not every revenue producer depends on equipment, though. Many college newspapers, which usually are distributed free on campus, have found they can reap large profits by selling subscriptions to students' parents. And The Yale Daily News garners substantial annual royalties from ''The Insider's Guide to the Colleges,'' a book written and edited by its staff. **********Another popular source of revenues are inserts - posters, coupons and particularly national magazines such as Ampersand, Dorm Magazine and Campus Voice, that are placed inside the college newspapers for a fee. **********One of the largest and most successful of the campus magazines is Newsweek on Campus, Newsweek's four-year-old college edition. Published six times during the school year, it contains articles written and edited by the news magazine's regular staff, with additional reporting from 50 campus correspondents.

The sale would be ITT's most dramatic reshaping in its 66-year-old history. **********The sources said that the two companies had expected the French Government, which owns C.G.E., to approve the sale yesterday but that the approval was delayed for undetermined reasons. ''They're close,'' one source said, commenting on the progress of the talks. **********Reached at his home in Paris, a spokesman for C.G.E. said, ''We do have negotiations with ITT; it's no secret anymore.'' But he added that ''nothing is signed'' and that the completion of any deal, because of the numerous countries involved, could take months. He warned that hitches could still develop that could scuttle the deal. In fact, there were reports in Europe yesterday that Northern Telecom Inc. was also interested in acquiring ITT's telecommunications operations. Talks Are 'Very, Very Hot' **********Asked how far along C.G.E.'s discussions with ITT were, the spokesman said they were ''very, very hot.'' The official asked not to be identified. **********If the deal is completed, ITT would be left a cash-rich company involved primarily in service businesses such as insurance and hotels, mainly through its Sheraton hotel and Hartford insurance companies. Gone would be the sophisticated telephone equipment that has long been synonymous with the name ITT. Before taking its initials as its official name, ITT was the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. **********Sources said that New York-based ITT would retain a 30 percent interest in a new company set up by C.G.E., and perhaps other European partners, to run the acquired telecommunications business. The business, however, would be under the control of C.G.E. Positive Reaction on Wall Street **********''If this thing happens, it is truly the most significant thing to happen to this company in its history,'' one source close to ITT said. ''It truly transforms the company.'' **********Reaction yesterday on Wall Street, where rumors of the impending sale were widespread, was positive. ITT's stock jumped $4 a share, to $49.375, in active trading of two million shares. **********Sources said that ITT's directors last week gave the company's management permission to negotiate the sale of the telecommunications operation. In 1985, ITT's telecommunications equp ment segment produced $4.6 billion of the company's $19.9 billion in total revenues from operations. **********Informal discussions between C.G.E., a huge holding company whose other major sectors are energy as well as construction and electrical contracting, and ITT are believed to have preceded the board's action. ITT declined to comment yesterday on the rumors, but sources said that Rand V. Araskog, the company's chairman, has spent much of the last week in Paris negotiating the deal, the terms of which would include C.G.E.'s assumption of what one source called ''a mountain of debt'' and payment of $2 billion in cash. **********The speculation on Wall Street was that ITT would use the proceeds to pay off other debt, acquire its own shares or make acquisitions. **********''It's difficult to comprehend an ITT without a telecommunications operation,'' said Carol Neves, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch & Company. ''I asked them what the T's would stand for in their name, and they said 'toil and trouble.' '' A Bothersome Product **********But analysts said that a sale would rid ITT of one of its most bothersome products, the System 12 digital switch. System 12, computerized equipment for switching telephone calls, has been under development since 1979 and is said to have cost the company about $1 billion. **********While System 12 has been selling nicely in Europe, the product lost out in the United States, where competition was intense from such concerns as the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and Northern Telecom. Last February ITT abandoned the United States portion of the System 12 business, a move that produced a write-off of $105 million and cost 1,600 workers their jobs. Sources said the telecommunications sale could greatly reduce the ranks of the 255,000 employees still employed worldwide by ITT. **********At the time of its withdrawal from the United States digital switch market, ITT said the move would permit it to ''provide additional resources to our European-based international switching business.'' ITT is said to have received orders from 20 countries, including some in Asia and Africa, for switches capable of handling 12 million phone lines. **********Still, analysts said, the business has been unprofitable in all but two countries, West Germany and Italy, although overall profitability was expected to be achieved in the second half of this year. That expected turnaround, analysts said, is probably why C.G.E. was willing to pay more than $2 billion for the business. **********Laurence Baker, a telecommunications analyst with E. F. Hutton & Company, said the digital and analog switching business is about 40 percent of ITT overseas operations. ''The price seems to be reasonable,'' he added. A Service-Oriented Company **********Market analysts say ITT has been moving toward becoming a service-oriented company ever since Mr. Araskog took over the helm in 1979 from Harold S. Geneen, the legendary conglomerate builder. Since then, Mr. Araskog has sold off about 95 subsidiaries for more than $4 billion. **********Last year, when the company was under a takeover threat from the Minneapolis investor Irwin L. Jacobs and the Chicago financier Jay A. Pritzker, ITT set a goal of selling off $1.7 billion worth of its assets. **********With the recent sale of its remaining stake in the Abbey Life Insurance Company in Britain, ITT has actually exceeded that divestiture goal by about $200 million. **********ITT, one of the first modern multinational corporations, was founded in 1920 by Sosthenes Behn, a sugar broker from the Virgin Islands. His dream was to build a worldwide phone system to rival the A.T.&T. network in the United States. In naming the company International Telephone and Telegraph, he deliberately invited confusion with his more famous rival. **********Mr. Behn started with phone operations in the Virgin Islands, Cuba and Puerto Rico, but a contract with Spain in 1923 was his first big break and the beginning of the company's vast European operations. Soon after it began to expand into the underdeveloped Latin American markets. **********After World War II, Mr. Behn embarked on a plan to diversify away from telephone systems and he acquired two American companies that made televisions and radios and refrigerators. Both ventures flopped. **********In 1959, however, Mr. Geneen assumed control and assembled the company's contemporary empire."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/world/us-envoy-denies-discussing-iran-arms.html": {"writer_name": "E.

''That is not my style,'' Mr. Rabb said.

''The Ambassador was taken by surprise when Mr. Minardos claimed to be a close and familiar friend,'' said one official who declined to be identified. ''Minardos talked his way into the office by pretending he was a friend.'' **********Mr. Rabb, the officials said, did not know who Mr. Minardos was when his secretary told him that an ''old friend'' who was passing through town urgently wanted to see him. Mr. Rabb finally agreed to see Mr. Minardos and vaguely recognized him - perhaps from Mr. Khashoggi's bithday party -when he was escorted into his office. **********The officials said that Mr. Minardos and Mr. Rabb exchanged pleasantries and that Mr. Minardos finally brought up the issue of Iran in vague terms. Advises Making Friends in Iran **********He told Mr. Rabb of the need for the United States to make friends in the Iranian Government and, according to the officials, also said he and some of his associates wanted to do business with Iran. **********The officials said that Mr. Rabb replied by repeating the American Government's policy stand against doing business with Iran and added that he thought the chances of any change in policy were ''remote.'' **********Mr. Minardos then asked Mr. Rabb, according to this account, if the Ambassador would let him know if there were any change in this policy. **********Mr. Rabb said he would, and he asked Mr. Minardos to leave his address and phone number with the secretary. According to the officials, Mr. Rabb requested the information so that he could find out the identity of the man with whom he had just spoken. But the officials said Mr. Minardos departed without leaving any information with the secretary. **********The officials said Mr. Minardos never mentioned Mr. Khashoggi's name, nor did he identify what his business activities were or with whom he was associated. **********Mr. Rabb said in the interview that he had never discussed anything having to do with Iranian arms sales with any officials from the National Security Council and that he first learned of the American operation through the recent news reports. Refering to arms sales, Mr. Rabb said, ''I'd run three miles before I'd talk about that.'' **********2 Dispute Rabb's Remarks **********By STUART DIAMOND **********>Mr. Kessler and Mr. Minardos yesterday disputed statements by Mr. Rabb about his conversations with them. **********Mr. Kessler said that contrary to Mr. Rabb's assertion the Ambassador did mention the Iranian hostages to him in connection with Mr. Khashoggi. ''Of course he said it, although at the time it didn't mean a lot to me,'' Mr. Kessler said in an interview from his Maryland home. **********Reached early this morning in Rome, Leonard Baldyga, a press attache for the embassy, said the Ambassador stood by his comments. **********Mr. Kessler said his conversation with the Ambassador occurred at about 11 P.M on July 24, 1985, at a party for the 50th birthday of Mr. Khashoggi at the Saudi arms trader's villa in Marbella, Spain. **********''We were standing on Mr. Khashoggi's marble terrace with a spectacular view of the the Rock of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean and, in the distance, Africa,'' Mr. Kessler said. He said that he had been drinking champagne and that Mr. Rabb also had a drink in hand. **********Mr. Kessler said he had been researching a book on Mr. Khashoggi titled, ''The Richest Man in The World,'' recently published by Warner Books. The author said he had met Mr. Rabb more than 10 years before, when Mr. Kessler was a reporter for The Washington Post and Mr. Rabb was a lawyer in New York City. **********The author said that Mr. Khashoggi's associates later told him that the next day, July 25, Mr. Rabb spent several hours on Mr. Khashoggi's yacht. Writer Says Rabb Called Sunday **********The author said that yesterday, at about 10:30 A.M., Mr. Rabb called him from Rome to complain about the writer's comments to The New York Times about their conversation. **********''At first he said he did not recall saying anything about the hostages,'' Mr. Kessler said. Then, Mr. Kessler said, Mr. Rabb told him that even if he did say it, ''that's a fine way to handle a confidence, isn't it?'' Mr. Kessler said that he saw nothing wrong with making the remark public because the issue had become important and the comment did not appear to implicate the Ambassador in the Iranian arms deal. **********Mr. Minardos also disputed parts of comments by Mr. Rabb and by the officials at the embassy - including that Mr. Minardos had no appointment, only vaguely discussed Iran and did not leave a forwarding phone number. **********Mr. Minardos said he had met Mr. Rabb when he sat next to the Ambassador at a restaurant on July 23 for a celebration of Mr. Khashoggi.'s birthday and saw Mr. Rabb again the next evening at the arms trader's villa. ''I promised that I would go to Rome'' to see Mr. Rabb, Mr. Minardos said. **********Mr. Minardos said he called Mr. Rabb from Athens the next February to discuss the Iranian arms issue. ''He said he didn't want to talk over the phone, that I should see him in Rome,'' Mr. Minardos said.  Mr. Minardos said that in Rome he discussed details of the Iranian arms issue with Mr. Rabb and asked the Ambassador if the United States had approved the sale of arms to Iran. ''He said he would find out. He was going to call my wife in California and let her know yes or no,'' Mr. Minardos said. ''He didn't call. The next thing I knew, I was arrested.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/business/credit-markets-lift-from-housing-data-ebbs.html": {"writer_name": "Susan Rasky", "pub_date": "1986-06-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 824, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LIFT FROM HOUSING DATA EBBS", "print_headline": "CREDIT MARKETS; LIFT FROM HOUSING DATA EBBS", "body_text": " **********An unexpected decline in May housing starts bolstered prices in the Government bond market early yesterday, but the brief flurry of activity consisted largely of professional trading and failed to produce a significant rally. **********By midday the early gains had been trimmed somewhat by profit taking, and at the end of trading in New York the price for the Treasury's key 7 1/4 percent bond due in 2016 was at 98 3/32, up 14/32 from Monday's close, to yield 7.41 percent. **********Prices of other Treasury issues posted gains ranging from 5/32 to 19/ 32, while interest rates for three-month and six-month Treasury bills were down slightly from Monday, with three-month bills yielding 6.10 percent and six-month bills yielding 6.16 percent. **********The yield on one-year Treasury bills was down eight-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.17 percent. **********The Treasury announced plans yesterday to auction $7.25 billion of four-year notes next Tuesday and $6.75 billion of seven-year notes next Wednesday. The four-year note sale, which is $250 million larger than the previous issue, will raise $2.9 billion in new cash. The seven-year note sale, also $250 million higher, will be entirely to raise new cash. When-Issued Trading Noted **********In advance of the auctions, the four-year notes were traded on a when-issued basis at 7.29 percent late yesterday, while the seven-year notes were traded at 7.48 percent. The two-year notes that the Treasury is to auction today were traded on a when-issued basis at 6.99 percent. **********Traders said the initially favorable market reaction to the housing report was muted somewhat by reports from Washington that Manuel Johnson, vice chairman-designate of the Federal Reserve Board, had said the Fed was not surprised by the weakness in second-quarter economic data. The credit markets have been buoyed in recent days by a conviction that the economy's lackluster performance in May would prompt the Fed to lower its discount rate. **********William V. Sullivan, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the markets interpreted Mr. Johnson's remarks to mean that such an easing of monetary policy was by no means certain. ''Some of the data we've been seeing are ominously weak, but the impression Johnson left with traders is that the Fed is still wedded to the notion of stronger growth in the second half of the year,'' Mr. Sullivan said. Views Offered by Angell **********The markets apparently paid less heed to reports of comments made by Wayne Angell, a member of the Federal Reserve Board. In a Cable News Network interview, he said that he saw no evidence of a strong economic rebound and that there was room for lower interest rates this summer. **********The housing data showed that starts totaled 1.89 million at an annual rate in May, well below the consensus forecast of a 2 million annual rate and down 7.4 percent from the April figure. The decline reflected a steep drop of 21.9 percent in multi-unit starts, while the annual rate for starts on single-family homes was unchanged at 1.26 million units. **********Mr. Sullivan said traders tended to discount some of the weakness in the housing figures because the declines were all in the multifamily sector, where numbers are often more volatile and where weakness had been expected because of the elimination of real estate tax breaks contemplated in pending tax legislation. **********He argued, however, that the figures do call into question the notion that there is underlying strength in the economy. Mr. Sullivan noted that construction permits for both single-family and multifamily construction were down, a signal of weakness in future housing activity, and that housing starts were off by 24.8 percent in the Northeast, a region that had been the strongest for housing activity. Weak Retail Demand Seen **********''Housing is no longer providing the prop for the economy that it once did,'' Mr. Sullivan said. **********Analysts for both the corporate and Treasury markets said that the trading environment had improved over the last several days but that retail interest was virtually nil. **********Lindley B. Richert, chief market analyst for McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, said that while the recent rally in the government bond market has given some encouragement to corporate bond issuers, many were still holding back offerings. **********''There's no clear consensus on the part of corporate issuers,'' he said. ''They see a two- or three-point spike upward in prices, but the yields are still not low enough to make them comfortable.'' **********Mr. Richert said most finance companies had taken care of their long-term funding needs during the first quarter but utilities in particular were still looking to refund debt that was sold when rates were higher. **********''Come September, there will be a whole new host of utilities whose high-cost paper becomes callable at far less of a premium price than would currently be required to refund,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/27/world/text-of-aquino-s-statement-all-the-world-wondered.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 409, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXT OF AQUINO'S STATEMENT: 'ALL THE WORLD WONDERED'", "print_headline": "TEXT OF AQUINO'S STATEMENT: 'ALL THE WORLD WONDERED'", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of a statement by President Corazon C.

Here we saw a people put up a heroic, and in some cases a fatal, defense. Here we saw a people putting their lives on the line, not out of identification with a personality, but out of devotion to the principle of electoral change: political change through honest elections. More Surprises in Store **********If my wide following was remarkable, this was startling. But the Filipinos had more surprises in store for the world. **********They came out in the millions to show their dogged support for the woman the dictatorship claimed it had defeated in the election. **********As if this was not enough to give the lie to the low impression the world has had of Filipinos after 20 years of Marcos, the Filipino people interposed themselves between a small band of officers and men who rejected the dictatorship finally out of disgust, and the vast array of the dictator's military night. **********The world saw and recorded a people who knelt in the path of oncoming tanks and subdued with embraces of friendship the battle-hardened troops sent out to disperse them and annihilate the military rebels. **********All the world wondered as they witnessed, in the space of two months, a people lift themselves from humiliation to the greatest pride. **********The challenges and difficulties that I and our people face are daunting.

They were members of the Apostles, an elite group on the campus, where Soviet agents recruited leftist students in the 1930's. The two other accused spies in the ring were Donald Maclean and Kim Philby. **********The peer, who did wartime service in M.I.5, had been investigated 20 years ago after the ring was uncovered and he apparently was cleared, since he later held major Government posts. But lately, he complained, the innuendoes were renewed as part of the endless fascination with the question of if there was a ''fifth man'' who had worked with the four known spies. No Evidence Over the Years **********No clear evidence of such a stealthy survivor has emerged over the years, but proponents theorize it must be so, contending Communist espionage cells often were designed as five-member rings. Preoccupation with the subject is such that even as the Government denied Lord Rothschild's involvement, observers were focusing on his insistence that there was ''unequivocal evidence'' of his innocence, theorizing that such could only exist if the identity of the actual ''fifth man'' were known. **********The unusual demand for clearance was made as the Thatcher Government became embroiled in a court fight in Australia to prevent the publication there of the memoirs of Peter Wright, a former M.I.5 agent. In the course of that fight, it has been disclosed that Lord Rothschild once assisted Mr. Wright in a 1981 book about M.I.5 that directed ''fifth man'' allegations at the late Sir Roger Hollis, a former director of M.I.5.

As barriers to interstate banking tumble in Illinois and nearby states, however, several regional banks are expected to join the big leagues, through mergers. **********''We're interested in building our bank into a mega-regional organization, and we think others will want to do likewise,'' said John F. Fisher, senior vice president at Banc One, of Columbus, Ohio, which has more than $10 billion in assets. ''In the 1990's,'' he added, ''we'll see some mega-regionals getting together to form banks that will be competitive with Citibank and Chase Manhattan.'' **********Banc One is already moving aggressively to expand into neighboring states. It has bought or agreed to buy four Indiana banks, a Kentucky bank and a Michigan bank. And the Ameritrust Corporation of Cleveland has moved boldly as well, having agreed to acquire the First Indiana Bankcorp in Elkhart, with more than $700 million in assets. **********New Interstate Banking Laws **********Some bank officials and analysts say the Middle West's new interstate banking laws will lead to a wave of mergers that will create a few new $20 billion banks. **********But not everyone thinks the merger phenomenon will mushroom throughout the region. With problems in the Farm Belt and Rust Belt continuing to drag down the region's economy, many bank experts do not expect the Middle West to experience the bank merger mania that has swept through the Southeast and Southwest. **********''In the Midwest, everyone is likely to be much more cautious than in other regions,'' said Paul M. Homan, executive vice president of the Continental Illinois Corporation, which, with $30.5 billion in assets, is the region's second-largest bank holding company. ''We're not as attractive a banking market. The economic potential for some of the states here is not as bright as Florida or Arizona.'' Chicago Area Targeted **********Nonetheless, bank officials and analysts note, many banks outside Illinois are hungering to make acquisitions in and around Chicago, the region's financial center, to get a piece of its thriving commercial business. **********The Illinois legislature has enacted a law that, on July 1, will permit banks in adjacent states to purchase Illinois banks so long as those other states have laws allowing Illinois banks to acquire their banks. This opens Illinois' door to banks in Indiana and Kentucky, which already have reciprocity laws. And entry is expected to be allowed in the next year to banks in Wisconsin and Missouri, where the legislatures are debating interstate banking bills. **********Michigan and Ohio also have new reciprocity laws, but they cannot buy into Illinois because they are not contiguous. In states like Wisconsin and Missouri, which do not have reciprocity laws, bankers are lobbying heavily because they worry that they will be left behind as their out-of-state competitors grow through mergers. 'We're Missing Out' **********''There is no question that we feel we're missing out,'' said Donald E. Lasater, chairman of the Mercantile Bancorporation, Missouri's largest bank holding company with almost $7 billion in assets. **********Middle West bankers give several reasons why they think growth, through merger or otherwise, is important. It enables them to compete better with the New York and West Coast giants. It allows for economies of scale in activities such as data processing. It makes it easier for banks to share in large credits to major corporations, and thus helps them win corporate business, like providing services to a company's factories or branch offices. **********''Size is also important because if you drop off the list of the top 100 banks, then you're followed less closely by institutional investors and analysts,'' said Mr. Lasater, whose St. Louis-based bank holding company ranks about 65th in size nationwide. Less interest in a bank's stock, he said, often means lower stock prices. Establishing a Presence **********The Middle West, analysts agree, has four principal financial centers: Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis and Cleveland. Many analysts say that in order to achieve the size necessary to compete with money center banks, Middle West banks will have to try to establish a presence in each of those centers. Analysts suggest, for example, that Detroit's leading banks, NBD Bankcorp and Comerica Inc., will try to buy into Chicago and other major regional centers. **********Roger L. Fitzsimonds, executive vice president for the First Wisconsin Corporation - which, with $6 billion in assets, is that state's largest bank holding company - said: ''There are 20 banks in the Midwest our size or larger, and they all want to survive. That means they're going to want to be involved in all the region's spheres of influence, but especially Chicago's.'' **********Everyone agrees that the region's interstate banking activity will revolve around Chicago because of its financial exchanges, big banks and plethora of corporate headquarters. ''The Chicago metropolitan area, with its booming suburbs, is absolutely one of the best areas that bank holding companies can buy into,'' said Michael Sammon, a bank analyst with the Chicago Corporation. Two Bank Giants Ailing **********Ironically, Chicago's two banking giants are not in the best of shape to make acquisitions as the era of interstate banking dawns. The First Chicago Corporation - the nation's 10th largest bank and the largest bank between the coasts - has stumbled in the last 18 months and is trying to regain investor confidence after taking huge charge-offs for troubled loans and after making a bad investment in a Brazilian bank. And following its near-collapse in May 1984, Continental Illinois, the nation's 12th largest bank, is slowly on the mend. **********''Continental's opportunities may be limited to acquiring some smaller-sized institutions,'' said James McDermott, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. ''First Chicago's ability to capitalize on interstate banking will depend to some extent on its healing process.'' **********Since First Chicago's depressed stock price has improved recently as a result of improved earnings, analysts say this gives the bank more options because it is likely to use stock to acquire other banks. **********Richard L. Thomas, president of First Chicago, which has $39 billion in assets, says his bank will enter the interstate derby. ''We think it would be desirable to broaden our funding base by acquiring other banks,'' said Mr. Thomas. ''Through that same process we would like to achieve greater penetration of the commercial middle market.'' Middle Market Cited **********Analysts say First Chicago hopes to buy non-Illinois banks to replicate its success with the American National Bank, which it bought two years ago. American National is the leading bank in Chicago's profitable middle market - medium-sized companies much loved by banks because they borrow at a premium and use a host of bank services. **********Officials at Continental Illinois have less grand designs. Long plagued by Illinois laws that limited banks to having just three branches, thus making it harder to attract retail depositors, Continental hopes to buy retail-oriented banks within Illinois. The new Illinois law opens the door for Chicago banks to buy not only out-of-state banks but also banks in downstate Illinois and some outlying suburbs - areas long off limits to the Chicago banks. **********Mr. Homan, the Continental executive vice president, said: ''We have been looking at banks in the Chicago suburbs with the aim of diversifying our assets and liabilities, particularly toward retail banking.'' According to some analysts, one of the factors leading to Continental's crisis was its inadequate retail base, which forced it to pay a premium for its funds. Developing a Beachhed **********Many analysts predict that non-Illinois banks, hoping to develop a beachhead in the Chicago area, will vie with Continental Illinois to acquire banks in Chicago's fast-growing suburbs. The out-of-state banks are expected to focus on Illinois banks with assets under $1 billion. **********Some analysts suggest, however, that target banks, in Illinois and elsewhere, may play hard to get. The reason is they might wait for the passage of national banking laws that would allow banks from any state to purchase them. By admitting New York's big banks into the bidding this could raise the price that banks fetch. **********''The way the Illinois legislature defined the region, you have relatively few big banks that will be buyers,'' said John Rau, president of the Exchange National Bank in Chicago. He noted that Michigan, Ohio and Minnesota are excluded from the Illinois region. ''But broadening the region is inevitable and so is expanding to national banking. That's when the real excitement comes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/23/world/britain-moves-to-expel-21-libyans-it-calls-revolutionary-activists.html": {"writer_name": "Jo Thomas", "pub_date": "1986-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRITAIN MOVES TO EXPEL 21 LIBYANS IT CALLS 'REVOLUTIONARY' ACTIVISTS", "print_headline": "BRITAIN MOVES TO EXPEL 21 LIBYANS IT CALLS 'REVOLUTIONARY' ACTIVISTS", "body_text": " **********Britain said today that it planned to expel 21 Libyan students for suspected involvement in ''student revolutionary activities.'' **********The 21, all of whom were arrested today, included a pilot trainee who authorities say telephoned Tripoli radio last month with an offer to form suicide squads to bomb United States military targets. **********The expulsions of the Libyan students were ordered by the Home Secretary ''in the national interest.''

On Monday, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Minister, warned other European nations that Libyan journalists, airline workers, and others also posed a potential hazard and merited surveillance. **********In Athens, the Greek Government indicated that it would not apply diplomatic sanctions against Libya, although it had reluctantly agreed to them at the European Community meeting. A Government spokesman, Miltiades Papaioannou, cited ''national factors'' and said there was no firm evidence that Colonel Qaddafi's Government sponsored international terrorism. **********In 1984, when an unarmed police constable was killed by shots fired from the Libyan diplomatic mission in London, there were 5,000 Libyans in Britain. Since then, the number of Libyans allowed to enter the counry has been sharply reduced, from 28,500 in 1983 to 1,300 in the first six months of 1985. **********At the moment, according to British officials, there are 1,800 Libyan students in Britain, including 250 Libyan pilots undergoing training here. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons today she was considering further actions against the pilot trainees. List of Undesirables **********The names of the 21 Libyan students are to go on a list of undesirables to make sure they do not enter another Common Market country. **********Among those whose explusion was announced today was Abdel Massoud, 23 years old, a student at the Oxford Air Training School, near Oxford. He was said to have telephoned Tripoli radio after the action by the United States Sixth Fleet in the Gulf of Sidra last month and offered to form anti-American suicide squads. **********The call, in Arabic, was broadcast on Libya's external radio service and picked up by a monitoring service of the BBC. ''We, the revolutionary force, are prepared to become suicide squads against America and its aggression,'' Mr. Massoud said. ''We will hit with an iron fist anyone like Reagan who contemplates aggression.'' **********Also today, Nezar Nawaf Mansour Hindawi, a Jordanian, was charged in Magistrate's court with conspiracy to destroy an El Al Israel Airlines plane and kill his fiancee by planting a bomb in her luggage before she went aboard. **********On Monday, in agreeing on steps to cut down the number of Libyans in Europe and restrict their movements, the European Community ministers also agreed to ban entry of any Libyan expelled from another member state. Danish Action on Libyans **********In Denmark, Mr. Ellemann-Jensen said today that his country planned not only to expel several Libyan diplomats, but also to restrict the movements of those who remain. **********In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said West Germany intends to reduce the size of its mission in Tripoli, which now has 22 people. After Bonn reduces its mission staff, the spokesman said, the Libyans, who have 41 people, including 8 Germans, working in their Bonn mission, will be told to reduce their staff to the same size. **********The West Germans expelled two Libyan diplomats immediately after the April 5 bombing of a West Berlin discotheque and issued an arrest warrant for Amin Abdullah el-Amin, a Libyan diplomat stationed in East Berlin but earlier posted in West Germany. **********France has expelled a total of six Libyans since April 5, when two Libyan diplomats were deported for alleged involvement in a plan to machine-gun the visa line at the American consulate in Paris. Four others, not diplomats, were expelled April 18. According to press reports they were plotting the assassination of a senior American diplomat in Paris. **********Italian authorities yesterday announced the arrest in Rome of one former Libyan diplomat and issued an arrest warrant for another on suspicion of plotting to kill the United States Ambassador to Italy, as well as the Saudi Arabian and Egyptian Ambassadors. **********The Libyan taken into custody Sunday night was identified as Arebi Mohammed Fituri, 47 years old. He was described as an employee of the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company in Rome. The other suspect was Mussbah Mahmud Werfalli, 39 years old, who left Italy last April. ----Libya Denounces Italian Move ROME, April 22 - Libya today denounced the arrest of a former Libyan diplomat in a purported plot to murder three Ambassadors as ''pure invention'' by the United States. **********But the United States Embassy praised the Italians' arrest of Mr. Fituri, a former cultural attache at the Libyan diplomatic mission in Rome. The Embassy called the arrest ''a very positive sign of progress in the struggle against terrorism.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/01/business/bankamerica-fund-pledge-reported.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Cole", "pub_date": "1986-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 668, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BANKAMERICA FUND PLEDGE REPORTED", "print_headline": "BANKAMERICA FUND PLEDGE REPORTED", "body_text": " **********Three of the BankAmerica Corporation's four Wall Street fund-raisers have told the troubled banking company that they are prepared to raise at least $1 billion in new capital, Wall Street sources disclosed yesterday. **********These sources said that the First Boston Corporation, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. and Salomon Brothers Inc. - all longstanding investment advisers to BankAmerica - informed bank executives that they might even be able to raise more than $1 billion, without asking for any change of top management. **********They cautioned, however, that now did not seem to be the time to raise funds, largely because the bank did not need capital. They added that raising funds now would also heavily dilute the holdings of investors. Moreover, they said, to sell stock at a time when additional capital is not essential would be to give it away, since the bank's stock price is depressed. **********Goldman, Sachs & Company is BankAmerica's fourth major fund-raiser, but its position is unknown. Goldman, Sachs executives did not return phone calls, but other sources speculated that the investment firm might have a conflict of interest that prevented it from joining in. Secret Meeting **********The strong show of Wall Street support for BankAmerica came at a time when its directors were preparing for a secret meeting tomorrow and a formal meeting on Monday to consider a proposal from Sanford A. Weill, former president of the American Express Company, to become head of the bank. A crucial part of the proposal called for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., now owned by American Express, to raise $1 billion in new bank capital, but only if Mr. Weill took over as chief. **********''If you separate the money from the rest of the plan, all you've got is a job application,'' one leading Wall Street executive remarked. ''And if the bank wanted to change management, it would have done it last January, when it reported big losses.'' **********This executive argued that by not taking action at that time, directors were signaling that Samuel H. Armacost, BankAmerica's current president and chief executive, has another year to turn the bank around. **********Responding to the growing battle, BankAmerica stock rose 37.5 cents yesterday, to $17.625, for an advance of more than $3 for the week. Unspecified Plan **********All that is known for certain about Mr. Weill's proposal is that he be named to run the bank, as successor to Mr. Armacost. He has also mentioned an unspecified plan he has in mind to help the bank recover. Part of that plan would be to bring in $1 billion in new capital, but Mr. Weill was known to have told Mr. Armacost that the money was only part of his proposal. **********Sources close to BankAmerica said that ''the company is taking no chances'' and is preparing for what could be a long siege. **********Besides Mr. Weill's commitment from Shearson Lehman, Morgan Stanley & Company, another powerful investment house, has joined his team, and Warren Hellman, one-time president of Lehman Brothers, is another personal adviser. Bank's Team **********The bank's team, meanwhile, includes the California law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which helped Unocal fight off a takeover bid by T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, and D. F. King & Company, an organization that helps major corporations solicit votes. King's participation would become significant if Mr. Weill turned to BankAmerica stockholders to vote for him as new chief at election time in April. **********Some of BankAmerica's directors have been out of the country. They may still not know that Mr. Weill's proposal will be put before them. Each of them is being given a hefty package of papers to study before their informal meeting tomorrow. **********Of directors that could be reached, some implied that the matter should be resolved quickly.

But officials have made clear in conversations that this will not dilute white power or the notion of separation of the country's classrooms, suburbs and ways of life. **********Moreover, disputes within Afrikanerdom seem to have led to a strengthening of those whose opposition to major change is stiffened by a sense that they are facing a ''revolutionary onslaught'' against white privilege, conducted by the banned and outlawed African National Congress. **********And while the images have been chased from American television screens by the outlawing of film coverage of political unrest, the tumult in segregated black townships continues. #1,100 Killed Since September Since September 1984 at least 1,110 people have died in township violence, eight of them this weekend alone, 99 of them since the beginning of the year. Many of them are the victims of internecine violence. A state of emergency remains in force around Cape Town, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth - a tacit acknowledgement of failure to find a political solution to the endemic unrest. **********The violence, too, seems sometimes turned in on itself so that the bodies are those of blacks killed by fellow blacks in pursuit - by design or by accident -of white tactics called divide and rule. By police figures, almost a third of those who died by the beginning of this year had been slain by fellow blacks. **********If there are omens for the coming year, most political analysts and Government security specialists say, they are bleak. A school boycott has temporarily been suspended but could well be reintroduced soon by township radicals who brook no opposition among their peers to their plans for protest. **********It is a year, too, of anniversaries laden with anger and defiance. March 21, for instance, commemorates not only the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, but also the slaying, on that day last year, of black mourners at Langa, in the restive Eastern Cape. June 16 will be the 10th anniversary of the Soweto uprising, whose casualties then - officially put at 550 dead - seemed grisly enough, but have long been overtaken. Marching to Different Rhythms **********As on many occasions in this divided land, the authorities and their foes seem to march to different rhythms. **********Thus President P. W. Botha, seeking to co-opt black leaders into what he has called a National Statutory Council, has offered the black majority, by his own definition only, access to the highest levels of power. Yet, as with earlier attempts to achieve the same goal, the offer has not been taken up, even by black leaders such as the Zulu Chief, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, whom the township radicals call a sellout because he leads a so-called homeland called KwaZulu set up for the nation's six million Zulus. **********Mr. Botha, adopting a more glittery public-relations style than ever before and seeking to tone down the belligerence of some of his public appearances last year, has appealed directly to blacks on vernacular-language radio and television to support him. He has placed full-page advertisements in the newspapers assuring blacks that he wants to include them in the nation's future. **********But other realities seem to intrude, offering blacks another view of the authorities. On Friday, during a protest march by mothers in the township of Atteridgeville outside Pretoria from which reporters were barred, the crack of tear-gas cannisters being fired drifted over the railroad tracks and the cornfields that separate the area from white-owned land. Battle Remote From Suburbia **********This weekend in Alexandra township in northern Johannesburg, hard by the continent's wealthiest belt of suburbia, three blacks died in fighting between riot policemen and youthful protesters - in a battle destined by apartheid to remain remote from the private pools and tennis courts enjoyed by whites just over the hill. **********In Cape Town, seat of the nation's Parliament, while the Government this month sought to assure the outside world that the system of racial separation called apartheid was dying, mixed-race deputies from the segregated, three-chamber Parliament -which ignores the black majority -were refused service in a restaurant reserved for white legislators. **********''As this incident so graphically demonstrates,'' the anti-Government Cape Times newspaper said in an editorial, ''apartheid lives.'' **********Yet that comment seems to beg the question: What is apartheid? Use of the word angers and troubles Government figures, who say the notion is outdated, a throwback to the manners of rule devised by such Afrikaner leaders as Hendrik Verwoerd, the Prime Minister who was assassinated in 1966. Yet, for outsiders, the word also denotes the racial separations - and the notions of ethnic and racial differences - that underpin the changes that Mr. Botha is promising. 'Gone as Far as He Can' **********Those changes represent a break with Dr. Verwoerd's notion of apartheid but fail to satisfy black demands for a universal franchise. **********Mr. Botha, said Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, the former leader of the relatively liberal white opposition in Parliament, ''has gone as far with reform as he can.'' That means, he said, that South Africa's leader ''cannot sacrifice self-determiniation for whites.'' **********Thus, according to Stoffel van der Merwe, of the so-called enlightened wing of Afrikaners, South Africa's rulers feel they can manage events so ''we are not left completely at the mercy of a hostile black majority.'' **********That is to say that, by compartmentalizing the nation in the manner devised by early Afrikaner rulers, the thrust of black power can be diverted into separate channels for the nation's tribes and races. The notion seems to be, paradoxically, that apartheid can be dismantled by the same compartmentalization that created it. **********''We see a future in South Africa where all the minority groups in South Africa are represented, which means that the Zulus would be represented as Zulus, the Sowetans would participate as Sowetans,'' Mr. van der Merwe said. ''So you would have a number of bodies that would have a joint responsibility for governing the country.'' Rebuke for Foreign Minister **********That, he acknowledged, implied ''a government dominated by blacks in a numerical sense'' but with guarantees for continued white exclusivity. When Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha made the same, hedged suggestion at a briefing with foreign reporters in Cape Town, President Botha, to whom he is not related, responded with a harsh public rebuke that seemed to strengthen the hand of the so-called right wing of the 2.8 million Afrikaners. **********The realities, beyond President Botha's promises, seemed thus to be displayed not in pledges of amorphous and cautious change, but in the words of F. W. de Klerk, the Afrikaner minister responsible for education and the leader of the ruling National Party in the Transvaal. **********Asked the other day if he might envision integrated schools in South Africa, he replied: ''Not in Government schools. Not as long as my party is in power.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/23/business/dow-drops-2.67-as-volume-eases.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 545, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dow Drops 2.67 as Volume Eases", "print_headline": "Dow Drops 2.67 as Volume Eases", "body_text": " **********Stock prices fell yesterday as trading reverted to more normal levels after the record-breaking session on Friday caused by the ''triple witching hour.'' **********Yesterday's turnover of 157.6 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, while hefty by ordinary standards, was far below the historic 244.7 million shares traded Friday.

British Paper Comments **********The Daily Telegraph in Britain said in an editorial, ''The current round of reprisals is not the way to create the openness, trust and confidence that will lead the way to disarmament.'' **********Blame for the showdown was generally spread equally between Washington and Moscow, although some newspapers lauded the diplomacy of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, who they said refused to be drawn into the game. **********Others accused President Reagan of exploiting the action to gain points with conservative supporters, who were said to be disgruntled over the handling of the arrest and expulsion by Moscow of Nicholas S. Daniloff, the American reporter accused of spying. **********''President Reagan is still smarting from the gibes of some of his right-wing Republican supporters that he was soft over the Daniloff affair,'' The Daily Mail of Britain said. ''If he wants to deserve the reputation of a statesman he must be prepared sometimes to sacrifice demagogy and short-term electoral appeal.'' 'Diplomatic Banalities' **********One of the papers to praise what it called the restraint of Mr. Gorbachev was the liberal Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung, whose correspondent in Moscow, Elfie Siegl, wrote: **********''Mr. Gorbachev proved himself above these sandbox games. Instead he cast light on these diplomatic banalities and made clear that the Reagan Administration is having its problems with a Soviet leadership that is unexpectedly and seriously capable of compromise in key disarmament questions.'' **********Official Government reticence was not surprising, given the European record in expelling Soviet diplomats, trade officials, journalists and others on suspicion of spying. **********The two major cases came in April 1983, when Paris expelled 40 Soviet diplomats, 5 commercial attaches and 2 Tass reporters, and in 1971, when London told 105 Soviet diplomats to leave. **********The Russians did not react to the French move and demanded the withdrawal of only 18 British diplomats from Moscow in retaliation for London's action.

This appears to be an attempt to avoid souring relations with the East bloc. **********Moreover, with the large German stake in the disarmament effort, because of the presence of large numbers of nuclear-tipped missiles on German soil, there was little enthusiasm in Bonn for the American-Soviet round of expulsions. **********''We're not terribly happy with it all, and the last thing in the world we'd do is to comment on it publicly,'' a West German official said.

Levine, a consultant with the New York State Police, who signed the statement with Dr. Carlos F. Valerio, a Brazilian forensic expert, said the dental records matched X-rays taken last year of the teeth of Dr. Mengele's remains. **********The records were discovered when the United States consul general in Sao Paulo, Stephen F. Dachi, and a vice consul, Fred Kaplan, were able to track down Dr. Mengele's dentist from obscure references in his diary. **********Israel Remained Skeptical **********While the United States, West Germany and Brazil had all accepted the previous evidence that Dr. Mengele lived in Brazil from 1961 until his death in 1979, Israel had refused to endorse the previous findings. **********The absence of dental records also helped feed conspiracy theories suggesting that the body exhumed last June 6 was not that of Dr. Mengele and that he might still be on the run. **********He was wanted because he had selected inmates in the Auschwitz death camp for the gas chambers and had also used prisoners for cruel and bizarre pseudoscientific experiments. **********The Brazilian national police chief, Romeo Tuma, who headed last year's investigation, said today in Sao Paulo that the case was now closed. Mr. Dachi, the consul, said: ''We already had 99 percent proof, but people would point to the missing 1 percent. We had not found the smoking pistol. In 40 years, no one had found an X-ray of Mengele. Then suddenly we had eight dental films and definitive identification was possible.'' **********Even before the dental records were found Friday, all the evidence pointed to the same conclusion. Documents seized from a former employee of the Mengele family firm in Gunzburg, Bavaria, led to two couples in Sao Paulo who had sheltered Dr. Mengele. One couple, Wolfram and Liselotte Bossert, took the police to where they said Dr. Mengele was buried under the name of Wolfgang Gerhard. **********As the case unraveled, forensic scientists said that the exhumed body's size and age were consistent with those of Dr. Mengele at the time of his death and that a modern technique of superimposing the skull on photographs of Dr. Mengele as a young man further corroborated their finding. **********American experts who compared samples of Dr. Mengele's handwriting found in his Nazi SS records with handwriting in his diary and other documents in Brazil said they were written by the same person. **********''But the question remained,'' Mr. Dachi recalled, ''were those Mengele's bones?'' Looking for a Town Called Sama **********Detective work then came into play. In his diary, Dr. Mengele mentioned visits to dentists, including root canal treatment by a Dr. Gama in Sama on Dec. 6 and 11, 1978, for which he had made two payments, of 2,000 and 1,000 cruzeiros. But there is no town called Sama and dentists named Gama were interviewed without result. Mr. Dachi, the consul, said: ''I had noticed that Mengele often used abbreviations in his diary and I kept thinking, 'Sama,' 'Sama,' 'What is Sama?' Then suddenly it came to me, 'Santo Amaro.' **********''There was one last hopeless place we had not looked - the yellow pages of the phone book. And there it was, Dr. Hercy Gonzaga Gama Angelo in Santo Amaro. My secretary called and asked for an appointment and she was told, 'Yes, but Dr. Gama does only root canals.' '' **********Accompanied by a police agent, Mr. Dachi visited Dr. Gama in Santo Amaro, a Sao Paulo borough, last Friday. The dentist, on looking through his records, found that he had indeed provided root canal treatment on Dec. 6 and 11, 1978, with payments of 2,000 and 1,000 cruzeiros, to a Pedro Hochbichler of Estrada de Alvarenga 5555. First Alias Used in Brazil **********Pedro Hochbichler was the first alias used by Dr. Mengele in Brazil, and the address was that of the home he rented from Mrs. Bossert. **********Dr. Gama had no X-rays, but he said the patient had been recommended by another dentist, Dr. Kasumasa Tutiya, two blocks away. **********''By then I was hyperventilating,'' Mr. Dachi went on, still excited by the find. ''Mengele had told Mrs. Bossert that he went to a Japanese dentist because, he said, all Japanese looked alike and so Japanese could not tell one white from another. But he never told Mrs. Bossert the name of the dentist.'' **********When visited, Dr. Tutiya promptly found the dental charts of Pedro Hochbichler for 1976 through 1978 and, disproving Dr. Mengele's thesis, he also recognized photographs of the patient. **********As Mr. Dachi recalled the visit, ''I then asked him sort of casually, 'You wouldn't have any X-rays, would you?'' **********''And he said, 'Wait a minute' and came back 30 seconds later with eight dental films,'' the consul said.

[ Page A3. ]  In the interview, Mr. Shamir repeated Israel's position that it will not withdraw its troops from the Israeli-designated ''security zone'' in southern Lebanon, as demanded by the Security Council.

''We don't think we have to pay a price for a Soviet change in attitude.'' **********When asked if this meant the Russians would have to drop their demand that Israel give up occupied territories, he replied, ''The answer is yes.'' **********He added, ''We are not desperate to make them change their position.'' **********Mr. Shamir said the Soviet Union under the leadership of Mikhail S. Gorbachev ''until now seems to be old wine in new bottles.'' **********''It's the same regime with the same slogans, with the same theory and ideology,'' Mr. Shamir said, ''and unfortunately, so far, there is not any promising change.'' **********He said there had been no modification in the Soviet attitude on Jewish emigration, a subject that Mr. Peres raised at the meeting on Monday. **********''The only thing we could consider a change is for the Soviet Union to give permission to thousands of Soviet Jews to leave Russia immediately and go to Israel,'' he said. ''The release of one or two prisoners or refuseniks is not the beginning of a solution.'' **********He said he had no plans to meet with Soviet officials during his visit to the United Nations, but added, ''I am always ready to discuss with the Soviets subjects of mutual interest.'' During this visit, he said, he will meet with the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Rumania, among others. **********Mr. Shamir acknowledged differences between his approach and that of Mr. Peres.

For the last year, Mr. Peres has emphasized the possibility of an international conference involving interested Middle East parties and the Soviet Union, although he has said such a conference would not be a substitute for direct negotiations. Mr. Shamir has repeatedly expressed his opposition to an international conference. **********''There are no different views between me and Mr. Peres that the main way to get peace is by direct negotiations,'' he said.

DeBartolo Sr. and Paul A. Bilzerian. Allied, which owns Brooks Brothers, Bonwit Teller and Jordan Marsh, had accepted that bid earlier this month. **********Campeau had initially offered $58 a share for Allied on Sept. 4. It then raised the offer to $66. **********Campeau said the $66 offer had already drawn tenders of more than 38 million of Allied's outstanding common shares, although withdrawal rights for those shares have not expired yet. Under the terms of the offer, the company would acquire up to 40.75 million shares, and the remaining 20 percent would be bought for $84.16 face amount of securities. That would involve the exchange of $47.86 face amount of a 16 percent exchangeable, redeemable cumulative, preferred stock and $36.30 face amount of a right to buy Campeau shares. **********But the value of Campeau's latest offer was questioned by analysts and by Daniel Good, a managing director and head of principal investment at Shearson Lehman Brothers, which is advising the DeBartolo-Bilzerian group. ''We still believe we have the higher bid at $67 a share in cash,'' Mr. Good said, ''and their revised offer is in large part illusory. They have not announced the terms for the exchange of securities or rights.'' **********Monroe Greenstein, an analyst for Bear, Stearns & Company, said the new offer was less than ''face value'' because it has no cash value.

The notes, which represent a reopening of the 7 3/8 percent issue the Treasury auctioned in May, brought an average yield of 7.47 percent, the same as the average yield at the May auction. **********Dealers estimated that Japanese investors purchased between $1 billion and $2 billion of the 10-year notes, or about half of the amount they are estimated to have bought at the previous sale. The extent of Japanese purchases may be more difficult to gauge than usual because Japanese securities firms have been asked by the Ministry of Finance to refrain from disclosing their bids or awards. **********Domestic Demand Also Weak **********Domestic investor interest in the 10-year notes was also lackluster. Noncompetitive bids were less than half of what they had averaged at the last 12 auctions of 10-year notes, and in competitive bidding, New York dealers were awarded a 94 percent share of the notes, compared with an average for the last 12 auctions of 86 percent. In Tuesday's bidding for $9.5 billion in three-year notes, New York dealers also absorbed a larger-than-usual share of the new issue, for which retail demand proved somewhat lighter than epredicted. **********American banks had been expected to be heavy buyers of the three-year notes, but that demand, at least at the auction, did not materialize. **********''The banks have been buying Treasury securities heavily for the past three weeks, and the presumption was that the buying would continue,'' said Robert Ried, president of Ried, Thunberg & Company, a market analysis firm based in Westport, Conn. Mr. Ried noted that with the three-year notes now down about 4/ 32 from the average auction price, dealers are already taking losses. **********''About the only reason the markets did not trade off further after the announcement of the very poor results of the 10-year notes was self-preservation,'' he said. ''With dealers holding the bulk of the three-year and 10-year issues, it would be suicidal to dump the holdings.'' Continuation of a Trend **********John Niehenke, a senior vice president at Nomura Securities, said the poor reception for the 10-year notes was largely a continuation of the lack of retail interest in the Treasury market that has been evident for several weeks. ''The question was, would the Treasury refunding stimulate any retail interest, and the answer appears to be no,'' he said. **********Mr. Niehenke attributed the light retail demand to investor uncertainty about the direction of the economy. Over the last three weeks, Government statistics have contained enough conflicting signals to support forecasts showing the economy to be weak and getting weaker, weak and getting stronger, or simply weak and likely to remain that way. **********The question facing the market today is whether the light Japanese demand for the 10-year notes means a shift in buyers' preference to the 30-year bonds. Several dealers predicted Japanese investors would buy more of the 30-year bonds than they did of the 10-year notes, but opinion was divided on whether yields for those bonds would have to rise even further. **********''I think we may have to back up to 7.65 percent to get the bonds sold,'' said E. Craig Coats Jr., the head of government bond trading at Salomon Brothers Inc. Late yesterday, the bonds were trading on a when-issued basis at 7.58 percent, and the yield has been rising steadily for the past several trading sessions. Interest in 30-Year Bonds **********William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities, said there appeared to be more Japanese interest in the 30-year bonds. ''I do not believe foreign exchange considerations are the primary factor in determining Japanese investor interest,'' he said. ''It's more a belief about what the market will do, and that's a decision any investor makes at the last minute.'' **********Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities International, said investor uncertainty about the impact of the new OPEC production agreement, along with general uncertainty about the direction of the American economy were factors contributing to the relatively light Japanese participation in the 10-year note auction. **********''From an investor's point of view, the OPEC agreement may be no news, but if it is news, it's bad news,'' Mr. Brusca said. Mr. Niehenke of Nomura said that it would be wrong to write off the 30-year bond auction based on the results of the 10-year note sale, but he said it was impossible to estimate how high the yield on the 30-year bond would have to go to insure good retail participation. ''Earlier this week, I would have said 7.50 percent would have been enough,'' he observed. **********Following are the results of the Treasury's 10-year note auction:  (000 omitted in dollar figures)          Average Price   99.316        Average Yield   7.47%        Low Price   99.248        High Yield   7.48%        High Price   99.521        Low Yield   7.44%        Accepted at low   70%        Total applied for   $19,292,212        Accepted   $9,522,657        N.Y. applied for   $17,079,546        N.Y. accepted   $8,940,446        Noncompetitive   $270,000        Interest set at   7 3/8%       The 10-year notes mature May 15, 1996."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/world/reagan-gorbachev-meeting-opens-with-plans-pursue-arms-pact-rights-issues-work.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Weinraub", "pub_date": "1986-10-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1398, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WORK UNITS SET UP", "print_headline": "REAGAN-GORBACHEV MEETING OPENS WITH PLANS TO PURSUE ARMS PACT AND RIGHTS ISSUES; WORK UNITS SET UP", "body_text": " **********President Reagan and Mikhail S.

Talks Focus on Arms Control **********United States officials said the bulk of today's talks between the two leaders focused on arms control, with Mr. Reagan expected to raise human rights and other issues Sunday, the final day of the talks. Officials described the nearly four hours of talks as ''businesslike,'' and said they were marked by friendly exchanges. **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, in announcing the working groups, said they would start meeting this evening. ''The two leaders thought it was the appropriate way that they should proceed as a result of their discussions held today,'' Mr. Speakes said. **********One group, on arms control, is headed by Paul H. Nitze, the Administration's top arms control adviser. The other group, headed by Rozanne L. Ridgway, Asssistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, will focus on human rights, bilateral and regional issues. Soviet Teams Are Named **********A spokesman for the Soviet delegation said its arms-control team was headed by Viktor P. Karpov, the negotiator in the Geneva arms talks, and the other team by Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, a Deputy Foreign Minister. **********United States officials said it was to early to make a judgment on progress in the talks, but that the mood was upbeat. **********An official indicated that the establishment of the working group was designed in large part to meet Mr. Gorbachev's concerns about coming back empty-handed from a summit in the United States. One official said Mr. Gorbachev, if he visited the United States, wanted to ''sign something,'' that would mark a substantial step forward in Soviet relations with the United States. **********It was expected that the working groups would form the basis for further discussions between the two sides in Geneva in the efforts to narrow differences between both nations on arms control. **********The members of the arms control working group, headed by Mr. Nitze, are Max M. Kampelman, special negotiator for the nuclear and space talks; Edward L. Rowny, special adviser to the President; Kenneth L. Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; Richard N. Perle, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, and Robert E. Linhard of the National Security Council. **********The members of the second group, dealing with human rights, regional and bilateral affairs, are Ms. Ridgway, Arthur Hartman, United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Peter Rodman and Jack Matlock of the National Security Council; Thomas Simons, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, and Mark Parris, director of the State Department's Office of Soviet Affairs. **********Both sides plan to meet tomorrow, and officials said tonight that it was left unclear if they would produce a statement or continue plans to meet at a future date. First Meeting in Geneva **********Last November, at their first meeting in Geneva, the two leaders said they would meet again in the United States in 1986, but the timing has been delayed because of Mr. Gorbachev's insistence that concrete results be achieved in arms control. **********In view of a mutual decision to withhold information while the talks are in progress, Mr. Speakes rebuked Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, the national security adviser, for having briefly characterized the meeting. **********In the interval between the morning and afternoon sessions, Admiral Poindexter described the talks as ''businesslike.'' When asked whether the morning session had been friendly, he tersely reiterated, ''Businesslike.'' **********When Mr. Speakes was asked later to describe the mood, he said, ''I not characterize it, and Poindexter should not have.'' **********The morning and afternoon sessions today lasted nearly four hours, with the two leaders spending considerable time alone. **********In the morning, they spent 51 minutes together, with interpreters and notetakers, before calling in their advisers. In the afternoon, the two leaders first met together with their foreign ministers, Mr. Shultz and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, from 3:34 to 5:43, Mr. Speakes said. Later Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev spent more time alone. **********The two leaders sat in leather arm chairs in a sitting room, a small table between them. Mr. Reagan faced north, with a direct view of shimmering Reykjavik Bay. Mr. Gorbachev faced a dark blue oil painting, a seascape of waves crashing onto rocks. **********Officials said Mr. Reagan planned to make the issue of long-range arms his priority in the arms control talks. **********According to aides, the President looks to an accord on deep reductions in offensive ballistic missiles and to a renewed explanation of his program for an advanced type of missile defense, a program that the Soviet Union considers destabilizing and dangerous. The Russians want to link any cuts in offensive weapons to curbs on the proposed American defense program. **********A display of good-natured friendliness marked the opening of the meeting, the first session between the two leaders since they met in Geneva. **********At 10:21 this morning, Mr. Reagan's seven-car motorcade pulled into the circular driveway in front of Hofdi House, a white stucco building overlooking Reykjavik Bay that serves as the site of the meeting. President With Folder in Hand **********The President, carrying a folder in his hand, was coatless and wearing a brown suit, brown shoes, brown tie and white shirt. He was accompanied by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, John M. Poindexter, the national security adviser, and Donald T. Regan, chief of staff. **********When Mr. Reagan was asked by a reporter whether he was ''going to give away the store,'' he replied, ''Don't own the store.'' **********Seven minutes later, Mr. Gorbachev arrived in a Soviet ZIL limousine, his hat in his hand, wearing a dark raincoat in the damp, windy breeze. The temperature hovered in the low 40's. **********When a Soviet journalist shouted, ''Mikhail Sergeyevich, what can you tell us?'' Mr. Gorbachev replied, ''You will have to wait.'' **********In a protocol mishap, the Soviet leader was kept waiting in the doorway for less than a minute, staring at his watch. Finally Mr. Reagan, the host, opened the door, looking a bit chagrined. The two men grinned and shook hands for photographers in the blustery wind. Chitchat About the Weather When Mr. Reagan was asked, what was ''the first thing'' the two were going to talk about, Mr. Reagan said, ''The weather.'' **********The morning meeting began at 10:44 and ended, as scheduled, shortly before 12:30 P.M.. At Mr. Reagan's request, the two sat at a table in the small study, overlooking the wind-swept bay and snow-draped mountains. **********The two leaders were accompanied by interpreters and by Jack F. Matlock, Mr. Reagan's adviser on Soviet affairs, who took notes for the President. At the afternoon session, the notetaker was Thomas W. Simons Jr., Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs. **********Before the morning meeting, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev also posed for photographers in a small room, separated by a table with a green plant on it. Pressure From Icelanders **********Mr. Gorbachev was telling Mr. Reagan: ''The Icelanders that we met yesterday tried to persuade me very convinciingly that we must agree on something with you, Mr. President. And I asked them, did you say the same thing to the President when you met him? And they assured me, yes, in exactly the same words.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/21/business/briefs-455486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 385, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Becton, Dickinson & Co. filed up to $200 million of debt securities. *********** Birmingham Steel Corp. is offering $25 million of 7 1/4 percent convertible subordinated debentures due in 2006 at par and 1.35 million common shares at $17 each through Robinson-Humphrey; the debentures are convertible into common at $21 a share. *********** Citicorp sold $150 million of 91-day commercial paper at an average rate of 6.766 percent, up from 6.60 percent last week, and $50 million of 182-day pape at an average rate of 6.756 percent, up from 6.519 percent. *********** Royal Bank of Canada is issuing $300 million of 99-year bonds at par through Orion Royal Bank.

[ Page D17. ]  The Quanta decision is a victory of some national importance for state environmental regulators and a defeat for creditors of bankrupt companies such as Quanta, who will be able to satisfy their claims only out of any assets left after cleanup costs have been paid. **********Dissent Cites Vagueness **********The four dissenting Justices stressed, however, that the majority's opinion was unclear as to whether a bankruptcy trustee must do a total cleanup, or only remove the most immediate hazards, before abandoning a toxic waste facility. **********The trustee for Quanta could be liable under today's ruling to reimburse New York City for about $2.5 million it spent to clean up the polychlorinated biphenals, or PCB's, that the company left at the Long Island City facility, and to clean up similar wastes that are still present at the Edgewater facility at a cost of more than $6 million. **********Quanta declared bankruptcy in 1981 while New Jersey officials were seeking to require it to clean up thousands of gallons of oil and sludge containing PCB's. It has total assets worth less than $2 million, so today's ruling could mean that nothing will be left for banks and other creditors. **********Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York hailed what he called ''this major decision,'' saying it showed that ''a financially pressed toxic waste company will not be allowed to dump its toxic waste cleanup problems on the public.'' **********The problem of companies declaring bankruptcy and seeking to abandon toxic waste dumps ''has cropped up all over New York State,'' Nathan Riley, a spokesman for Mr. Abrams, said today. **********Thomas J. O'Neill, the bankruptcy trustee, and the Midlantic National Bank, Quanta's main creditor, had argued that using the assets of bankrupts to clean up their toxic waste dumps would have the unfair effect of leaving their creditors, rather than the public at large, suffering the consequences. **********The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 authorizes bankruptcy trustees in general terms to abandon any property that is ''burdensome'' or ''of inconsequential value to the estate.'' It contains no explicit exception for toxic waste dumps or other environmental hazards. Implied Exception Seen **********But Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.'s majority opinion said there was an implied exception in the law limiting a trustee's power to contravene state health and safety regulations. **********He affirmed a Federal appellate ruling that bankruptcy courts had erred in authorizing the trustee to abandon the two sites. **********Justice Powell noted that New Jersey officials had found Quanta had violated a prohibition in its operating permit by accepting more than 400,000 gallons of oil contaminated with PCB's, a highly toxic carcinogen, and that more than 70,000 gallons of toxic, PCB-contaminated oil had been found ''in deteriorating and leaky containers'' at Long Island City. **********After a bankruptcy court in New York had authorized the trustee to abandon the Long Island City facility, Justice Powell said, ''the trustee removed the 24-hour guard service and shut down the fire-suppression system,'' presenting an immediate danger of fire or explosion. This obliged the city to decontaminate the facility, with the exception of the polluted subsoil. **********Justice Powell reasoned that the history leading to adoption of the 1978 bankruptcy law's authorization for trustees to abandon worthless properties showed Congress could not have intended to override all state health and safety regulations. **********He stressed that the abandonment power had initially been ''judicially developed,'' and that lower courts before the 1978 law had recognized an exception to protect ''legitimate state or Federal interests.'' Support for Exception Seen **********He said that the history of the 1978 law showed no intent to abolish this exception, and that various provisions of the statute and other Federal laws also supported an exception to the abandonment power to effectuate state health and safety laws, especially those involving toxic wastes. **********But Justice Powell specifically limited this ''narrow'' exception to the abandonment power, saying it only applied to state regulations ''reasonably calculated to protect the public health or safety from imminent and identifiable harm.'' **********He further qualified the Court's holding by suggesting that state laws ''so onerous as to interfere with the bankruptcy adjudication itself'' might be pre-empted. **********Justice William H. Rehnquist, in a dissent joined by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justices Byron R. White and Sandra Day O'Connor, said this limitation rendered ''the import of the Court's opinion quite unclear.'' **********He said that ''I can only speculate'' whether the majority agreed with the positions of the states of New York and New Jersey ''that abandonment can be conditioned on a total cleanup.'' He noted that this was the view of the appellate court, which the Supreme Court had affirmed somewhat ambiguously. **********Justice Rehnquist said Congress did not intend to place the states' ''interest in protecting the public fisc ahead of the claims of other creditors,'' which he said would be the effect of requiring a total cleanup as a condition of abandonment of a waste facility. **********While some requirement that bankruptcy trustees tend to pressing, immediate hazards would be justified, Justice Rehnquist argued, there was no evidence in the history of the 1978 law or prior judicial decisions of any broad rule that bankruptcy trustees cannot abandon toxic waste dumps. **********The cases decided today were Midlantic National Bank v.

McClellan that demonstrated beyond serious debate that existing law was inadequate in dealing with the illicit activities of the Mafia, particularly as the mob had taken over legitimate businesses and unions. **********The act provided not only for Government criminal and civil suits, but also private claims for treble damages for victims of specified criminal conduct involving violence, the provision of illegal goods and services, governmental and union corruption and commercial and other forms of fraud. After specific debate, Congress also decided not to limit the act to the activities of organized crime figures. Victims care little that their life savings are stolen by mobsters at gunpoint while wearing black shirts and white ties or by accountants armed with pens and dressed in Brooks Brothers' suits and white collars. Since 1970, 23 states have enacted similar laws. RICO, in short, is an idea whose time has come. **********Special pleas, particularly by segments of the accounting and securities industries, are now being heard in the courts and Congress against bringing ''racketeering'' charges, particularly involving fraud, against ''legitimate'' business people, as if ''legitimate'' business people never engaged in criminal fraud, or if they did engage in such conduct, they would be less ''racketeers'' than those whose names end with vowels. **********Similarly, dire predictions are being made of an unjustified flood of new Federal litigation, as if litigation of any proportion would be unjustified if the victims could establish their allegations. But most stridently, voices cry out that RICO is anti-business, in that it encourages the lawyers of unethical plaintiffs to file suit in hopes of obtaining quick settlements. **********Nothing could be more self-serving - or further from the truth. In fact, not all RICO suits are filed by unethical people. The International Business Machines Corporation sued Hitachi Ltd. under RICO for the theft of computer software; the suit was settled for upwards of $200 million. Other suits have been brought by such legitimate businesses as Standard Oil of Indiana, Armco Steel, the Bankers Trust Company, the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, the Allstate Insurance Company and the State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. **********Two hotly contested civil RICO appeals were decided by the Supreme Court in July 1985. At issue was whether a civil RICO had to be preceded by a successful criminal case. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, read RICO narrowly to apply only to those convicted of a crime; the court felt civil suits for fraud against such respected businesses as E.F. Hutton and Company were ''outrageous.'' The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, read RICO broadly to apply to all who violated its terms, even if they were thought to be legitimate businesses. THE Supreme Court held that **********Congress meant what it wrote in 1970, reversing the Second Circuit and affirming the Seventh Circuit; the Court also pointed out that the criminal conviction limitation would have substantial adverse impact on criminal prosecutions. The important issue now, therefore, is how, if at all, Congress itself should rewrite RICO, particularly in the fraud area. **********RICO should remain free of artificial blocks to justice. If unethical lawyers have brought frivolous suits under RICO falsely alleging fraud, they should be disciplined and, if necessary, additional remedies should be designed to deal with all kinds of frivolous litigation, not merely that under RICO. We should not compound our injury from frivolous litigation by denying victims of racketeering their own day in court. **********Fraud costs the nation upwards of $200 billion each year. Insurance fraud alone soaks the country $13.75 billion every year. Bank fraud, particularly by insiders, is also deeply disturbing. In 1980 and 1981, the failure of 105 banks and savings and loans cost $1 billion. According to a recent Congressional study, roughly one-half of the bank failures and one-quarter of the savings and loan collapses had as a major contributing factor criminal activities by insiders, few of whom were adequately sanctioned, criminally or civilly. **********In light of the allegations surrounding the failure of E.M.S. Government Securities Inc., including a paid-for false audit report, and its repercussions in the savings and loan industry and on the gold market, no one ought seriously to contend that fraud is a ''garden variety'' problem that may be ''weeded'' with business-as-usual traditional legal techniques. **********Clearly, fraud is a national problem that belongs not only in state courts, but also in the national courts along with price fixing, copyright infringement and related business offenses. No less than the integrity of the free enterprise system is at stake. **********RICO properly applies to racketeering activity, no matter who engages in it. It reflects ''one measure of wine through the realm.'' It is neither anti-business nor pro-business. It is pro-victim."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/13/business/company-news-stake-in-viacom-raised-to-8.7.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 129, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Stake in Viacom Raised to 8.7%", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Stake in Viacom Raised to 8.7%", "body_text": " **********An investment group, led by National Amusements Inc. and its chairman, Sumner M.

O'Hair at Westinghouse Defense Electronics have begun to hear about difficulties of a different sort. **********''A number of employees have been coming to us with their problems in taking care of their elderly relatives,'' Mr. O'Hair said. Seeking sources of help, the Westinghouse facility, which is in Baltimore, offered employees a two-week series of lunch-hour seminars with local, state and Federal officials and other experts. **********Similar programs have been arranged for employees at Mobil, Ciba-Geigy and Con Edison by Pathfinders/Eldercare, a Scarsdale, N.Y., counseling service. In Illinois, the Metropolitan Chicago Coalition on Aging is also setting up workplace seminars. **********The Travelers Corporation recently staged a ''care-giving fair'' in Hartford; 700 employees and representatives of 20 social agencies participated. Last month, Travelers established a care-givers support group for employees who wished to share experiences and tips. And today, the company will add care for elderly dependents at home to the flexible benefits programs in which employees can set aside part of pretax income. ''We think we can help, particularly in the area of information giving,'' said James J. Davis, vice president for personnel. **********Building on the experience at Travelers and eight other companies, the Care-givers Workplace Project of the American Association of Retired Persons is preparing guides and training programs for management and employee-assistance counselors. ''The business community is in the early stages of awareness,'' said John C. Rother, the association's legislative director. ''The oldest baby boomers turned 40 this year, which means their parents are likely to be 65 or older,'' he added. ''So management is beginning to hear from the work force, including fellow executives.'' **********Most of the 96 companies that responded to a recent survey by the New York Business Group on Health had not given much thought to this problem. But the survey itself created new awareness, said Dr. Leon J. Warsaw, the group's executive director. He cited a company that examined computer printouts of employees' telephone calls and found two categories of heavy users: ''Teen-age lovers, of course, but also people with care-giving responsibilities, who had to call home five or six times to make sure Momma turned off the stove.'' **********Travelers also surveyed its employees, most of them women, and found 20 percent of those 30 years and older were providing some form of care for an older person. Eight percent were devoting 35 or more hours a week to care-giving. Employees were not asked about morale and work performance. But the association of retired persons, the Federal Administration on Aging and the University of Bridgeport, in Connecticut, are looking at the bottom line. **********''Unanticipated lost time is the main problem,'' Dr. Warsaw said. Employees often must leave work to deal with doctors and government agencies that are only open weekdays, from 9 to 5. **********As for morale, a study of families by Elaine M. Brody of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center found that 28 percent of women who were staying home to take care of elderly mothers said they had quit work for that purpose. ''A similar percentage of those who were at work had reduced their working hours or were considering quitting,'' she said. **********At the other end of the family spectrum, 1,200 companies offer a child-care benefit - nontaxable money that employees can allot from their pay, said Dana E. Friedman of the Work and Family Information Center of the Conference Board. A few companies, like Travelers, are offering a similar benefit to employees with elderly dependents. **********Under the program, an employee can have a maximum of $100 a week in salary untaxed if the money is used for the care of an elderly, dependent relative. The Internal Revenue Service, however, has imposed narrow restrictions on this program: It has to be established by the employer. The elderly person must be a dependent and live in the employee's home. And the employee must state that he or she would otherwise have to forgo working. **********The benefit has had few takers. ''Even if universally adopted, it would meet only a small proportion of the total need,'' said Peter L. Hutchings, a partner a Kwasha Lipton, an employee benefits consulting firm in Fort Lee, N.J. **********The vast majority of services for older people are provided by their families. Seventy-eight percent of the over-85 group, sometimes known as ''the old old,'' live in their own or relatives' homes. Most of the rest are in nursing homes. ''Most of the bills are paid for by the family or from the person's resources,'' said Mrs. Brody of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center. She said employers could help by offering flexible working hours, sabbaticals in times of family crisis and day-care benefits. Dr. Friedman of the Conference Board suggests that companies could sponsor their own day-care centers for elderly adults and could also increase corporate giving to community agencies that serve the elderly. **********A number of insurance companies have been considering possible benefits for the care-givers -''at least in the think-tank stage,'' said Edward R. Shults, an assistant vice president at Metropolitan Life. ''Some companies may address this for their own retirees,'' he added. ''But it is a major uncovered area and the magnitude scares a lot of people.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/business/icahn-bids-8-billion-for-usx.html": {"writer_name": "John Crudele", "pub_date": "1986-10-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ICAHN BIDS $8 BILLION FOR USX", "print_headline": "ICAHN BIDS $8 BILLION FOR USX", "body_text": " **********Carl C. Icahn offered to acquire the USX Corporation yesterday for about $8 billion in cash. **********If he makes the purchase, Mr. Icahn will have put together the third-largest takeover in American corporate history. It would be surpassed only by the merger of Chevron and Gulf Oil in 1984 and the combination of Du Pont, the chemical company, with Conoco that same year. **********Bill Keslar, a spokesman for USX, said the company had no immediate comment on the offer, which was announced late in the afternoon. **********Interests in Steel and Oil **********USX, the former United States Steel Corporation, is an oil producer and the nation's largest steelmaker. It has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for several weeks. Mr. Icahn is a New York investor who bought Trans World Airlines last year and has turned it into a profitable operation. **********Mr. Icahn offered to pay $31 a share for USX's 257.3 million shares outstanding. He said that a group he heads had already purchased 25.4 million shares of the Pittsburgh company, about 9.8 percent of the outstanding shares. Those purchases cost $497 million. He made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that arrived in Washington just before the end of the business day. **********The move against USX comes at a time when the markets for both steel and oil have been slumping. In 1985, the company earned $409 million, or $2.56 a share, on sales of $19 billion. Diversification Efforts **********The steel industry in the United States, faced with strong foreign competition and aging plants, has seen its profits erode for years. The trend, which many experts feel is irreversible, has caused a number of steelmakers to diversify. One example was USX's acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company in 1981 for a then-record $6.5 billion. **********USX had hoped that Marathon would provide it with the earnings stability that the steel business lacked. But oil prices have dropped sharply, dipping below $10 a barrel for a time this year. **********USX is not in as much trouble as other steelmakers, some of which have been forced into bankruptcy, but the price of USX stock had declined enough to make the company attractive to a number of corporate raiders, including Mr. Icahn. **********Mr. Icahn said he had purchased 12 million of his 25.4 million USX shares before Sept. 22, the day the company announced that it planned to take steps to raise the value of its stock. **********USX was not specific about its intentions then, but Wall Street analysts suspected that the company might sell some assets and use the proceeds to purchase enough of its own shares to make its stock too expensive for corporate raiders. Others Bought Shares **********Not only was Mr. Icahn purchasing USX shares at that time, but so were T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman who is known for shaking up the oil industry in the early 1980's with his corporate raids, and Irwin L. Jacobs, the Minneapolis investor. The first to bring attention to USX, however, was the Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court, who announced in the summer that he intended to accumulate USX stock. **********Mr. Pickens and Mr. Jacobs have since sold their holdings in USX, according to Wall Street sources. The status of Mr. Holmes a Court's holdings is not known. **********In a letter yesterday to the USX board and its president, David M. Roderick, Mr. Icahn repeatedly referred to the Sept. 22 restructuring announcement by USX. The letter, which was made public through the S.E.C., stated, ''We share your belief that USX has been undervalued by the marketplace.'' **********''After reflection on your additional statements that USX's pension fund is not significantly overfunded, and noting USX's large debt burden,'' the letter said, ''it appears that an alternative to a restructuring might be the optimal way to enhance shareholder value.'' **********Mr. Icahn said he was prepared to offer such an alternative in the form of a ''friendly cash merger transaction of USX with a corporation to be formed by our group for that purpose.'' Drexel's Assurances Cited **********Mr. Icahn said that ACF Industries, a company he controls, would contribute $1 billion toward the acquisition. He said that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment firm that specializes in financing using high-yield bonds, has told him that it is confident that the additional $7 billion can be raised. **********The letter did not say whether T.W.A., which reportedly is awash in cash, would participate in the acquisition effort. **********The cash merger proposal will remain open until Oct. 22, the date by which the company said its review of restructuring alternatives would be finished. **********Even while Mr. Icahn was making his offer, he was reserving the right to pull out of the deal if the company comes up with a more attractive alternative. **********''If, in our opinion, any such alternative plan provides greater value for USX's shareholders, we will be supportive of such alternative plan unless we determine to increase our cash merger bid,'' his letter stated. Possibility of a Vote **********Mr. Icahn said that if he views the company's restructuring unfavorably, he would like both his proposal and the company's to be put to a vote of shareholders. That could help his plan, since speculators have accumulated large holdings of USX shares in recent weeks. **********Yesterday, for instance, the volume of USX stock topped 12.6 million shares in consolidated trading. The stock has had daily volume as high as 19 million shares in the recent days of heavy takeover speculation. **********The price of USX stock rose 37.5 cents yesterday, to $26.50, in New York Stock Exchange trading that was unaffected by the late announcement. It could not be determined if any of the stock that traded yesterday ended up in Mr. Icahn's hands. But Jefferies & Company, a brokerage firm favored by Mr. Icahn as well as other speculators, handled the bulk of yesterday's trading in the stock, including a block of 4 million shares that traded late in the day. **********Mr. Icahn disclosed that he had purchased 17.4 million of his shares on the open market for $17.50 to $26.25 a share. He said the largest block was 2.5 million shares bought on Oct. 1 for $25 each. **********Mr. Icahn said that if he succeeded in acquiring USX, he plans to negotiate an agreement under which the company's labor unions would receive an equity interest in the company or participate in its profits in exchange for wage reductions and other concessions. **********''Such arrangements would, in our judgment, make U.S. Steel and the domestic steel industry more competitive with foreign producers and provide greater opportunities for USX's employees,'' his letter stated. **********There has been a work stoppage at USX since midsummer by members of the steelworkers' union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/world/stockholm-east-west-pact-called-near.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1986-08-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "STOCKHOLM EAST-WEST PACT CALLED NEAR", "print_headline": "STOCKHOLM EAST-WEST PACT CALLED NEAR", "body_text": " **********Reagan Administration officials said today that recent concessions by the Soviet Union and the United States had significantly improved the chance for an East-West agreement in coming weeks on guidelines to avoid an accidental war in Europe. **********The Soviet Union has in the last two weeks accepted the principle of allowing on-site and aerial inspections of its troop formations from East Germany to the Ural Mountains. The United States has agreed to notify Moscow whenever it sends large numbers of troops for duty in Europe, the officials said. **********The two sides have also come closer to agreeing on how large a movement of troops should require one country to notify the others to avoid misundersting or misinterpretation. **********If an agreement is reached by the target date of Sept. 19, it would be the first accord related to arms control in some time. Officials here said the 35-nation Stockholm conference on European disarmament questions had always been viewed as the best hope for an early agreement of the various East-West arms-control negotiations. Important Details Remain **********A senior Administration official said he could not say an agreement was assured because there were still several important details to work out. But he said the progress made in the last two weeks was encouraging. The State Department and the Soviet press agency Tass have issued almost daily statements in the last week noting concessions made by the two sides. Some officials here said the statements were an apparent effort to encourage progress. **********American officials said the goal of the Stockholm talks was to produce a set of guidelines to reduce the chance of a serious misunderstanding or an outbreak of accidental fighting caused by unexplained movements of forces. They said an agreement should also reduce tensions in Europe. **********The talks began in January 1984 when there were severe strains in Soviet-American relations. They are nearing an end as the two sides are also close to a decision on whether to hold a second summit meeting this year The latest round, the concluding one, began on Aug. 19, officials said. **********Negotiations are also now under way on drafting an East-West statement pledging the various parties not to use force to settle disputes. This so-called non-aggression agreement has been sought by Moscow, and President Reagan has said the United States would agree if the accord included concrete measures accepted by both sides in Stockholm. **********American officials said the language being drafted is drawn largely from the United Nations Charter, which also bars the use of aggression and encourages peaceful settlement of disputes, and from the previous language agreed to in the Helsinki agreement of 1975 on security and cooperation in Europe. **********The United States delegation is headed by Ambassador Robert L. Barry. The Soviet side is headed by Oleg A. Grinevsky. Follow-Up to Helsinki **********The Stockholm conference is a follow-up to Helsinki and to an accord reached in Madrid in 1983. At Helsinki, the 35 nations agreed to notify the others before military exercises were held in Europe involving more than 25,000 soldiers. But the definition of Europe included only the westernmost 150 miles of the Soviet Union with the rest of Eastern and Western Europe. **********The Russians now agree to permit the more customary definition, from the Urals to the western frontier. No concession was given by the United States in return. **********The Western allies, saying 25,000 was too large a figure, initially called for a notification threshold of half a division, or 6,000 troops. The Western allied proposal called for notification 45 days before the start of each year of what kinds of maneuvers would be held during that year. **********In addition the West wanted further notification 45 days before any movement outside a garrison by more than a half of a division. Concessions by Russians **********The Soviet side initially agreed only to lower the troop movement figure to 20,000. More recently, the Russians have agreed to drop the total to 18,000, officials said. The West has said it will raise its figure above 6,000, and a compomise of about 12,000, about one division, seems possible, officials said. **********On the key question of verification, two weeks ago, Moscow, for the first time, agreed to on-site inspection of its troops. But it has proposed allowing only one or two a year. **********The Western nations are proposing that each member of the conference be allowed one inspection of another's troops a year. That would give the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization up to 16 inspections of each Soviet-bloc nation. The Warsaw Pact has only seven members, which would give it fewer chances to make inspections. Officials said talks were going on now on setting another number, which will presumably be between 7 and 16. **********The Soviet side also agreed two days ago to allow aerial inspections of its troops to monitor its compliance with the accord. But Moscow has proposed that the observation planes be those of the nation being inspected, although the observer would be from another nation. The West has countered by saying that a neutral nation's plane should be used. **********The notification agreement does not require any government to say when it is sending forces to Europe on the way elsewhere. Thus, American forces being sent to the Middle East by way of bases in Europe would not be disclosed, officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/08/business/key-rates-665486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/09/business/company-news-rockwell-to-buy-electronics-corp.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Rockwell to Buy Electronics Corp.", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Rockwell to Buy Electronics Corp.", "body_text": " **********The Rockwell International Corporation said that its Allen-Bradley Company subsidiary had agreed to buy the Electronics Corporation of America for $52 a share, or $99 million. **********Separate agreements call for Rockwell and Allen-Bradley to pay the same price for a total of 644,000 shares, or 35 percent of the 1.9 million shares outstanding, from Arthur G.B.

Shultz. **********At the urging of the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and other senators from hard-hit farm states, the Senate on Tuesday amended a bill on the Export-Import Bank to lift a ban on subsidized agricultural sales to China and the Soviet Union. The two countries have been major purchasers in the past of American grain, but subsidies are prohibited. **********The House version of the bill does not include the provision on subsidies, and the issue is being discussed in a House-Senate conference. **********Australia Reacts Strongly **********Concerned that such subsidies would cut into its annual grain sales of $500 million to those countries, the Australian Government has reacted strongly. Foreign Minister William G. Hayden said on Thursday that if the Senate bill became law, it could lead to public pressure in Australia to renounce American use of bases in Australia. **********Mr. Shultz entered the debate today when he told reporters that he was ''very upset'' by the Dole bill. He said that under no circumstances should the United States subsidize sales to the Soviet Union. **********''I think it is ridiculous,'' he said. ''I don't think it makes any sense, and it is wrong.'' U.S. Hypocrisy Is Charged **********Mr. Shultz said that Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia telephoned him on Thursday to express his indignation at length. **********He said Mr. Hawke, whose Government is a close ally of the United States, said it was hypocritical of the United States to consider subsidized grain sales when it was urging small Pacific nations not to extend fishing rights to the Soviet Union. **********It was unclear whether the Australians might go so far as to challenge American bases over the trade issue. The United States is already at odds with New Zealand, the third member of the South Pacific alliance known as Anzus, over nuclear issues. As a result, the United States has relied even more heavily in recent months on its continued military ties with Australia. **********Mr. Hayden said on Thursday that he did not think the dispute over grain would lead to a formal break in the alliance, but he added, ''I have had guys in North Queensland, in the sugar area, engaged in a number of public meetings, and I was struck by the number of farmers who said in a very hostile fashion, 'Why doesn't the Government use these joint facilities as leverage against the Americans to get a decent deal for us?' '' Agreement With Allies **********Moreover, Mr. Shultz said, the United States had an agreement with its European allies, stemming from an earlier dispute over trade with Moscow, that none of them would subsidize trade with the Communist bloc. **********The issue goes beyond the problem of subsidized grain. Under the existing Export Enhancement Program, the United States provides exporters of agricultural goods with funds in such a way that it allows them to undercut competitors. **********This has already provoked disputes with Thailand, which has complained that American rice exporters were taking away a large portion of their export market, and with the Philippines, which has had difficulty competing with American sugar exports, Mr. Shultz said today. **********''There is a clear fallout in our foreign affairs of all of these things that are going on in the agricultural field,'' he said. **********''Our sugar program is devastating to traditional suppliers of sugar to us, like the Philippines,'' he said. ''Our rice program has caused tremendous strains in our relations with the Thais. And this program has upset people no end.'' Officials to Meet in August **********Mr. Shultz will meet with Mr. Hayden in San Francisco on Aug. 10 and 11, along with the defense secretaries of both countries, for what used to be the annual meeting of the Anzus pact countries. But because of a dispute with New Zealand, the third member of the treaty organization, over its refusal to allow nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships to enter its ports, only Australia and the United States will be at the meeting. **********The grain issue will probably be discussed by the two sides then, American officials said today. **********On Thursday, the State Department criticized Australia for even raising the possibility of linking the use of the bases with the trade issue. **********Mr. Hayden said, ''We are gravely concerned about this latest development.'' **********''It is putting great pressure on the sort of price we are able to get for our grain products, and that means with a serious trade account and current account problem, we are not getting the sort of income we might otherwise get,'' he said. ''Now, these are the things we have got to make quite clear to America. We have made them clear. But we will have to make them clearer.'' Pressure for Subsidies **********American farm-state leaders are pushing for the subsidy program for the Soviet Union in order to reduce the price-depressing domestic surpluses and to increase foreign sales. **********Because of what it regarded as discrimination by the United States, the Soviet Union has sharply cut its purchases. Mr. Dole has asserted that since the Soviet Union has been the leading buyer of American grain, American farmers should be permitted the subsidies to allow them to compete for the Soviet market. **********The decline in American farm exports over the last five years is viewed by experts as the primary reason for the depressed state of American agriculture."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/22/business/business-people-chairman-to-resign-after-mgm-sale.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 395, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Chairman to Resign After MGM Sale", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chairman to Resign After MGM Sale", "body_text": " **********Frank Rothman said yesterday that he would resign as chairman and chief executive of the MGM/UA Entertainment Company upon the closing of the sale of MGM to the Turner Broadcasting Company.

Many said that CBS would have considerable difficulty in coming weeks in defending itself against irate stockholders looking for a chance to make a killing on their investment. **********Wyman Said to Be Approached **********In a brief statement, the Denver executive said he had made his offer to CBS's management ''both verbally and in writing.'' **********He gave only sparse details, but insiders said that Mr. Davis spoke directly with Thomas H. Wyman, chairman of CBS, last Wednesday in Mr. Wyman's Manhattan office. The two had met there late last month when Mr. Davis is understood to have offered only $150 a share. Within the next 48 hours, CBS stock had jumped almost $20 a share. CBS said at the time that it knew of no corportae developments to account for the rise. **********CBS stock edged up $1, to $147, in heavy trading yesterday, soaring as high as $151.50. CBS stock had advanced almost $6 on Monday. **********William Lilley 3d, spokesman for CBS, commenting before Mr. Davis's announcement, refused to say whether Mr. Davis had approached the company. He maintained only that CBS wanted to remain independent and was not negotiating to be acquired. **********Also before Mr. Davis's announcement, Mr. Wyman had said: ''Our view today is no different than it was in 1985. We intend to pursue our goals as an independent company.'' **********''After careful study,'' Mr. Davis said, ''we determined to submit an offer to acquire all of the shares of CBS Inc. for cash at $160 a share.'' **********He added, ''We told CBS that our offer was not subject to financing and that we intended to retain current management following the acquisition.'' **********''We also told CBS,'' Mr. Davis went on, ''we would only proceed on a friendly, negotiated basis.'' **********''Today,'' he said, ''we received a letter from CBS rejecting our offer and stating the company's desire to remain independent.'' Concerns Over News Division **********In an effort to satisfy concerns that prompted Dan Rather, the anchorman for ''The CBS Evening News,'' to try last year to buy the news division, Mr. Davis told Mr. Wyman that he was prepared to have Edward Bennett Williams, his special counsel, set up procedures to insure the news division's independence and integrity. **********Mr. Davis is also understood to have offered Mr. Wyman and other CBS senior executives an opportunity to buy a stake in the company, possibly between 5 and 15 percent. **********As contemplated, the deal would have provided for Mr. Davis and Prudential to invest about $500 million each, to be raised through bond sales, with the rest to be financed by banks, insurance companies and other lenders. **********Generally when executives bid for companies the offers are conditioned on getting the financing that is needed. But in this instance Mr. Davis indicated that he had the funds lined up. **********A spokesman for Mr. Davis declined comment on his next step. Traders said they thought Mr. Davis would probably watch developments for a few days and most likely withdraw the offer. Other Avenues May Be Studied **********Mr. Davis, a former owner of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, is also reported to be pursuing other entertainment avenues. Sources close to Ted Turner, the Atlanta broadcasting executive, said Mr. Davis met yesterday with Mr. Turner at Drexel Burnham Lambert's Los Angeles offices. The sources said the two discussed Mr. Davis's possible purchase of the motion picture studio of the MGM/UA Entertainment Company, which Mr. Turner has just acquired. **********Sources close to CBS said that CBS directors, including Laurence A. Tisch, head of the Loews Corporation, were unreceptive to Mr. Davis's offer. Mr. Tisch, who could not be reached for comment, is regarded as crucial to CBS's future. Loews owns about 12 percent of CBS and plans to raise that to 25 percent. **********Sizing up Mr. Tisch and Mr. Davis, Wall Street professionals said that while both were extremely wealthy, the betting was that Mr. Davis would not go against Mr. Tisch. Barriers to Participation **********If Mr. Davis were to team up with others in a hostile bid, many stockholders might support him. But some big holders could be unable or unwilling to join in a Davis group. **********Some 250 financial institutions own two-thirds of CBS stock, according to Standard & Poor's. Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager, owns almost 5 percent but under an agreement with CBS is barred from joining any takeover group. The Fisher real estate interests of New York, which almost made a bid for CBS, have had a nearly 5 percent stake but are believed to have no involvement with Mr. Davis. The Belzbergs of Canada and Jamie Securities of New York, which had a similar position, are thought to have disposed of much of it. **********One trader said that because of the high price being paid for broadcast properties, he placed CBS's breakup value at $172 a share, up sharply from estimates only a few months ago. On that basis, he said, he thought the company might be worth $155 to $160 a share to some buyer. Another reason for the high price, some said, was that CBS had bought back almost a fourth of its stock, or 6.4 million shares, last year, trimming stock outstanding to only 23.4 million shares. **********The nearly $1 billion buyback, part of a defense against a takeover attempt last year by Mr. Turner, was intended to buoy the stock price and reduce tension by eliminating troublesome stockholders."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/world/around-the-world-west-germans-throng-to-anti-nuclear-concert.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "West Germans Throng To Anti-Nuclear Concert", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; West Germans Throng To Anti-Nuclear Concert", "body_text": " **********Tens of thousands of West Germans and Austrians descended on this Bavarian hamlet today for a two-day rock concert to protest nuclear power. **********The event was organized by local activists with the backing of national parties of the left, including the Greens, the Communist Party and the youth wing of the Social Democrats. **********The concert was staged on a grassy field about 20 miles from the village of Wackersdorf, where West Germany is building a $3 billion installation to process spent nuclear fuel. **********Wackersdorf has become a symbol of resistance to nuclear energy, particularly since the Chernobyl accident in April, and has emerged recently as a minor irritant in normally cordial relations between Bonn and Vienna.

From their multi-story headquarters, relics of a more gracious and less hectic era, the department stores are restructuring operations, paring down their organizations, weeding out some product lines, spotlighting others - in other words, entering the leaner, more responsive world of specialty retailing. A number have even spun off specialty-store chains - many, but not all of them, in the fast-churning apparel field.

On one flank are the discount stores, which cannot rival the large retailers for service, but can undercut their prices on such commodities as toys, sporting goods and large household appliances. On the other flank are the specialty stores, which cannot compete in range of products but can offer a higher level of service, greater depth in a limited range of merchandise and quicker responsiveness to trends.

Levy, a New York retail marketing consultant. **********''Consumers are reacting positively to those stores that have filled their particular niche of demand, whether it's product, age or life style.'' The specialty boom, he suggested, is a result of consumers' dissatisfaction with stores that have much the same product and present it in much the same way. ''In a society where one has all the options in the world,'' he said, ''the specialists are taking over.'' **********Specialization does not guarantee success, of course. Woolworth's, after losing $9 million in 1984 on its J. Brannam off-price apparel chain, closed the stores last year. The U.S. Shoe Corporation, which operates a number of apparel specialty chains including Casual Corner, Ups 'N Downs, T.H. Mandy and J. Riggings, overexpanded and had to shut down 67 different units as well as its entire Proving Ground men's wear chain. **********And while specialty stores can soar faster than the department stores, they can crash to earth faster, too. **********Philip Schlein of U.S. Venture Partners (See box), which is investing in nine separate chains, suggested that the Banana Republic division of The Gap stores might find itself in trouble in five years unless it changes its product mix. ''The casual clothes, safari style, are fine,'' he said, ''but it could be a short cycle.'' **********Still, the arguments in favor of at least some specialization are compelling. Retailing experts note that specialty stores tend to operate more efficiently than department stores, with fewer levels of management; while department stores have large consumer credit departments, for example, specialty stores can offer credit without policing it, thanks to widespread bank credit cards. Because specialty stores concentrate on a handful of merchandise areas that they can move quickly, they have a higher rate of turnover - a critical measure of retailing success. The advent of the suburban mall and the strip center, with their multiple stores, has helped bring in traffic. By contrast, many of the big stores, burdened with unproductive space, have reduced the size of their urban stores and are beginning to lease space to specialty retailers as a means of slashing overhead and increasing profits. **********It is difficult to make strict financial comparisons between department and specialty stores, which tend to be younger and, thus, to show more impressive growth rates. Even so, the numbers are instructive. Over a five-year period through 1985, sales of publicly owned apparel specialty chains rose an average of 21.3 percent annually, compared with publicly owned department stores' 9.1 percent, according to Alex. Brown & Sons, a Baltimore brokerage. Net income of the specialty stores rose at an average annual rate of 18.4 percent, against 17.3 percent for the bigger stores. From 1984 to 1985, specialty stores' profits were 4 percent of sales, department stores were 3 percent. In the same year, returns on assets and net worth were significantly higher for the specialty businesses. **********Admittedly, this is not the first time that specialized retailers have outperformed the department stores, or that the big stores have noticed that small can be beautiful. Thirty years ago, they sprouted so-called ''twig'' stores, almost within view of their major suburban branches, that were miniature versions of the bigger stores. Instead of increasing total sales, the twigs weakened the branches. Twenty years ago, big department store chains tried a more profitable tack, buying up elite specialty chains devoted to apparel. For example, Carter Hawley Hale, the Associated Dry Goods Corporation and Federated Department Stores acquired, respectively, Neiman-Marcus, Lord & Taylor and I. Magnin. **********Now May Department Stores, in pursuit of Lord & Taylor, which it plans to roll out nationally, is merging with Associated. **********And over the years - and increasingly, of late - many large retailers have stripped themselves of lower-producing departments or those most prone to price-cutting competition. These include toys (except during the Christmas season), sporting goods, major appliances, pharmaceuticals, tailored men's clothing, hats and food, except for candy and cookies. **********But many of the department stores changed too little, or too late. Most of Gimbels's 36 department stores have closed, with the holdouts running going-out-of-business sales before being taken over by other companies and real estate developers. Ohrbach's will be gone by early next year. The John Wanamaker chain, one of America's oldest retailers, has been put up for sale by its owners, Carter Hawley Hale. The Wieboldt stores in Chicago, operating under new ownership, met with creditors last week to seek a settlement of long-standing debt. And stretching behind them all is a long line of retailing ghosts: Korvettes, Goldblatt's, Two Guys, Best and Company, S. Klein, Franklin Simon. **********The big stores' newest plunge into specialty retailing is deeper and probably more enduring, because the stakes are higher. Walter F. Loeb, a retail analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company, predicts that as many as one-third of today's department stores will not see the end of the century. For those bent on survival, specialization has become the key. J.C. **********Penney has in effect become an apparel specialty business after dropping its major household durables and automobile service business. The K Mart Corporation is concentrating on fewer departments in its exisiting stores, and has also acquired or started up several specialty-store chains. **********While Sears, the nation's largest retailer, is known primarily for its 799 general merchandise stores and 2,361 catalogue sales offices and agents, it also operates 250 specialty stores, which include separate chains selling business systems, paint and hardware and surplus merchandise. Each of the chains is being increased in number because, said Edward Brennan, the company's chief executive officer, ''Specialty stores continue to be an attractive opportunity for growth.'' **********Sears deepened its commitment to specializing two years ago when its spawned its so-called ''Store of the Future,'' with 285 stores converted from traditional Sears outlets. The stores spotlight certain higher-turnover departments, such as apparel, home furnishings, electronics and sporting goods. Unlike the typically utilitarian Sears stores, the ''stores of the future'' are brightly lighted, showy places with departments of related merchandise positioned near each other to encourage shoppers to cross over and buy. Sears labels the concept ''a program aimed at enhancing the shopping experience,'' but it is clearly a specialty store approach - and it is paying off. ''The 'store of the future' is exceeding the others by 4 percent in sales growth, and gross margins are up 0.4 percent, which we consider quite good,'' a company spokesman said. **********And despite its unhappy experience with J. Brannam, none of the retailing giants has jumped more enthusiastically into specialty retailing than the F. W. Woolworth Company. The erstwhile variety merchant today operates 4,200 stores in 28 different specialties; next month it will add its 29th, Face Fantasies, a low-priced cosmetics chain. Some of its specialty chains, such as Kids Mart and Athletic Shoe Factory, were acquired by Woolworth's, but many others, such as the Afterthoughts custom jewelry and accessory boutiques, are offshoots of the most productive departments in the Woolworth variety and the Kinney Shoe stores. Foot Locker, which sells athletic footwear, was developed in the mid-1970's and has turned into a resounding success with more than 774 stores - 155 more than last year - expected in operation by the end of the year. A spinoff, Lady Foot Locker, opened three years ago, has 210 stores and is growing. **********Last year specialty stores accounted for 33 percent of Woolworth's total sales of $5.9 billion and 50 percent of profits, and their contribution to both areas is expected to outpace the traditional variety stores'. John W. Lynn, Woolworth's chairman, said that the specialty stores last year represented 68 percent of the company's total sales increase and 70 percent of its operating income gain. **********''Specialty stores provide greater sales per square foot and higher profit margins and return on investment than do general merchandise stores,'' he said. Recently Woolworth created a six-member chairman's group to supervise its move into specialty stores as well as its established businesses. Montgomery Ward, owned by the **********Mobil Corporation, is taking a double-barreled aim at the specialty business. Last week in Parkersburg, W. Va., it opened its first specialty-store prototype, tentatively named ''Focus.'' The 65,000-square-foot store, an old Ward's outlet, concentrates on apparel, home furnishings, appliances and electronics, but has discontinued such departments as home care, lawn-and-garden and home services like central air-conditioning, plumbing, electrical and fence installations. After a test period, a Ward's spokesman said, the company will decide whether to open additional ''Focus'' units. **********And next month, a store in Gaithersburg, Md., that Ward's closed last year, will be reopened as a joint operation with Toys 'R' Us, the highly successful toy chain. Although the store will have a common entrance, it will be split between Ward's and Toys, Ward's tenant. ''Many of their customers are the same as ours, 15-to-40-year-olds in middle-income families, and we will both gain in traffic from the combination,'' said Bernard F. Brennan, Ward's president and chief executive. He added that Ward's is ''contemplating 20 such stores with Toys 'R' Us. We are also reviewing the possibility of working out similar arrangements, to accommodate our excess store space, with other specialty-store operators.'' **********The same pairing is taking place on a more rarefied level: B. Altman & Company, the New York department store chain, has invited F.A.O. **********Schwarz, the toy chain, to set up shop in its seven stores, starting with the Manhattan flagship. And if Ward's and Altman's experiments pay off, it is likely that other combinations that were once unthinkable will become common as retailers seek profits from specialization. In the next several years, said Fred E. Wintzer Jr., retailing analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons, ''most mature retailers will face an environment of slower growth, market saturation, intense competition, fragmented specialized consumer markets, rising resource costs and accelerating technological advancements. **********''This environment will be hostile to mature retail sectors such as department stores, supermarkets, discount stores and others,'' he added, but ''it will create immense opportunities for all sorts of new retail concepts during the next 15 years.''  SHARINGTHE RISKS  Though some of the nation's well-heeled department store chains are making forays into specialty stores, the field is still primarily the realm of entrepreneurs and private investors. Among the latter, one active player is U.S. Venture Partners of San Francisco, which in the past year has invested in the start-up of nine separate specialty chains. **********Perhaps it is fitting, given current trends in retailing, that the man spearheading the venture capital firm's entry into specialty stores is a veteran department store executive, Philip S. Schlein. Last year Mr. Schlein resigned as chairman and chief executive of Macy's California, the West Coast operation of R.H. Macy & Company, after a 27-year career there. His departure was precipitated by a dispute with Edward S. Finkelstein, Macy's chief executive officer, over the direction of the California division. **********These days the 52-year-old retailer is a convert to the specialty-store faith. ''Customers are learning to feel more comfortable in specialty stores that give them more service and are more focused in merchandise,'' he said. ''These are the great opportunities for growth in the next decade.'' According to Mr. Schlein, the venture capital community today has ''a high level of interest'' in specialty stores. **********As the lead investor in each of the new retail companies, U.S. Venture Partners antes up between $1.5 million and $3 million. ''We bring in management and give them at least a 20 percent investment in the business,'' Mr. Schlein said. If and when the company turns a profit, he added, ''it has the option of being sold or going public.'' **********U.S. Venture Partners' investments include Home Express, a ''value- and fashion-oriented home-furnishings'' retailer, which has opened its first store in Milbrae, Calif.; Craftmart, a crafts, custom frames and needlepoint goods merchant with four stores in California; C.S. Brods, an educational toy chain, also with four stores in California; Karen Austin, a petite-size sportswear retailer with shops in Owings, Md., and Corde Madeira, Calif., and Casey & Osh, which sells private-label sportswear for men and women, and is scheduled shortly to open its first store, in Atlanta. **********In the case of Karen Austin, several of the investors and members of management were middle-level executives in the Macy's organization who resigned to join the new venture.

Traders largely ignored the announcement of the cut in Japan's discount rate, which was reduced a half point, to 3.5 percent. **********''If today's credit market appeared to ignore the positive aspects of the cut in the Japanese discount rate, it was because the move was widely expected and already factored into the pricing structure,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds. Factory Orders Climb **********''Perhaps more important - and highly negative - was the sharp 3.4 percent rise in September factory orders reported by the Government this morning,'' he said, referring to a Commerce Department report. **********Mr. Sullivan said that while the credit market was focused on next week's record refunding, many money managers were also watching gold bullion prices. ''If gold drops below the $400 level, it will be considered most friendly for all fixed-income securities,'' he said, ''especially if oil prices remain steady or move lower, because both gold and oil are watched as barometers of inflation.'' **********The cash price of gold was down $4.50 an ounce, to $403.50, in New York at 4 P.M. yesterday. **********In late trading on a when-issued basis yesterday, the 3-year notes to be auctioned on Tuesday traded at a yield of 6.44 percent; the 10-year notes slated for sale Wednesday, at 7.26 percent; and the new 30-year bonds that will be offered Thursday traded at a yield of 7.47 percent. Secondary Market **********Meanwhile, late trading of intermediate Treasury coupon issues in the secondary market showed the offered price of the 6 3/8 percent notes due in 1988 down 3/32, at 100 9/32, for a yield of 6.22 percent; the 6 5/8 percent issue due in 1989 rose 3/32, to 100 14/32, to yield 6.45 percent; the new 7 1/8 percent issue due in of 1993 dropped 10/32, to 100 6/32, to yield 7.09 percent. **********Among the longer maturities, the 7 3/8 percent notes of 1996 fell 9/32, to 100 11/32, for a yield of 7.32 percent; the 9 3/8 percent bonds due in 2006 rose 8/ 32, to 115 6/32, and yield 7.83 percent, and the current bellwether long bond, the 7 1/4 percent issue due in May 2116, fell 5/32, at 95 26/32, and now yield 7.61 percent, down sharply from 7.76 percent a week ago. **********In the corporate bond market, meanwhile, falling borrowing costs prompted more offerings yesterday. This week, some $4.2 billion of corporate bonds were sold, compared with $2.2 billion last week, according to Lindley B. Richert, chief market analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, a credit research firm. **********Yesterday's major corporate offerings included $150 million of J. C. Penney Company's non-callable seven-year notes. The First Boston Corporation led the underwriting group that sold the 8 3/4 percent notes at 99.50, to yield investors 8.45 percent, or 1.17 percentage points above comparable Treasury debt issues. **********Merrill Lynch Capital Markets headed a group offering $100 million of Mobil Corporation five-year non-callable notes.

Karson, director of the life and health insurance industry's Center for Corporate Public Involvement. **********The Baltimore meeting will be followed by others in major cities in coming months, each aiming to meet human-service needs as Federal budget cutbacks continue. Priority Issues **********The center's emphasis on what it considers priority issues is keeping with a trend among some, but not a majority, of large companies to increase contributions to human-service programs that help the nation's needy. **********A survey of 330 major companies released yesterday by The Conference Board, a business research organization, found that one-third of those companies had already shifted their human-service programs to emphasize food, clothing, housing and other basic needs. **********Four out of ten companies said they planned to devote an increased share of their giving to new areas in human service - domestic violence and child abuse; drug and alcoholism, and support programs aimed at helping the elderly. Majority Favor Education **********However the majority of the companies said they planned to maintain their giving patterns, which traditionally have favored educational causes when it comes to deciding how to allocate their charitable spending. **********In fact, the survey showed that although more dollars from corporations were going to human services as well as other categories of giving, the percentage of total corporate contributions for health and human services continued a downward trend begun in 1976. **********''Companies say they want to be compassionate, but they do not want to end up 'owning' this country's human-services problems,'' said Kathryn Troy, author of the Conference Board study. ''While some are redirecting their contribution efforts, many resent being pulled into large-scale social service investments.'' Government Responsibility **********She said the responses to the survey indicated that a number of corporate leaders believed business was being asked to finance programs that were the government's responsibility, and some said it was time for a broad national debate about the division of responsibilities. **********The companies in the study were not identified, but in interviews several corporate leaders agreed with the sentiment indicated by the study. **********The growing recognition that business cannot substitute for government ''is pleasing to me,'' said William S. Woodside, chairman and chief executive of the American Can Company, adding: ''I'm beginning to get the impression my peers don't sidle away and regard me as a Typhoid Mary because I say we must have more Federal funds to resolve social problems.'' 'Private Sector Can Help' **********''I'm delighted to see the business community much more involved in helping to combat hunger and poverty, and it makes a difference in the way they see their role in the community,'' he continued. ''The private sector can help, but the basic leadership, commitment and funding must come from government. It is unconscionable to expect business to provide funds of the magnitude supplied in the past by government in areas of major social concern to the entire United States.'' **********American Can, mainly through its foundation, increased charitable contributions this year to $4 million, which included support for Washington-based organizations that measure the impact of Federal budget cuts on the needy. **********The American Telephone and Telegraph Company intends to increase support for social services and economic development, said Reynold Levy, president of the A.T.&T. Foundation and a corporate vice president. 'What is Government's Role? ' **********''There is no question a debate is looming on about what Federal responsibility entails,'' he said. ''The Reagan Administration has succeeded from its inception in encouraging the private sector to support the delivery of social services, the arts and education, and the data show this, but the pendulum can swing only so far. When the private sector feels it is being asked to fulfill very basic needs, the question arises 'What is the government's role and where do the tax dollars go?' '' **********The Weyerhaeuser Company has had to cut its corporate contributions by 25 percent in the last year, despite the pressing needs for emergency help for food, medical aid and housing in the isolated and rural areas where the forest products concern operates, said Mary Stewart Hall, vice president of the company's foundation. Consequently, Weyerhaeuser cut its contributions to research for industry related fields, such as enivironmental development. **********''There needs to be a sorting out of responsibility and I think we will be seeing it increasingly at the state and local level,'' Mrs. Hall said. ''We don't expect it at the national level.'' G.E. Increases Contributions **********The General Electric Company is putting increasing emphasis on human services, and the company increased total contributions to $6.2 million last year from $3.9 million in 1980, said Paul M. Ostergard, the foundation's president. A new gift-matching program was recently introduced to encourage giving by employees to agencies serving the disadvantaged. **********James D. Robinson 3d, chairman and chief executive of the American Express Company and chairman of United Way's Board of Governors, predicted that corporations would continue to increase commitments for human services.

Aquino Jr., General Fabian C. Ver continues to receive the tacit support of his cousin and patron, President Ferdinand E. Marcos, despite strong American pressure to remove the general as Chief of Staff of the armed forces. **********The general, who turned 66 years old today, told troops assembled for a birthday ceremony that ''as a good soldier, I have always indicated my readiness to retire.'' It was a restatement of the stand he has taken from the start. **********But Mr. Marcos, who relies heavily on the general as his link to the military, has remained evasive about his plans for the future of General Ver. **********Mr. Marcos told reporters last Tuesday that the general ''might wish to retire before the election,'' which is scheduled for Feb. 7. **********Pressed as to whether he meant ''might or will,'' the President continued to leave the door open with the brief reply, ''He will probably.'' In recent days the President has made new reference to internal problems that could make it difficult for him to remove his cousin and trusted supporter. Rumors on Retirement or Leave **********There were strong rumors in Manila that the general would retire today, and other rumors persist that he will at least take a leave of absence during the election, to avoid hints of partisanship. But similar rumors have come and gone constantly since the general, who took a leave of absence during his trial, was reinstated on the day of his acquittal last Dec. 2. **********The general remains the most powerful military officer in the Philippines and has maintained a high profile as he travels the country overseeing a reorganization of the military and joining Mr. Marcos at campaign appearances. **********Meanwhile, the public pressure from Washington that reached a crescendo when General Ver was reinstated has become muted. A member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said on Sunday that he had met with Mr. Marcos but had not mentioned General Ver. **********At a news conference Sunday, Ambassador Stephen W. Bosworth of the United States declined to say that the removal of General Ver was a specific American priority. Symbol of Professional Military **********The general has become a symbol of the need to professionalize the Philippine armed forces, where promotions often come on the basis of loyalty to President Marcos. **********The day after General Ver was reinstated, the widow of Mr. Aquino, Corazon C. Aquino, announced her candidacy for president and is now challenging Mr. Marcos in the election. **********At the time of the reinstatement of General Ver, President Marcos responded to American criticism by saying that he was committed to reinstaing the general but that the reinstatement would probably be temporary. **********American officials have since said they had received assurances that the general would soon leave his post. **********A lawyer for the general, Antonio P. Coronel, said in an interview Sunday that he had known all along that General Ver would not be removed from his post. **********''There is no indication he is going to be eased out,'' Mr. Coronel said. ''I never believed Ver would be removed, but I couldn't talk about it before.'' Ver Is No Issue in Campaign **********Mr. Coronel also noted the easing of pressure on Mr. Marcos to remove General Ver. ''Nobody talks about it now. For the last two weeks I haven't seen anything in print.'' He noted that the removal of the general had not become an issue in the election campaign. **********He also noted that no move had been made to reconsider the acquittal of General Ver and his 25 co-defendants and that the decision had therefore become final. **********Mrs. Aquino has said that if she is elected president, she will probably reopen the case. **********''Double jeopardy has now set in,'' Mr. Coronel said. ''I do not believe there is any legal measure under which Ver could be brought to trial again in connection with the Aquino-Galman case.'' **********Rolando C. Galman, who was shot dead on the tarmac of Manila International Airport, was said by the military to have been the assassin. The court upheld this view in its verdict. **********''The question of how Aquino died and who killed him is now settled legally,'' Mr. Coronel said. ''Even if you consider the remote possibility that evidence might crop up to prove some other means by which Aquino was slain, and to identify his assassin, that would only be a historial footnote.'' Major Overhaul of Armed Forces **********Immediately after the general was acquitted, Mr. Marcos assigned him to oversee what he said would be a top-to-bottom reorganization of the military. The first moves of General Ver were to promote officers who had stood by him in the period he was on trial. **********In an interview two weeks later, Mr. Marcos indicated that a split had developed in the military between the supporters of General Ver and those of his deputy, Gen. Fidel C. Ramos, and that this split could delay any reassignment of his Chief of Staff. **********Last Friday he raised a new issue that he said could delay the removal of General Ver: a charge by members of a fact-finding board that General Ramos had covered up the role of the military in a massacre at the town of Escalante in which 21 civilian demonstrators died. **********Mr. Marcos told an American television interviewer that the question of removing the general was ''not a matter which should be intervened by any foreign power like the United States.'' He added, ''But I can tell you that we are taking all the steps necessary to protect the Philippine national interest.'' Marcos Says Obstacles Block Shift **********In the interview, with John McLaughlin of a Washington public television station, Mr. Marcos added, ''There are many obstacles to the shift right now because General Ramos is being involved in the Escalante charges.'' He did not explain why this accusation had a bearing on the disposition of General Ver. **********In his statement to reporters today, Mr. Marcos said ''there is a plan'' that General Ramos, as commander of the Philippine constabulary forces, would oversee all troops involved in the election and that ''General Ver would have nothing to do with anything about the election.'' **********He said the reason for this ''is apparently the foreign elements, the United States for instance, believe that General Ramos is someone that can be depended upon.'' **********General Ver, however, remains in overall command of the military, and Western diplomats say they believe Mr. Marcos will want to keep his most trusted officer in place in case he needs to call on the military in the election period. **********Two of the sons of General Ver are colonels in the presidential security command."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/09/business/thrift-regulator-apologizes.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1986-12-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1147, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THRIFT REGULATOR APOLOGIZES", "print_headline": "THRIFT REGULATOR APOLOGIZES", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board apologized to Congress today for permitting large amounts of travel and personal expenses incurred by him and other bank board officials to be paid by organizations within the thrift industry, which he regulates. **********Some operating expenses of the bank board were also reimbursed, bringing the total to millions of dollars. **********''The purpose of this letter to you is to apologize for my own flawed judgments relating to bank board travel expenses during my tenure as chairman,'' Edwin J.

The bank board oversees the industry, including the regional banks, and insures deposits up to $100,000 through the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. Both the bank board and the regional banks were created by Congress 50 years ago. **********''In retrospect, I can only say that I should have paid significantly greater attention to such matters,'' Mr. Gray wrote. ''I suppose I felt that the cost of hotel rooms, food, etc., associated with official travel was infinitesimal compared to the financial stakes of the thrift system.'' **********Mr. Gray, in describing his activities and long working hours at the bank board, said he had personally gone into debt by as much as $75,000 since becoming chairman three and a half years ago. He described as ''nonsense'' charges that ''this job has served in any intended way to achieve personal gain for me.'' **********The thousands of pages of documentation, released by Mr. Gray's office at the request of The Washington Post and disclosed by the newspaper in a series of articles, detailed a history of closeness between the thrift industry and its regulators that has brought calls for sweeping reforms. Practices Said to Precede Gray **********Though expenses during only Mr. Gray's tenure have been released, the bank board chief and other thrift industry experts contend that reimbursement by the home loan banks and industry groups has been common for years, that lawyers for the home loan banks have approved the practice and that the independent judgment of bank board officials has not been impaired. **********Most industry experts agree, however, that the level of travel expenses grew dramatically under Mr. Gray's administration. **********Spending levels for Mr. Gray, his top aides and members of their families were often lavish. During one trip to New York, for instance, Mr. Gray stayed in a hotel room at the Waldorf-Astoria that rented for $649 a night. **********Members of Congress voiced dismay today about the disclosures, particularly since the Justice Department has been asked by the Office of Government Ethics to see whether Mr. Gray or other bank board officials may have violated any criminal laws. **********Criminal behavior would include filing false expense statements or receiving payment for work that is part of one's government job. 'Clean Up This Industry' **********''I think we are seeing that Congress needs to clean up this industry,'' said Representative James Cooper, Democrat from Tennessee and a member of the House Banking Committee. ''We have to make sure the regulators can be real regulators and not in bed with the regulated institutions.'' **********Added Charles E. Schumer, Democrat from Brooklyn and another member of the Banking Committee, ''At a time when major segments of the thrift industry are in real trouble to begin with, it is not very comforting to have a bank board chairman worrying about a Government investigation.'' **********Members of Congress and their top aides voiced deep concern that the controversy over Mr. Gray's expenses could delay emergency legislation to bail out the weakened deposit insurance fund at a time when funds are needed to liquidate hundreds of insolvent institutions. **********Since early last year, Mr. Gray and others have been lobbying for a bill that would inject as much as $20 billion over several years into the nearly depleted F.S.L.I.C. The F.S.L.I.C., which insures deposits at the 3,500 thrift institutions throughout the country, has seen its usable funds dwindle to just over $1 billion. **********At the same time, taking action against the bank board chief is politically unappealing to some leading Democrats. Mr. Gray is perhaps the most regulatory minded of the Reagan Administration's appointees, and in the past he has come down hard on perceived industry excesses, such as large investments by thrift institutions in real estate development. In the process, he has made enemies of segments of the industry and the Reagan Administration as well. Muted Reaction **********In the House, Banking Committee aides said that reaction to the Gray spending problems may be muted partly because the personal finances of the House Banking Committee chairman, Fernand J. St Germain, are also being investigated by a House ethics committee. **********The propriety of the reimbursements poses a sensitive problem for lawmakers since part of the reimbursement was made from special funds set up by the 12 regional banks. The establishment of the funds was approved by the banks' lawyers. **********Kenneth McLean, the top aide to Senator William Proxmire, incoming chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the use of Federal Home Loan Bank funds was a ''loophole'' left by Congress in the way it set up the system and that Senator Proxmire's goal ''at a minimum'' would be to bring all bank board spending under the Congressional appropriations process. **********Mr. McLean said Mr. Proxmire would not call for Mr. Gray's resignation. ''Prox thinks Gray has done some dumb things, and that it's a big embarrassment, but Ed Gray has also done some good regulating,'' Mr. McLean said. **********A call to Mr. Gray's chief of staff, Shannon Fairbanks, was not returned. **********Today's letter to Congress was not Mr. Gray's first response on the questionable payments. Earlier, he repaid to the 12 regional banks at least $26,000 for such personal items as use of a private plane and his wife's lodgings at business gatherings. **********The ethics office has ordered all bank board officials to ''immediately cease from accepting official travel expenses for themselves or accompanying family members from any source except the board itself.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/06/world/the-un-today-feb-6-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 45, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

It could be one of any number of plantations functioning around its sugar mill, except that it is the family home of President Corazon C. Aquino. And it is slowly going broke. **********Sugar, a pillar of the Philippine economy for generations, is in crisis because of a worldwide glut compounded by European, American and Soviet protectionism, Filipinos say. At the same time this vital export crop is also suffering the effects of ''Marcos cronyism,'' according to planters. **********A look at its problems is a key to understanding much of Manila's economic and social situation at the end of the Marcos era. The sugar crisis is both example and symbol of the predicament the Philippines finds itself in as it tries to rebuild a battered and looted economy. **********It is also the area where American help to the Aquino Government would be most welcomed and most quickly felt, sugar planters say. 'The Heart of the Matter' **********''If the United States would like to put something into our economy, and wants a solution that is rapid and will go right to the heart of the matter, sugar is it,'' the new head of the Philippines Sugar Commission, Fred Elizade, said today in Manila, after he was named by President Aquino to direct the Philippine Sugar Commission. **********It will be his job to bring this crucial industry - the second largest export commodity, after coconuts - back into viability. And he wants to do it within the private sector, dismantling the cumbersome and corruption-prone state enterprises of President Ferdinand E. Marcos's Government. **********Mr. Elizade, born into an old sugar family 45 years ago - and therefore in the Filipino aristocracy - remembers the days of gracious plantation life, balls and jewels, ''when pedigrees had to be traced to Iloilo, or invented,'' he said of the former social capital of the islands. **********''This was a glamorous, Deep South culture several years ago,'' said Mr. Elizade, whose knowledge of American life dates to his years at Harvard. A Monument to Prosperity **********There was not much of sugar's ritzy, glittering heyday on view at Hacienda Luisita today. The only monument to the prosperity this place once enjoyed is the 20-year-old family compound of luxury houses built for the former Corazon Cojuangco and her brother and sisters. The family bought Hacienda Luisita from a Spanish company in 1958, when Mrs. Aquino was 25. **********Over the years, the family had made Hacienda Luisita, about 75 miles north of Manila, into what became recognized in the country as a ''progressive'' estate, Hermanegildo Zayco, the departing governor of the Philippines Board of Investment, said this morning in the capital. It was a plantation where workers were well treated and innovative techniques were used. **********But a sharp drop in sugar prices worldwide over the last few years -aggravated by subsidized industries and rigid quota systems in the West and in the Soviet bloc - and the effects on the sugar industry of the corrupt practices of the Marcos Government have dealt estates like this nearly fatal blows. **********''We are having to draw on capital,'' Nereo Mendoza, the assistant resident manager at Hacienda Luisita, said today as he showed a visitor around the cane fields and workers' barrios of the estate. Sugar Production Is Down **********He said the hacienda was forced to create jobs for workers with not enough to do because of mechanization and reduced production. The Philippines, which once produced more than 2.5 million tons of sugar a year, is now down to 1.3 million tons. **********At the same time there is no money for needed research and development of substitute crops, Mr. Mendoza said. **********A reporter heard a similar account of the industry's problems Wednesday at the Canlubang Sugar Estate, south of Manila in Laguna Province. **********There, Arsenio Yulo Jr., the assistant resident manager and member of the family that has owned the plantation since 1948, said the family's estates here and in Negros were surviving on the domestic demand for sugar and the low cost of operating sugar mills, where labor and energy expenditures are minimal. Sugar estate workers earn barely $2 a day, much less in some areas. #15 New Mills and Estates Mr. Yulo said the traditional sugar estates were badly affected by the intrusion in the 1970's of about 15 new mills and estates built by close political and personal associates of Mr. Marcos. The associates, he said, got large foreign currency loans in return for kickbacks and built sugar factories that cut into the livelihood of existing estates, taking away betwen 30 and 48 percent of their market. **********In addition, planters say, the ''crony'' mills were financed on overestimated costs - a $200 million mill getting a $400 million loan, one planter suggested - that allowed the friends of Mr. Marcos to pocket the difference. **********By all accounts, corruption also entered the industry at point of sale. A Government monopoly under Mr. Marcos's control bought sugar from the mills and sold it both domestically and abroad at prices and bookkeeping processes out of public view. **********''There was no clear accounting,'' said Mr. Yulo, whose family split bitterly over whom to support in the recent election. ''We felt we were shortchanged. Marcos and company probably stole $200 million a year from sugar.'' **********Mr. Zayco said today that such charges from Mr. Yulo and the managers of Hacienda Luisita were probably correct. 'Never Got a Proper Accounting' **********''The planters never got a proper accounting from the National Sugar Trading Company,'' he said. ''So there are no published accounts to prove their charges right or wrong.'' **********Last year the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank intervened to try to stop the lucrative but illegal profit-taking from sugar. Reorganization of the sugar-trading mechanisms and an audit of the sugar trading monopoly were demanded. **********''Beginning an audit of this hard-to-measure trade is like opening a can of worms,'' Mr. Zayco said. ''You never know how many worms there are. The audit will be more like writing a novel - something that will have to be done by gut feeling.'' **********Mr. Elizade believes more than economic and ethical considerations are at stake as he begins to look for a way out of the sugar crisis. He thinks an equitable solution that raises the living standards of sugar workers would go a long way to ending the guerrilla war. **********''The sugar island of Negros in particular is the fulcrum of the whole problem of classical insurrection,'' he said. ''If you can come up with solutions down there, I believe you'll get a centrifugal effect that will spread around the country, and we will be on the way to ending the guerrilla war.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/24/business/finance-briefs-030586.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 212, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "print_headline": "FINANCE BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** American Express Overseas Finance is issuing $100 million (Australian) of zero-coupon Eurobonds, due 1991, at 55 1/2 to yield 12.13 percent through Shearson Lehman Brothers International. *********** American General Corp. is issuing $150 million of 8 1/2 percent Eurobonds, due 1998, at a price of 100 through Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. *********** Cummins Engine Co. is offering $100 million of Baa-2/BBB- rated 9 3/4 percent sinking fund debentures, due 2016, at 99.345 to yield 9.818 percent, through First Boston Corp. *********** Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp. plans to announce on Wednesday the interest rate on $1.6 billion of bonds, due Oct. 1, 1986. *********** General Motors Acceptance Corp. is offering $300 million of 7 3/4 percent three-year notes at 99 3/4 to yield 7.844 percent through Salomon Brothers Inc. *********** Household Finance Corp. has filed for up to $1 billion of debt securities and warrants. *********** Inco Ltd. is issuing $100 million of 9 3/4 percent Eurobonds, due 1996, at 100 through Morgan Stanley Internationl. *********** Iowa Public Service Co. is offering $80 million of 8 1/4 percent first mortgage bonds, due 1996, at 98.075 to yield 8.54 percent through Goldman, Sachs & Co. *********** Lockheed Corp. is offering $200 million of 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes, rated A-2/AA-, at par through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/29/business/finance-new-issues-commonwealth-edison-is-offering-9-1-2-bonds.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Commonwealth Edison Is Offering 9 1/2% Bonds", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Commonwealth Edison Is Offering 9 1/2% Bonds", "body_text": " **********The Commonwealth Edison Company is offering $300 million of 9 1/2 percent bonds due in 2016 at a price of 100 through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley & Company. **********While interest rates in general have declined enough to cause the Chicago-based utility and several other companies to sell more than one long-term issue in recent months, yesterday's financing shows that yields for corporate bonds have not declined so sharply as for Treasury issues. **********Investment bankers say the corporate issues are selling with yields that are much more generous than normal compared with Treasury issues because of the heavy supply of new corporate bonds and because investors prefer noncallable Treasury issues to corporate issues that can be called, or retired, long before maturity. **********The Commmonwealth Edison bonds, which can be redeemed by the company after five years, offer a yield that is about two percentage points higher than for 9 1/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016.

''We are going to have the hottest autumn and hottest winter in 20 years,'' a protest leader, Koji Kitahara, said. **********Show of Force by Police **********Fearing possible bombings or rocket attacks, the Japanese police organized one of their biggest shows of force in the last few years. About 12,000 officers patrolled Tokyo streets and key Government installations, and 10,000 others, most of them riot policemen, stood guard at highway checkpoints and at the airport here, 41 miles east of the capital. **********Security was tighter on only one recent occasion - the conference of leaders of major industrial democracies that was held in Tokyo in May. **********On roads in and near Narita, the police stopped and searched nearly all trucks and vans for explosives. Parts of the airport compound were blockaded, with patrols particularly thick at the control tower. The goal was to avert a repeat of a 1978 attack in which radicals seized the tower and damaged vital equipment. The action delayed the airport's scheduled opening. **********Tokyo policemen have been on edge for almost two weeks, since attackers presumed to be left-wing extremists fired homemade rockets toward the Prime Minister's residence and other Government buildings. The missiles fell short. **********On Oct. 12, the police in Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan raided what they said was an weapons factory for Japan's dominant radical group, the Middle Core Faction. Among the material the police said they confiscated were two bombs made from pressure cookers filled with gun powder and lead pellets. Bombs Intercepted Earlier **********The police said two suspects were caught in a truck carrying the bombs, which officials said radicals had planned to use against police officers at the demonstration today. **********Mr. Kitahara, the protest leader, said policemen had visited several farmhouses near the rally site at 3:30 A.M. today in still another search for explosives. **********In the last few days, Tokyo has been awash with rumors that some kind of violence would soon occur. The speculation and the police nervousness were fed by a surge of incidents in the last year, including several rocket attacks on Government installations and sabotage that twice knocked out commuter rail service. **********The Narita airport has long been a focus of dissenters, and the events today underlined the likelihood that the issue will not soon disappear. Trouble From the Start **********Originally, in the mid-1960's, it was a farmers' protest against Government confiscation of their land to build the $2.9 billion airport. Officials had violated a cardinal Japanese rule: consult all parties first in any important undertaking and reach a consensus before taking action. **********The belief that the Government had behaved highhandedly was widely held. It led to violent struggles that ignited in a politically charged atmosphere that enveloped Japan in the 1960's, much as it did the United States. Over the years, at least seven people have been killed and thousands hurt in protest-related violence. **********The airport construction ''became the symbol of extra-institutional protest in Japan, a metaphor of Government oppression and a sign of the state itself,'' David E. Apter and Nagayo Sawa wrote in ''Against the State,'' their study of the airport protest violence. **********Even now Narita remains a potent symbol, although the numbers of demonstrators have greatly fallen in the prevailing conservative political mood. #2 New Runways at Issue With the airport operating for eight years, the protesters' emphasis has switched to stopping plans for two new runways, one 10,496 feet long and the other 8,200 feet. Narita now has one 13,200-foot runway. **********Landowner resistance comes from eight farm families who own about 53 acres of the 1,272-acre tract where the airport may build the new runways. But the families are divided, with some believed ready to compromise. **********If it wished, the Transport Ministry could simply seize the land. But with memories of earlier violence, it has avoided direct action. The ministry has yet to announce formally that it even has designs for new runways, although it has become common knowledge. **********Among the speakers at the protest today was Kakichi Ogawa, a 64-year-old farmer who tends eight acres of sweet-potato fields near the rally site. He is one of the holdouts, and he insists he will never negotiate. **********''Nothing has changed,'' Mr. Ogawa said in an interview. ''We're just trying to protect our basic rights. I don't consider myself at all an extremist. But I've been forced to continue this struggle for the last 21 years.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/27/world/manila-and-the-insurgents-agree-to-60-day-truce-starting-dec-10.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1986-11-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1154, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MANILA AND THE INSURGENTS AGREE TO 60-DAY TRUCE STARTING DEC. 10", "print_headline": "MANILA AND THE INSURGENTS AGREE TO 60-DAY TRUCE STARTING DEC. 10", "body_text": " **********Communist rebels and the Government of President Corazon C.

Military leaders were briefed on the draft agreement today by two Government negotiators, Agriculture Minister Ramon V. Mitra and Teofisto Guingona, head of the Commission on Audits. **********'Military Will Support Decision' **********''Definitely, the military will support the decision taken by the panel,'' the Deputy Chief of Staff, Gen. Eduardo Ermita, said. **********Both sides said tonight that the agreement would be signed here Thursday, the birthday of Mrs. Aquino's late husband, the onetime opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino Jr., in the Club Filipino, where she took the oath of office in February. **********The agreement comes as President Aquino is overhauling her Government after asking for the resignation of her Cabinet on Sunday. The presidential press office said today that the new Cabinet lineup would be announced Friday. Speculation on Cabinet Changes **********Manila newspapers have been speculating on the extent of the changes, some of them suggesting that Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, the military Chief of Staff, may get a civilian portfolio. Although Mrs. Aquino's staff denies most of the rumors, it appears that at least four controversial ministers are likely to lose their jobs. **********The cease-fire agreement, which includes safety and immunity guarantees for Communist negotiators, leaves some other difficult questions yet to be resolved. **********According to the negotiators for the Communist side, who held a news conference tonight, there has been no agreement, for example, on whether forced levies or ''taxation'' by rebel armies are an ''act of hostility.'' **********The Communist negotiators, Saturnino Ocampo and Antonio Zumel of the National Democratic Front, say they also intend in future talks to raise demands for the end of United States military aid to the Philippines and the ''dismantling'' or ''removal'' of American bases in the country. **********Substantive negotiations on these and other unresolved issues would begin 30 days after the cease-fire went into effect, the Communist side said. **********Some Philippine officials and foreign diplomats believe that topics such as Manila's relations with Washington or the presence of American military bases here could ultimately destroy the accord, because they are likely to be opposed strenuously by the Philippine military and the political opposition. **********In a statement today, Blas F. Ople, a Labor Minister under Ferdinand E. Marcos and an active opposition spokesman, said a cease-fire agreement should not be allowed to ''legitimize the existence of two parallel governments even for a short period, or to preclude the Government's sovereign function to uphold and enforce the laws in any portion of the national territory.'' 'Grand Design' **********He said the Communist Party considered a cease-fire ''eminently suitable to its grand design for a rapid buildup of political strength in major cities.'' **********The negotiators for the Communists said tonight that they wanted to raise the topics of human rights, land reform and ''national sovereignty.'' This is a catch phrase for opposition to foreign investment and involvement in international economic institutions. These issues may also pose stumbling blocks to a long-lasting accord. **********But for the moment, the country can perhaps look forward to a peaceful Christmas holiday season, both sides say. **********The guerrilla war waged by the Communists still kills about eight Filipinos a day, according to the army. Nearly a fifth of the country's towns and villages have been drawn into the conflict to one degree or another, General Ramos said in a recent interview. Economic losses are in the millions of dollars. **********The announcement that an agreement had been reached came four days before the deadline set by President Aquino on Sunday in the same speech in which she announced the resignation of Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. **********The draft agreement with the Communists followed the decision by Moslem separatists on the southern island of Mindanao to open peace negotiations in January, according to reports in the Philippine press today. **********Mrs. Aquino is also negotiating with leaders of a small rebellion in the Cordillera region of northern Luzon.

If Iran begins the big offensive it has been promising for months, some military analysts think it likely that Iranian troops can crack this line at some point and seize, and probably hold, another small but psychologically embarrassing chunk of Iraqi territory. **********Understanding why this is so is the key to understanding the six-year war between Iran and Iraq. **********The operations and doctrinal manuals of nearly all armies stress as the first two principles of war the objective and the offensive. An army needs a clear objective, preferably an attainable one. And while defensive combat is often very important, the orthodox military view is that ultimate success depends on offensive operations. **********But for several reasons, Iraq's officers appear to have been denied the chance to apply either of those time-tested principles. **********Iran seems to feel reasonably sure that it need not worry about offensive operations by Iraq and can therefore mass troops safely in small areas. With enough men, a Western analyst pointed out, any defense can be pierced. **********Because another important aspect of Iraq's war policy, which is primarily formulated by the civilian political leadership, is to try to hold down casualties, it is hard to retake the small salients of ground lost. The Iranians are good military engineers, too, and dig in energetically once they take a position. ''You could get them out, but the political leaders may not be willing to pay the price,'' said a foreign diplomat. Worries Seem Overblown **********Iran has few friends in the international community, but Iraq, despite past political confrontations, has the strategic sympathy of the United States and most of the West. In recent months there has been an easy-to-detect sense of worry among some American policy makers about the war, a feeling that things have not been going well for Iraq and might somehow get significantly worse. Officials recently told Congress that Iran had ''the initiative.'' **********Partly, this stems from a lack of first-hand information. Foreign military attaches are never permitted to visit combat areas or even reserve troop units. **********But military experts seem far less concerned than Western civilian officials about the possibility of a really major Iraqi reverse or even some sort of collapse. After a glimpse at the army, a reporter also tends to be dubious about any decisive Iraqi defeat. The impression here is of an army that is well-equipped and well-trained, with senior officers with excellent military educations and a strong aptitude for planning. **********At times, the army has been slow to react to Iranian thrusts, as in 1982 when it was driven off Iranian soil and at Fao this year. But it is not clear that the officer corps is to blame since President Saddam Hussein insisted on retaining so much personal control of even day-to-day military operations. **********The army has repeatedly shown that when the Iranians make a breakthrough, the Iraqis usually contain it quicky. Armor officers are very prominent in the top ranks, and Iraq seems to demonstrate a talent for effective use of tanks in counterattacks. A Top-Level Meeting **********Maj. Gen. Talie Khalil Ibrahim al-Duri, commander of III Corps, said in an interview that in his sector artillery batteries had pre-registered their guns on key coordinates and had pre-planned firing missions that would permit rapid response to an Iranian offensive. Helicopter gunships and close air support from the air force have also been effective in some past battles, as in March 1985 when thousands of Iranian troops were killed in a drive on the Basra-Baghdad highway. **********It is also possible that the army will be given more freedom of action in the future. After the Mehran disaster in early July, President Hussein called what appeared to be an extraordinary meeting of the top officials of the Baath Socialist Party and key commanders. Diplomats say they are pretty sure something important transpired, although they are unsure and divided about exactly what it was and how it came about. **********''The feeling is that Saddam Hussein agreed to give the armed forces a bit more freedom of action in military decisions, particularly the freedom to move quickly in a crisis,'' one diplomat said. Another expert believes it was the air force that may have been given the greatest latitude to risk losses in pressing home the air war, in which Iraq maintains the initiative."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/26/business/special-exemptions-in-the-tax-bill-as-disclosed-by-the-senate.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4864, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE TAX BILL, AS DISCLOSED BY THE SENATE", "print_headline": "SPECIAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE TAX BILL, AS DISCLOSED BY THE SENATE", "body_text": " **********A list released tonight by the Senate Finance Committee identified the hundreds of corporations, private organizations and civic projects that received special exemptions in the tax revision bill passed by the House. **********Senator Howard M.

Most experts believe the report will confirm weakness in the nation's economy. **********The Dow Jones industrial average, which dropped 62 points on Monday, July 7 and more than 27 points on Monday, July 14, gained a meager 1.13 points yesterday, to 1,779.11, while other indicators were declining moderately. **********The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.10, to 136.25, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.12, to 236.24 and the average share on the Big Board lost 3 cents.

If the report indicates a lower rate of growth, stock prices could decline, experts say. Higher growth, on the other hand, could mean an improvement in the equities market as investors anticipate better profits for businesses. **********Even in yesterday's dull market, there were several standout stock performances.

ON REFUGEES FROM ETHIOPIA", "body_text": " **********A recent surge in the number of Ethiopian refugees going to northwest Somalia has set off a sharp dispute between the Government in Mogadishu and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here. **********The dispute began early this month when Somali officials warned publicly of ''starvation not seen since World War II'' because of what they said was the failure of the United Nations agency to provide enough food. **********The agency has countered the Somali charges, saying there is enough food to feed the refugee population, which has risen from an estimated 700,000 to 850,000 since December. United Nations officials say the influx of new refugees has at times exceeded a thousand a day at the Tug Wajale reception camp, about five miles from the Somali-Ethiopian border. **********Agency officials contend that the crisis lies in the Government's refusal to allow any of the new refugees to move inland from crowded border camps around Tug Wajale, risking a major epidemic if a new outbreak of cholera comes with the onset of rains that began last week. **********Last year cholera and malnutrition killed more than 2,000 people in the northern corner of Somalia that borders on Ethiopia and Djibouti, agency officials said. The agency fears that poor transportation facilities, made worse by the rainy season, could isolate the refugees from food and water supplies. With improper sanitation and inadequate drainage in and around the camps, the officials fear that a cholera epidemic could be even more serious this year because of the recent influx of refugees swelling the number of people confined to the camps. **********''If there is a crisis, it's not about food,'' said Michel Barton, a spokesman for the High Commissioner. ''There is a crisis in the northwest due to thousands of refugees being confined to a site near the border with a planned capacity of 2,000 people.'' **********The comments reflect a tendency at the agency to be more forthcoming in its warnings of possible problems, in the wake of criticism that it had not been aggresive enough in the past in foreseeing and publicizing looming crises, like last year's Ethiopian drought famine. It may also reflect the more aggresive style promised by the newly elected High Commissioner, Jean-Pierre Hocke of Switzerland, who assumed the post in January. **********The Somali Government is said to fear that allowing the new refugees to move could result in the spread of cholera to other national and refugee populations, after three cholera cases were reported in Tug Wajale in March. The decision by the Government also reflects the strain already placed on Somalia's impoverished economy by a refugee influx that has Somalia the world's fourth largest concentration of refugees after Pakistan, Iran and the Sudan. **********Somalia's refugee problems stem from the war in Ethiopia's Ogaden region in 1978-79, when about 100,000 refugees entered Somalia. The number continued to grow, and the recent influx is believed to be due in part to Ethiopian Government attempts to move peasants into strategic villages in its war against guerrilla forces in the region."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/04/world/chile-authorities-act-to-prosecute-leaders-of-strike.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1986-07-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1038, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHILE AUTHORITIES ACT TO PROSECUTE LEADERS OF STRIKE", "print_headline": "CHILE AUTHORITIES ACT TO PROSECUTE LEADERS OF STRIKE", "body_text": " **********The Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, reacting to a general strike called by opposition groups demanding a return to democracy, brought charges of inciting disorder against the protest leaders and two magazine editors today. **********In another sign of the crackdown, Chileans awoke without what many described as their main sources of public affairs news. Four radio stations, accused by the Government of encouraging violence through their aggressive coverage of strike activities, obeyed an order issued Wednesday night to limit their programming to music, commercials and Government pronouncements.  [ The independent Human Rights Commission and newspapers quoting police sources said three teen-agers were shot to death Thursday night in Santiago neighborhoods patrolled by the army, The Associated Press reported. Aurelia Luca, a human rights worker, said residents told her one teen-ager was shot in the head by an army patrol that fired into a group of protesters, The A.P. said. ]  Penalties for Strike Leaders Dr. Juan Luis Gonzalez and 16 other strike organizers said they would turn themselves in to the courts once they were advised in writing of the accusation that they had violated the state security law. Among other things, the law makes it a crime to incite ''the illegal paralyzation of normal activities.'' **********Jose Galiano, one of the lawyers representing the strike leaders, said that they could face penalties ranging from two months to 13 years in jail under the various charges. **********The journalists who face charges were Juan Pablo Cardenas, editor of the weekly magazine Analisis, and Juan Jorge Faundez, editor of Cauce, another weekly. Groups Calling Strike **********The Interior Ministry charges against the two publications accused them of ''inciting acts of violence, attacks on the armed forces and continuous calls to disobey the Government.'' **********The strike, which went into its second day with what appeared to be less support than it had on Wednesday, particularly outside the capital, was called by the Assembly of Civility, a coalition of professional, labor, student and civic groups, to press the armed forces to open talks about a transition to democracy. Dr. Gonzalez, a physician affiliated with the Christian Democratic Party, is president of the Assembly. **********Under a new Constitution drawn up by General Pinochet and approved in a plebiscite in 1980, he can remain in power until 1989 and then seek another eight-year term in a referendum. The four radio stations that were ordered not to report news, Radio Cooperativa, Radio Chilena, Radio Santiago and Radio Carrera, were said by the military to have exceeded journalistic norms in their coverage. **********The military order came under a broad set of decrees and what are called transitory provisions of the Consitution that essentially give the Government the power to impose any restriction it chooses on news outlets. No Prior Censorship **********There is, however, no prior censorship, and several radio stations and news magazines routinely present coverage that is strongly critical of the Government. **********Two stations that do so are Radio Cooperativa, whose owners are affiliated with the the Christian Democrats, a major opposition party, and Radio Chilena, which belongs to the Roman Catholic Church. **********Guillermo Munoz Melo, the news director of Radio Cooperativa, said today that his news team had not broken any laws and had obeyed a Government order not to give advance mention of the general strike until officials themselves began to speak of it. He also said the station had never promoted or interviewed groups advocating violence. **********Acknowledging that his connection to the Christian Democratic Party, he said his concern as news director was with being a professional journalist. Protest Song Played **********Mr. Munoz also said that Radio Coopertativa had been threatened with total closing this morning until it stopped periodic broadcasts of the protest song written for the strike, which had continued to be played after the station halted its newscasts. **********''We were considering the song as music,'' Mr. Munoz said with a smile. **********Strike leaders continued to claim success for what Dr. Gonzalez characterized as the largest anti-Government action in Chile since the protest that preceded the overthrow of the late President Salvador Allende Gossens in 1973. However, the Labor Minister, Alfonso Marquez de la Plata, said the action had been a ''total failure.'' **********The violence in what was intended as a peaceful protest continued to mount. Residents of several poor neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city said there had been numnerous robberies of stores and shooting incidents in the early morning hours today plus large-scale identity checks by the police. More than 500 people had been detained by this afternoon, mostly in Santiago but some elsewhere in the country. Most were being freed within hours.  Shooting Deaths Reported It was confirmed Wednesday that three residents of poor neighborhoods around Santiago had been shot to death and there were unofficial reports of a fourth death in Santiago and one in Valparaiso. Witnesses said the police were responsible for two of the confirmed deaths in Santiago and gunmen in civilian clothes were said to be responsible for the third. **********Several dozen people were being treated in hospitals in Santiago for bullet wounds or burns. **********Among them were two teen-agers who, according to a report from strike headquarters, were picked up Wednesday morning by uniformed men with painted faces, soaked in a flammable liquid and set afire. Later, according to the report, which authorities did not confirm, policemen found the couple wrapped in blankets beside a road on the edge of Santiago and took them to a hospital. **********The reference to uniformed men with painted faces was not explained, but the army has often used paint to hide the identity of soldiers in recent weeks. **********Strike spokesmen identified the burn victims as Carmen Quintana Arancibia, 18 years old, a university student, and Rodrigo Rojas de Negri, 19. **********The human rights group Amnesty International said in New York that Mr. de Negri was a resident of the United States, where his mother, Veronica de Negri, is a political exile.

Whitehead said. ''He has not yet made that decision.'' But Mr. Whitehead added that while there was no deadline for a decision, ''time is winding down; the time is getting short.'' **********Tension continued to build as Vernon Walters, the American representative at the United Nations, held confidential briefings in key allied capitals today about American plans  [ Page A6 ] . Two United States Navy carrier battle groups exercised in the central Mediterranean, not far from Libya. Senator Invited to Meeting **********Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said today that Secretary of State George P. Shultz had told him to go to the White House on Monday for a meeting with Mr. Reagan that is expected to discuss the possible American response. Mr. Lugar had sent a message to Mr. Shultz on Friday complaining about not being briefed on possible war plans, ''A decision will be made on that occasion, or shortly thereafter as to what our response ought to be,'' Mr. Lugar said in Bloomington, Ind.

Both are expected to meet with Mr. Reagan on Monday as well, and their advice may be crucial. **********In the past, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Weinberger have been opposed to general acts of military retaliation against terrorists. They have said that military force should be limited to attacking places where the known perpetrators of terrorist actions could be located. **********Mr. Shultz, however, has supported attacks on military targets in Libya in response to terrorist actions, whether or not those targets were directly linked to the specific terrorist bombing. Mr. Reagan has repeatedly said that terrorists would not go unpunished and there would be a response if it were proven that the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was responsible for the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque on April 5. **********Robert B. Oakley, the chief State Department official in charge of counterterrorism, said today that the evidence linking Libya to the Berlin bombing was still being examined ''because we want to make the best case possible.'' **********''We want to have our own minds clear if something should be done,'' he said. ''There's a lot of talk about the President acting recklessly, and yet in cases like this he generally acts in a very cautious manner. He wants to be sure that he's right before he makes any decisions.'' **********Mr. Oakley later left for Europe where he is to meet with allied counterterrorist experts to discuss in detail the information available on Libyan actions, a State Department official said. **********In discussing the intelligence information about Libyan links to terrorism, Mr. Whitehead said that more important than Colonel Qaddafi's specific involvement in the Berlin bombing is information ''we have about his future plans for literally dozens of other terrorist actions around the world, and it is those plans that we must react to to protect the lives of Americans which are in danger by his plans if he goes forward with them.'' **********He said the plans involved specific targets and that people have been ''enlisted to carry out the plans.'' Targets Not Identified **********The No. 2 official at the State Department declined to identify the targets, but added that ''we hope we will have enough information to forestall these actions, or many of them, before they take place.'' **********Mr. Whitehead, appearing on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' seemed to be suggesting that a military attack would take place unless there was a sudden decision by Colonel Qaddafi to renounce terrorism and support for groups carrying it out. **********When asked if the United States had to attack Libya after having created an aura of expectation, Mr. Whitehead responded: ''Not if he changes his conduct. Not if he stops training terrorists, financing terrorists, supplying them with arms, supplying them with documents. As soon as he stops those actions, then we would certainly back away from our actions.'' **********He added: ''We would certainly listen to a response. Whether we could find it believable is, of course, another question.'' Other Options on Hold **********Administration officials have not actively discussed other options for dealing with Libya except a military one. Mr. Oakley, appearing on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' said that when he and Mr. Whitehead toured Europe in January after last December's attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports, they sought to get allied cooperation in imposing economic sanctions against Libya and in expelling Libyan diplomats. But they received virtually no support. **********He said that at that time, the United States told the allies that if there were no strong collective political and economic action against Colonel Qaddafi, then ''we would feel correct in resorting to other measures.'' **********The allies have continued to resist taking signficant action and have urged the United States to be cautious about using military force. **********Some officials have suggested that if the European allies imposed dramatic sanctions against Libya such as expelling most or all of the Libyan diplomats, or imposing a ban on trade with Libya, this might have the effect of removing the urgent need for an American military response. But the officials said that they did not expect the Europeans to shift positions in the near term."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/world/tension-libya-assessing-air-raid-lost-fliers-families-voice-support-doubt-raid.html": {"writer_name": "Eleanor Blau", "pub_date": "1986-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 454, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LOST FLIERS' FAMILIES VOICE SUPPORT AND DOUBT ON RAID", "print_headline": "TENSION IN LIBYA: ASSESSING THE AIR RAID; LOST FLIERS' FAMILIES VOICE SUPPORT AND DOUBT ON RAID", "body_text": " **********The mother of one of the two American fliers believed killed in Monday's attacks on Libya said yesterday that her family supported President Reagan's decision on the raids. **********''You can't let someone like Qaddafi rule the world by terrorism,'' Mrs. Bernie Lorence Kruger, mother of Capt.

W. Botha shuffled his Cabinet today, replacing the officials responsible for security and information. **********The ministers who were dropped were Louis le Grange, the Minister of Law and Order, who was responsible for mass detentions and widespread police action under the nation's newest emergency decree, and Louis Nel, the deputy minister responsible for information, who became the Government's most prominent propagandist, Political commentators said the shifts seemed unlikely for foreshadow fundamental shifts of policy. **********The Cabinet shuffle was the first for several years. Although there was no immediate official response to it from black protest movements, activists said privately the moves seemed irrelevant to the concerns of anti-apartheid organizations, which are seeking fundamental change in a system that reserves political power and economic influence for whites. **********Military Influence Strong **********Some Western political analysts argued that the influence of the military over the nation's decision-making remained as strong as in the past. **********Mr. le Grange, who is said to have undergone treatment for cancer, had reportedly requested a transfer to a less prominent and demanding position. Mr. Botha appointed him Speaker of the white chamber of the three-chamber Parliament. **********Mr. Nel, was evidently dismissed under a cloud. Mr. Botha said Mr. Nel had been offered alternative posts but had not decided on any of them yet since he was ''busy playing, 'I love you, I love you not.' '' **********The sarcasm seemed a clear indication of Mr. Botha's feelings about Mr. Nel who, since taking over the information portfolio in late 1983, has failed to promote a favorable image of the nation's white rulers, either to the outside world or to a restive black majority. New U.N. Delegate **********In another move, the Government appointed Albert Manley to be its new chief delegate to the United Nations. Mr. Manley, 40 years old, now Deputy Foreign Minister, will replace Kurt von Schirnding, who asked to retire. **********Mr. Nel was head of the Government's propaganda arm, the Bureau for Information. He is to be replaced by Stoffel van der Merwe, the governing National Party's Information Director, who has allied himself in the past with the party's relatively liberal wing. **********Mr. le Grange, aged 58 years, has been a member of parliament for the conservative Potchefstroom constituency for 20 years. He has been in charge of the nation's police since 1979. Responsibility for Police **********Under emergency decrees proclaimed in 1985 and 1986, Mr. le Grange has been responsible for police action to curb protest in the nation's segregated black townships. **********There has been no suggestion, however, that Mr. le Grange has been personally criticized by white leaders for his handling of the crisis. **********He is to be replaced by Adriaan Vlok, until now the deputy minister of both Law and Order and Defense. **********Mr. Vlok, unlike Mr. le Grange, has taken part in negotiations with black leaders designed to end school boycotts in Soweto, Johannesburg's huge black satellite city. Policy of Confrontation **********Political commentators said the appointment offered no suggestion that the authorities had shifted away from a policy of confrontation with foes of apartheid. **********There were no other changes among the leading policy-making figures in the Government, and the main contenders for Mr. Botha's position, should he retire, remained in place. These are generally held to be Education Minister F. W. de Klerk, Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha and Constitutional Development Minister J. Chris Heunis. **********The most publicized departure was that of Mr. Nel, a blunt and outspoken figure who was thrust into prominence by the nation's crisis and by the emergency censorship regulations he oversaw in an effort to limit news about the depth of South Africa's turmoil. **********Mr. Nel's Bureau for Information, which came to prominence earlier this year, was the principal vehicle of the Government's effort to minimize what was officially seen as damaging foreign coverage of South Africa.

But the department's legal adviser said later this afternoon that the United States hoped that resolution of this case would persuade Iran to help free the hostages. **********The Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, has said in general terms several times recently that if the United States returned to Iran all of the Iranian assets in the United States, Iran would be sympathetic to using its leverage with the militant groups holding the hostages in Lebanon. **********A major if not overriding reason for the secret sale of American arms to Iran in the last year and a half was to obtain the release of the hostages. Three were freed, leaving two of the original group in captivity; but three more were kidnapped in the last several months. **********''There is nothing we say or do that should prevent Iran from giving us back our hostages,'' Abraham D. Sofaer, the adviser, said in an interview. 'Matter of Principle' **********''We are not willing to negotiate with that as our objective,'' he said, referring to the policy, violated by the secret arms shipments, of not paying ransom for hostages. ''If Rafsanjani decides, however, to give us back our hostages, we will be grateful to God for the return of these Americans.'' **********''If there is anything Iran can do to get the hostages back, they should do it as a matter of principle,'' Mr. Sofaer said. ''Innocent people should not suffer for disputes among nations.'' **********The linkage of the assets and the hostages has become a political problem for the Administration. On the one hand, it recognizes that the Iranians are owed most of the $500 million, without any connection to the hostages. But it also seems to recognize that if it agrees to the terms for handing over the money without any hostages being freed, some people may be persuaded that the Administration was again tricked by the Iranians. **********The question of Iran's assets in the United States is the only issue that has brought the two sides together in a regular way since the takeover of the United States Embassy in Teheran in 1979. The 52 Americans held hostage after the takeover were freed in January 1981 as part of a complicated agreement negotiated through Algerian mediation. **********As part of that accord, Iran deposited $3.7 billion with the Federal Reserve to cover claims by American-led bank syndicates against the Iranian Government. It turned out, however, that Iran overpaid by some $350 million the amount it had to deposit, and now, counting interest, that amount is $506 million. Ruling in The Hague **********The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, set up by the 1981 accord and based in The Hague, ruled last Aug. 20 that Iran was entitled to the $506 million, and details for its return should be concluded by Dec. 20. Even though the target date has passed, both sides agreed to meet in The Hague today, the third such meeting since August. The meeting has attracted considerable attention because it was the first since the revelations about the secret Iran operation and because of Mr. Rafsanjani's linking of assets and hostages. **********Mr. Sofaer said that since August, the Iranians had raised ''all kinds of unanticipated problems and objections,'' but that it seems as if ''they might be getting more reasonable, and if they are, we'd like to respond accordingly.'' **********Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokesman, said the $506 million, held by the Federal Reserve Bank in News York, ''belongs to Iran.'' **********The details to be negotiated, she said, were ''how much money should be retained by the New York Fed in order to pay any remaining claims against the account, and two, a release and discharge by Iran of all claims against the United States or the New York Fed for its administration of the fund.'' **********Mr. Sofaer said there is about $40 million in new claims which have been made and presumably the United States would seek to set aside that amount from the $506 million to cover payment of them. Other Assets in Dispute **********In addition to the funds deposited by Iran for syndicated bank loans, there are other assets in dispute, Mr. Sofaer said. **********There is what is known as ''the security account'' under which Iran transferred $1 billion in 1981 to pay awards to the United States and its nationals by the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal. So far, American claimants have received $825 million from that fund, Mr. Sofaer said, but Iran has honored an obligation to keep the fund at the $1 billion level. **********Another account was set up by Iran with a transfer of $1.4 billion to pay off non-syndicated bank loans. **********Negotiations are continuing on settlement of outstanding claims from the security account and the non-syndicated bank loan account, he said. **********In addition, the Government of the Shah of Iran had deposited about $500 million with the United States Government to cover advance payments for armaments purchases. That fund, Mr. Sofaer said, is the subject of considerable litigation before the tribunal both by American companies and by Iran. With interest, that fund is probably close to $1 billion. **********There is also more than $100 million worth of arms already purchased by Iran but which could not be shipped to Iran under the arms embargo placed on Iran by the Carter Administration and by the Reagan Administration. **********Mr. Sofaer said Iran is claiming that the United States owes Iran some $11 billion.

But 12 years ago, the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau asked the United States to move out as soon as it could build another chancery. The Trudeau Government, with headquarters nearby, said it needed more office space. **********The location of the American Embassy, across the street from Parliament, has also been a sore point among Canadian nationalists and the source of jokes about Americans intruding in Canadian politics. **********The United States did not object to moving because the chancery is now too small. More than 80 American diplomats and 90 Canadian employees are dispersed at six locations around town. **********The National Capital Commission, a Federal agency created in 1948 to develop Ottawa into a more imposing capital, selected Mile Circle for the new United States Embassy from a list of 16 available parcels of federally owned real estate. **********The commission proposed that up to 10 acres of the meadow, which covers 52 acres in eastern Ottawa, be sold to the United States and that 10 additional acres be reserved for five or six other embassies. Affluent Neighbors Object **********But Mile Circle is the backyard for two affluent neighborhoods, Rockcliffe Park and Manor Park, where some of Ottawa's most influential civil servants, diplomats and business officials live, and the residents want the embassies elsewhere. **********''We don't feel the N.C.C. should use land that has been acquired as parkland to build office buildings on,'' said Joan Frommer, a Manor Park resident who is helping coordinate the protest. **********The protests have taken the form of poster contests for children, a tea party for senior citizens, a joined-hands ''Circle the Circle'' rally and lawn signs that say, ''Save the Circle.'' **********''We're not anti-American, and I don't get any anti-American feeling about it,'' said Grace Mackenzie, a activist in Manor Park. She said more than 4,000 signatures had been collected on a petition to keep the embassies out. **********Canada and the United States agreed a few years ago to put the embassies on a prestigious site on Sussex drive. But after the bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut and other anti-American terrorism, the State Department moved to make its embassies less vulnerable, and the alternative site was rejected as too exposed. Alternative Called 'Sitting Duck' **********''It would have been great from a standpoint of location,'' said Stanley Zuckerman, the cultural affairs counselor at the embassy. ''From a security standpoint, it's a sitting duck.'' **********The concern about terrorist attack has hardly encouraged Mile Circle neighbors. ''There are private homes in close proximity to that location and security is an issue,'' Mrs. Frommer said. **********Residents also complain that a heavily guarded embassy would spoil an area where they picnic and bicycle in summer or ski in winter. **********The Canadian Government would find it awkward to withdraw the offer because it was granted an enviable site for its new embassy in Washington, on Pennsylvania Avenue. **********Jean Piggott, the chairman of the National Capital Commission, has hinted that the choice of Mile Circle is firm. That does not mean the protesters will give up. ''I've got a feeling that there could be a lawsuit,'' Mrs. Mackenzie said.

Boesky to pay $100 million for illegal stock speculation, according to an industry source. **********A securities executive, who said he had personal knowledge of the Government's latest action, said the subpoenas were served to investment bankers and arbitrage traders at three investment houses. The executive asked not to be identified. Dennison Young Jr., an Associate United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, declined to confirm or deny the report, or the existence of a new grand jury investigation. Charged With Criminal Act **********The securities executive said that the subpoenas were a direct outgrowth of the Government's action against Mr. Boesky, who has been charged with a criminal act because of the insider trading charges he settled on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. **********Insider trading involves the use of privileged corporate information that has not been made available to the investing public at large. **********The Government enforcers who penalized Mr. Boesky say that they have other insider trading cases under way and that they expect the Boesky affair to lead to new ones involving corporation executives, investment bankers and Wall Street lawyers who stood to gain from such trading. **********''We have continuing investigations,'' said John S. R. Shad, the chairman of the S.E.C. ''It's certainly not the end of it.'' **********Mr. Boesky may have been part of more insider trading rings than the one he joined with Dennis B. Levine, a Wall Street merger specialist who was apprehended by the S.E.C. last summer and who led the agency to Mr. Boesky. Incentive to Cooperate **********Mr. Boesky, like Mr. Levine, has agreed to cooperate with Government officials and has an incentive to do so -to possibly stay out of jail or to get a minimum sentence if he is convicted. **********''You can see the evolution of this,'' Mr. Shad said. A senior Administration official, who declined to be identified, said that ''Boesky was a user of information'' about corporate takeovers and mergers.'' The official added: ''There is always a question of sources of information - lawyers, officers and directors of companies, and investment bankers who assist companies in takeovers. Boesky used information from these kinds of sources.'' **********The S.E.C.'s settlement with Mr. Boesky - his payment, from his personal, rather than corporate funds, of a $50 million fine for illegal trading and of $50 million more representing his profits from the trading - has stunned Wall Street. It shows that the Government, after years of frustration, has finally devised methods to spot the kind of trading in which Mr. Boesky and Mr. Levine participated, and has turned the corner in its efforts to curb a crime from which the few profited at the expense of the many. **********The Boesky affair has also abruptly altered perceptions of a Government agency that had been tainted by morale problems and an image of ineffectiveness. Seven civil-servant attorneys at the S.E.C., five men and two women, all in their 30's except for one in his 40's, worked endless hours, chasing countless fruitless leads. **********They wrestled with the nation's leading private-sector securities lawyers and examined thousands of computerized stock-trading records in the effort that led them first to Mr. Levine, and then to Mr. Boesky. **********Shortly after taking office five years ago, when Wall Street experts were saying that insider trading appeared unstoppable, Mr. Shad told some newspaper reporters that he would to go after the trading with ''hobnail boots.'' But it took work and major changes in the agency's investigation procedures, so not until last summer, with the Levine case, did the young enforcers begin to produce noteworthy results. **********Many observers of the S.E.C. said they expected other cases. The head of the commission's Boesky team, Gary L. Lynch, 36, the director of enforcement, would only say that ''we intend to pursue vigorously.'' Unusual News Conference **********The results of the S.E.C.'s work in the Boesky case became public on Friday, when Mr. Shad called an unusual news conference in the agency's auditorium at 4:30 P.M., just as the financial markets in New York closed. Of its 30-some insider trading cases over the past year, this one, unlike any other, involved a big enough figure, with big enough stock holdings and influence, to affect the course of the entire market. **********Mr. Boesky was the biggest of the risk arbitragers, traders who buy and sell the stock of companies that already are, or are likely to become, the trading object of other companies' takeover efforts. Like any other trader, they try to buy low and sell high, risking that the takeover might not go through. **********It is a perfectly legal business, except when traders learn something the public does not know and use it to their advantage in the market. ''That's like playing in a poker game when one guy is playing with marked cards,'' Mr. Shad said. The S.E.C. said Mr. Boesky had marked cards. **********He agreed to buy inside information from Mr. Levine and used it to make about $50 million for himself and the investors he represented in takeovers involving such companies as Nabisco Brands, Houston Natural Gas, the FMC Corporation, American Natural Resources, Boise Cascade, General Mills and Union Carbide. **********As part of his settlement Mr. Boesky agreed to turn over $100 million, half in what the S.E.C. calls ''disgorged'' profits, and half as a fine. He has paid the $50 million in illegal profits in cash and cash equivalents, such as certificates of deposit, to the S.E.C.'s appointed escrow agent, David E. Weisberg, a New York attorney. Injury Difficult to Prove **********Most of these funds are to be used to make payments on valid claims by investors who can show they were injured by Mr. Boesky's trading. Such injury is difficult to prove, but even if such claims fail, none of the money will be returned to Mr. Boesky. **********Mr. Boesky has provided the other $50 million - the fine to be paid to the Treasury - in the form of his personal holdings in two publicly traded companies. One is the Northview Corporation of Beverly Hills, Calif., a company that owns hotels and motels and stock market investments. Mr. Boesky has given Mr. Weisberg 5.8 million shares, or 6 percent of the outstanding stock, which is traded over the counter. **********The other company is Cambrian and General Securities, a British investment trust, which is similar to a mutual fund, and which is traded on the London Stock Exchange. Mr. Boesky held two classes of stock in Cambrian and General, capital and common. He has transferred to the escrow agent 8.5 million capital shares, representing 72 percent of those outstanding, and 193,827 common shares, or 18 percent of those outstanding. The escrow agent is expected to sell the holdings in the two companies at prices assuring that the Treasury receives the $50 million. **********But the companies, the S.E.C. said, are separate from Mr. Boesky's principal operation, through which he conducted trading for himself and other investors, the Ivan F. Boesky Company at 650 Fifth Avenue. Mr. Boesky is required to withdraw from management of the New York company, with a delay of 19 months to assure an orderly transition. For the period of the transition, the Government has appointed Gerald F. Rath, a Boston attorney, as ''special compliance agent.'' **********''He will be an independent presence there,'' said Harvey L. Pitt, Mr. Boesky's chief attorney and a former general counsel at the S.E.C. Mr. Rath, Mr. Pitt said, is a prominent litigator, specializing in securities law compliance. The S.E.C. added that he was selected because he is free of conflict with any of Mr. Boesky's businesses or associates. **********The settlement with the S.E.C., like any, involved concessions on both sides. The law permits a fine of up to three times the $50 million that Mr. Boesky was assessed. In a plea bargain, Mr. Boesky's criminal liability was limited to a single count. And the Boesky company's business, and its affiliates, were permitted to continue without his involvement after the 18 months. Agreement on Businesses **********''We agreed that we were not going to bring cases against businesses in which he had operational control,'' said John H. Sturc, 36-year-old associate enforcement director at the S.E.C. and the official who managed most of the investigation for Mr. Lynch. **********The S.E.C., for its part, got from Mr. Boesky his cooperation in future investigations, as it did from Mr. Levine, and this accounts in part for the agency's confidence that the Boesky case will lead to others. **********No one - at the S.E.C., among the securities lawyers who deal with it, or on Wall Street - would discuss where, to what companies or to what firms, new investigations might lead. The S.E.C. has a tighter net of secrecy over these investigations than usual. ''This is one we simply didn't talk about'' outside the team, said Therese D. Pritchard, 33, an assistant enforcement director. **********Improved technology has also aided the S.E.C. in dealing with insider trading. Four years ago, Mr. Shad called in the executives of the stock exchanges and urged them to develop more sophisticated systems - electronic surveillance systems and transaction audit systems that would leave detailed records of transactions and that would also, as a benefit to the industry, enhance its efficiency. **********When Mr. Levine disclosed the information he had passed on to Mr. Boesky and when he did it, the S.E.C. enforcement team was able to verify his disclosures against the industry's surveillance and audit trails."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/21/business/company-briefs-550586.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 263, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "print_headline": "COMPANY BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Barris Industries, Beverly Hills, Calif., said its chairman, Chuck Barris, would sell two million shares of the company, or 23 percent of the outstanding stock, for $13 each to Giant Group Ltd.

''It continues to be heavily exposed to a very soft commercial real estate market.'' **********Some analysts, however, believe Integrated has already shifted its business emphasis enough to protect it from the new proposals. The company has been offering increasing amounts of investment programs that are oriented to income and capital appreciation rather than tax benefits. **********Stanley Goldring, director of the Katz, Goldring division of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, said that at one time Integrated derived 75 percent of its revenues from real estate tax shelters but that it had diversified to the point where only 25 percent of its revenues came from that source. The company had $430 million in guaranteed outstandinng indebtedness of various limited partnerships as of March 31, and $502 million in stockholders equity. Integrated declined to comment on its diversification efforts or the tax proposals' possible impact. **********After the new tax plan was presented on May 7, the stock of the Manhattan-based company dropped $6.25 a share, to $30.75. It subsequently fell to as low as $22.625 a share and yesterday closed at $26.25, off 12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. Integrated's 52-week high is $40.25. **********C. Wendel Tewell, executive director of Morgan Grenfell USA, says that the new tax bill will severely restrict the ability of Integrated Resources to syndicate tax-shelter transactions to the individual investor market. ''To compensate, the company may further increase its emphasis on income-oriented funds,'' Mr. Tewell said. ''It remains to be seen whether the investor acceptance and syndicator profits produced from tax shelter partnerships will ever be matched by income funds in the individual investor market.'' **********About 46 percent of Integrated's $440 million in revenues and about 41 percent of the company's $49.8 million in 1985 earnings came from its investment programs. These programs are generally in the form of limited partnerships that acquire and own real estate, equipment and other properties. Insurance operations accounted for 38 percent of Integrated's revenues and 39 percent of profits. **********Under terms of the new tax proposals, investors in a limited partnership cannot deduct a loss that is generated from that partnership against ordinary income. They can only deduct from income that is generated from other limited partnerships. The bill, therefore, eliminates the viability of the benefits generated solely from a tax-benefit standpoint. **********The Senate proposal also lengthens the depreciation period for real estate to 27.5 years from 19 for residential property and to 31.5 years for commercial buildings, lowering the depreciation write-offs and accounting losses in the early years of an investment. Also, partners in a project would pay taxes of 27 percent of any gains under the new proposals instead of 20 percent or less. **********''The big earnings push that I envisioned the company would have in 1986 has been really pushed back to the fourth quarter of 1986 and into 1987,'' Mr. Goldring of Ladenburg said. ''Until the tax bill is passed and signed, uncertainty over exactly what the bill will be will continue to throttle sales, earnings and equity appreciation.'' He said that this uncertainty should end by fall. Mr. Goldring said he considered Integrated as a ''hold.'' ''I believe earnings for 1986 should be about the same as the $2.04 a share it earned in 1985,'' he said. ''My estimate for 1987 is about $4 a share.'' **********Integrated's earnings for 1985 were hurt not only by uncertainty over the proposed tax law changes but also by a 72-cent-a-share charge related to curtailments at its energy division. **********Mr. Goldring said that he did not think Integrated's stock had much further downside risk until the tax bill was clearly defined and that it should trade in a narrow range until then. ''Long-term, I think the stock could double over the next 12 to 18 months,'' he said. **********Mr. Grant also pointed out that Integrated had beefed up its life insurance business and started a money management division that excelled last year although it had not yet generated meaningful revenues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/world/chile-arms-caches-are-laid-to-cuba.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1986-10-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 887, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHILE ARMS CACHES ARE LAID TO CUBA", "print_headline": "CHILE ARMS CACHES ARE LAID TO CUBA", "body_text": " **********United States weapons experts have accused Cuba of providing the arms found hidden in several caches in Chile recently. The experts say the amount of weapons was too large for Chilean guerrillas to have acquired on their own. **********In a summary of a study made available to reporters by Reagan Administration officials recently, the experts said the weapons appeared to be part of ''sophisticated plans for a protracted conflict, rather than for a series of quick, hit-and-run operations designed to harass'' Chilean Government forces. **********The unidentified experts who prepared the study said about 70 tons of munitions, including more than 3,300 American-made M-16 rifles and more than two million rounds of ammunition, was the largest clandestine leftist arsenal ever found in this hemisphere. **********The arms, much of which are now stacked in a vast storeroom at the century-old War Arsenals complex in Santiago, were found buried at 10 sites from early August through early September. Most of the places were around the southern edge of the Atacama Desert, about 400 miles north of Santiago. Soviet Role Assumed **********Robert S. Gelbard, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South America, said in a telephone interview that the United States considered the discovery of the arms a sign of a ''major threat to the hemisphere.'' He said American officials intended to raise the issue with the Soviet Government. **********''We feel very strongly about this,'' he said. ''We know it is Cuba who did it, and we assume the Soviet Union is behind it.'' **********Mr. Gelbard said the United States intended to prevent Chile from becoming ''the site of an East-West confrontation.'' He said the Soviet Union and Cuba were being ''very provocative'' and appeared to be seeking such a confrontation here. **********Mr. Gelbard also said copies of the arms report were sent this week to 30 to 40 governments in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Mostly U.S.-Made Arms **********According to an inventory provided by the Chilean intelligence service, the Center for National Information, the arms cache included 3,383 used M-16 rifles, more than two million rounds of 5.56-millimeter ammunition for the rifles, 117 Soviet-made rocket launchers, 179 American-made light antitank weapons, about 2,000 rocket-propelled grenades, tons of explosives and miscellaneous other weapons and ammunition. **********The serial numbers of all but 18 of the M-16's had been filed off, the report said. But United States officials said checks made on 10 of those rifles traced them to guns sent to South Vietnam from 1967 to 1969. After the fall of the Saigon Government in 1975, large numbers of the rifles fell into the hands of the Hanoi Government. **********Most of the antitank weapons and much of the rifle ammunition was made in the early 1970's and was also among arms sent to American and South Vietnamese forces, the experts said. Most of the Soviet-bloc equipment was made more recently, they said, including the 2,000 grenades, which were made in Bulgaria in 1984. **********''The cost of the weapons found and the logistical problems associated with moving them probably put an effort of this scale beyond the resources of any Chilean terrorist group acting independently,'' the study said. Cuba Called Supplier **********It added, ''Hanoi has not sold its captured U.S. ordnance to private dealers, and information regarding the other Latin American countries where these arms have turned up points to Cuba as the regional supplier.'' **********The experts said the discovery of Vietnam-era weapons fit a pattern of arms found since 1980 in the hands of leftist fighters in Central America, Colombia and Jamaica. **********Chilean military intelligence officers said in recent interviews that they believed the arms were linked to a plan, backed by the Soviet Union, Cuba and Nicaragua, to place in Chile large numbers of leftist exiles trained to lead an insurrection. They said the weapons were intended for the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, the larger of the two Marxist-Leninist guerrilla groups in Chile, the other being the Leftist Revolutionary Movement. **********Although conceding that he, like American officials, was surprised to find so many weapons, one of the Chilean officers said the quantity was ''relative to the interest of the Soviet Union in Chile historically.'' President Also Heads Army **********The President of Chile, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who also commands the army, has long contended that Chile is a special target of Marxism-Leninism globally because it is ''the only nation that threw off the Communist yoke.'' His allusion is to the 1973 coup against President Salvador Allende Gossens. **********The Chilean intelligence officers said a major use of the hidden weapons was to have been for 200 to 230 exiles who had returned to Chile in recent years. They said the exiles had undergone military training in Nicaragua or Cuba and that more were being trained. **********The American experts said guerrilla training schools were also found at some of the locations. Their report said this was another indication that the insurgents planned a ''long-term effort to build up the ability to seriously confront the Chilean security forces.'' **********Until now, leftist guerrillas in Chile had been considered capable of mounting only isolated acts of violence, such as blowing up electric towers, not of organizing an armed insurrection."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/world/filipinos-talking-out-ways-to-avert-a-crisis.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1986-11-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 667, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FILIPINOS 'TALKING OUT' WAYS TO AVERT A CRISIS", "print_headline": "FILIPINOS 'TALKING OUT' WAYS TO AVERT A CRISIS", "body_text": " **********Envoys crisscrossed Manila today between the Defense Ministry and the palace in an effort to defuse a Government crisis that has raised fears of a coup. **********''There's a lot of talk going on by a lot of intermediaries,'' said one of the envoys before heading for Malacanang Palace.

Marcos from office, the military has been treated with distrust by her Government, he said. Voices of Discontent **********He said the officers close to Mr. Enrile were voicing the discontent of many in the military. This discontent has been fueled by the creation of a presidential commission to investigate human rights violations by the military. **********Mr. Enrile has said he felt excluded from Mrs. Aquino's Government much as he did from the that of Mr. Marcos, in which he was also Defense Minister. **********Political analysts here often debate the question of whether Mr. Enrile is determined to seize the presidency or would be satisfied to dominate a government headed by Mrs. Aquino. **********A Cabinet official close to the President agreed today that the military was trying to maintain the influence in government it has held since Mr. Marcos declared martial law in 1972.

The Organizations **********International Monetary Fund: Created at the Bretton Woods monetary conference in 1944, it originally represented 44 countries. Today that number has climbed to 151. The organization's objective is stability in the world economy. It makes short-term loans to ailing economies, often setting tough terms requiring changes in borrowers' economic policies. The terms then become the standard for subsequent bank lending. The managing director is Jacques de Larosiere, a French economist. **********World Bank: Formally the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, it could be called the sister of the I.M.F. The bank has the same membership as the I.M.F., but its objective is improving living standards in developing countries. Historically it has emphasized long-term ''project'' lending such as the installation of power plants and communications systems. The bank now does more I.M.F.-like ''policy-based'' lending. The bank has two affiliates: the International Development Association, which makes concessionary loans to the poorest countries, and the International Finance Corporation, which lends to private borrowers in developing countries. The new World Bank president is Barber Conable Jr., a former Republican Congressman from upstate New York. **********Group of 10: Actually consists of 11 countries: the United States, West Germany, France, Britain, Japan, Italy, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Created under the auspices of the I.M.F., its authority has been largely eclipsed by the major industrialized members, but it is a vehicle through which issues before the smaller groups are brought to the I.M.F. **********Group of 24: An I.M.F. committee of finance ministers of 24 developing countries. They are nominated by a still larger Group of 77, which meets regularly to set the agenda for the developing countries at the annual meetings.  The Key Issues **********1) Various groups are negotiating ways to coordinate economic policies of the major industrialized countries. **********2) The banks might agree to make their half of a $12 billion, I.M.F.-designed loan to Mexico. Such an agreement would mark significant progress for Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d's plan to relax terms of lending in return for debtors' adoption of growth-oriented economic policies. **********3) The developing countries will seek relief from the effects of falling prices for commodities, on which they rely for economic growth, and from the protectionist practices of developed countries. They will also seek increases in lending from developed countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/business/japan-s-bug-push-on-wall-street.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Bennett", "pub_date": "1986-02-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2848, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN'S BUG PUSH ON WALL STREET", "print_headline": "JAPAN'S BUG PUSH ON WALL STREET", "body_text": " **********WHEN Yoshitoki Chino, the chairman of the Daiwa Securities Company, visited Daiwa's New York subsidiary last fall, he was upset about the Japanese art on the walls.

But they have not attempted to sell themselves as stock brokers serving the average American investor - a business that requires a huge network of brokers and branch offices. **********''We have to start as a niche player, building up good people and good research,'' said Akira Shimizu, president of Nomura Securities International Inc., the firm's American unit. **********In their pursuit of the government securities market, both Daiwa and Nomura have asked the Federal Reserve to make them primary dealers - a status that would put them in the inner circle of banks and investment houses that operate directly with the Fed in this gigantic market. **********Finally, Nomura and Daiwa are becoming major players in raising new capital for American corporations. According to one story, an American oil company recently wanted to raise money through a bond issue in Europe and invited a number of banks and securities firms to a meeting in New York to bid for the underwriting business. Each firm's representative was put in a separate room and the oil company's officials walked from room to room, playing one firm against another. Finally, the Nomura representative said to the oil company official: ''Don't worry, we'll beat any bid you get.'' When told that anecdote, Yoshio Terasawa, chairman of Nomura Securities International, the firm's American unit, just smiled and said, ''we can be very, very competitive.'' **********''The Japanese securities companies are more interested in market share than in making short-term profits, and they use predatory pricing techniques,'' says Steven B. Schlossstein, a specialist in Japanese securities. **********Both Nomura and Daiwa have been learning the hard way that the tactics that have worked so well for Japanese auto makers and electronics companies may not work on Wall Street. The problem is salaries and promotions. The Japanese firms are said to pay about 5 percent above the going Wall Street salaries to attract American executives, but that often is not enough to attract the best people, who feel the jobs are a dead end. Most of the top jobs go to the Japanese, although Daiwa has changed that policy substantially. **********Recruiting and keeping stock and bond traders can be even harder. Until very recently Japanese securities firms have refused to pay the commissions and bonuses that are an integral part of the compensation for traders at American firms. Only last month two of Nomura's top stock traders - William J. King and Joan McCullough - quit in a dispute over bonuses. Others also have been leaving for better offers elsewhere. **********Still, Nomura's American employees are earning more than its Japanese executives of similar rank in the United States. And, in a sharp break from tradition, some of these young Japanese are jumping ship to join American firms. Ten of Nomura International's 38 Japanese executives have left in the last year or so. **********''When we hire a Japanese we expect him to stay for life,'' said Mr. Terasawa. Nomura, he continued, has invested heavily in these young people, sending many abroad to business schools such as Harvard, and then, after intensive training in Japan, they are assigned to New York or London at about 35 years of age. **********''They are the delicious part of the body, the filet mignon,'' said the 48-year-old Mr. Terasawa, himself a product of the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania. Pointing to the open door of his office, he said: ''When a Japanese employee comes in and shuts the door behind him, I know he's going to tell me he's going to Merrill Lynch or some other American firm.'' Mr. Terasawa, resigned to what he is about to hear, toys a bit with the young executive. ''Before he can say a word, I tell him how happy Nomura is to have him with us,'' Mr. Terasawa said. **********The Japanese are learning, however. ''This is a people business,'' said the 49-year-old Mr. Shimizu. ''It cannot be compared to selling automobiles. The quality of people is what counts.'' And the pressures are bringing change. Determined to restructure its personnel policies, Nomura last month hired Stanley Lomax away from Shearson Lehman where he had been in charge of personnel. **********In other areas, too, the Japanese push to become a major Wall Street presence is meeting resistance. The applications of Nomura and Daiwa -and also of Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - to be primary dealers in Treasury securities are raising cries of foul in Washington, mostly from lobbyists for competing American investment houses. The Americans are urging the Fed to reject the applications until Japan allows more American investment houses to buy seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. So far only three firms, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have been authorized to become members of the Tokyo exchange. **********''If there's one industry where the United States can dominate, securities should be the one,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat. The Japanese response is that they deserve to be primary dealers if only because of the huge amounts of Treasury securities that are being shipped home for purchase by Japanese investors. Japanese securities firms, for example, are estimated to have purchased more than 60 percent of the $4.75 billion in 20-year bonds that were sold at the United States Treasury's January auction. **********''The Japanese securities firms are doing the United States a favor by being here,'' says Yoshi Tsurumi, professor of international business at Baruch College. ''Last year they helped finance the budget deficit by bringing in about $40 billion from Japan.'' **********The thrust by the Japanese securities firms into the United States is at least partly defensive. With the heavy demand in Japan for American securities, the Japanese houses fear they will lose some of their domestic customers to foreign firms if they fail to offer a full range of international services. **********Indeed, the Japanese battle to grow on Wall Street is part of the struggle of securities firms everywhere to go international in order to survive. More and more deals made in one market are linked through arcane arrangements to markets elsewhere. **********So far, the Japanese are having a hard time moving at the pace required to succeed on Wall Street. An American employee at one Japanese securities firm related that a year ago the company had wanted to get into options trading in the United States. Instead of quickly hiring experts and jumping into the business, it set up study committees - and sought permission from the parent company in Japan, which also wanted to study the proposal. In addition, the firm needed permission from the Ministry of Finance in Japan, which reportedly did not understand the concept and which also wanted time for study. As a result, the Japanese securities firm still has not gotten into the options business and, in the meantime, so many other firms have that profit margins have been cut and it no longer seems very profitable. **********Toshio Mori, chairman of Nikko Securities, which has been moving more slowly into the United States than Daiwa and Nomura, stresses the cultural differences. Mr. Mori, who has spent 11 years in New York and 6 in Los Angeles, says he has learned that when he argues with an American he can never say ''you are wrong or you are right.'' Using his hands to emphasis his point, Mr. Mori says that with Americans ''never go crosswise, always go parallel.'' **********Americans who work for Japanese firms say they have difficulty with the Japanese approach to problems. The Japanese, says Mr. King, the former Nomura equities trader, ''never deal directly with a problem. At Salomon Brothers you would have your fight, the top executives would handle it, and it would be over. But at Japanese firms the problems simmer, never reaching the surface.'' **********Daiwa appears to have had more success than Nomura in drawing and keeping Americans, and even promoting them to high positions. Mr. Aron, for example, the 64-year-old American vice chairman of Daiwa Securities America, also bears the title of chief executive. He joined Daiwa in 1976 after having been investment manager for the College Retirement Equities Fund. Before that, he said, he had been the No. 1 investment manager for all foreign securities and the No. 2 investment manager for all domestic securities at the Dreyfus Fund. **********Mr. Aron, however, is not Daiwa America's only chief executive. Takuro Isoda, chairman of the New York subisidiary, also carries that title, and there is little doubt that the lithe, 49-year-old Japanese executive, who last December was named a managing director of the parent company, is the ultimate boss. **********Even at Daiwa, melding the two cultures is not always easy. Mr. Aron tells the story of a visit from Tokyo by Sadakane Doi, president of the parent company. Mr. Doi was tired and wanted to sit down. But because Mr. Aron was older than Mr. Doi it would have been inappropriate under Japanese custom for Mr. Doi to sit while Mr. Aron stood. Mr. Doi asked Mr. Isoda to ask Mr. Aron to sit. **********Still, a walk through the crowded, narrow aisles of Daiwa's offices indicates enthusiasm among its American employees. The offices, on the 41st floor of Merrill Lynch's Wall Street headquarters, are abuzz with activity. Video terminals are piled on top of each other and traders -American and Japanese - appear to have an easy relationship. Workmen are busy pulling wires out of the raised floor preparing for a move to the new World Financial Center, where Daiwa will have four times the space it now occupies - between 60,000 and 70,000 square feet. **********Daiwa's biggest catch to date has been William M. Brachfeld, a trim 51-year-old whose credentials are based on the fact that he had been a general partner of Salomon Brothers in charge of its fixed-income activities, the same job he now holds at Daiwa. A Saab-owner and jogger who lives in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, Mr. Brachfeld left Salomon in 1978 after working there 21 years. He attributes his departure to a disagreement with the other partners. After leaving Salomon, Mr. Brachfeld joined Blythe Eastman Dillon, where he spent a year, and following that he traded for his own account until he joined Daiwa last July. **********Getting Mr. Brachfeld was especially important for Daiwa, since he has attracted other experienced Americans to the Japanese firm. ''Bill Brachfeld is the reason I've come here, not because it's Daiwa,'' said 49-year-old Arthur Doyle, a former bond salesman at Paine Webber and a graduate of Fordham University. In fact, Mr. Brachfeld raided Paine Webber to put together a large part of his team. In addition to Mr. Doyle, there is Gilbert Clark, who had been responsible for Paine Webber's government department, and Stuart Gantman, who had been a Paine Webber salesman. **********But Daiwa also has its problems with departing Americans. Daniel Schwartz, for example, who had been in Daiwa's corporate finance department since 1983, left recently to join the New York office of Paribas, a French investment bank. Mr. Schwartz speaks kindly of Daiwa, but says he was offered better opportunities at Paribas. **********The personnel problems are more onerous at Nomura. Although it has started paying commissions to its traders, it continues to lose some of its best. One was Michael G. Steuerer, who left Nomura last month to join Morgan Stanley & Company. ''There are better opportunities here,'' he said. **********But it is the loss of Nomura's young Japanese employees that is most upsetting to Mr. Terasawa. These departures are partly because Nomura has been paying its Japanese executives - who are usually based in New York for seven years or so -far less than what it pays Americans in comparable jobs. Mr. Tsurumi of Baruch College estimates that top American traders at Japanese firms usually earn from $100,000 to $300,000 a year, compared with a range of only $50,000 to $60,000 for their Japanese counterparts. ''The gap must be narrowed,'' Mr. Tsurumi said. **********For his part, Mr. Terasawa argues that Japanese employees should have longer-term views and that rewards for good work eventually will come, even if it takes decades. But that does not always sell well among the Japanese as they become accustomed to the free-wheeling, highly paid American market. And Mr. Terasawa himself admits that Nomura's very growth is making it harder to retain the Japanese who are sent to New York. When he first came here in 1956 he was one of a handful of young Japanese sent overseas and his move into Nomura's top ranks was assured. Today, with dozens being sent here, New York is no longer the certain corporate stepping stone it once was. **********Mr. Terasawa also blames the parent company for not giving the overseas offices the prestige he believes they deserve. Nomura's overseas activities now account for about 10 percent of its profits, up from only 1 or 2 percent a decade or so ago. Yet power within the company remains firmly entrenched in Japan. His promotion last December to executive vice president of the parent company -one of the five No. 2 spots at Nomura - will give ''a tremendous boost to morale, not only to Nomura people but to people in the international end of the securities business at Daiwa and Nikko, too,'' Mr. Terasawa said. ADAPTINGTO N.Y. Yoshio Terasawa, chairman of Nomura Securities International, goes swimming every day at the New York Athletic Club, and often goes shopping at Brooks Brothers during lunch. **********Takuro Isoda, chairman of Daiwa Securities America, is married to an American of Japanese descent and has spent most of his working years abroad. **********The two men are what Yoshi Tsurumi, professor of international business at Baruch College, describes as ''the new breed of Japanese business executive.'' Both are charged by their parent companies in Tokyo with bridging the gap between the East and the West - a responsibility that is reflected in their personal as well as their business lives. Both, for example, are known in the Japanese community as ''Manhattan bachelors,'' who live in apartments provided by their firms while their wives spend most of their time in Japan where their children are being schooled. **********Only two years after Mr. Terasawa, who is 48, joined Nomura in 1954, he was sent on a Fulbright scholarship for two years to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. While there, he also worked as a Nomura account executive. **********Mr. Terasawa returned to Tokyo in 1959 and, in 1968, was transferred back to New York for seven more years. Reassigned to Tokyo in 1975, he returned again in 1980. **********The 49-year-old Mr. Isoda's overseas experience has been more varied. Shortly after joining Daiwa in 1959, he was sent to Honolulu for four years (where he met his wife), and then went to London for two more, assigned to Daiwa's office there. After London, he was stationed in Frankfurt, where he stayed for almost nine years before returning to Tokyo. In 1984, he was sent to New York."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/business/company-news-continental-bank.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Continental Bank", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Continental Bank", "body_text": " **********The board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has decided not to oppose the proposed takeover of three small Illinois banks, with about $170 million in total assets, by the Continental Illinois Bank and Trust Company of Chicago.

But, he might have been referring to another issue, that of the proposed sale of a state-owned television station to a private buyer, that has become a kind of early-summer festival of argument, of demonstrations, of newspaper headlines and protest. **********The immediate issue is the decision by the new conservative Government to sell a state-owned television network into private hands. The Socialist opposition has harshly criticized the proposal, apparently hoping to turn it to political advantage. Petitions have circulated, television journalists have twice gone on strike and cultural figures, describing themselves as ''artists and creators,'' have marched on the streets and denounced the sale as a bit of treachery to ''the fabulous patrimony of the imagination.'' Debate Small by Comparison **********Last week Jean-Paul Aron, a sociologist and historian of ideas, was trying to determine why the French were so bothered by the issue. His answer was that other things have bothered the French even more. Some 3,000 ''artists and creators'' may have recently marched on the street, but two years ago, a million people demonstrated against a Socialist proposal to reduce the independence of the country's religious schools. **********Nonetheless, Mr. Aron said, ''France is a very conservative country that experiences discomfort when it sees old habits shaken.'' **********''Don't forget,'' he continued, ''that France is a country of institutions, and, while television hasn't been around that long, it is nonetheless conceived of as part of institutional life.'' **********The other explanation is that the French, perhaps more than other peoples, savor a certain absurdity in their debates, as they witness the process by which the intellectual ''ritual murder'' takes on a life of its own to the point where the original issue that provoked the debate becomes obscured. 'Black Art' of a 'Strange Country' **********''This is our black art,'' said the magazine editorial writer, Jacques Julliard, who called France a ''strange country.'' **********''It is this baroque mix of the serious and the derisory,'' he added. **********At a recent cocktail party, Michele Alliot-Marie, a Deputy Minister of Education in the conserative Government, was asked why the television debate had so captured the intellectual attention of the French. **********''You know,'' Ms. Alliot-Marie said, ''the French never get excited over the really important things.'' **********An element of the unfolding controversy almost entirely lost in the debate is that the conservative party that now formulates policy in France, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic, was opposed to the idea of private television during its long previous tenure in power, which ended in 1981. Socialists Broke State Monopoly **********It was the Socialists who finally broke the long state monopoly on private broadcasting last year, first permitting private radio stations and then licensing two private television channels, both of which began broadcasting earlier this year. Last year, in fact, the conservatives bitterly accused the Socialists of political favoratism when the license for the first private channel was given to a group with personal ties to President Francois Mitterrand. **********But the political opponents have reversed sides, with the Socialists bitterly criticizing the Government for, in essence, scheming to turn Channel One over to a private group that will support them politically. **********''The purpose of the Government is purely political,'' Jack Lang, the Socialist former Minister of Culture, said. ''All this talk about culture is just that - talk. For Chirac, the objective is to become President of the Republic, and what he does he does for that end.'' **********The debate over the political effects of the plan is enhanced by the fact that only two groups have emerged as serious contenders to buy the state-owned network, both of them pro-conservative. The most conspicuously political is Robert Hersant, a conservative deputy himself and the owner of 18 daily newspapers, most of which have been transformed into organs of conservative, anti-Socialist opinion. Fear of Rightist Propaganda **********If Mr. Hersant were to gain control of T.F.1, as Channel One is generally called here, it would be tantamount to turning over this country's largest televison network to a rightist propagandist, the Socialists and other anti-privatization advocates say. **********Earlier this year, the other major candidate for the network, the large publishing company Hachette, took control of a national radio station, Europe One. A few weeks ago, the station dismissed one of its commentators, Jean-Francois Kahn, who happened also to be the co-sponsor of one of the main anti-privatization petitions circulated among ''artists and creators'' here. The reason given for the dismissal was that Mr. Kahn was publicly against the T.F.1 sale. **********''There are sharks swimming around the television stations in order to devour them,'' Mr. Kahn said, referring apparently to Hachette and others. **********Mr. Kahn's dismissal sent a chill through many of the French who felt that the move refected an unwelcome indication of the sorts of political restrictions that might be imposed if either Hachette or Mr. Hersant gained control of the national network. Low Opinion of Private Television **********Another aspect of the general opposition to the sale of the state-owned network is the belief in France that private television is low-quality television. **********The privatized station would be similar to television in the United States, which is assumed in France to be aweful. **********But a figure in the debate challenged the assumption. Claude Sarraute, a humor columnist for Le Monde, shocked many here when she said that quality might well improve if Channel One went private, and she hinted at a condescending elitism on the part of those who assumed the contrary. **********''People are less dumb than the responsible paternalists of the public sector think they are,'' Miss Sarraute wrote in Le Monde. If television stations have to compete for an audience, there is no assurance that quality will diminish, she wrote."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/06/world/soviet-arms-pact-breaches-charges-questioned.html": {"writer_name": "Charles Mohr", "pub_date": "1986-06-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1974, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET ARMS PACT BREACHES: CHARGES QUESTIONED", "print_headline": "SOVIET ARMS PACT BREACHES: CHARGES QUESTIONED", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Union has not breached key provisions of the 1979 arms pact, according to data cited by critics of President Reagan's announced policy of ending adherence to the treaty terms. **********According to Government figures cited by the critics, the Soviet Union dismantled or replaced more than 1,200 launchers of nuclear weapons to remain within the limits of a 1972 interim agreement and the 1979 treaty. **********There is general agreement that the even more significant detailed limits on missiles carrying multiple warheads and on aircraft with the flying bombs called cruise missiles have not been breached by the Soviet Union. **********The critics, who include members of Congress and former officials, contend that if the President carries out his intention to end adherence to the terms of the unratified 1979 treaty, the nuclear balance may shift in Moscow's favor. U.S. Accused Soviet of Breaches **********The treaty was signed at the end of a second series of strategic arms limitation talks, known as SALT II. Although neither side has ratified the treaty, they said they would keep within its provisions as long as the other side did. **********Mr. Reagan recently decided to abandon the treaty, on the ground that the Soviet Union has been breaking key provisions. The Soviet Union has denied the American charges. **********According to the critics of President Reagan's decision, a mutual abandonment of treaty restraints could degrade the United States' ability to gather intelligence on Soviet forces and give the Russians enough nuclear warheads to threaten the ability of a proposed United States mobile missile to survive attack when it becomes operational in the early 1990's. **********The critics believe that most of the purported Soviet breaches are ambiguous or of marginal importance to American national security, and that greater efforts should be made to resolve them through negotiations. **********One of the critics of the new American policy, Jack Mendelsohn, a former arms negotiator who is now a deputy director of the Arms Control Association, a private group, said: **********''I believe the Administration has not made a convincing case and could not attack SALT II on the central core provisions.'' **********Senator Albert Gore Jr., Democrat of Tennessee, said the Soviet Union has ''scrupulously abided by the numerical limits with a few marginal exceptions.'' He said that in complaining of increases in warheads permitted by the treaty, the Administration did not explain that new launchers displaced older weapons on a one-for-one basis. **********He and other critics such as Paul C. Warnke and Gerard C. Smith, former arms negotiators, and Representative Les Aspin also say that abandonment of the 1979 treaty provisions would be disadvantageous to the United States in the near term. Arithmetic Said to Favor Soviet **********They reason that the Soviet Union's heaviest missile, the SS-18, is limited by treaty to 10 warheads. Intelligence specialists believe it can now accommodate four more. If the 308 SS-18 missiles are refitted with four more warheads each, the warhead total would rise by 1,232. **********The United States, on the other hand, plans to deploy 50 10-warhead MX missiles starting in late 1986. But the MX must be deployed in silos now used by three-warhead Minuteman 3 missiles, for a net increase of only 350 warheads. **********''It seems to me,'' Mr. Smith says, ''that this decision does not reflect any cost counting.'' **********The critics are especially disturbed by two passages in President Reagan's statement announcing the new policy. **********One was that he did not ''anticipate any appreciable numerical growth in U.S. strategic forces,'' which may be an admission that no pragmatic response to an accelerated arms race is available. **********The other is that the United States ''will not deploy more strategic ballistic missile warheads than does the Soviet Union.'' Since that sentence did not mention submarine-carried missiles or bomber forces in which the United States is superior, the critics fear that it threatens a move to match the Soviet Union in its strong suit of land-based missiles and may thus mean an effort to substitute American superiority for nuclear parity. **********The issue of whether the Soviet Union has breached provisions of the 1979 arms pact involves three basic issues - encryption, or the coding of missile test-flight signals; the provision allowing for one new type of land-based missile, and the total number of delivery vehicles. **********The test-flight signals transmit a variety of engineering data to ground stations of the testing nation, and can be monitored by the other nation. The 1979 treaty gives each party the right to use coding, except when it will ''impede verification'' of adherence to treaty provisions. **********The signals include such information as combustion, temperatures of the rocket fuel, fuel consumption per second, missile acceleration and speed.From this information, it is possible to estimate the accuracy of missiles. **********The treaty gives the other side no right to uncoded access to the data. Only information needed to verify such treaty provisions as the number of re-entry vehicles, each of which carries a warhead, the number of rocket stages and the launch weight and throw-weight should be unimpeded. Other Sources of Information **********Such information as the number of re-entry vehicles can be gathered by American radars and by other means independent of telemetry. **********The critics of the Administration say that Soviet negotiators asked the United States to specify what data it needs that is being denied, but that American officials refuse to do so on the ground that this would reveal too much about the information the United States is gathering. **********An official of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said, ''We have enough data to make the accusation of noncompliance, but there is additional data we would like to have that involves treaty verification.'' **********He declined to be specific, calling it a ''Catch 22 situation'' in which the Government feels it cannot offer detailed proof of its accusation. **********Richard N. Perle, an Assistant Secretary of Defense who has been critical of arms control agreements, said in an interview that the Russians ''don't necessarily encrypt the same thing on every flight.'' He said that this might be a ''mistake'' on their part and that ''sometimes we get lucky.'' **********The implication seemed to be that while he was convinced that much of the coding was contrary to 1979 treaty provisions, the United States had been able to gather evidence of still other purported infractions concerning the capabilities of new Soviet weapons. **********On the issue of new missiles, the 1979 treaty permits each nation to deploy only one new light intercontinental ballistic missile. The MX is the new United States missile. The Soviet Union has been flight-testing and will soon begin to deploy a 10-warhead missile called the SS-24, and it has told the United States that it this is the new Soviet missile. **********But the Soviet Union has also been flight-testing - and is now in the process of deploying - a solid-fuel, three-stage missile with a single warhead, which the United States calls the SS-25. The Russians contend that this is simply a modification of the older SS-13 missile and is thus permitted. The Americans contend that it is a second new missile, and not permitted. **********The treaty defines a new type of missile as one that differs from the older model in the type of fuel or number of stages or by more than 5 percent in length, weight, largest diameter, launch weight or throw-weight. Second Criterion for New Missile **********Another provision is that any missile modification may not have a re-entry vehicle that is more than 50 percent lighter than the missile throw-weight. This provision was included to prevent development of a single warhead missile that could easily be modified to carry multiple warheads. **********The Administration contends that it has evidence the SS-25 violates both of these provisions, and is thus a second new type of missile. **********According to an article by Mr. Mendelsohn, the Soviet Union reportedly told the United States that the SS-13 has no separate ''post-boost vehicle,'' or ''bus,'' which is the device that dispenses warheads after separation from the last rocket stage. Instead, the Russians say, part of the post-boost throw-weight was on the third rocket stage. **********By not taking this into consideration, the Russians contend, the United States assumes too low a throw-weight for the SS-13 and erroneously concludes that the throw-weight of the SS-25 exceeds that of the SS-13 by more than 5 percent. They Russians apparently also contend that the throw-weight of the SS-25 is even less than that of the SS-13. Allusion Made by Shultz in '85 **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz seemed to concede some merit to the Soviet argument when he said in a television interview on March 18, 1985 that to him the SS-25 ''is a clear new missile,'' but that ''there are questions about whether in a purely technical sense it fits within treaty language as might be interpreted by a lawyer.'' **********As for the American argument about the low weight of the SS-25 re-entry vehicle in ratio to throw-weight, the Russians have reportedly told the Americans that a heavy instrumentation package in the test payload had reduced the re-entry vehicle's apparent percentage of the throw-weight. In operational SS-25's, the Russians said, the re-entry vehicle will be more than half the throw-weight. **********Critics contend that Gen. Richard H. Ellis, the delegate to the Soviet-American consultative panel that handles such disputes in Geneva, has not been getting instructions from the Pentagon on how to handle the issue. **********''He is authorized to complain, but is not authorized to resolve the issue,'' one expert said. Joint Chiefs Favored Adherence **********General Ellis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been backing the 1979 treaty terms on the ground that they set an upper limit on Soviet weapons. **********Senator Gore and Mr. Mendelsohn contend that the SS-25 is being deployed to replace single warhead SS-11 missiles and that it will not increase the size of the Soviet strategic missile forces.

No one, however, could issue assurances that the wine did not enter the United States. Italian authorities are still trying to identify and locate the brands that have been tainted and which have been blamed for 17 deaths. **********Across Europe, other governments moved to protect their consumers. Israel, Switzerland and Denmark today joined France, West Germany and Belgium in trying to identify and seize Italian wine imports. The governments involved have issued warnings against drinking Italian wine. No government has banned the sale of the wine but tank trucks carrying it have been impounded in France and Germany. **********The Italian Government is expected to take further measures Thursday at a cabinet meeting, among them substantially increasing the penalties for adulterating wine. Officials are also expected to order an increase in the number of police who monitor wine production. **********Investigators here said today that they believe they have identified six new victims in the case. Since mid-March, 17 people have died in northeastern Italy and more than 60 have been hospitalized. They all drank wine that contained poisonous quantities of methyl alcohol. **********The death toll may rise as autopsies are performed on the bodies of several persons who died recently, including some that have been exhumed. **********Eleven people have been arrested in connection with the scandal and some have been charged with manslaughter. Tracing the wine from one producer to another has presented a major problem for investigators. In many cases sales records were not kept. **********After France and West Germany seized large quantities of tainted wine, the Italian Agriculture Ministry issued a decree on March 28 requiring all Italian wines to be certified safe by a Government laboratory and to carry a certification document before they can be exported. **********Italian authorities today conceded that wine exports were virtually frozen because of the backlog of wines that require laboratory testing. According to a Government announcement today, out of 12,585 samples, 274 have been found to contain illegal quantities of methyl alcohol. **********In the United States, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said that the agency continually tests wine for a variety of substances, including methanol. **********The Italian Government has been pressed to act because of the potential losses to an industry that last year produced more than $900 million in export income. **********The tainted wines are inexpensive varieties often sold in liter bottles at both supermarkets and wine stores. The wine is mostly red and mostly from the Piedmont region. **********So far, the scandal has not touched Italy's high-quality wines, those labeled ''Denominazione de Origine Controllata'' or simply ''DOC.'' The designation means that the wine was produced in a specific area under prescribed conditions. **********At the beginning of the week, the Government tried to reassure its citizens and foreign customers that it had control of the situation. Prime Minister Bettino Craxi's said in a statement Monday that ''the heart of the poisonous adulteration has been identified, isolated and crushed.'' **********This was based on the discovery by the Italian police that beginning in December four large wine producers had illegally purchased industrial quantities of methyl, or wood, alcohol and had then added it to poor-quality wines to boost their alcohol content. **********The tainted wines were then resold, often several times, and mixed with other wines before reaching the consumer as common table wine, which accounts for more than 80 percent of Italian production. **********Methyl alcohol or methanol is a natural byproduct of wine-making and is harmless in minute quantities. Much of the wine that has been sequestered in the last few weeks has contained 10 times as much of the poisonous substance as is legally permitted. **********The investigation has uncovered widespread violations of the already loose rules governing the production of cheap wines by manufacturers, who mixed together different kinds of wine to drive down their costs. **********As the detective work has progressed, the Government has issued, as it did again today, updated lists of wine brands that are suspect. Copies of the lists are now posted prominently in restaurants and supermarkets in many European cities. **********The first alarms sounded March 14 when public health authorities discovered that three men had died suddenly in Milan after drinking large quantities of the same kind of wine. **********The wine was quickly traced to a single factory, which authorities closed. But, as people continued to die, many of them elderly and some of them alcoholics, the police found that adulterated wine had been produced in a variety of places around the country and had been widely distributed in Italy and abroad. **********It remains unclear how widespread the problem may be, although Mr. Pandolfi told Parliament last week that as much as 600,000 liters of wine may have been affected. **********After France and West Germany impounded large quantities of suspect Italian wine, the Agriculture Ministry issued an urgent decree March 28 requiring all wine exports to be accompanied by a certificate from an official laboratory guaranteeing that they contain only the permitted quantity of methyl alcohol. **********Last summer, there was a scandal involving the use of diethylene glycol, a chemical found in some antifreezes and one that was used to sweeten West German, Austrian and some Italian wines. Now, with a second crisis in the industry, many wine producers fear a permanent loss of business. **********In the United States, consumers seem to be cautious. Louis Iacucci, owner of Goldstar Wine and Spirits, in Forest Hills, Queens, which has a sizable inventory of Italian wines, said: ''A number of our customers have inquired, and we have explained that these are not wines that are exported to the United States, but rather wines that are sold in supermarkets in Italy.'' **********Bernie Fraidin, the owner of Quality House Liquor in Manhattan, said of the Italian scandal: '' People do mention it.

But what Mr. Sharon now seeks is more foreign investment in Israeli companies, not only for the capital but also for the technology, management and marketing experience. Last year, he said, direct foreign investment in Israel amounted to a mere $46 million out of a total private and public investment of $1.2 billion. **********A major reason for the low rate of foreign investment here in recent years, according to many economists, has been the high rate of inflation, which soared to nearly 1,000 percent a year before July 1985, when the National Unity Government, headed by Prime Minister Shimon Peres, adopted a package of Draconian measures that brought the inflation down to 15 to 20 percent, a rate that in Israel feels almost like price stability. **********Some economists are worried that the Government is prematurely relaxing its campaign against inflation in order to shift to the more popular course of faster economic growth. Prof. Eytan Sheshinski of Hebrew University says the most important thing Israel can do to encourage the growth of investments is to stick to its fight against inflation. **********He does not think the Government has gone nearly far enough in trimming budget expenditures, whether in military or nonmilitary areas. While the budget deficit has been cut by $1.5 billion, Professor Sheshinski says that only $200 million of this resulted from reductions in the activities of Government agencies. The bulk of the cuts came from the trimming of subsidies and increases in tax revenues. **********The Government, he added, gained a ''tremendous'' one-time increase in revenues last year as a result of the drop in inflation and expectations on the part of taxpayers that the Government would stick to its guns. The payment of taxes in Israel, Professor Sheshinski said, had become a ''Mediterranean bazaar'' during the hyper-inflation. Many individuals and businesses put off paying their taxes until a later date. With the stopping of hyper-inflation, they paid up past as well as current taxes, creating a surge in revenues. **********However, the chief factor in stopping the Israeli inflation, the economists responsible for the program believe, was the cut in real wages. **********David Brodet, director of planning, economics and finance in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, says the basic strategy of the Israeli anti-inflation program was ''post-Keynesian'' - that is, based on the concept that the critical factor in inflation is the rate of increase in wages, salaries and fringe benefits. The Government program also used fiscal and monetary policies to back up its incomes policy. And it moved fast, rather than gradually, to prove to the public that it meant business. That strategy was reinforced by the findings of Prof. Thomas Sargeant of the University of Minnesota, based on studies of the way the great hyper-inflations after World War I in Central Europe were stopped on a dime. **********The Israelis believe that their experience in using a wage policy as the main instrument in stopping inflation is the principal lesson they have to teach the rest of the world; they consider it important because it permitted the country to move forward with only a moderate increase in umemployment. However, the rate of gain in real growth did slow down. **********After dropping by 12 to 14 percent by the end of 1985, real wages began to rise again. In April of this year, according to Mr. Brodet, wages were 7 to 8 percent higher than before the rollback began last July. Many economists - and some politicians -fear that the wage increases will keep rolling. Ariel Sharon says: ''We have to be very, very careful. Israel is a Western democracy, an integral part of the Western world. The struggle against wages is not something you can carry on with no limitations.'' **********Nevertheless, Mr. Sharon favors freezing wages. He also urges cutting the budget - as long as the cuts are not in military expenditures, which constitute one-third of the total Israeli gross national product. ''The inflation,'' Mr. Sharon says, ''is only suppressed.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/business/key-rates-028286.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/world/basque-guerrillas-threaten-to-attack-foreigners.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 337, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BASQUE GUERRILLAS THREATEN TO ATTACK FOREIGNERS", "print_headline": "BASQUE GUERRILLAS THREATEN TO ATTACK FOREIGNERS", "body_text": " **********Basque separatist guerrillas threatened today to attack citizens of European Community countries in Spain to protest the group's support for the Madrid Government, diplomatic sources said. **********The threat was made in a letter mailed to the embassies of several European Community countries as France pledged further help to Spain in fighting Basque guerrillas, who have killed 29 people this year in their campaign for independence in northern Spain. **********The letter, signed by E.T.A., the Basque guerrilla group, warned that embassy staff members and other citizens of European Community countries were potential targets for unspecified attacks, the sources said.

John M. Poindexter, the former national security adviser, and Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, a former National Security Council staff member - were allowed complete access to their offices until Tuesday and that they destroyed sensitive documents last weekend, perhaps as part of their regular routine. **********In a related development, Administration officials said F.B.I. agents spent much of the weekend in the State Department reviewing records related to the arms shipments to Iran. Among the records, they said, were notes of meetings between Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Robert C. McFarlane, a former national security adviser, in which Mr. Shultz strongly argued against the arms sales.

Director, William H. Webster, has decided to have the team report directly to F.B.I. headquarters instead of going through supervisors in the Washington field office, officials said. **********One official said he was comforted that Mr. Webster had taken charge of the investigation.

Sofaer, warned department employees that they should not destroy documents related to the Iran deal. Law-enforcement officials have said destroying such documents could result in charges of obstruction of justice. **********Administration officials have said they believe Colonel North, who is accused organizing the diversion of money to the Nicaraguans, and Admiral Poindexter destroyed sensitive documents last weekend. Routine Procedure **********Destruction of documents, they noted, is routine procedure at the National Security Council, and they said there was no evidence to prove that documents related to the Iran deal had been destroyed. The two former White House aides have been unwilling to comment on the reports. **********But officials said the F.B.I. was fearful that irreplacable documents might have been destroyed because Mr. Meese did not act fast enough to secure the files. **********Department officials have said that Mr. Meese had evidence last Sunday of the diversion of the Iranian payments, but that the files of Admiral Poindexter and Colonel North were not taken into the possession until Tuesday. **********Had the F.B.I. become involved at the first hint of criminality, they said, the offices at documents would have been immediately secured. ''That's just good investigative practice,'' said one Federal law-enforcement official. ''It's just common sense.'' Although praising Mr. Meese for ferreting out information about the diversion of money to the Nicaraguan rebels, other officials said F.B.I. agents believed Mr. Meese should bow out of the case himself if only because he provided the legal advice that allowed President Reagan to sell weapons to the Iranian Government. **********''If I were Meese, I'd recuse myself so darn fast it would make your head spin,'' one official said. Worries of Conflict of Interest **********Some investigators at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. are believed to fear that without a special prosecutor, they could get swept up in the sort of conflict-of-interest allegations that damaged their agencies during the Watergate scandals, officials said. **********According to an Administration official, the Justice Department prosecutor directing the inivestigation, Stephen S. Trott, the Associate Attorney General, first talked with senior F.B.I. officials about the case late Tuesday. **********The next afternoon, they said, the F.B.I. was formally called into the case. Mr. Trott has not returned phone calls from reporters in recent days. **********A team of veteran F.B.I. agents was quickly picked for the investigation.

A powerhouse in the East, it has little presence elsewhere at a time when victory is increasingly going to those airlines that can capture the most passengers for the longest geographic distance. Moreover, Delta's labor costs are among the highest in the industry and attempts to pare them on one important front - the pilots -have brought on the first labor strife in the company's history. Delta has also built its success on a cautious and conservative approach to business that may be outmoded in the faster pace of deregulation. **********Delta senior officials decline to comment, although rumors continue to circulate that Delta is in the market for a merger partner. This uncertainty has made investors lukewarm to the carrier's stock, which has not performed as well as its rivals in the current bull market. Delta's shares have suffered further of late from the Texas Air Corporation's decision to acquire the Miami-based Eastern Airlines, a move that many feel will step up the competitive pressure in Delta's backyard. The stock gained $2.25 yesterday, to $44.50, largely because of falling oil prices. **********But stock market performance is only a measure of investors' perceptions. More central to Delta are issues that the carrier's managers are grappling with today. **********''Delta's revenues are in jeopardy and its costs are out of line with the rest of the industry,'' said Barry J. Gordon, president of American Fund Advisor, a mutual fund that specializes in aviation stocks. ''And this is not an airline that has reacted quickly to changing conditions.'' Buying Time **********Indeed, Delta may not have to change overnight. Its long history of prudent management and wise fiscal policies could buy it some time. Delta has been profitable every year except one and some analysts expect that it will be one of the few airlines to show a profit in the 1986 first quarter, one of the roughest in airline history. **********In polls of frequent travelers, Delta continues to be ranked above all others for the quality of its service. Its fleet is among the most modern, thanks to the company's financial strength and strict adherence to a disciplined schedule of aircraft purchases. The carrier - with the exception of its pilots - has remained non-union and its employee relations are considered among the best in the industry because of its generous salaries and no-layoff policy. **********And, in an industry known for its often daredevil approach to finance, Delta is unique for its conservatism. Debt represents less than 30 percent of its balance sheet, making it among the least leveraged of the nation's air carriers. Its accounting practices are cautious, almost to the extreme, dampening its reported earnings. **********Where other carriers, for instance, depreciate their planes over 18 years, Delta is alone in depreciating its fleet over 10 to 12 years. This bigger annual depreciation expense lowers Delta's reported profits, but helps increase its cash flow and minimize its annual tax bill. Similar caution extends to investment tax credits, which Delta spreads over five years rather than using them in a single year like most corporations. 'Japanese-Style Management' **********''It's almost as though you have a Japanese-style management at Delta,'' said Michael Derchin, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''They are ultraconservative financially and there's a lot of consensus among management before any big decisions are made. It's not like a lot of other companies where one guy dominates by force.'' **********Delta has long been ruled by managers who have grown up with the airline. The most public of Delta's senior executives are David C. Garrett Jr., 63 years old, chairman and chief executive, and Robert Oppenlander, 62, vice chairman and chief financial officer. **********''Delta has an image problem on Wall Street and a strong acquisition would help that,'' Mr. Derchin said. ''But Delta makes decisions not by image, but by what makes sense in the long run. Delta would consider something - but only if it were a good strategic fit, if the price was right. They don't believe that merger for merger's sake is a necessity.'' **********Although Delta has, so far, steered clear of a merger, it is not as though the carrier has ignored the increased competition that has shaken the industry since deregulation. Delta has met the challenge of low-priced carriers by drastically discounting fares on certain flights. Sophisticated Forecasting **********To lower prices - and still garner enough revenues - Delta has entered into an agreement with the Control Data Corporation to use sophisticated computer programs that forecast demand and provide the optimal mix of full fare and bargain fares for the 86 million seats that it flies each year. Delta has attempted to establish new hubs in Dallas and Cincinnati to offset revenues lost to other airlines poaching in its Atlanta stronghold. And, it has engaged in joint marketing agreements with other carriers, like Western Airlines and Japan Air Lines, to feed passengers into its planes and vice versa. **********Some see these moves as a sign that Delta may try to expand internally rather than grow through acquisition. For example, Delta has expressed interest in picking up some of the Northeast Corridor flights that might be dropped as a result of the Eastern-Texas Air merger. And many fear that if Delta continues to go it alone by adding new hubs, additional capacity will pour into an industry already plagued by oversupply and price slashing. **********''There's already too much capacity in the marketplace,'' said Mr. Sylvester of Montgomery Securities. ''Building a hub doesn't stimulate additional demand. You are only gaining market share at the expense of others.'' Added American Fund Advisor's Mr. Gordon, ''There's little room left to start a hub and not be in competition with someone else.'' American Air Threat **********Delta's most pressing threat right now is from American Airlines, which is breaking into Delta's backyard with a new hub in Nashville and another planned for Raleigh-Durham, N.C. Delta is rapidly trying to build up its new Cincinnati hub faster than American's at Nashville. But Delta's attempts to compete in American's Dallas stronghold have been disappointing. American holds a 60 percent market share in Dallas, compared with Delta's 20 percent. **********In the long term, an even more potent threat is the prospect of a revitalized Eastern, which had historically been the region's financial weak sister. Most analysts doubt that Eastern, because of its union contracts, can be turned into a discount carrier overnight. But, over time, Eastern could well pose a greater threat than it ever has in the past. **********Clouding over any major decisions at Delta right now is the fate of its negotiations with its pilots' union. Delta has begun to cut its labor costs by imposing two-tier wages on its non-unionized employees, but its attempts to do so with its pilots led to a bitter labor dispute that is now in Federal mediation. In the 1985 fourth quarter, Delta's compensation per employee averaged $51,200, compared with $45,800 at American and $27,500 at People Express, according to Montgomery Securities. **********Delta's pilots are willing to be flexible to try to preserve the airline's ''traditional family relationship,'' said Cameron Foster, a spokesman for the Airline Pilots Association, adding, however, that ''it's a two-way street and we hope the company feels the same way.'' **********While there is much speculation over Delta's merger intent, it is unclear just which carrier Delta might buy - or when. Acquisition of an airline like Piedmont would give Delta further market penetration in its own home base. Taking over a carrier like Western - a combination that was the subject of intense speculation this week - would provide new geographic range. Delta was seen as a possible suitor for Northwest Airlines, but Northwest instead chose Republic."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/business/advertising-domaine-wines.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 47, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; Domaine Wines", "print_headline": "Advertising; Domaine Wines", "body_text": " **********Lord Geller Federico Einstein has added another product line to its assignment from Schieffelin & Company.

Chevrolet moved 20 models yesterday, also about twice its normal sales. ''It showed up in all price ranges,'' said Steve Hinchcliffe, sales manager. **********General Motors dealers across the nation reported a quick consumer response - with as much as a doubling of sales - to the auto maker's announcement on Thursday of 2.9 percent financing on three-year car loans. The rate will be available until the 1987 models go on sale Oct. 7. **********But not all dealers were happy about the rush to the showrooms. Some dealers expressed concern that the campaign to sell slow-moving 1986 models would take away from sales of 1987 models. **********''On the average Cadillac, you are talking about paying $150 to $200 a month less in carrying charges,'' said Norman Bramen, head of Bramen Enterprises, which has Cadillac dealerships in Tampa and Miami. ''We expect a lot people to take of advantage of that and buy 1986 models. And all we can hope is that there will be enough demand left to stimulate the 1987 models.'' **********For the time being, business boomed in G.M. dealers' showrooms, indicating that the company's strategy to loosen the logjam of unsold cars was working. **********But yesterday the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company countered by slashing their own loan rates in an effort to lure customers. **********In Manhattan at Potamkin Chrysler, where lower-interest signs were being posted in windows, Jim Goldfine, vice president and general manager, said: ''We think this will blow the doors in. Chrysler hasn't had the inventory problems that G.M. has, and even started shipping the 1987's in late July.'' **********Meanwhile, owners and potential buyers of General Motors cars were telephoning or going to showrooms to try to work out a deal. ''Our phones haven't stopped ringing,'' said Stan Quarles, sales manager of Metropolitan Oldsmobile in Manhattan. He said he had been able to convert two contracts for undelivered cars to the 2.9 percent rate from the previous 5.9 percent rate, but other dealers said they were unable to do that. Lure for Installment Buyers **********In Kansas City, Mo., Jack Roach, a Cadillac dealer, said he had sold several cars within hours after the news of G.M.'s interest cut was announced. ''I expect many younger adults who are installment buyers to come into the market,'' he said. **********G.M.'s 2.9 percent financing, or 4.8 percent on four-year loans, replaces rates of 5.9 percent on 30-month loans and 6.9 percent on 36-month loans. Instead of the lowered rates - the lowest the company has ever offered -customers can take rebates ranging from $300 on subcompacts to $1,500 on luxury cars such as the Cadillac Seville. **********Victor Potamkin, president of Potamkin Cadillac in Manhattan, said: ''We've already gotten lots of calls from customers who paid 5.9 percent interest and from new car buyers. It means a discount of a couple of thousand dollars. You'd have to be crazy to pay cash.'' Inventory 10% Over Normal **********Mr. Potamkin's company, with its combined G.M. and Chrysler dealerships, is the country's largest auto dealer. ''The G.M. move will help us move our inventory, which is about 10 percent higher than normal,'' he said. **********G.M.'s problem, dealers said, has been greatest among cars in the middle- and higher-price ranges, such as Oldsmobile and Cadillac. ''Chevy hasn't had the problem that Oldsmobile has,'' said Mr. Frank, the Chicago dealer, who sells both brands. ''Olds, Buick and Pontiac need that extra volume.'' **********In Marlow Heights, Md., Ourisman Chevrolet has seen a surge of interest from car buyers since the G.M. announcement, ''including from owners of one- to two-year-old models who are talking trades,'' said Paul Sherbow, the sales manager. **********The incentive financing also revived dealers' hopes for achieving sales quotas. Amid a sluggish season, G.M.'s Cadillac dealer incentives of $1,000 to $2,000 had been based on reaching sales quotas that were considered virtually out of reach. A New Look at Sales Effort **********Sevilles, in particular, proved hard to sell when the 1986 body style differed from the year before, and El Dorados also were slower-moving. **********''Now, maybe, we can reach those quotas,'' said Terry Fenner, Bramen's chief controller in Miami. **********But dealers showed no enthusiasm for the 2.5 percent rebate, reduced from 5 percent, on some G.M. cars. ''G.M. does not take back any unsold 1986's,'' said Mr. Quarles of Metropolitan Oldsmobile in Manhattan. ''And they will only give us back a 2.5 percent rebate to help the situation.'' **********But, brightening up, he declared: ''That aside, G.M. is practically now giving away its cars with that new, low rate. It's practically a loss for them, but they've got to move units.'' **********He was even receptive to the similar actions by Chrysler and Ford, reasoning that the general move to lighten motorists' interest costs should stimulate the entire market. **********Not everyone agreed, however.

And half a century since a comparable craze sent stock prices soaring, and then crashing, in America, a harbinger of the Great Depression. **********Markets - particularly the financial markets -have grown considerably in complexity since those historic episodes. New forms of securities and trading instruments have been devised. New technologies have been brought to bear. The world's markets are now linked so that trading goes on around the clock. Volume has rocketed, and so have the dollars involved. **********What have not changed are the crescendos and crashes that periodically grip these markets - such as the stunning 7 percent Wall Street stock plunge a week ago. Nor have the elements that drive the markets changed: a combination of economic sentiment, avarice, psychology and technical trading patterns, all played out in an uncertain environment where no mechanical answers exist. **********Sometimes one factor dominates, sometimes another. The shifting mix is part of what makes the markets so unpredictable - and so difficult to explain, even in hindsight. Yesterday, with Wall Street battened down for a hurricane, trading closed with scarcely more turbulence than a summer breeze. **********For all their unpredictability, markets are nevertheless considered among the truest gauges of the economy. The market is no more - and no less - than the sum of what thousands and thousands of people decide about it at any one time. The market is where all knowledge about the economy or individual enterprises - the surmises as well as the certainties - is brought to bear, almost instantly. **********If Iraq's bombings knock out key oil fields in Iran, or auto sales prove stronger than expected, within minutes the prices of oil contracts, Treasury bonds, stock and options prices - an entire spectrum of financial instruments - begin to move. As soon as news is known, legions of traders are dissecting it for its possible impact on every corner of the economy and for how they can extract a profit. **********From the outside, the action often seems puzzling. For what seems to make stocks rise one day may send them tumbling another. **********On Monday, for instance, investors may view new strength in the economy as auspicious, a signal that corporations will thrive and earnings rise. So stock prices move up. By Thursday, further signs of economic growth may be regarded as bad; they might rekindle inflation. Fearing that the Federal Reserve might therefore throttle the money supply and choke off growth, traders suddenly pull back. So stock prices fall. **********Shifts in ''sentiment'' such as these have a powerful effect on the market. This is not to say that Wall Street takes lightly the task of assessing the economic value of companies in the stock market. Most brokerage firms employ cadres of highly paid securities analysts to follow company fortunes and to spin out earnings forecasts as the basis for buy and sell recommendations on stocks. **********The tension between economic logic and market psychology is not new. The noted British economist John Maynard Keynes, himself an eminently successful investor, once commented: ''It is not sensible to pay 25 for an investment of which you believe the prospective yield to justify a price of 30, if you also believe the market will value it at 20 three months hence.'' **********Or, putting it another way, Keynes once likened the market process to a newspaper contest where contestants had to pick the six prettiest faces from hundreds of beautiful faces. A contestant's own preference was not telling. Instead, the winner was to be the person whose six choices most closely matched those chosen by all the voters. Thus the true task was to anticipate which beauties most readers would favor, while their choice, in turn, was also shaped by trying to outguess everyone else. **********''We have reached the third degree, where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be,'' Keynes remarked. ''And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, the fifth and higher degrees.'' **********But while Keynes and others understood the forces operating on the markets, they did not reckon with the power that some of these forces unleash today, forces that can pound prices down 4 percent in a day or 7 percent in a week, as they did last week. **********The elements include money managers with billions of dollars at their disposal, computers that can perform millions of calculations a second, an array of financial investments so varied and so complex that most traders stick to only one or two rather than trying to understand the intricacies of many. Perhaps more remarkable than the striking volatility is the fact that stability prevails so much of the time. **********It is hard to say that any single change has been most important in transforming today's frenetic markets. There have been many. **********First, the pools of investment funds slosh from market to market as never before - money with no particular loyalty, either to a country or to a specific investment. A decade ago it was the OPEC nations, as they accumulated huge stores of wealth as oil prices soared. Today it is Japan, with its savings and export proceeds, that has generous pools to invest. **********The United States, on the other hand, no longer the largely isolated economy it once was, now has an immense trade deficit to finance. What foreign investors think suddenly becomes critical not only for the Federal Reserve, but also for other players in the marketplace. **********Changes in America's pension laws, roughly a decade ago, have contributed to the buildup in large blocks of private funds in the United States. **********If the pools of investing funds changed, so too did the behavior of investors. The inflation of the 1970's burned many professional investors who had built portfolios of bonds paying 2 and 3 percent. After that lesson, investors and money managers who had been content to sit on long-term bonds for 30 years now may turn over their portfolios several times a year, contributing to the bond market's greater ups and downs. Stock portfolios, always managed more actively than bonds, are pushed even harder. **********Another material change is the proliferation of new financial instruments. Little more than a decade ago, Chicago's commodity markets introduced investment vehicles that have become central to today's financial markets. **********First, they initiated options on individual stocks, which give investors the right to buy or sell those stocks at a specific price at a specific date in the future, with limited risk. The idea was not new; buyers have long used options to stake claims on real estate. And stock options had long traded in the over-the-counter market. **********But an exchange for listing and trading options on blue chips, and their marketing by major brokerage houses, helped promote widespread use by portfolio managers, both as a means of making bigger profits and as a way of protecting against large declines in stock prices, a practice known as hedging. **********Then, they introduced options on groups of stocks, such as the Standard & Poor's index, adding more tricks for portfolio managers to play. So did the advent of futures contracts on stock indexes. These new instruments not only opened new opportunities for speculators, they also opened the way for arbitragers, who seek to profit by exploiting disparities among markets, thereby bringing the multiplicity of markets in line. **********Such changes also called for a new tribe of players, more quantitatively oriented than before. Where firms previously hired macroeconomists to forecast the course of the economy, now they seek microeconomists who understand relative values among the myriad financial instruments in the markets and can devise complex arbitrage formulas. Sophisticated Computers **********Sophisticated computers are another requirement in the new trading order. Only a computer can assess, in an instant, the ever-changing value of the 500 stocks in the Standard and Poor's index - and whether their total exceeds or lags the value of the option on the S.&P. 500 or the futures contract on the same index. The 500 stocks could be totaled manually, or with a calculator, but, by then, their values might already have moved significantly. **********Traders have portable machines so small that they can be carried home or to a restaurant or to the beach. Market data are fed by satellite; the trader is never out of touch. And if there is an important move in Tokyo or London, after the American markets have closed or before they reopen, the trader can quickly call up market data and make decisions. **********Even the average small investor, who traditionally called a broker for information and advice, today can use a personal computer for access to much the same information, and same types of programs, used by the big money managers. **********What changes such as these can mean to the functioning of markets is best understood by looking at the market. Last week's plunge offers a prime example. **********The markets' big moves - Treasury bonds fell roughly 2 percent on Sept. 11, while the Dow Jones industrial average was off a record 86 points that day - were touched off by a new sense of unease over the economy and some jitters over inflation. **********What might well have been a moderate market move, however, appears to have been exacerbated by the swift flow of information to money managers around the globe, and by program trading, by large financial institutions using computers to detect differences in the value of the stock indexes, and the options and futures on stock indexes. **********Many on Wall Street believe that even without program trading or the sloshing of other big pools of money, the market probably would have fallen similar amounts but more gradually, perhaps over two or three weeks rather than a day. **********Psychology still plays a big role, as it did in the Netherlands in the 1700's, and as it did in New York in 1929. But when the psychology changes now, the market adjustments tend to be a lot quicker - and a lot steeper. Whether last week's episode was an extreme, or whether even steeper moves lie ahead, remains to be seen. What seems certain, however, is that day-to-day volatility is here to stay.

Inventories Pared **********In a year in which Compaq's sales jumped 53 percent, to $503 million, the company actually pared inventories of circuit boards, microprocessor chips and other parts by $9 million, to $76 million, from the 1984 year-end total. This translates into greater earnings because it frees money that otherwise would be tied up in parts sitting in warehouses. **********The result was a more than doubling of profits, as Compaq's gross margin, the commonly used gauge of manufacturing efficiency, jumped to 40 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 31 percent a year ago. **********The improvement came even though Compaq was building inventories for a series of computers to replace its original Compaq Portable. Those new computers are priced between $3,499 and $4,799 and were introduced Thursday; Compaq said they are three to five times faster than the original Compaq Portable, and are I.B.M. compatible. **********Gross margin measures the percentage of sales dollars remaining after labor, parts and other manufacturing expenses have been tallied, but before administrative, marketing, research and other costs are added. **********''It was simply an excellent performance,'' said Donald J. Heeter, an analyst with J. C. Bradford & Company, a brokerage in Nashville. ''And it should improve with higher-priced products coming out and production costs continuing to fall.'' Future Is Hardly Secure **********To be sure, Compaq's decision to compete in the volatile personal computer market with I.B.M.-compatible machines means its future is hardly secure. In the past, Mr. Heeter said, concerns about the I.B.M. threat, as well as possible inroads from lower-priced Asian brands, have overshadowed Compaq's unmatched growth record in investors' eyes. **********However, investor reticence may be easing: On the New York Stock Exchange today, Compaq's stock closed up $1.375, at a record $15.125. **********Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive, said inventories would have climbed by $42 million, to $118 million, if the company had been content to allow the costs of production parts to rise at the same 38 percent rate its sales climbed in the fourth quarter. Had inventory growth matched the full year's sales increase of 53 percent, additional costs would have been $54 million. **********''In a year when sales are growing, most companies are content simply to make sure inventories don't grow faster than sales,'' Mr. Canion, attired in black tie, told the 3,000 guests and employees who filled the Jesse H. Jones Hall. ''But at Compaq, we don't think that is enough.'' Home Users Not a Target **********He said in an interview that Compaq draws its business plans by projecting growth for the total personal computer market for business users, then adding ''at least a few points on'' to commit the company to a bigger market share. He said he thinks the market will grow between 20 and 35 percent this year. Compaq does not attempt to sell to home users, and that market represents a small percentage of its sales. **********Analysts said that approach has worked to date, because Compaq has carefully researched potential users, then designed computers that have gained broad acceptance, such as the Deskpro 286, which runs 30 percent faster and has 50 percent more storage capacity than the similar-priced I.B.M. model. **********At one point, before more extensive market research was dissected by corporate officers, Mr. Canion favored production of a lightweight laptop computer as the successor to the original Compaq Portable. He yielded to others, though, when he became convinced that the technology had not advanced enough for customers to accept a lap top. **********The new portable computers introduced Thursday at the Jesse H. Jones Hall are smaller, faster and have more storage capacity than the original Compaq Portable, and illustrate Compaq's sensible approach, said Harvey Allison, an analyst with Wertheim & Company. 'Better Than Anyone Else' **********And Thomas H. Galvin, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said that Compaq ''adds value to the basic, I.B.M. standard of personal computers better than anyone else in the industry.'' **********Mr. Canion said Compaq's staying power in the face of price cuts by I.B.M., new competition from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and low-priced imports from South Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia had helped it negotiate favorable, low-volume purchase agreements with several suppliers. **********The pacts helped assure that Compaq will be competitive with the ''lowest-cost producers'' in the industry, he said. Design changes for Compaq's new line of portable computers, as well as improvements in production quality, also reduced costs, Mr. Canion added. **********Moreover, Compaq's presence with I.B.M., Tandy, Apple and A.T.&T. among leading sellers of personal computers to business has made its suppliers more willing to execute demanding delivery schedules that help keep Compaq's parts inventories at a minimum. **********That close link with suppliers has helped Compaq master the just-in-time inventory system that many American electronics makers zealously embraced after Japanese competitors perfected the process. **********The just-in-time system, as the name implies, requires suppliers to deliver their parts to assembly plants at Compaq's headquarters in a wooded suburb of northwest Houston a few days before they are actually fixed onto a computer chassis. **********Together, these improvements help explain why Compaq's profits grew faster than sales, both in the fourth quarter and for all of 1985. **********Profits jumped 47 percent in the fourth quarter, to $10 million, while sales climbed 39 percent, to $156.3 million. For the year, profits more than doubled, to $26.6 million, against the 53 percent jump in sales. Its after-tax profit margin continues to grow, reaching 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter, and averaging 5.2 percent for the year. Cash Financed Growth **********Compaq put the cash to work financing its growth without having to raise any money through such steps as issuig notes - which would have increased its interest expense - or selling more shares, which would likely have lowered its stock price. **********''Compaq's ability to fund its growth is a very significant step in the eyes of investors,'' said Mr. Heeter of J. C. Bradford. **********Most analysts believe Compaq can accelerate sales another 30 percent, to about $650 million this year. Mr. Canion declined to make a forecast, but said Compaq can again finance all the growth from its profits. **********In the meantime, the company -which now employs 1,800 people locally - is clearly the toast of Houston's business world, which has been enshrouded in the gloom of the oil bust since before Compaq was born. **********''Your company epitomizes the Houston spirit,'' an enthusiastic Mayor Kathy Whitmire told the Compaq gathering. ''It symbolizes what we are about in Houston - that people who work hard to get ahead can be successful.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/03/business/packwood-hopeful-on-tax-plan.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1986-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1315, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PACKWOOD HOPEFUL ON TAX PLAN", "print_headline": "PACKWOOD HOPEFUL ON TAX PLAN", "body_text": " **********The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, announced today that he believed he had won majority support on his committee for a ''package'' of comprehensive changes in the tax law. **********''A group of us have reached a consensus,'' the Senator said. ''I think it's a majority.'' **********The apparent agreement on a revolutionary set of tax principles that would go into effect next year was reached in a series of long closed-door meetings this week. Senator Packwood, an Oregon Republican, said that the panel would begin voting on the legislation in public sessions next week and that he hoped the committee would approve a bill by the end of the week. **********Senators who are backing Mr. Packwood said they had agreed to defeat all consequential amendments to the package. Challenges on Floor Seen **********If a measure is approved by the committee, it will doubtless face serious challenges on the Senate floor, where the rules permit unlimited amendments and unrestricted debate. Moreover, the package is quite different from legislation proposed by President Reagan last spring and from the bill approved by the House of Representatives in December. **********''I think we've won a skirmish but not the war,'' said Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, a strong supporter of tax-revision legislation. **********President Reagan has put tax revision at the top of his domestic legislative agenda. But with the President and his top economic advisers in Tokyo for the meeting with leaders of other industrialized democracies, Administration officials declined to comment today on Senator Packwood's announcement. Details to Be Worked Out **********The precise details of the package, particularly as they apply to business taxation, are to be worked out this weekend by the committee's staff, but Senator Packwood and his staff provided this framework today: *********** The top tax rates would be reduced to 27 percent for individuals and 33 percent for corporations. The maximum rates are now 50 percent and 46 percent, respectively. Most individuals would be taxed at a 15 percent rate. *********** The measure would raise approximately the same amount of revenue as the existing tax law. *********** Full deductions would be permitted for mortgage interest payments on up to two homes, charitable contributions by taxpayers who itemize deductions, and state and local income and property tax payments. *********** Almost all other deductions would be disallowed, including those for Individual Retirement Accounts for taxpayers with ordinary pension coverage, state and local sales taxes and charitable contributions by non-itemizers. *********** Capital gains would be taxed at the same rate as other income. Now, the maximum capital gains rate is 20 percent. *********** Interest payments on other than mortgage loans would be deductible only to the extent they did not exceed income from interest and dividends. *********** In an effort to minimize tax shelters, strict rules would limit the amount of investment losses that could be used to offset income from earnings. The staff estimated that more than $50 billion would be raised through the limits on tax shelters. *********** A stiff minimum tax would be applied to corporations. Interest from tax-exempt bonds would not be subject to the individual minimum tax. That, plus the restrictions on tax shelters, would make the individual minimum tax almost insignificant. *********** The personal exemption, now $1,080 for all taxpayers and their dependents, would be raised to $1,925 in 1987 and $2,000 after that for nearly all taxpayers. Very wealthy taxpayers would not be entitled to this exemption. *********** The 10 percent investment tax credit would be abolished, but business depreciation rules would be more favorable than they are under existing law. **********All together, according to a staff analysis, corporate taxes would be increased by $93 billion, to $103 billion, over five years, and taxes on individuals would be reduced by the same amount. The measure would not increase excise taxes. **********The precise nature of the proposed increased corporate taxes are to be worked out over the weekend. The bulk of the money would come from the stiffer minimum tax, changes in the way businesses are taxed on their inventories and stricter compliance measures. In addition, deductions for business meals and entertainment would be limited to 80 percent of their cost, special tax preferences enjoyed by the insurance industry would be limited and foreign taxpayers doing business in the United States would be subject to higher taxes. **********The measure would retain favorable tax treatment of the oil, gas and timber industries. It would also allow banks and other financial institutions to continue to write off the money they set aside in bad debt reserves. Oil and Timber Supporters **********The committee is dominated by senators from states with oil interests, and Senator Packwood is a strong advocate of measures that give tax relief to Oregon's timber industry. **********The measure would be somewhat more favorable to business and less favorable to individuals than President Reagan's proposal and the House bill, which would increase corporate taxes and reduce individual taxes by more than $120 billion over five years. **********Still, the sharp reduction in tax rates and the abolition of so many deductions and credits would amount to the most thorough overhaul of the nation's tax law since World War II. **********''I hope the public will regard it as genuine tax reform,'' Senator Packwood said. ''It is simplicity, it does restrict tax deductions, it does remove immense tax shelters.'' Most 'Efficient Use' Seen **********Mr. Packwood added that the plan would allow taxpayers to make the most ''efficient use'' of their money without ''extraordinary interference of a tax code that pries and pulls them in all directions.'' **********Senator Packwood made his announcement surrounded by six of the 19 other members of his committee: Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and George J. Mitchell of Maine, all Democrats, and Mr. Chafee, John C. Danforth and David F. Durenberger, all Republicans. In addition, Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, who is also a member of the Finance Committee, issued a statement saying he supported the proposal ''in principle.'' **********Other senators who may join this core group include Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Steven D. Symms of Idaho, Republicans, and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Max Baucus of Montana and David Pryor of Arkansas, Democrats. Eleven senators are needed for a majority. **********Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Baucus said they could not support the legislation unless it abolished tax shelters gradually over several years rather than ending them immediately. The staff was instructed to study their proposal over the weekend to see if it could fit in the overall framework. Contention Not Questioned **********Mr. Packwood is known for making extravagent assertions that he has subsequently retracted, both during the consideration of the tax bill and before. But, while the exact nature of his majority was not apparent today, no one publicly questioned the contention that he had fashioned one. **********He seemed to have put together the coalition the way deals are often cut on Capitol Hill, with promises and threats. One Senator, a Packwood supporter who asked not to be identified, described Mr. Packwood's operations this way: ''He's going through the process a chairman has to go through. He's saying to us, 'O.K., if there are people who want to come with me, you can have one or two things you really need, but then you've got to stay with me. If you're not with me, I'm going to take back from you the things I have given you, and the bill will pass without them.' '' **********Last month, when the tax legislation seemed to be falling apart, Mr. Packwood's capacity for leadership was challenged by some of his colleagues. Today, Senator Bradley remarked, ''The chairman has obviously played a strong leadership role, as any chairman would have to to get an agreement.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/business/finance-new-issues-south-carolina-agency-in-345-million-offering.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 220, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "South Carolina Agency In $345 Million Offering", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; South Carolina Agency In $345 Million Offering", "body_text": " **********The Piedmont Municipal Power Agency of South Carolina, in a $345 million refunding, is offering electric revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 8.04 percent for an issue due in 2023, through underwriters led by E.

'Conquered Pessimism' **********''Brazil has conquered pessimism and inertness, doubts and despondency, tragedy and despair,'' Mr. Sarney said in a year-end message to the nation. ''Today, there is multiplied confidence and reason for optimism.'' **********Yet, paradoxically, beneath the euphoria of recent months, a continuing feeling of uncertainty about Brazil's economic future lives on among some officials, and many bankers and businessmen. In this boom, they fear, the ingredients for a bust may already be visible. **********The darkest cloud remains inflation, which reached a record 233.7 percent last year. The Government has argued that this was only slightly higher than in 1983 and 1984, with the difference that it was accompanied by growth. **********Officials also point to recent tax reforms and budget cuts as evidence of their determination to bring inflation down to 160 percent this year, even if this means slower growth. **********But, with prices jumping by 13.4 percent last month and expected to rise by more than 15 percent this month, many economists are already predicting a dramatically higher inflation rate for 1986. **********''There are obviously many variables, but you're beginning to hear numbers like 300 percent or even 500 percent,'' one said. ''No one can live with that.'' A $12.4 Billion Trade Surplus **********At the same time, while a $12.4 billion trade surplus last year enabled Brazil to keep up interest payments on its $104 billion foreign debt, the largest in the developing world, the Sarney administration has still to complete a long-awaited debt restructuring with the country's commercial creditors. **********Even with a looming deadline of Jan. 17 for the renewal of some $16 billion in interbank and trade credits, Brazilian officials and representatives of a 14-bank advisory committee have made little progress in recent talks that were marked, according to sources on both sides of the table, by irascibility and distrust. **********While refusing to involve the I.M.F., Brazil has sought rescheduling of principal due in 1985 and 1986 under conditions similar to those granted to countries that have accepted fund ''adjustment'' programs. But the banks are reluctant to make such concessions as lowering their ''spreads,'' or profit margins, without first seeking I.M.F. approval of Brazil's economic policies. **********Souring the mood of negotiations, Brazil also at first refused to guarantee $455 million owed abroad by three local banks that went into forced receivership last November. And while Brazil has since agreed to cover 50 percent of this debt, the sources said many banks are demanding full compensation as the price of cooperating with the debt restructuring. **********Both Brazilian officials and foreign bankers now seem doubtful that a full-scale rescheduling can be completed by Jan. 17, and have instead begun contemplating a new 90- or 180-day rollover of the interbank and trade credits to allow more time for negotiations. But representatives of some large banks that belong to the advisory committee have also warned that many regional banks may not go along with this. Some Bankers Call It 'Arrogance' **********The new self-assurance - some bankers have even called it ''arrogance'' - that Brazil has begun displaying in its dealings with both the I.M.F. and its creditors nonetheless appears to reflect the Government's perception that its bargaining position has been bolstered by the resumption of domestic growth and its continuing strong trade performance. **********Even the drop in world oil prices, a severe blow to the revenues of such other regional debtors as Mexico and Venezuela, has worked in Brazil's favor. With domestic production expected to cover 74 percent of the demand of one million barrels a day by the end of 1986 and some $800 million saved from lower oil prices, the country's oil import bill this year is forecast at around $3 billion - compared with $10 billion in 1980. **********Similarly, while a drought in Brazil's agricultural south is damaging crops, officials say the recent sharp rise in world coffee and soybean prices should more than make up for any food production losses that must be covered with imports. **********Perhaps most symptomatic, though, is the mood of Sao Paulo, which accounts for half the country's industrial production. While industry nationwide grew by 7.8 percent last year, output in Sao Paulo jumped by around 13 percent. 'Reality Surpassed the Dream' **********''Reality surpassed the dream,'' the economic weekly, Senhor, noted effusively. ''The year that ended was far better than even optimists had predicted.'' **********Yet the boom has not dispelled doubts as to how long it can last. While many companies are earning huge profits by activating unused plant capacity, little new domestic or foreign private investment is currently taking place, awakening fears that the speeding economy might run into the wall of supply shortages. **********Further, with elections for Congress and state governors due in November this year, experts question whether President Sarney will voluntarily take the unpopular measures needed to slow inflation. **********''Many foreign bankers are gambling that the boom will explode in inflationary flames within six months, and Brazil will return meakly to the I.M.F.,'' one said. **********For the moment, however, after being told between 1981 and 1984 that things were getting better, when they were in fact getting worse, Brazilians now feel that things are indeed improving, and they are in no mood to listen to naysayers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/business/for-2-weak-economies-downfall-regimes-no-panacea-haiti-s-small-industries-face.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1208, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HAITI'S SMALL INDUSTRIES FACE A STRUGGLE WITH UNCERTAINTY", "print_headline": "FOR 2 WEAK ECONOMIES, DOWNFALL OF REGIMES IS NO PANACEA; HAITI'S SMALL INDUSTRIES FACE A STRUGGLE WITH UNCERTAINTY", "body_text": " **********It was early afternoon, and the rows of sewing machines in the lingerie factory were silent. **********There had been another political protest downtown, and the machine operators had gone home. **********Remy Mendoza, the 35-year-old manager of the American-owned plant, was alone in her office. **********''We're on the verge of deciding whether to continue this operation,'' she said. ''You just don't know what's going to happen. Today it may be very normal, tomorrow there is no transportation.' **********A sense of uncertainty has been pervasive in Haiti's important light-assembly industry since the collapse of the regime of President Jean-Claude Duvalier in early February. Protest marches, strikes by transportation workers and Government employees, and attempts at organizing labor unions have disrupted factory work schedules and interrupted the flow of deliveries of raw materials and finished goods. Some Factories Are Shut **********At least three factories have closed, and production at the others has fallen 20 percent, according to the Haitian Association of Industries. Of the 50,000 workers, about 12,000 have lost their jobs, association and Government officials say. The factories make items as varied as clothing, sporting goods and electronic equipment for export to the United States. They have been this impoverished country's leading source of income. **********Of the 230 American companies that had been contracting work in Haiti, about 40 had withdrawn by mid June, according to the United States Embassy here. **********''We've seen a steady erosion of contracts and employment over the last six months,'' said Aubrey J. Hooks, the chief of the embassy's economic section. ''We see no indication of a halt, or that it's reached its bottom point. We see nothing accelerating, but a steady erosion which continues.' **********For many American plant managers and owners, the critical question has become whether to pull up stakes or to try to ride out the storm. **********The United States is trying to persuade them to stay. On June 13, about 100 chief executives of American companies doing business with Haitian industry were invited to the White House for a morning of briefings and explanations of the strategic importance of Haiti, which lies just across the narrow Windward Passage from Cuba. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige were among the speakers. Words of Reassurance **********Frederic H. Brooks, the chairman of MacGregor Sporting Goods Inc., which employs 1,000 people here, said in a telephone interview that he had suggested the White House meeting. He said he told the executives there that from ''an American businessman's point of view, the worst-case scenario for Haiti is not that bad.'' **********He continued: ''There doesn't seem to be much possibility of a Communist takeover, a seizure of our factories. It really comes down to labor disturbances or potential labor disturbances, and they get magnified out of all proportion. If I have a strike in New Jersey, the workers get unemployment, they have a working spouse, there is a strike fund. The strike could last for a long time. In Haiti, if you go out on strike, there is none of that. It sounds cruel, but if you don't work, you don't eat.'' **********According to the American Embassy, about half the work force in Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere, is chronically unemployed. Among Haiti's principal attractions for American businessmen have been its minimum wage of $3 a day and its labor force's reputation for hard work. **********William Reddick, the 53-year-old manager of a plant that makes electric motors for the I.M.C. Magnetics Corporation of Jericho, L.I., favorably compares Haitian workers with the Japanese. But, he said, their motivation is different. **********''The Japanese works because he loves to work,'' Mr. Reddick said.

If we can keep business from leaving, we will have accomplished what we can during this period.'' **********Several plant managers said their companies had decided to stay in Haiti, and some said they had recently received fresh orders for goods and had hired more employees. **********A few days after the strike that idled her plant, Mrs. Mendoza said her factory had received orders that would keep it busy through September. Michael L. Smolens, who has been in Haiti 16 years and employs 400 people in a factory that finishes tennis rackets, said his business has been up 20 percent in the last four months, and that he has plans to expand. And Mr. Brooks said MacGregor expects to hire an additional 400 Haitians in the next 12 months. **********Mr. Brooks called the present situation ''a time of golden opportunity'' for opening or expanding factories in Haiti because ''things are only going to go uphill.'' Some Signs of Doubt **********But most managers interviewed here were not that sanguine. ''I wouldn't come in now,'' said Mr. Reddick, who has managed the electric motor plant here for seven years. ''It's too unpredictable.'' Gene Terry, an executive at a factory that stitches slacks, said he would not suggest opening a factory in Haiti now, because even though ''they have announced they're going to have elections in 18 months, if somebody doesn't get a grip on the situation here, these 18 months could be pure hell.'' **********Susan Barrows, 22, the manager of a subsidiary of the Canvas and Leather Bag Company of Melville, L.I., said she increased her work force in May by 35 percent, to 230. Miss Barrows said she had two orders worth 10 percent of her company's summer business canceled in June because of late delivery. Still, she said, the company had reviewed its finances after a year in Haiti, found that it had broken even, and decided to stay. **********Ronald Rosenbaum, 34, who comes from Gloversville, N.Y., has worked in garment assembly plants in Haiti for 13 years. He and his wife, Stephanie, who also works in the industry, hope to stay on, but he was recently laid off. **********''I don't think people looking for short-term gains would be happy here,'' he said. ''Everything is very confused at the moment.'' **********''Haiti,'' he said, ''used to be one of the only places anyone heard of where it was absolutely safe and it really was fun. **********However, he said, ''The last few months it's been a little more confining. Roads have been closed. You can't drive out into the provinces or get to the beaches. And there are a lot of people that aren't here anymore. There's been an exodus of people getting the hell out of here.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/world/nicaragua-and-bishops-at-odds-again.html": {"writer_name": "Stephen Kinzer", "pub_date": "1986-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1013, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NICARAGUA AND BISHOPS AT ODDS AGAIN", "print_headline": "NICARAGUA AND BISHOPS AT ODDS AGAIN", "body_text": " **********An explosion last week that killed 32 people as they rode in a truck through a remote part of northern Nicaragua has become a new source of conflict between the Government and Roman Catholic bishops. **********According to reports in the pro-Government press, all 32 victims, who included women and children, were civilians. The reports said they died when a mine placed by rebels exploded beneath their truck near the remote village of San Jose de Bocay. **********The bishops are under attack for not having condemned the killings. The official statement in which the Government announced on Friday that it had decided to expel Bishop Pablo Antonio Vega from Nicaragua said the victims at San Jose de Bocay had been ''murdered by Reagan's and Vega's mercenaries.'' **********On Sunday, the front page of the pro-Government newspaper Nuevo Diario displayed four powerful photographs of burned corpses and bereaved relatives under the banner headline ''Vega's Work; These Are the Crimes the Bishop Blesses.'' Cardinal Is Criticized **********Radio Sandino, the official station, also criticized the Catholic Primate, Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo, for failing to condemn the rebels in a homily he gave this week. The radio said the Cardinal had condemned Government orders that exiled Bishop Vega and another prominent clergyman, the Rev. Bismarck Carballo, but said he had ignored the deaths of the 32 civilians. **********The bishops' reluctance to condemn rebel forces for reported atrocities and attacks on civilians has been an important element in the Government's campaign against the Catholic hierarchy. **********''The bishops are blind,'' Nuevo Diario asserted Sunday. Although the bishops normally do not speak out against specific acts of violence said to have been committed by rebel groups, they frequently condemn the Government for what they say are its abuses of human rights. Government leaders have described them as anti-Sandinista political activists disguised as clerics. 'I Don't Know the Details' **********Cardinal Obando y Bravo and Bishop Vega, who is the second-ranking Nicaraguan prelate, have said that because the Nicaraguan press is censored and because no information about military attacks can be published or broadcast without Government approval, they have no way of ascertaining the truth about attacks said to have been staged by the rebels, who are known as contras. **********''I don't know the details of that attack,'' Cardinal Obando y Bravo said today when asked about the deaths in San Jose de Bocay. ''We condemn all unjust deaths. We are not in agreement with the spilling of blood, and for that we condemn all parties.'' **********In Managua, diplomats expressed varying opinions over the attack, which occurred last Friday. Some said the Government version of the incident had the ring of truth, but others said they doubted it. Spokesmen for the rebel force were not available for comment today. Army Plants Mines **********Over the last several years, the Nicaraguan Army has planted many thousands of mines along its northern border with Honduras. They are intended to make it more difficult for rebels based in Honduras to infiltrate into Nicaraguan territory. The border area has been largely cleared of civilians, but it is known that some Nicaraguan civilians have been killed by Sandinista mines. **********In some border regions, farms that once produced coffee and tobacco have been abandoned because of fears that field laborers might be killed by mine explosions. **********''It is entirely possible that the mine that blew up that truck was placed by the Sandinistas, not the contras,'' a European diplomat said. **********Others, however, doubted that the explosion was caused by a Sandinista mine. They said that the planting of mines by the Sandinistas was confined to the border area, and that it would be difficult to understand why they would mine a road near San Jose de Bocay, which is 25 miles from the border. Reports of Rebel Mining **********Until the end of 1985, the rebel forces did not have a substantial supply of mines. But according to Western officals closely familiar with rebel strategy, the rebels have begun to receive mines in recent months. There have been reports that they have been planting them along roads used by Sandinista military convoys. **********San Jose de Bocay, once a small trading center for the desperately poor peasants who inhabit the region, today is a fortified settlement guarded by heavy artillery and antiaircraft weapons. Sandinista soldiers regularly set out from there to patrol the rugged terrain of the rural province of Jinotega, a nearly unpopulated region where rebel bands move freely. **********According to the Sandinista press, the 32 victims had been in the back of the truck traveling toward San Jose de Bocay along a dirt road. The press reports said that there was one survivor. **********The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada said the device that destroyed the truck was ''an anti-tank mine planted by C.I.A. mercenaries.'' **********A Latin American diplomat who doubted this account said that Sandinista units would have detected contras trying to lay mines along the few roads that pass near San Jose de Bocay. 'It Takes Some Time' **********''You don't just drop a mine on the road and then speed away,'' the diplomat said, ''and you don't just put a single mine somewhere and leave it at that. You send out a squad to do the job right, and it takes some time. If the squad was contras, I think they would have been detected by army troops.'' **********There are also reports circulating in the diplomatic community here that at least some of the victims of the explosion last week were members of the Sandinista militia who may have been wearing olive green clothing. **********Neither diplomats who believed the Sandinista version nor those who doubted it could offer concrete evidence for their theories. They said their conclusions were based solely on speculation and deduction, and they agreed that the truth would be almost impossible to determine."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/23/world/us-weapons-begin-to-reach-chad.html": {"writer_name": "James Brooke", "pub_date": "1986-12-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 775, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. WEAPONS BEGIN TO REACH CHAD", "print_headline": "U.S. WEAPONS BEGIN TO REACH CHAD", "body_text": " **********This listless town seemed to shake today as an American cargo plane touched down with the first shipment of United States military equipment since Libya began an offensive in northern Chad. **********The shipment arrived as Chadian Government officials announced that Libyan warplanes, flying during a break in desert sandstorms, repeatedly bombed Chadian guerrillas today. **********Ahmed Moussa-Mi, chief of staff to President Hissen Habre, asserted that in addition to conventional bombing, Libyan forces had dropped napalm and poison gas near Zouar.

Three-Pronged Attack **********The Libyan campaign, now in its third day, is reported to have begun after three Libyan columns of about 700 troops each attacked mountain strongholds of guerrillas loyal to former President Goukouni Oueddei. **********On Sunday, diplomats said that the guerrillas had ambushed one of the Libyan columns, killing 100 soldiers. The other Libyan units were said to have encircled the mountain range and were trying to wipe out the estimated 2,000 guerrillas based there. **********The guerrillas, once allied with Libya, turned against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in October, when Mr. Goukouni was shot in the stomach by Libyans seeking to place him under house arrest in Tripoli. **********Today, Chadian radio broadcast reports that Mr. Goukouni was being tortured by the Libyans in an attempt to make him record an appeal to his supporters to stop resisting the Libyans. Qaddafi Unifies Chadians **********''Qaddafi may have gone a little too far this time,'' a Western diplomat said here. ''For the first time in 20 years of civil war, he has produced a united Chadian front.'' **********Few people believe that the American aid will be enough to allow the Chadians to push the Libyans back. **********''It's a drop of water compared to the river from the East Bloc to Libya,'' said Chad's Minister of Information, Moumine Togoi Hamidi. **********Chad's air force is virtually non-existent. Libya, by contrast, maintains a large concentration of warplanes at a base on Chad's northern border. Comparison to Afghanistan **********Mr. Togoi described northern Chad as ''the Afghanistan of Central Africa.'' **********The comparison seems apt. The hardy mountain tribesmen, who have a long history of fighting among themselves, have done well against the better-equipped Libyans. **********Mr. Moussa-Mi said the guerrillas, mostly Toubou tribesmen, protect themselves by hiding in the Tibesti mountains, which rise high enough to be topped with snow and are honeycombed with caves at lower altitudes. **********On Saturday, guerrillas reportedly ambushed a Libyan armored column toiling through mountain passes near Bardai. The guerrillas reportedly destroyed or captured millions of dollars' worth of hardware. Libyans Seen as Half-Hearted **********The Libyans, on the other hand, do not appear to be very determined. **********Last spring, officials here said, the Chadian Army captured 50 Mercedes trucks and two squadrons of Brazilian-made armored personnel carriers. **********Libya's attack on the northen tribesmen also seems to be a political error for Colonel Qaddafi, diplomats say. **********After two decades of civil war, Chad's northern and southern tribes, which were once split into 11 factions, are now allied in a common cause. Qaddafi's 'Fit of Pique' **********A diplomat said the attack on Libya's former allies amounted to ''a fit of pique'' by Colonel Qaddafi. ''They were with him, and now they are against him and he is punishing them,'' he said. **********He added that the number of Chadian fighters still allied with Libya ''couldn't fill a fair-sized movie theater.'' **********Mr. Moussa-Mi charged that last week Libyan soldiers started rounding up Chadian immigrant workers in the Libyan cities of Benghazi, Sidra and Tripoli. The workers are being trained to fight in a Chadian puppet army alongside Libyans in northern Chad, the official said. **********In contrast to the mood in many third world capitals, there is little ambivalence here about Libya. **********''When are you Americans going to come and help us kick Qaddafi out?'' a Chadian telex operator asked an American visitor."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/19/business/advertising-dove-bar-begins-its-first-big-campaign.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-05-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 84, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Dove Bar Begins Its First Big Campaign", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Dove Bar Begins Its First Big Campaign", "body_text": " **********Dove Bar, the high-priced Chicago-born ice cream pop, is spending $3.5 million on its first major advertising campaign. **********The TV advertising, already seen in Chicago and Los Angeles, comes to New York, San Francisco and Washington on June 2. **********Jan Zechman & Associates, Chicago, is the agency behind what is called the ''Heritage Campaign,'' which will largely be 15-second TV spots.

Marcos joked that if all else failed he could open a second-hand shoe store with the 3,000 pairs of his wife's shoes found in his palace in Manila. **********His joke seemed to illustrate the former Philippine President's contention in an interview here Tuesday that he was getting over a period of depression, bitterness and nightmares that troubled him after he fled his country six weeks ago. **********Mr. Marcos, seated in a wicker chair at the modest beach-front home that has become his place of exile, said that he considered his political career over, but that he was prepared to return to leadership if it becomes ''absolutely necessary in order to save the country.'' **********He said he considered it necessary to back the new Government of President Corazon C. Aquino to avoid chaos. But he also said, ''Poor girl, she may have bitten off more than she can chew.'' **********Vindication Called Aim **********As gusts of rain and wind stirred the ocean just beyond his open porch door and servants prepared lunch, Mr. Marcos said he was taking a morning off from the consultations with lawyers that are now consuming his days. **********''I intend to vindicate myself within my lifetime,'' he said, referring to the accumulating lawsuits over what is known as his hidden wealth. ''We are not going to let these fabrications and these lies and perjuries destroy the family name.'' **********As he talked, his wife, Imelda, stood in the next room trying on gifts of clothing brought by friends from Manila to augment what she said was the one good dress she had managed to take with her. **********In conversation, Mrs. Marcos appeared preoccupied with the many charges of extravagance that have been brought against her since their flight from the Philippines on Feb. 26, explaining specifically her possession of hundreds of bars of perfumed soap, vats of perfume, cases full of gifts for her friends and thousands of pairs of shoes. **********Asked how she felt about the opening of Malacanang Palace to the public, she said: ''I think that's a very kinky issue with the panties and bras. That's the thing that they will display: shoes, panties and bras.'' Possessions Are Defended **********Mr. Marcos defended what he said was the discovery of five dialysis machines in the palace, saying, ''Well, of course, that's part of any medical dispensary.'' He continued to maintain that he did not receive dialysis treatments, saying the very number of the expensive machines proved his point. **********''If I had needed dialysis, why would I have needed five?'' he said. **********He added that the palace was also equipped with two X-ray machines, though he had no special need for X-rays. **********Mr. Marcos appeared relaxed and said he was feeling well and had gained weight. He limped slightly and the backs of his hands bore the scars of a mysterious ailment that had afflicted him during the election campaign, which some doctors said appeared to be the degenerative disease systematic lupus erythematosus. **********Throughout the interview, Mr. Marcos sounded much as he had when still in power, speaking in long, slow sentences and analyzing events in the Philippines in lawyerly detail. From time to time he made the dry horizontal gesture with his palm that Filipino television viewers had come to know well. **********But the setting of the interview illustrated the distance he had traveled from his days in the ornate palace, where groups of aides and security men stood nearby awaiting his orders. Hired Guards Roam **********The two-story house, for which he pays $4,500-a-month rent and whose furniture is rented, is bare of decoration as if its occupants consider it a temporary stopping place. **********The dining room table seats only eight and latecomers take their plates to a patio furnished with wicker chairs. **********Guards from a private security company who were hired on a two-week basis after Secret Service protection was withdrawn this week wander with hand-held radios among the palm trees bordering the seashore 100 feet away. **********Mrs. Marcos complains that her view of the Pacific does not face toward the Philippines. **********Mr. Marcos said that in his first weeks in America, at Hickam Air Force Base, ''I had a period of extreme depression and bitterness.'' **********''I felt ill-treated back then. It took me two weeks to get out of it, but I'm over that now.'' Bitter Words for Americans **********He said his bitterness was directed ''at everybody, but mostly at myself, for having been deceived into leaving Malacanang.'' **********It was primarily the Americans who deceived him, he said, by threatening to use force against him and by telling him, falsely, that he was to be evacuated no farther than his home province of Ilocos Norte.  [ President Reagan told a group of newspaper executives in Washington that ''as far as we knew, he was aware that his destination when he left the palace was Clark Field.'' It was from Clark Air Base that Mr. Marcos flew into exile.  [ Mr. Reagan said that during the February rebellion against Mr. Marcos, ''our only practice - or what we did during that entire time'' was to try to make sure that situation did not ''degenerate into civil war.'' ]  ''What must really have broken my will was the American position,'' he said, rather than the electoral performance of Mrs. Aquino or the military revolt led by his close friend, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. **********If it had not been for American pressure, he said, he could easily have used phosphorus shells and buckshot to sweep away the crowds surrounding Mr. Enrile's rebel troops. The Nightmares Are Fewer **********But he also said the thought of doing battle with his own people still haunted him. ''I awaken sometimes with some kind of nightmares about me leading troops and killing people, killing my own soldiers,'' he said. ''But that doesn't happen so often anymore.'' **********Arriving at lunchtime with a group of friends from Manila, and carrying gifts of cake and cookies, his daughter Irene Araneta said gaily: ''We're all refugees. Isn't it fun?'' **********But Mrs. Marcos said that both her daughters, Irene and Imee Manotoc, reported that their small children had been traumatized by their flight from the Philippines and that one child had been taken to see a psychologist. **********Irene said her son shouts in fear whenever he hears the sound of a helicopter. **********Asked about his future role, Mr. Marcos, who was dressed for the interview in a dark blue three-piece suit, replied with a dry laugh, ''As a peasant, I suppose.'' **********Then he added: ''I intend to play an advisory role. I don't wish to engage in politics anymore.'' His Wish Is to Go Back **********He said that he had been asked by some African governments, including that of Liberia, to advise them on developing economic and social self-reliance and that once he had completed the groundwork for his legal defense, ''I might just do that.'' **********His great desire, he said, was ''to go back peacefully to Ilocos Norte and live there and be part of the return to normalcy in my country.'' **********''I would be one of the anonymous public that performs its share of citizenship, and perhaps guide our people in some of the programs I have put forward in my writings.'' **********Mr. Marcos said his statements of support for Mrs. Aquino were intended not only to rally the people against Communism but also to help prepare the way for his return. ''But I don't expect it to be anytime soon,'' he said. **********Of his political future, he said, ''I would prefer to stay out. But if it comes to a point where I am needed to unite our people, even at the risk of life, I will do that. I will go there to help them fight the common enemy.'' **********He appeared to be referring to the Communists, who he said he believed were now infiltrating the Government of Mrs. Aquino. **********''Look, I'm tired of all this,'' he said, ''of these falsehoods, this treachery of friends, of this general human weakness. All I can do about this is philosophize about it. It's one of those things you must accept, I guess.'' Errors That He Regrets **********At all costs, he said, he wished to avoid looking like ''an angry, bitter political figure trying to recover what he has lost.'' **********Mr. Marcos said he thought often of a reference in Cervantes to the last Moslem kings of Spain: ''Do not cry like a woman over the kingdom that you lost because you could not defend it like a man.'' He said he had failed to defend his own kingdom ''like a wise man.'' **********''I should have not committed errors that I committed.'' **********The errors that appeared to preoccupy him were his tactics in his final days in power and his failure to hold out despite his evident loss of American support. **********Asked whether he would counsel another nation to rely on the United States for its help and protection, he said, ''That's a very hard question.'' He said he would advise ''certain guarantees'' and a measure of skepticism and self-reliance in the face of American guidance. Charges Are 'Hogwash' **********Mr. Marcos called the accusations that he has huge real estate and financial holdings ''hogwash'' and he offered complicated but evasive defenses against some of the specific charges. He said his detailed defenses were in the hands of lawyers. **********Of an estimated $350 million in real estate he is said to control in New York, he said: ''That is not our property. I have said so. We will file a counterclaim. This is a serious matter.'' **********''We will not talk about these places,'' he said. ''We have asked our lawyers to handle it. I would like to see if my name is on any of these documents, or any participation in any of the corporations involved. We already have said enough. You realize how ticklish all this is.'' **********Asked whether he felt let down by the Philippine people, Mr. Marcos replied: ''No. I won. I am the legitimate President, although I am not pressing the point. I was deposed by a coup d'etat, by friends that I trusted and aided by the American Government.'' **********He said he believed the extraordinary powers assumed last month by Mrs. Aquino were more autocratic than his own declaration of martial law in 1972 in that he had set more specific ground rules for the conduct of government and adjudication of grievances and had specified the constitutional terms of his declaration. **********''I'm afraid it's in a state of confusion,'' he said of the Aquino Government. ''Cory is probably too weak to stop anything. This is what I'm worried about. Cory has her own ideas, but probably she is not the type of person who dominates.'' **********He added: ''She's not used to all this hard work, and she finds this all very dull.

Pearson in the late 1960's, Mr. Nielsen's comments implied that the Conservatives in opposition were privy to the Government's policy secrets. **********The disclosure was made by The Toronto Star newspaper, which obtained an interview that Mr. Nielsen recorded in 1973 with Peter Stursberg, an author who was writing a book about the late John Diefenbaker, who was Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963. **********Tape Recording in Archives **********''There was a method by which we knew every Wednesday what was said in the Liberal caucus,'' word for word, Mr. Nielsen was quoted as having confided. ''I had nothing to do with it, but I had access to it.'' **********Mr. Nielsen had asked Mr. Stursberg to keep his comments about eavesdropping secret, and the tape recording of the interview has been stored away in the Public Archives of Canada. **********Mr. Nielsen told the House of Commons today that he knew what went on in the Liberal caucus meeting because wires had been crossed on an electronic system being installed between the committee rooms. He said that he had explained this in an interview that appeared in the monthly magazine Saturday Night in January 1985. **********Mr. Nielsen called it no secret that ''information has a habit of finding its own way into other hands.'' **********But angry members of the opposition Liberal and New Democratic Parties repeatedly called for him to resign his post as the second most powerful man in government or at least step down until the matter was cleared up. The Deputy Prime Minister has simultaneously held the defense portfolio since the previous Minister of Defense, Robert Coates, resigned in a scandal last February. Report on Wiretaps Issued **********Unfortunately for the Conservatives, the revelation coincided with the finding made public by the Law Reform Commission of Canada today that Canadians are 20 times as likely as Americans to be targets of electronic eavesdropping. **********The commission reported that judges in Canada approved twice as many wiretaps as did judges in the United States, which has a population 10 times as large. It concluded that there was an ''unjustified pervasiveness'' of electronic surveillance by police agencies in Canada. **********The new dispute for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was unlikely to bring down his Government, which holds 211 of the 282 seats in the House of Commons. But the Nielsen affair has become the latest in a series of controversies that have tarnished his party's image and undercut its popularity in the last five months. Three of his Cabinet ministers who came under attack have resigned in the last year. **********Today in the House of Commons, Mr. Mulroney staunchly defended his Deputy Prime Minister as ''entirely blameless'' of wrongdoing and alluded repeatedly to his record as a Member of Parliament for 28 years and a decorated bomber pilot in World War II. **********Mr. Mulroney rejected calls to investigate the affair and challenged Mr. Nielsen's critics to make specific accusations ''with the appropriate consequences.'' Members of Parliament who accuse a fellow member of wrongdoing traditionally must resign if their charges are not substantiated in an ensuing investigation. **********Mr. Nielsen, an effective if aggressive point man for Mr. Mulroney in the House of Commons, has developed personal antagonisms toward the Liberals since joining Parliament in late 1957. In the late 1960's, he contended that his telephone was tapped and his mail opened on orders of the Liberal Government then in power. **********Consequently, Mr. Nielsen, a tough political infighter, may be the man the Liberals would most like to bring down. Remarks Are Translated **********During a fractious question period in the House of Commons this afternoon, the opposition parties repeatedly challenged Mr. Nielsen's contention that his eavesdropping on the Liberal Party caucus had come about accidentally. **********Neil Young, a New Democratic member, asked if Prime Minister Mulroney did not agree that enough doubts had been raised to warrant an investigation. **********Mr. Nielsen told Mr. Stursberg that when he overheard one virulent attack on Mr. Diefenbaker and himself in the Liberal caucus by Leo Cadieux, a former Cabinet minister, ''I could scarcely believe what I was hearing, and I was hearing every word that was spoken.'' **********''He was speaking in French and I had the benefit of a translation service as well,'' he added. **********Mr. Nielsen does not speak French, and his critics contended that the translation of Mr. Cadieux's private remarks proved that deliberate bugging was involved. **********Today's House of Commons session grew so contentious that the Speaker, John Bosley, kept rising to rule many questions out of order and to restore some semblance of civility."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/14/business/key-rates-921586.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 111, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/09/world/thai-chief-won-t-enter-election.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 223, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THAI CHIEF WON'T ENTER ELECTION", "print_headline": "THAI CHIEF WON'T ENTER ELECTION", "body_text": " **********Thailand's Prime Minister, Prem Tinsulanonda, announced today that he would not run for a legislative seat in the election on July 27. **********The decision does not rule out another term for Mr. Prem, a former general who has survived two coup attempts as he moved the country toward a more democratic system. **********The Thai Constitution does not demand that the head of Government be elected to a seat in the National Assembly. **********But his decision is a setback for civilian political leaders who are trying to move the country away from military dominance.

Mr. Gavin replied: ''Because of the nature of the classified information I have received on these matters, it would be improper to comment.'' **********The Mexican Embassy deferred comment, citing President de la Madrid's statements on the subject during an interview on American television earlier this week.

He said the Senator's office could not make public any of the classified information from the closed hearings. **********Although no one in Government had made public accusations against the Mexican President's cousin and the Judicial Police official before, their names had circulated in Washington, and the Mexican Government had denied the allegations. **********The Mexican Judicial Police, which operate under the Attorney General's office, are in charge of the national anti-narcotics campaign. **********While most of Mr. Gavin's testimony today was sympathetic toward Mexico, he harshly criticized ''at least two governors,'' whom he did not name, of being ''notorious'' drug traffickers, ''up to their elbows in the trade.'' **********But Mr. Gavin defended the Governor of the northern state of Sonora, Rodolfo Felix Valdez, whom William von Raab, the United States Customs Commissioner, implicated in possible involvement in drug trafficking when he testified before the same subcommittee last month that the Governor of Sonora owned farms on which drugs were grown. **********At the same time, Mr. Gavin acknowledged that the Customs Service does have its own ''sources of information'' about Mr. Felix Valdez. **********In the American television interview last week, President de la Madrid was asked about the accusations against both his cousin and Mr. Ventura. Mr. de la Madrid said he had asked the Mexican Attorney General to request from American authorities ''proof of the allegations that were being made.'' **********''So far,'' he added, ''the only thing they can say is that there are rumors but no proof.

Evans, the Republican of Washington who was the only other Senator to attend the hearing, said he disagreed with Mr. Helms's approach. **********''The constant drumfire of criticism,'' he said, ''will do just what it would'' if similar criticism were targeted at the United States from another country.

At Reykjavik the Soviet Union went farther than ever before in accepting our goal of deep reductions in the level of nuclear weapons. For the first time, we got Soviet agreement to a figure of 100 intermediate-range missile warheads for each side worldwide. And that was a truly drastic cut. **********For the first time, we began to hammer out the details of a 50 percent cut in strategic warheads over five years. And we were just a sentence or two away from agreeing to new talks on nuclear testing. And, maybe most important, we were in sight of a historic agreement on completely eliminating the threat of offensive ballistic missiles by 1996. **********Believe me, the significance of that meeting at Reykjavik is not that we didn't sign agreements at the end. The significance is that we got as close as we did. The progress that we made would have been inconceivable just a few months ago. **********On issue after issue, particularly in the area of arms reduction, we saw that General Secretary Gorbachev was ready for serious bargaining on real arms reductions. For me this was especially gratifying. Just five and a half years ago, when we came into office, I said that our objective must be must not be regulating the growth in nuclear weapons, which is what arms control as it was known had been all about. . . . Western Unity **********The Soviets knew that we have the support of not only a strong America but a united NATO alliance that was going ahead with Pershing 2 and ground-launched cruise missiles. **********So, yes, it was this strength and unity that brought the Soviets to the bargaining table. And particularly important was America's support for the Strategic Defense Initiative. As you know, I offered Mr. Gorbachev an important concession on S.D.I. I offered to put off deployment for a decade and I coupled that with a 10-year plan for eliminating all Soviet and American ballistic missiles from the face of the earth. **********This may have been the most sweeping and important arms reduction proposal in the history of the world. But it wasn't good enough for Mr. Gorbachev. He wanted more. He wanted us to accept even tighter limits on S.D.I. than the ABM treaty now requires. That is to stop all but laboratory research. He knew this meant killing the Strategic Defense Initiative entirely, which has been the Soviet goal from the start. **********Of course, the Soviet Union has long been engaged in extensive strategic defense programs of its own. And unlike ours, the Soviet program goes well beyond research - even to deployment. The Soviet proposal would have given them an immediate one-sided advantage and a dangerous one. I could not and would not agree to that. I won't settle for anything unless it's in the interest of American security. S.D.I. as Insurance **********Now, America and the West need S.D.I. for long-run insurance. It protects against the possibility that at some point when the elimination of ballistic missiles is not yet complete the Soviets may change their mind. We know the Soviet record of playing fast and loose with past agreements. **********America can't afford to take a chance of waking up in 10 years and finding that the Soviets have an advanced defense system and are ready to put in place more missiles or more modern missiles and we have no defense of our own and our deterrence is obsolete because of the Soviet defense system. **********If arms reduction is to help bring lasting peace, we must be able to maintain the vital strategic balance which for so long has kept the peace. Nothing could more threaten world peace than arms reduction agreements with loopholes that would leave the West naked to a massive and sudden Soviet buildup in offensive and defensive weapons. **********My guess is that the Soviets understand this but want to see how much farther they can push us in public before they once again get down to brass tacks. Assessment of Talks **********So here's how I see the meeting in Iceland adding up. We addressed the important issues of human rights, regional conflicts and our bilateral relationship. Mr. Gorbachev and I got awfully close to historic agreements in the arms reduction process. We took discussions into areas where they have never been before. **********The United States put good, fair ideas out on the table and they won't go away. Good ideas, after all, have a life of their own. The next step will be in Geneva, where our negotiators will work to build on this progress. . . . **********I believe that we have it within our grasp to achieve some truly historic breakthroughs. Last week I described Iceland as a base camp on the way to the summit. This week I want to report to you that I believe there exists the opportunity to plant a permanent flag of peace at that summit. And I call on the Soviets not to miss that opportunity. The Soviets must not throw this away, must not slip back into a greater arms buildup. **********The American people don't mistake the absence of a final agreement for the absence of progress. We made progress. We must be patient. We made historic advances. We will not turn back. **********Thank you again for all that you have done."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/business/l-mcclain-replies-917486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "McClain Replies", "print_headline": "McClain Replies", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I was amused to read C. W. Griffin's assertion (Letters, Dec. 29) that I used ''faulty'' data on inflation in my Dec. 1 article, ''The Recessions Weren't Worth It.'' My statement that ''the average inflation rate from 1979 to 1981 was in the single digits'' referred to the average inflation rate as measured by the implicit price deflator for the gross national product, a more comprehensive measure of inflation than the Consumer Price Index to which Mr. Griffin alluded. **********My statement is also accurate if one uses as an inflation indicator the implicit price deflator for personal consumption expenditures. **********Further, Mr. Griffin is incorrect when he suggests that if inflation and nominal interest rates were 4 percent higher today the economy would find itself in recession again.

It's tempting to try to convince ourselves that all the economic pain we experienced in the early 1980's in the name of lowering inflation was unavoidable and in the long run beneficial.

Increasingly, they are substituting coordination for costly internecine competition in their campaigns to organize the four-fifths of the work force still outside union ranks. **********In an even sharper break with tradition, labor's top officials now want to get in on the ground floor of any strike - or any bargaining - of national significance, not just be there at the end to pick up the pieces of a local union in disarray. **********The principal architect of the push to revitalize the movement through concerted action is Lane Kirkland, the soft-spoken technocrat who heads the A.F.L.-C.I.O. In the six years since he succeeded George Meany as federation president, he has used his own distinctive brand of conciliation and consultation to win from the potentates who rule its key affiliates a respect comparable to that once accorded his imperious mentor. Despite the steady worsening of labor's fortunes, which had begun under Mr. Meany, Mr. Kirkland believes a reversal can come through giving the central body an early voice in efforts to keep bargaining disputes from producing yet more headaches for labor. **********''We must be part of the general staff at the inception, rather than the ambulance drivers at the bitter end,'' Mr. Kirkland told his colleagues at a February meeting of the federation's executive council in Florida. A sense of urgency, bordering on desperation, spurs the search for initiatives: The skeleton-like state of many once-powerful unions has banished torpor in the upper echelons of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. **********But unfortunately for unionism, its problems have a way of growing at least as fast as the remedies the leadership is trying to put in place. Grassroots activists long censorious of what they consider excessive complacency at labor's summit are ambivalent about the prospect of a pivotal role for the federation in formulating policies in collective bargaining and strikes. **********Almost without exception, activists and some local labor leaders agree that it is past time for labor to map a unified strategy aimed at taking the initiative away from management in major struggles. But some fear the intervention will mean a suppression of rank-and-file influence and a damper on militancy. **********''Unhappily, I have seen no indication the leaders believe that the strength of the organization is in its rank and file,'' says Ray Rogers, the professional union strategist whose aggressive tactics in the bitter strike of meatpackers at the Austin, Minn., plant of Geo. A. Hormel & Company have made him a bete noir to the labor establishment. **********The strike, now in its ninth month, pits a militant local of striking meatpackers not only against Hormel but also against its own international union and most of labor's top hierarchy. The fratricidal struggle is a major embarrassment to labor, precisely the sort of quagmire that Mr. Kirkland's initiatives would strive to avoid. It has rekindled fierce debate within labor over how much control in determining union policy should rest with officials at the top and how much with the rank and file. **********It has also brought back to fever heat another major question that plagues federation leaders and local activists: If there is a road to salvation for the battered labor movement, does it lie in more aggressiveness or more accommodations? **********In the resolution on the Hormel strike it adopted at its February meeting in Florida, the 35-member executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. left no doubt that it opts for moderation. ''Today's economic and political climate,'' the council said, ''makes it imperative that unions follow realistic bargaining strategies that will assure gains for workers and protect their jobs - not 'all or nothing' stances that too often leave workers with nothing, including no job.'' **********The sticky fight by the Austin rebels, who have the fervent support of scores of local unions and individual activists all over the country, could scarcely come at a worse time for a parent federation trying to institute reforms. **********These reforms all point toward converting what has always been a relatively loose alliance of autonomous unions - ''a rope of sand,'' as critics have frequently characterized the federation - into a much more centralized organization. Labor leaders envision a parent body capable of mobilizing the movement for coordinated resistance to the ravages inflicted by employer attack, imports, deregulation, the atrophy of traditional union strongholds and the flight of jobs overseas. **********In line with this trend toward centralization, the executive council is trying to devise a plan that would empower it to get in at the beginning of potential clashes. Its members hope that such a strategy would prevent the entire movement from being damaged by the miscalculations of a single union, and that it would help counteract the string of devastating defeats unions have been suffering since President Reagan demolished the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization in 1981 and fired all 11,500 of its striking members. **********''It is very encouraging to think of the movement involving itself from the beginning in important situations,'' says Jan Pierce, an international vice president of the Communications Workers of America, who is also one of the few high-ranking unionists actively supporting the Hormel strikers. ''It would encourage, not suppress, local militancy, which is an ingredient that has been missing as we in labor have let ourselves be desensitized and brutalized by Ronald Reagan and others who took their cue from what he did to PATCO.'' **********The nub of the new plan, which leaders hope to have ready for consideration at the council's August meeting, would be relaxation of the time-hallowed rules that have kept the federation from interfering in major labor-management confrontations until after a strike is lost. **********Traditionally, each international union is sovereign in determining its own policy in collective bargaining with employers. Under the new plan, whenever negotiations have national implications and the international union involved anticipates trouble, the federation would endeavor to get involved from the start in helping to shape bargaining strategy and in deciding whether to strike or pursue other approaches toward achieving union goals. **********Proposals to grant the central organization such authority in the sacrosanct field of collective bargaining developed unexpectedly out of a lachrymose discussion of labor's difficulties on the strike front at the February council meeting. The council, made up primarily of international union presidents, sets policy for the federation and its 13.5 million members between conventions, and does so behind closed doors. **********At the Florida meeting, Mr. Kirkland, the federation's president, lost no time in identifying with the idea that his office ought not be required to wait until its only function in critical disputes was to pick up the pieces ''in extremis.'' **********In the field of new organizing, the executive council also acted at the same meeting to endorse an equally startling departure from the historic straitjackets of union autonomy and jurisdiction. This took the form of a precedent-breaking arbitration pact aimed at halting the downhill slide in the percentage of workers with union cards. Today, fewer than one worker in every five belongs to a union, as against one in three 30 years ago. **********The pact seeks to halt destructive warfare among federation affiliates over who will be king of the hill in attempts to sign up the same group of unorganized workers in factories, offices or public agencies. Only a few months ago, unions were spending millions of dollars fighting one another in a scramble for new members. Now, they have agreed to resolve such disputes amicably with the aid of federation-picked mediators and umpires. **********Far-reaching as these efforts are, it is still too early to be sure that they will create the kind of unity the federation seeks to forge. Solidarity has been more slogan than reality in many key unions during the last decade: That has been demonstrated repeatedly by the collapse of strikes in airlines, copper mines and other fields because of the failure of sister unions to honor picket lines or the inability of the striking union to hold its own ranks intact in a long tie-up. **********Typical of the mixed sentiments with which long-time union gadflies view labor's new drive is the comment of Herman W. Benson, executive director of the Association for Union Democracy, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing internal democracy in labor. **********''This could be the answer to a crying need if labor is to stop the union busters,'' he says. ''The movement has been letting itself be picked off, union by union, without any mobilization of its collective strength. But until the leadership gives some concrete evidence of seriousness, activists will remain pessimistic about the ability of this labor officialdom to rise above bureaucratic self-interest.'' **********A more positive reaction comes from another long-time crusader for more membership involvement in union governance. ''It is encouraging that, for the first time, the federation is talking about becoming a central factor in building strike solidarity, not just a disbursing agency,'' says Anthony Mazzocchi, director of the Workers Policy Project. ''Unions are being beaten all over the lot, and a fight-back strategy is necessary.'' MANAGEMENT has uncertainties, too, but its concerns are just the opposite of those that worry union activists. ''It is yet to be seen how a larger role for the federation will translate into the marketplace,'' says Mark A. de Bernardo, manager of labor law for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''It will be positive if it means a more cooperative, responsive movement, one that reins in the maverick locals, such as the one at Austin. If it goes the other way, it will be a problem management will have to counter.'' **********No guideposts for federation involvement have yet begun to take shape. But the February discussion disclosed near-unanimity within the council on the desirability of a flexible program for applying A.F.L.-C.I.O. leverage to maximize the chances of union success in situations where all labor might otherwise end up with a black eye. **********The subject surfaced in the wake of a lament by William H. Bywater, president of the International Union of Electronic Workers, on the ease with which employers - the prosperous as well as the hard pressed -could use the existing labor laws and the availability of a huge pool of jobless workers to force unions to yield concessions at the bargaining table or face extinction through the permanent replacement of strikers. **********Mr. Bywater urged the federation to press Congress for legal changes designed to prevent companies from ''wiping out 20 or 30 years of job rights for their people'' by fomenting strikes and capitalizing on the unemployed to get rid of both the union and their old work force. All his colleagues agreed that such legislation would be beneficial, but there was equal agreement that the political climate in Washington ruled out realistic hope of getting it through now. **********At this point, the focus shifted to steps the federation might take to swing the power balance in labor's favor, especially in conflicts where unions believed management was girding for a fight to the finish. The consensus, as reported by a half-dozen council members, was that the interests of all unions - and of the movement - would be best protected if parochial considerations were subordinated and machinery created for early A.F.L.-C.I.O. involvement. **********''Our people are coming to realize that they can't operate in their own little fishbowl,'' said John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union. **********Responsibility for drafting the new program has been turned over to the group that has become the federation's principal think tank for modernizing its structure - the Committee on the Evolution of Work, whose chairman is Thomas R. Donahue, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. secretary treasurer. **********The committee issued a landmark report 15 months ago, acknowledging the magnitude of the federation's afflictions and calling for innovations in policy and practice to get the movement moving again. Experiments in labor-management cooperation and other moves away from adversarial tactics were lauded. But the report also urged unions to consider financial and community pressures as alternatives to strikes in clashes with recalcitrant employers. **********Charles McDonald, the committee secretary who will become director of the federation's department of organization and field services in July, envisages the A.F.L.-C.I.O. establishing a vast computerized data base to help in organizing and negotiating. It would include expiration dates of contracts that might impinge on a specific negotiation, legal limits on how much support other unions might provide and the outside pressures, alliances or contacts the parent organization might invoke to sway the heads of a resistant company. **********The techniques at the federation's disposal would include quiet diplomacy in corporate executive suites, a squeeze on companies with interlocking directorates through the movement of billions of dollars in employee pension reserves, lobbying activities with governmental agencies, and enlistment of aid from church, civil rights and consumer groups. **********Where a strike appears unwinnable, the federation's advice might be to keep everyone at work and use in-plant strategems plus pressure on investors to prod the employer - a technique now being used to fight pay cuts and other contract retreats in the cement industry. THE council's approval of the arbitration plan designed to avoid ''wasteful'' competition in organizing campaigns strengthens the leadership's expectation that a formula for assigning strike responsibilities to the central organization would not be torpedoed by local union contentions that it represented an invasion of their autonomy. **********''Now,'' says Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, ''we are beginning to recognize that it is more important to organize the unorganized than to argue about who will get the workers when they are organized. No one is saying, 'This is my turf.' The accent is on cooperation.'' **********This recognition has resulted in a coordinated campaign by nine unions to organize 40,000 Blue Cross/Blue Shield employees across the nation. Through the A.F.L.-C.I.O. organizing department, each of the nine unions has been assigned two primary targets in specific states or metropolitan areas. Such once-dominant unions in the smokestack industries as the United Steelworkers and the United Automobile Workers are pursuing new members in health care, showing how little the traditional lines of jurisdiction have come to mean in the present enfeebled state of unionism. **********Another expression of the outreach program the middle-class oriented federation is undertaking to shake off its woes is its sponsorship of a panoply of financial services for its members. It has entered into a contract with the Bank of New York for a special low-interest credit card under the Mastercard imprint. Similar deals are being explored for union-sponsored I.R.A.'s and money-market funds. Still to come are more consumer ventures, through discount programs covering everything from household goods to insurance. **********Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, wants to see the range of coordination by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. extended even further. ''With women on their way to being 50 percent of the work force and everything else about the nature of work changing, unions are going to have to be a step ahead of employers in foreseeing what lies ahead,'' she says. ''We must not stop with the pragmatic, but organize a thoroughgoing and highly professional program of research and development to look 20 years down the road.'' **********To build up rank-and-file backing for the whole range of reforms, unions in many areas are sponsoring workshops for an exchange of views between grassroots leaders and spokesmen for the parent federation. Prof. Thomas A. Kochan of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a consultant to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., says there is a general feeling among the rank and file that the problems of the 1980's exceed the grasp of any single union and must be tackled by organized labor as a movement. **********''As unions experience more and more shrinkage and the crisis environment intensifies,'' Mr. Kochan says, ''the need and the opportunity for centralized leadership increases. The handicap is that the movement still lacks any overriding force or message to pull its disparate elements together.'' **********As the search for affirmative answers goes forward, the federation leaders do not delude themselves that time is on their side. ''There is a kind of pressure cooker building up out of frustration with the remedies, sanctions or responses now available to us in combating employer offensives,'' says John T. Joyce, president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen. ''Our task is to find an effective way to express the growing militancy among our rank and file and our mid-level officials and not have it all wind up as a Pyrrhic gesture.'' THE GOMPERS RULE: AUTONOMY **********When the American Federation of Labor was established in Pittsburgh a century ago, no concept was more fundamental than the autonomy of its constituent unions. The right of each union to self-rule was viewed by Samuel Gompers, the federation's founding father, as a safeguard for the principles of bread-and-butter unionism that differentiated his organization from the Utopian visions of a series of short-lived predecessors. **********''The American Federation of Labor,'' said Mr. Gompers, ''avoids the fatal rock on which all previous attempts to effect the unity of the working class have split, by leaving to each body or affiliated organization the complete management of its own affairs.'' **********Under this doctrine, the policy of the Gompers-led A.F.L. was to stay out of collective bargaining except when invited by unions that found their own resources inadequate. Even that restraint did not always prevent conflict where the request for help came from strong unions. **********But things began to change over time. The industrial unionists who bolted the A.F.L. in 1935 to form what became the Congress of Industrial Organizations never accorded autonomy the same sacrosanct status. John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers made himself the spearhead of the C.I.O., in command from the start of critical negotiations in autos, steel and other industries. His successor, Philip Murray, never exercised comparable muscle, but he often injected himself into strikes that involved vital services. **********The first real movement toward greater centralization in the A.F.L. did not come until George Meany was named president in 1952. He was outraged by the damage being done to labor's image by the stubbornness with which a few unions used autonomy as a shield to protect racketeers in positions of union trust. The vigor with which Meany tore down that barrier by ousting unions that refused to rid themselves of corrupt leaders contributed to unification of the A.F.L. and C.I.O. three years later. The merger made further dents in the walls of autonomy, notably in such areas as civil rights and interunion raids. **********In the nearly seven years since Lane Kirkland replaced Mr. Meany, labor's many setbacks have caused an increasingly rapid transfer of authority to the central organization. ''Out of our suffering is coming a cohesion that is impressive,'' says Murray H. Finley, president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/05/business/south-africa-is-pressed-into-economic-isolation.html": {"writer_name": "Steve Lohr", "pub_date": "1986-07-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 775, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA IS PRESSED INTO ECONOMIC ISOLATION", "print_headline": "SOUTH AFRICA IS PRESSED INTO ECONOMIC ISOLATION", "body_text": " **********A confusing series of threats, statements and denials by South Africa's officials and advisers in recent days underline the nation's growing economic isolation. **********Moreover, it has become clear that while Western political leaders are debating the wisdom of economic sanctions against the Pretoria Government because of its racial policy, the international financial markets have already imposed sanctions of their own, battering the South African currency. **********The uncertainty surrounding South Africa's debt rescheduling efforts grew after statements this week from the Swiss banker Fritz Leutwiler, who had acted as mediator between Pretoria and its foreign creditors, and his spokesman in Zurich. On Thursday the spokesman, Erich Heini, said Mr. Leutwiler was resigning as mediator in response to South Africa's state-of-emergency declaration last month. **********Late Thursday night Mr. Leutwiler denied that statement, attributing it to a misunderstanding between him and the spokesman. Instead, Mr. Leutwiler said his role had effectively lapsed after the banks and South Africa reached an interim debt agreement last March, based on his proposals. Misunderstanding Noted **********A statement issued by his London representative said Mr. Leutwiler's mandate was over but, if asked later to resume the role of mediator, ''he would consider it in the light of the circumstances at the time.'' **********Today Mr. Heini conceded that his announcement was based on a misunderstanding. He added, ''The important thing is that there is no mandate anymore in the hands of Leutwiler.'' **********It now seems unlikely that either Mr. Leutwiler, former head of Switzerland's central bank, or anyone else of similar standing will act as mediator. **********Mr. Leutwiler was appointed mediator last September after South Africa, facing a drain of funds and creditors' demands amid racial tension, stopped making repayments on $14 billion of its $24 billion in foreign debt. At the time, no bank wanted to head a creditors' committee that might be seen as cooperating with the Pretoria administration, which is known for apartheid. **********Last February Mr. Leutwiler persuaded the two sides to accept a short-term accord in which South Africa agreed to make some penalty payments on the frozen debt while the banks agreed to roll over existing loans maturing within the period of the accord, later extended to June 1987. Accord's Informal Status **********The pact was not a formal rescheduling of debt, and the banks refused to even discuss the possibility of new loans unless Pretoria moved to end its policy of apartheid. **********At the time, Mr. Leutwiler characterized the agreement as a short-term vehicle giving South Africa needed economic ''breathing room'' during which it could progress toward a peaceful solution of its problems. Mr. Leutwiler was to have conducted sessions next fall and next April, when the bankers and the Government would review the debt settlement in light of hoped-for improvement in the political situation. **********''But after the state of emergency, there is no role for a negotiator because instead of progress things have gotten worse,'' a London banker said. **********Money continues to flow out of South Africa. Since February the value of the financial rand, the restricted form of the currency used for exporting capital, has fallen more than 35 percent. Since January of last year, 55 American companies with employees in South Africa have pulled out - 17 of them this year. A small secondary market in South African debt, mostly involving European banks, has developed with the loans selling at discounts of as much as 30 percent. Outlook Seems to Worsen **********''There are already sanctions against South Africa in terms of no new loans, no new investment and considerable disinvestment,'' said William Guttridge, a South African specialist at London's Institute for the Study of Conflict, a private research group. **********South Africa's economic outlook appears to worsen as political tensions heighten. Black workers went on strike at diamond mines today, demanding the release of union officials held under the state of emergency. Diamonds are a major South African export. **********''As the situation deteriorates, South Africa's chances of achieving any kind of respectable economic growth are fading,'' said Stephen Lewis of Phillips & Drews, a London brokerage firm. **********The South African Finance Minister, Barend du Plessis, told foreign bankers Thursday that Pretoria plans to keep meeting interest payments as provided in its interim pact with the lenders. His comments came three days after Denis Worrall, South Africa's Ambassador to London, said his country would consider reneging on its debts if Western nations imposed comprehensive sanctions. Mr. du Plessis said Mr. Worrall's remark should be interpreted as a statement of fact, not as a threat."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/14/business/business-digest-monday-july-14-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 360, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Summary", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, JULY 14, 1986", "print_headline": "BUSINESS DIGEST: MONDAY, JULY 14, 1986", "body_text": " **********The Economy **********The impact of foreign economies on the nation's growth rate has been underestimated, economists say.

Shultz's speech today at Harvard University's 350th anniversary convocation: **********I know that I've come to the right place to voice a message of outrage at the detention of Nick Daniloff, Harvard class of 1956. The cynical arrest of an innocent American journalist reminds us of what we already know: our traditions of free inquiry and openness are spurned by the Soviets, showing the dark side of a society prepared to resort to hostage-taking as an instrument of policy. **********Let there be no talk of a trade for Daniloff. We and Nick have ruled that out. The Soviet leadership must find the wisdom to settle this case quickly in accordance with the dictates of simple human decency and of civilized national behavior. **********So I know I've come to the right place to deliver a message of concern, to speak of some disturbing trends I see in this country - to tell of some important lessons America has learned in recent years, and some lessons we apparently have not yet learned. **********These disturbing trends at home are all the more paradoxical because they occur against the backdrop of powerful positive forces at work today in the world at large, forces that offer us an extraordinary opportunity if we don't throw it away. War, Upheaval, Progress **********How much has happened in this world in the 50 years since Harvard's 300th convocation! War, revolution, social upheaval and progress - the scale and pace of events make the last half century seem as dramatic, and even more full of promise and peril, than the previous three centuries put together. **********We all know that one of the most dramatic changes in these 50 years was in this country's relationship to the rest of the world. And the pace of that change, in some respects, is still accelerating. **********In the past five years, message traffic between the State Department and our posts overseas has increased by about 50 percent. Yet it was only 25 years ago that Dean Rusk set up the State Department's Operation Center to give us a 24-hour command, control and communications system. In a crisis, when the agencies of our Government come together in a ''task force'' to monitor and report on events around the clock, we need special communications facilities to back them up. In 1980 we had one such center; today we have three, and sometimes all three are going at once. **********Since I came into my present job four years ago, 18 times we have set up such procedures to deal with crises such as the terrorist hijacking of T.W.A. Flight 847, the Mexican earthquake and the change of government in the Philippines. A Label for This Age **********We sometimes put labels on eras of the past in accordance with their leading characteristics. There was an agricultural age, an Industrial Revolution; there was an age of religion, and one of the rise of nationalism. But our era, and that just ahead of us, is beyond encompassing in a single word or slogan. Ours is a time of many seemingly contradictory forces at work. **********Even as communications shrink the planet and economics increases our interdependence, nationalism is more potent than ever; technology advances at dizzying speed even as, once again, religious faith becomes a powerful political force all around the world. **********But one significant trend is already discernible. The advanced nations of the world are already in the throes of a new scientific and technological revolution - one whose social, economic, political and strategic consequences are only beginning to be felt. **********The industrial age is ending; in some parts of the world, it is already gone. A century ago our country moved from an agricultural to an industrial phase of our development. Today we remain agriculturally and industrially productive. **********But, if we try to put a label on our era, we would have to call it an Information Revolution. And it promises to transform the structure of our economies and the political life of the planet as thoroughly as did the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. 'A New Era of Growth' **********I see this as a trend of great promise. It's a stimulus to a new era of growth. It's a challenge that the free nations of the world, above all, are in the best position to meet. **********The swift advance of technology is unsettling; some of the foundation-stones past societies took for granted are gone. Yet even in the midst of enormous change, it is still possible to locate and rely upon some fundamental, unchanging verities. **********So it is no coincidence that the free nations have once again been the source of technological innovation. Once again an economic system congenial to free scientific inquiry, entrepreneurial risk-taking and consumer freedom has been the fount of creativity and the mechanism for spreading innovation far and wide. **********Once again, a political system that welcomes, indeed thrives on, a free flow of ideas and information and people and goods across national boundaries finds itself the natural breeding ground of progress. Once again, the developing countries, seeking their own path to a better future, find the West their natural partner for cooperative endeavors. And once again, even the countries of the Communist world turn to the West as the source of advanced technology. **********Our adversaries, indeed, face an inescapable dilemma. They see the new post-industrial era coming, and they see the West well poised to take advantage of it. And yet opening themselves up to the Information Revolution and its benefits risks what is the essence of their political power - the effort to control thought and behavior through the tight monopoly they maintain over information and free communication. They fear losing control over what their people read and see. The VCR and the Computer **********How can a system that keeps photocopiers and mimeograph machines under strict control and surveillance exploit the benefits of the VCR and the personal computer? With each innovation, the leaders of the totalitarian world are reminded of their agonizing choice: They can either open their societies to the freedoms necessary for the pursuit of technological advance, or they can risk falling even farther behind the West. In reality, though, it already may be too late for them to catch up with the future. **********So we are learning that the Information Revolution holds out profound promise for America. And yet it's only one of the positive forces at work in the world. Let me give you some examples of other things we have learned in recent years. **********First, we have learned once again that freedom is a revolutionary force. Dictatorships - left or right - are not permanent. In Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Nicaragua, imperialism, oppression and regimentation have given rise to resistance movements that struggle for the rights denied them by Communist rule. **********In South Africa, the structure of apartheid is under siege as never before. In Latin America, the yearning for democracy has transformed the political complexion of the entire continent. Contrary to the expectations of many only five or six years ago, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have joined Costa Rica in the democratic trend in Central America -leaving only Nicaragua as the odd man out. **********And we have learned again that there is a connection between freedom and economic progress. Few countries around the world now dispute that entrepreneurial initiative in a market environment is the engine of development and growth. **********Closer to home, we have rediscovered the truths that, as America's weakness makes the world a more dangerous place, America's strength deters aggression and encourages restraint and negotiation. We have seen how the rebuilding of America's defenses in the early 1980's gave the Soviets an incentive to return to negotiations on arms control. Our ability to project power abroad has helped us protect our vital interests and defend our friends against subversion and aaggression. The Fight Against Terrorism **********Our military strike against Libya - undertaken as a last resort after years of Qaddafi's terrorism - has sent a powerful signal to friends and enemies alike. The day has not yet arrived when terrorism has taken its place among other vanquished barbarisms of our time. But that day will come - and when it does, history will show that American resolve, backed up by our power, tipped the balance in favor of peace and security. **********It's time to wake up - before we endanger the world's future, and our own. These dangers take many forms, but they all have in common a thoughtless escapism, a retreat from responsibility, an attempt to evade the reality of our dependence on the world and the world's dependence on us. As such, whether we admit it or not, they amount to nothing less than an isolationist throwback that could once again propel the world toward catastrophe. **********One danger sign is the evil of protectionism. Not since the days of Smoot-Hawley have the forces of protectionism been as powerful as they are today in the United States Congress. We should have learned from the experience of 50 years ago how protectionism only impoverishes us along with our trading partners, spurs inevitable retaliation and shuts down the engine of world trade and therefore of world growth. **********Another form of escape is self-righteous moralism. I have to say I see signs of this in the fervor for punitive sanctions against South Africa. The reality is that the United States has imposed increasing sanctions against South Africa from President Kennedy's bar on military sales in 1962 to the array of measures in President Reagan's executive order of 1985. **********And now the free market itself is slowing the pace of the South African economy. But sanctions are not solutions. Those on whom political sanctions are imposed grow more defiant and can evade their own responsibilities by pointing to ''outside influences'' as a scapegoat. **********White South Africans must recognize that apartheid is a disaster of their own creation and that it must be done away with in an active and orderly fashion if their own interests are to survive."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/15/business/peru-faces-credit-bar-by-the-imf.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Riding", "pub_date": "1986-08-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 611, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PERU FACES CREDIT BAR BY THE I.M.F.", "print_headline": "PERU FACES CREDIT BAR BY THE I.M.F.", "body_text": " **********Peru has opened itself to being declared ineligible for further credits from the International Monetary Fund by paying only a small share of its outstanding debt to the organization. **********The Government said Wednesday night that a drop in export earnings this year made it possible to pay only $35 million of a total of around $192 million that was due by Friday. **********The executive board of the I.M.F. is scheduled to meet in Washington Friday morning and is widely expected to declare Peru ineligible for future loans, a status already assigned to Guyana, Liberia, the Sudan and Vietnam. **********Government officials have sought minimize the importance of such a move, noting that previously approved loans of around $1 billion, from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, should continue to be disbursed.

Hurt by Export Prices **********While Peru's foreign-exchange reserves rose by more than 50 percent, to $1.5 billion, by the end of 1985, they have since fallen to $1.2 billion because of the sharp drop in the world prices of oil, copper and other Peruvian exports. **********In April, when Peru was due to pay $75 million to the I.M.F., the Government persuaded the fund to accept a partial payment of $35 million on condition that all arrears would be cleared by Aug. 15. **********Fund officials have argued that Peru's reserves permit full payment of its outstanding debt, but on Tuesday the Government sent only another payment of $35 million, arguing that it was making ''a significant additional effort.'' **********The president of the central bank, Leonel Figueroa, said in a cable to the I.M.F.'s managing director, Jacques de Larosiere: ''Under present circumstances, in order to maintain the economic improvements obtained by the Peruvian people, it would be extremely prejudicial to disburse immediately almost $200 million to cover our arrears with your institution.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/business/pfizer-unit-president.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 53, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pfizer Unit President", "print_headline": "Pfizer Unit President", "body_text": " **********Pfizer Pharmaceutical Products said yesterday that William C.

Elsewhere, the police said they shot dead two black youths after a police patrol was attacked with stones, guns and gasoline bombs in the Crossroads squatter camp outside Cape Town. **********The police said their men had been fired on with heavy-caliber weapons. **********In a separate development, the authorities - who are facing a judicial challenge to their practice of ''banning,'' or silencing, anti-apartheid activists - said they had lifted bans on two people. They include Rowley Arenstein, a self-avowed Communist who has lived under restrictions of one kind or another since 1950 and is regarded as South Africa's longest-banned person. **********Banning involves official restrictions on a person's movements and usually prohibits the person from being quoted in South Africa or from meeting with more than a few people at a time. The most prominent banned person is Winnie Mandela, the wife of the jailed black leader Nelson Mandela. She may not be quoted and is not permitted to live in her home in Soweto, Johannesburg's black satellite. **********The judicial onslaught on banning began last week when the Supreme Court overturned a banning order on Mkhuseli Jack, a prominent black activist in Port Elizabeth. The court ruled that the authorities had not given sufficient reason for issuing the order. **********An associate of Mr. Jack, Henry Fazzie, was also freed from banning restrictions after challenging them in the Port Elizabeth Supreme Court Tuesday, the Government said. **********In the latest violence, the police in Bophuthatswana, a fragmented homeland whose resources include platinum mines and casinos, said from 5,000 to 10,000 people had gathered in a soccer stadium at the Winterveld squatter camp. **********A police spokesman, David George, said that the crowd was ''waiting to be addressed by a speaker who never arrived'' and that people stoned policemen who ordered them to disperse. The police then opened fire, he said. **********That version of events was disputed by a member of a local community group called the Winterveld Action Committee, who said residents had gathered to hear why many young people had been arrested in recent days. **********A police officer was said to have addressed the gathering and to have been stoned, prompting officers to open fire on the crowd. Scores of people were said to have been wounded. **********Other places where the police reported violence included Tembisa, east of Johannesburg; Ntuzema in Natal Province; Chesterville, near Durban, and Soweto. **********In Kwazakele, policemen guarding a liquor store reported having opened fire on about 100 black attackers. **********Liquor stores owned or run by white Government agencies have become a target for black activists since revenues from their sales are seen as providing money for the imposition of apartheid laws."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/30/world/plo-is-pessimistic-on-talk-with-hussein.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 175, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "P.L.O.

Threat of War Seen **********''Add them all together and there is no question that the threat of war between Israel and Syria is higher today than at any time since 1982,'' said Zeev Schiff, one of Israel's leading military writers. ''But that doesn't mean something is going to happen tomorrow, or even in six months. My feeling is that we can still control the situation.'' **********The experts said the danger, which has been rising steadily over the last two months, does not derive from any recent movements of men or armor on the ground, and no evidence of such movements could be seen on a recent tour of the Golan Heights. **********Clearly, both sides see constraints and opportunities in the present enviroment, Mr. Schiff said. For now it appears that the constraints, whether on Syria or Israel, outweigh any opportunities to be derived from starting a conflict. Desire to Avoid a Misstep **********The apparent desire of both sides to avoid a miscalculation was clear in the tour of the Golan Heights, as well as from recent statements by President Hafez al-Assad and Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel. Today Mr. Peres said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' that he believed both sides were trying to reduce tensions in an effort to avoid war. **********''We have declared very clearly that Israel does not intend to attack Syria and that we don't believe that Syria is ready or able to do it right away,'' he said. **********United Nations observers at the Golan Heights report that Syria and Israel are scrupulously holding to their 1974 agreement on the disengagement of forces and that there are no signs of any unusual troop movements. **********Gazing into Syria from the Israeli Army's border observation post on Hezeka Mountain overlooking Quneitra in the heights, one is aware of nothing but a calm stillness. Life appears normal as far as the eye can see along both sides of the 80-mile-long frontier. More joggers dot the road on the Israeli side than army trucks; more Syrian shepherds are visible on their side than military vehicles. The air is filled with nothing more threatening than the sound of warbling birds. Serenity Masks a Danger **********''I went home last weekend,'' said the Israeli colonel who heads one of the units in charge of holding the frontier, ''and my wife said to me: 'What is going on up there? Everyone is talking about a war.' I said to her, 'I honestly don't know what people are talking about.' I can tell you that on the ground there is no sign of it. We don't want it, and I don't think they do either.'' **********But while it may be true that the closer one gets to the Golan front the more remote a war seems, the stillness in the air masks a more troubling situation developing behind the front lines, according to the military experts. **********In the Middle East, logic does not always prevail, and in the view of these military analysts, Syria and Israel could easily find themselves in a war that neither wants. The experts point to five ''fuses'' that have developed in recent months that, they believe, could explode the truce at any moment. The Israeli Fear: Miscalculation by Syria The first and most immediate concerns what Israeli military sources believe has been an attempt by the Government of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria to nibble away slowly at some of Israel's military advantages over Syria. **********Some Israeli military analysts are convinced that the Syrians perceive Israel to be a country with a strong army and a weak society, a society so tired of war after its Lebanon experience that it will tolerate a high level of Syrian military maneuvering, and even gains. **********As a result, the Syrians seem to be taking bites out of Israel's strategic position that are large enough to benefit Syria, but not so large as to enable the Israeli military leadership to justify going to war. **********These include the recent digging by Syria of tank and artillery trenches in southern Lebanon only 10 to 15 miles from the Israeli border. These trenches could hold and launch forward a large unit Syrian armor and artillery, according to the military experts. Today, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Israeli Cabinet that Syria was continuing to build these fortifications despite Israeli protests, according to the Israeli Army radio. **********Another development that Israel sees as troubling was Syria's reported involvement in the attempt to plant a time bomb on an El Al Israeli Airlines jet preparing to leave London last month, a move that Israeli officials see as disturbingly brazen. **********A third was Syrian deployment last November of SAM-2, SAM-6 and SAM-8 surface-to-air missile batteries right up to its border with Lebanon in a configuration that has forced Israel to halt its reconnaissance flights over the Bekaa region of Lebanon, which also were used to look into western Syria. **********Mr. Schiff, the military analyst, said: ''There are some people who feel that Israel's deterrence against Syria is gradually being eroded by this process. The Syrians are showing a lot of self-confidence and willingness to go to the brink. Some people believe that Israel should do something about it now before it becomes too expensive to do something about it later.'' **********Western analysts say Israeli commanders have apparently decided that it does not make sense to try to destroy the new Syrian SAM missiles on the Lebanese border and risk starting a war just to improve Israeli intelligence gathering. It appears that, for the moment, Israel has decided to gather intelligence in this area in another way. **********However, Western military analysts say the Israelis will probably hold to this approach only so long as the Syrians do not try to exploit their new missile umbrella to introduce large numbers of pro-Syrian Palestinian guerrillas into the south, fill their newly dug trenches with Syrian armor or encourage large-scale rocket attacks by guerrillas on northern Israel. **********Some Western military experts say they fear that after months of nibbling, the Syrians may now be just one ''bite'' below the threshold of Israel's deterrence in Lebanon. This, they said, makes the danger of miscalculation unusually high. The Syrian Worry: Provocative Israeli Acts The second destabilizing element in the Syrian-Israel equation concerns Syrian anxiety about Israeli behavior in recent months, according to Arab military analysts. **********To begin with, the Arab analysts said, the Syrians deployed their SAM missiles right up to the border with Lebanon only after Israeli jets shot down two Syrian MIG-23's on Nov. 19 while the MIG's were flying over Syria. **********In addition, they cited Israel's interception of an executive jet carrying leaders of the ruling Syrian Baath Party home from a conference in Libya last February. The Israelis said they were looking for a senior ''Palestinian terrorist'' supposed to have been on board the plane, which was searched and released. **********The Syrians reject the accusations that they were involved in the attempt to bomb the El Al plane and view the Israeli assertions as part of a provocative propaganda campaign. ''The Syrians see the Israelis whipping up anti-Syrian hysteria around the world in order to lay the groundwork for some kind of action,'' said Patrick Seale, a London-based expert on Syria with excellent contacts in Damascus. **********According to some Arab and Israeli experts, the Syrians also fear that with the Reagan Administration in office in Washington, previous American constraints on Israeli military actions do not apply, particularly in the wake of the American retaliatory air strike against Libya and the perceived precedent that creates for Israel. **********There are several recent indications from travelers to Damascus of how worried the Syrian leadership has become. The first is the fact that since the American attack on the home of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in mid-April, the top Syrian leaders have apparently installed mobile surface-to-air missile launchers near their homes in Damascus. The second is the fact that at one point last month, the Syrian leadership briefly put all hospital beds under military control. **********''The Syrians believe that the pre-emptive strike school may be gaining strength in Israel,'' said Mr. Seale. ''The scenario looks very worrying from Damascus. All of their moves have been purely defensive.'' Long-Term Changes In Balance of Power The third destabilizing factor has to do with some long-term changes in the Syrian-Israeli balance of power, the military experts said. **********In 1980, Syria suddenly found itself confronting Israel alone. Egypt had opted out of the Arab-Israeli conflict by signing the Camp David accords, Iraq had become preoccupied with its war with Iran and Jordan was at odds with Damascus. **********''It was from that time on that President Assad began talking seriously about gaining 'strategic parity' with Israel,'' said Mark Heller, deputy director of the Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. ''What he essentially said was that Syria alone has to become Israel's military equal.'' **********Beginning in the early 1980's, Israeli and American military experts said, President Assad and the 3,000 Soviet advisers in Syria began analyzing why Israel had been able to set the terms of previous Arab-Israeli military conflicts, almost always shifting the battle to play to Israel's strengths and Syria's weaknesses. After such analyses, the experts said, the Syrians began to procure those arms that would help neutralize Israel's advantages. **********For example, they noted, Syria's strength vis-a-vis Israel has always been in the size of its standing army -500,000 men - compared with Israel's 120,000, which balloons to 540,000 only when reservists are called up. Because Syria has so many men in uniform and because the Syrian population is much less able to bring political pressure to bear on its authoritarian regime, Syria is in a much better position to engage Israel in a protracted, costly war of attrition. **********''Israel, in contrast, always took the position that, 'We will not play by the Syrians' rules,' '' Mr. Heller said. ''If they try to begin a protracted war, Israel would absorb the blow and then immediately escalate by striking deep into Syrian territory to end it early.'' **********For Israel to maintain that doctrine, it relied heavily on the superiority of its air force and on long-range surface-to-surface missiles, such as the American-made Lance and the Israeli-made Jericho, which give Israel the ability to strike at urban centers deep inside Syria. **********In an attempt to neutralize these Israeli advantages in air power, the Syrians installed in 1983 two SAM-5 long-range surface-to-air missile batteries, which are ideally suited for hitting a slow-flying aircraft like the Israeli EC-2 Hawkeye, which the Israelis use for advanced command and control of large-scale airborne operations, according to Western military sources. An Effort to Thwart Israel in the Air In addition, the Syrians greatly expanded their surface-to-air missile net against high-performance fighter-bombers, according to Israeli military sources. There are 150 SAM batteries of all types now, as compared to 80 in 1982. **********The Syrians apparently hope that these additions will deprive Israel of its assumption that it has freedom of action in the skies. At the same time, the Syrians have acquired some 10 to 15 Soviet-made SS-21 long- range missiles, which give them the ability to hit targets 80 miles away with great accuracy. This means Syria can now threaten a deep strike at Israeli population centers in retaliation for any deep strike inside Syria. **********The Syrians have also expanded their ground forces since 1982 from six divisions of roughly 15,000 men to nine divisions, and the number of tanks has been increased from 3,500 to 4,200, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. Of these, about 1,000 are advanced Soviet-made T-72's; there have been similar qualitative improvements in the air force, navy and overall command and control. **********In light of this Syrian buildup, several leading Israeli military analysts, including Mr. Schiff, argue that it is no longer 100 percent certain that Israel could absorb a Syrian attack on the Golan Heights, and then immediately go over to the offensive, as traditional Israeli doctrine dictates, and it is no longer certain that Syria would never go to war without another Arab partner, as was its rule in the past. **********As a result, Mr. Heller said, ''Israel today is probably less tolerant of ambiguity in Syrian behavior and more prepared to launch a pre-emptive strike, if a war appears likely.'' **********Nevertheless, although new capabilities can create new intentions, President Assad has always been a very cautious man. **********Western analysts are convinced that even with the improvement in Syria's surface-to-air missile net, the Israeli air force has the ability to electronically evade, jam and wipe out the Syrian missiles, just as they knocked out almost 20 SAM batteries in one afternoon during June 1982. **********In the view of Israeli and American experts, President Assad would also feel constrained by the fact that Soviet-made SAM missiles in Libya performed so poorly recently against American attack aircraft and by the observation that Moscow - the superpower patron of both Libya and Syria - did not lift a finger to interdict the American raids on Tripoli and Benghazi. **********Mr. Seale concluded: ''The Syrian posture is very much a defensive one. It is very hard to imagine a Syrian first strike, conscious as they are of Israel's continued air superiority. They are not going to take on Israel alone. I still think they feel very vulnerable to an attack.'' Economic Troubles In Both Countries The fourth factor destabilizing the Syrian-Israeli military balance is the fact that both countries are now going through economic difficulties. **********For now, Israeli military analysts believe Israel's defense budget remains at a level that keeps the quality, if not the quantity, of Israel's armed forces very high and maintains its ability to deter attack. But if the army has to sustain additional cuts in training hours and spare parts, that may no longer be the case. In that event, the voices calling for a pre-emptive strike against Syria at a time of high tension will certainly gain greater weight, according to these sources. **********Speaking in an interview several months ago, and not about Syria in particular, Maj. Gen. Avihu Binun, the chief of planning for the Israel Defense Forces, said, ''We are willing to take risks'' to improve the economy, ''but sometimes those risks mean that we will have to be much more nervous and act much sooner than we normally would have if we had more reserves.'' **********Some Israeli defense experts believe that Mr. Assad might be tempted to try to deflect the impact of his domestic economic troubles by starting a war with Israel. Others contend, however, that Mr. Assad would never base a decision to go to war on such a calculation. However, it could contribute to a larger decision to initiate a conflict. **********The final factor making for increased tension on both sides is the sheer number of troops that now face each other across the Golan Heights. After Israel withdrew most of its forces from Lebanon a year ago, the Syrians withdrew three of the five divisions there. Two of those withdrawn divisions were added to those already on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, making for six divisions there, or roughly 100,000 men. Israel has considerably less than that number. **********With so many men and so much armor already at the front, the Syrians could launch a major offensive with as little as 12 to 24 hours' preparation, Western military experts say. In the 1973 war, it took Israel between 24 and 36 hours to fully mobilize its reserves. **********Judging from recent remarks by Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Moshe Levy, this situation has made Israel much more alert, perhaps even jumpy, about any Syrian troop movements on the heights. **********''It all comes down to warning time,'' a senior Israeli commander said. ''Do the Syrians believe they can mount a major offensive on the Golan before I can mobilize my reserves?''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/11/world/c-corrections-947486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 108, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORRECTIONS", "print_headline": "CORRECTIONS", "body_text": " **********Tables of election results last Thursday misstated the winner in the 46th Assembly District in Brooklyn; incorrectly listed participants in the race in 23d Congressional District in upstate New York, and misstated the outcome of the contest for Supreme Court justice in the Nassau-Suffolk County district. **********In the Assembly race, the winner was Howard Lasher, who ran on the Democratic and Liberal lines, not Max Brudner, a Republican.

''The I.R.A. members are called terrorists instead of guerrilla fighters, yet we never hear a word in the media about the state-sponsored terrorism of Britain.'' **********Asked about such tactics as the recent shooting of an unarmed man working in a field as his son watched, Mr. Lawlor said that ''nobody could be sane and enjoy that.'' But he said it was most important to note that the man had been a member of an Ulster security patrol. **********Mr. McGuinness warned that an accord between Britain and the Republic of Ireland, giving Dublin a limited role in Ulster affairs, would lead to another violent period of internment and other abuses by British officials. **********The British authorities dismiss such assertions and contend that the I.R.A. is concerned that the agreement will undercut its ability to continue its campaign of assassinations and bombings. **********Mr. McGuinness, however, said he understood that Britain had been significantly increasing its strength in the province because of I.R.A. pressures. **********British officials acknowledged Wednesday that they might have to bolster security further as the I.R.A. pursues its latest threat to attack various civilian workers, from caterers to secretaries, who work for the British security authorities. #12 WOUNDED IN RIOTING BELFAST, Northern Ireland, Aug. 9 (AP) - Rioting broke out today in Roman Catholic areas on the 15th anniversary of internment without trial in Northern Ireland. The police said 12 people were wounded in rioting in Londonderry, West Belfast and Downpatrick, with 60 arrests. Britain abandoned internment without trial in 1975, but I.R.A. supporters, who had been the main target of such internment, still mark the anniversary with riots and rallies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/21/business/new-city-for-lefrak-jersey.html": {"writer_name": "Albert Scardino", "pub_date": "1986-04-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1600, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW CITY FOR LEFRAK: JERSEY", "print_headline": "NEW CITY FOR LEFRAK: JERSEY", "body_text": " **********Nobody has built more apartments in New York City than the LeFrak family, whose holdings numbered more than 50,000 at latest count. But after the current patriarch of the clan, Samuel J. LeFrak, finishes a building under construction on the Upper West Side, he is not going to undertake any more -not on the New York side of the Hudson River at least. **********These days he is standing at the New Jersey end of the Holland Tunnel, his back to the city he helped to shape in the decades since World War II, while he pours what he expects will be $10 billion into Jersey City. **********To his right, pile drivers are tamping into the soft riverbank the supports for a new community of 30,000 people. Over his left shoulder, cranes are lifting materials into a hole that will become a vast new shopping mall, the first for Hudson County, N. J., and its 565,000 residents. **********A 26-Acre Central Park **********Change a couple of letters in the name of his new community, Newport City, and it is the same old town he has always worked in. To drive the point home, he told his architects to include a 26-acre rectangular green space that he called Central Park. The boulevard through the middle of the site will be known as Park Avenue and the mile-long concourse along the water bears the name Riverside Drive. **********New York still needs him, says Mr. LeFrak, because he knows more about building housing for middle-income families than anybody else in town. But, as he tells it, New York has run him off. Now, at the age of 68, he plans to spend his last years in the business rebuilding the New Jersey waterfront. **********''In New York, everybody wants something from you,'' said Mr. LeFrak. ''Too much politics.'' **********He offers as an example a new 200-unit apartment building his company, the Lefrak Organization, is constructing at 90th Street and Columbus Avenue. (His father, Harry, who founded the company, anglicized the name in 1900 when he immigrated from Paris, but Samuel and his children and grandchildren all use the French spelling, LeFrak.) 22 Years to Complete a Project ''We were designated as the developer of that site in 1964,'' he said last week. ''This year, 22 years later, the building will take in its first tenants. **********I'm too old to wait that long to complete a project. Building in Manhattan involves too many lawsuits and too many community board hearings.'' **********Not that Mr. LeFrak has been innocent of politics. His own patron was Nelson A. Rockefeller. But after Mr. Rockefeller left office for the last time in 1976, Mr. LeFrak's fortunes began to fade. In 1976, he lost out ''at the 12th hour'' to the Reichmann family of Toronto in a bid to acquire a group of office buildings that had belonged to the Uris organization. **********The Reichmanns paid $320 million for the buildings, which were valued five years later at more than $2 billion. **********Three years after that setback, Mr. LeFrak came in behind the Reichmanns again, when a state agency selected the Canadians to develop Battery Park City after Mr. LeFrak's company had participated in the construction of the landfill. ''I built the land for the project, and they came along and got the contract to put up the buildings,'' he said. 'Concrete in My Veins' **********The Lefrak Organization did win the designation to build the first project at Battery Park City, a six-building, 1,700-unit apartment complex and retail center completed in 1982, but that hardly satisfied Mr. Lefrak's desire to build on a grand scale. ''I've got concrete in my veins,'' he said. **********While Mr. LeFrak was looking around for another project, Melvin Simon, the shopping center developer from Indianapolis, was seeking money and a partner to redevelop 400 acres of abandoned railroad yards, piers and industrial plants on the New Jersey waterfront. **********The Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company offered to finance the mall that Mr. Simon wanted to build, if he could find a partner to undertake the 9,000 housing units that were a critical part of the project. The bank recommended Mr. LeFrak. ''Who else,'' asked the man whose name adorns Lefrak City, the largest apartment complex in Queens and the largest privately financed housing project in the country. **********The two developers hit it off immediately. But the idea that a New York builder would cross the river to participate in a office-shopping-residential project that might take tenants out of Manhattan touched a political nerve in Mr. LeFrak's hometown. **********Newport City hardly threatens to put New York City out of business. Even at its projected limit 10 years from now, the LeFrak project would contain no more than 4.3 million square feet of office space, compared with Manhattan's current inventory of 300 million. And the 9,000 housing units would make little more than a dent in the city's critical shortage of apartments. **********Nevertheless, New York City officials lobbied hard in the state's Congressional delegation to sidetrack the Federal grant that was to underwrite the construction of the sewers, streets and utilities for Newport City. That led the New Jersey delegation to relatiate by seeking to divert grants for New York City projects, including Westway. **********The $40 million Federal grant to Jersey City was the largest Urban Development Action Grant ever proposed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. **********In mid-1983, the grant came through. To use it, the partners first had to assemble 147 different parcels, the largest of which had come from the purchase of abandoned freight yards of the bankrupt Erie Lackawanna Railway and one of its successors, the Consolidated Rail Corporation. (Mr. LeFrak, an exuberant salesman, takes an expansive view of his own work. ''Not even God could have assembled this parcel,'' he said.) After the partners had assembled the site, Jersey City designated it as an urban renewal project. That introduced the power of condemnation to allow the developers to acquire the few remaining tracts they needed. Ten-Year Project **********Though the owners of two small parcels are still fighting the condemnation in court, construction has started on the first phase of the 10-year project: four apartment towers with a total of 1,500 units, a one-million-square-foot shopping mall, a strip shopping center, an office building of 500,000 square feet and parking for 6,000 cars. **********The cost for the first phase will run about $425 million, with another $100 million budgeted for site preparation, streets and utilities for the overall project. The LeFraks say that, in current dollars, the construction will cost about $2.5 billion. Interest, inflation and land costs will bring the 10-year total to something near $10 billion. **********To get the project under way also required something of a supernatural agreement between Jersey City's redevelopment agency and the Hudson County Building Trades Council, the umbrella organization for the area's construction unions. The unions agreed to settle all disputes through arbitration and not to strike during the 10-year construction period. **********Under the work rules in effect, the unions also allowed around-the-clock work in three eight-hour shifts, settling for a 10 percent premium for workers on the second shift and 20 percent for the graveyard crew. **********''If the unions in New York had allowed shift work, it would have been at normal overtime rates,'' said Mr. LeFrak's 40-year-old son, Richard, president of the company. ''And the normal work day for union members in New Jersey is eight hours instead of seven, which improves productivity.'' Savings in New Jersey **********He said base wage rates are slightly lower in New Jersey, but the largest savings for the developers will come from productivity increases and reduced transportation and materials cost. ''Over all, we expect our construction costs to run 30 percent lower than in Manhattan.'' **********The partners also obtained a 15-year tax abatement on the retail portion of the project that will make the amounts that store owners must pay more equal with rates in other parts of the state. For the occupants of the new mall, that will amount to a savings of $1.8 million a year compared with the tax rates previously in effect in Hudson County. **********The elder Mr. LeFrak said that in the residential units, the lower land and labor costs mean that rent for a typical one-bedroom apartment will run about $900 a month, compared with $1,250 for a similar unit in the Columbus Avenue project. **********''And it will have what people need,'' he added, sweeping his arms across one of the many architect's renderings of the site that decorate his sales office at Battery Park City. ''There's light and air and a garage for the car and space and security. And it's only 10 minutes on the PATH line from Wall Street and 10 minutes from Penn Station.'' **********Richard LeFrak is less given to hyperbole than his father. He favors gray flannel suits and refers to Samuel in his blazer and bright red knit tie as the evangelist of Newport City. But he, too, has been seized with the enthusiasm. **********''We've got a 400-acre farm at the other end of the tunnel from the World Trade Center, and we're turning it into a new city,'' he said. ''For a builder, it's the dream of a lifetime.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/business/fluor-profit-of-6.6-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FLUOR PROFIT OF $6.6 MILLION", "print_headline": "FLUOR PROFIT OF $6.6 MILLION", "body_text": " **********The Fluor Corporation, an engineering, construction and natural resources company, announced net earnings of $6.6 million, or 8 cents a share, for the first quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with a net loss of $32.6 million for the quarter last year. **********If not for a gain of $24.1 million, or 30 cents a share, from the sale of a 10 percent interest in its holdings in the St. Joe Gold Corporation, Fluor would have reported a loss for the quarter. **********Revenue totaled $1.2 billion, up 29.4 percent from $927 million for the same period last year. **********The company's engineering and construction backlog was $4.8 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $5.3 billion at the end of the first quarter of 1985.

His talks with Mr. Craxi came just hours before the attack. **********Spain's Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, in criticizing the raid at a news conference, said, ''I was not notified previously - I was informed via a news agency.'' **********He said that in the meeting with Mr. Walters on Saturday, he had given a ''hypothetical'' rejection to what he called a ''hypothetical question'' about possible Spanish military cooperation in the raid. **********''Spain was not asked to facilitate anything, probably because the Spanish Government's answer was already no,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. **********West German officials said Mr. Walters had given clear indications of the United States' intentions without providing details. **********''We knew something would happen, but not when or how,'' a Foreign Ministry official said. He added that this might have been a blessing for Mr. Kohl, making it easier for the West German leader to distance himself from the attack. **********Leaders of the Mediterranean nations of Spain, Greece and Italy have said over the last month that military action in the region would expose them to terrorist reprisals. Fear of Helping Qaddafi **********Prime Minister Craxi of Italy has also argued that the focus on Colonel Qaddafi had only strengthened him and won him support among Arab moderates who in fact detested his policies. And European nations that have fought domestic terror for a decade or more resent the United States' charges that Europe is soft on terrorism. **********In the British Parliament, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher turned back opposition attacks on her decision to allow the United States to use bases in Britain for the Libyan raids. **********''It was inconceivable to me that we should refuse U.S. aircraft and U.S. pilots to be able to defend their own people,'' she said. ''I believe the United States was entitled to use its inherent right of self-defense. If one always refused to take any risks because of the consequences, then the terrorist governments will win and one can only cringe before them.'' **********Chancellor Kohl of West Germany, in striking an ambivalent position at a news conference, said: ''We advised against the use of force. Force is not a promising way of dealing with things.'' **********But he also said Libya had become ''a source of regional destabilization and center of international terrorism.'' When the British Found Out There was speculation among the Europeans about how much Britain, in granting the use of bases, had known of the United States' intentions. **********The Dutch Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, said that when the European Community ministers met Monday and agreed on a statement criticizing Libya, Britain had already received strong indications that the United States was planning an attack. **********The implication was that Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Secretary, might have negotiated in bad faith. However, the British Embassy in The Hague issued a statement saying that Sir Geoffrey had learned of the plan only after the meeting. **********France, which was also informed of the plan in advance, confirmed today that it had refused permission for the American fighter-bombers to use its airspace. The refusal of both France and Spain to allow the use of their airspace resulted in lengthening the route flown by the American planes from Britain to the Libyan targets by 1,200 nautical miles, to 2,800 miles compared with a direct route of 1,600 miles. **********The French Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, speaking in the French Senate, voiced regret that ''the intolerable and inadmissible escalation of terrorism has led to an action of reprisals that itself revives the chain of violence.'' **********Policy analysts in France said the refusal to allow the use of French airspace stemmed less from opposition to action against Libya than from a desire to maintain French freedom of action in the Middle East. The View of Chirac **********Mr. Chirac seemed to go out of his way to dispel any impression that France was less than resolute in its opposition to Libya. He said the Europeans themselves should respond firmly if Libya carried out threats to attack southern Europe. He said the response should come particularly from countries directly affected, for example, Italy and Spain. **********The theme that Europe should be responsible for its own defense was a common theme, and not everyone used it as an argument against the United States. **********Giorgio La Malfa, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Italian Chamber of Deputies, said American action had been inevitable. **********''If Europe had taken a firmer attitude against the terrorist attacks that have struck American citizens and interests - as well as citizens and interests of each of our countries - maybe today the situation would be different,'' he said. ----Greece Calls Urgent Meeting ATHENS, April 15 - Greece condemned the American raid on Libya today and requested an early meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Community on the ''abnormal and dangerous situation.'' **********Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias said that although the United States had informed some of its European allies of the impending attack, these nations had not passed the information on to their partners. He called this ''an unpleasant surprise'' and ''a violation of the moral rules of political cooperation.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/business/briefs-749486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** American Brands Inc., Old Greenwich Conn., said its London-based subsidiary, Gallaher Ltd., had completed the acquisition of the ordinary and preferred shares of NSS Newsagents P.L.C. for about $120 million. *********** Berry Acquisition Co., said it would not extend its tender offer for shares of Strawbridge & Clothier common stock and that the offer had expired. *********** Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, said it had entered into a joint program with Engenics Inc. to develop biochemicals that serve markets related to nutrition. *********** Flatley Co., Braintree, Mass., said it had made an offer to purchase the major real estate assets of Bradley Real Estate Trust of Boston for $52 million. *********** Genrad Inc., Concord, Mass., said it would reduce its work force of 2,600 by about 250 in the next two months through early retirement, attrition, and selective layoffs. *********** General Host Corp., Stamford, Conn., said it had completed the sale of Milk Specialties Co., its specialty animal feed products unit, for $30 million in cash, $5 million in preferred stock and the buyer's assumption of $3 million of long-term debt."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/02/world/bomb-wounds-18-in-durban-store.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1986-09-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 600, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOMB WOUNDS 18 IN DURBAN STORE", "print_headline": "BOMB WOUNDS 18 IN DURBAN STORE", "body_text": " **********A bomb left on a counter exploded today in a supermarket in a white working-class neighborhood of Durban, wounding at least 18 people, the Government reported. **********Two white victims, a 3-year-old girl and a 20-year-old woman, were in serious condition, and those treated for lesser injuries included 10 blacks, the authorities said. **********The official Bureau for Information said the explosion ripped through the Pick 'n' Pay store in the Montclair neighborhood of the Indian Ocean port city shortly after 1 P.M.

In that time, they said, he carried out ''activities aimmed at overthrowing the constitutional system of People's Poland.'' **********Sources close to the Solidarity movement said Mr. Bujak was arrested Saturday morning in a Warsaw apartment. Also arrrested in the raid, the Solidarity sources said, was Konrad Bielinski, a 37-year-old mathematician who in October organized a computer-based poll-watching operation to monitor compliance with an election boycott called by Mr. Bujak. **********The sources added that Eva Kulik, a writer for clandestine publications, was in the apartment and was also taken into custody. Walesa Addresses Thousands **********In Gdansk, Lech Walesa, the founder of the outlawed Solidarity trade union movement, praised Mr. Bujak before several thousand people who turned out at St. Brygyda's Church to celebrate Mr. Walesa's name day. **********''Lacking any success, the authorities look upon this capture as an achievement,'' Mr. Walesa said. Some people in the crowd then chanted Mr. Bujak's name. **********At Czestochowa, the country's foremost place of religious pilgrimage, Joseph Platek, the head of the Paulist Fathers who maintain the shrine, alluded unmistakably to the arrest. **********Speaking to 50,000 young people gathered for mass, he said: ''The maniacs of the revolution are still proud of certain arrests, of the repression of the spirit of freedom and the persecution of groups of people who are free in their thinking. Do not be afraid, the future belongs to you.'' **********In Cracow, 1,500 people who had assembled to condemn the Chernobyl nuclear accident marched through the old city and spontaneously began chanting, ''There is no freedom without Solidarity or Bujak!''

Still, the dominant mood among ordinary Solidarity supporters was more one of dismay and defiance. 'We Will Continue' **********The major above-ground allies of Solidarity were trying to dismiss arguments that Mr. Bujak's seizure was some sort of mortal blow. For example, Jacek Kuron, the ideological mentor of many Solidarity leaders, declared: ''For me it is a blow, a great blow, but it is not a blow for the movement. We will continue with our activities.'' **********And Janusz Onyszkiewicz, who had been the national spokesman for Solidarity when it was legal, said: ''This is not the end of the underground. That is obvious. The structures are intact and will continue. The arrest, well, we have to regard it as something of a job-related accident.'' **********Mr. Onyszkiewicz also speculated on the problems the Government would face in prosecuting Mr. Bujak. **********''I think that Bujak may now open the second chapter of his myth,'' he said. ''You know he is regarded by Poles as Robin Hood, and I am not sure whether Bujak on trial or in prison may not prove to be as much of a problem for the authorities as Bujak at liberty.'' **********Mr. Onyszkiewicz also wondered what effect the arrest would have on an amnesty for political prisoners that the authorities have hinted might take place after a Communist Party congress this month. The position suggested by some party figures is that after Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski recasts the party, an amnesty will be ordered and then the flow of Western credits will resume to rescue Poland's sagging economy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/business/morgan-grenfell.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 82, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Morgan Grenfell", "print_headline": "Morgan Grenfell", "body_text": " **********Morgan Grenfell Holdings Ltd., the London merchant bank, will make its initial public offering of stock today, according to company officials.

More Land-Based Warheads **********The new American proposal under consideration would also raise the limit on warheads on land-based missiles by 10 percent, to 3,300. The Russians, who have about 6,400 such warheads deployed, have most recently proposed limiting them to 4,800. **********In addition, the Administration's tentative proposal calls for backing away from a ban on long-range mobile missiles. Pentagon officials, who pushed for the ban last year partly because the Soviet Union has an advantage in this area, are said to be resisting the change. **********But while the Administration is considering moving toward the Soviet position in these areas, the proposal is expected to retain an earlier call for a sharp reduction in the throw-weight, or payload, of Soviet missiles. **********The tentative proposal would also sharply limit some types of land-based missiles, forcing the Soviet Union to make tough choices about which weapons to keep or deploy. Decision Expected Soon **********A final White House decision on the new American position has not been made, but is expected before a meeting of Soviet and American arms control officials scheduled for this Friday and Saturday in Washington. **********Administration officials said the proposed changes grew out of a series of meetings involving the American negotiators in the Geneva talks and other arms control officials. **********An Administration official said the new American proposal reflected an interest in serious ''give and take.'' The official added that, while the details of the plan have not yet been formally approved by President Reagan, ''it indicates the direction we are moving in.'' **********The new proposal would still call for big reductions in strategic arms, but would allow higher limits on such arms than previously proposed by the Administration. A higher limit could partly bridge the gap between the Soviet and American positions. **********The latest Soviet offer sets a limit of 8,000 on the total number of missile warheads, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles and bombs. This offer allows limited research on the space-oriented missile defense program popularly known as ''Star Wars.'' Earlier, Moscow offered deeper cuts in strategic arms as part of an agreement that virtually banned research on ''Star Wars,'' which is formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. U.S. Offer: 7,500 **********In response to the latest Soviet offer, the tentative American proposal would allow each side to have 7,500 missile warheads and air-launched cruise missiles. The latest American offer at Geneva would allow 6,000. **********Administration officials said the change was intended as a follow-up to a letter President Reagan sent in July to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, in which Mr. Reagan signaled that the United States would not demand such deep reductions. **********While the Administration plans to raise its proposed limits, it still differs with the Soviet Union about how the weapons should be limited and which ones should be included. **********The Administration objects to including ballistic missile warheads and air-launched cruise missiles under a common ceiling, saying that ballistic missiles are a greater threat. The American plan does not propose to limit sea-launched cruise missiles or bombs dropped by airplanes. **********One major difference that remains concerns reductions in the number of warheads on land-based missiles, which make up more than two-thirds of the Soviet arsenal and about one-fourth of the American strategic arsenal. **********The latest American offer seeks to reduce the number of warheads on land-based missiles from the current Soviet total of about 6,400 to 3,300. The previous American offer sought a reduction to 3,000, and the Administration once sought to cut the number to 2,500. A Soviet Limit of 4,800 **********In contrast, the current Soviet offer would limit the number of such warheads to 4,800. In making that offer, the Soviet Union fell back from an earlier proposal to limit the number to 3,600. **********While allowing the Soviet Union slightly more land-based missile warheads, the tentative American proposal would dictate what land-based missiles the Soviet Union could deploy. For example, no more than half of the land-based missile warheads could be carried by the ''heavy'' SS-18 missile, long-range mobile missiles or missiles with more than six warheads. **********This limit would force the Soviet Union to make difficult choices. The Soviet Union has 308 SS-18 missiles, and each is counted under the 1979 strategic arms agreement as having 10 warheads. For example, if the Soviet Union wanted to keep about half of its SS-18 force and deploy a small number of single-warhead mobile SS-25's, it would have to drop its plans to deploy the 10-warhead SS-24. Elements of New Proposal **********The proposal was described as having the following elements: *********** An overall limit of 5,500 would be set on the warheads carried by land- and sea-based ballistic missiles. The United States has previously proposed that the limit be 4,500. *********** Within the overall warhead total, the new proposal would limit the number of warheads on land-based missiles to 3,300. The United States has previously proposed that the limit be 3,000. *********** Long-range land-based mobile missiles would be allowed if the Soviet Union can demonstrate to American negotiators that they can be effectively verified. Previously, the United States has proposed banning them. *********** It also stipulates that no more than half the warheads on land-based missiles - or 1,650 warheads - can be carried on ''heavy'' Soviet SS-18 missiles, mobile long-range missiles, or missiles that have more than six warheads. This last provision would apply to the new 10-warhead SS-24 missile, which is currently undergoing flight tests and may be deployed this year. The Pentagon has said that missile that it expects the missile to be based in missile silos as well as on mobile, railroad cars. *********** An earlier call for a 50 percent cut in the throw-weight, or payload, of Soviet missiles would be kept. *********** A limit of 2,000 would be set on air-launched cruise missiles. The previous limit on air-launched cruise missiles, in which the United States holds a decided edge, was 1,500. The number of long-range bombers would be limited to 350, as in the earlier proposal. **********Administration officials said they had not decided whether the new proposal should be discussed in detail at the Soviet-American arms meeting that is to start Friday, or whether the changes should merely be ''signaled.'' **********A White House decision to back away from the proposed mobile missile ban, officials noted, could have important strategic and political advantages for the Administration. Congressional moderates who support the development of a small mobile missile, dubbed Midgetman, have said it is needed to make the American land-based missile force less vulnerable to attack. **********Administration officials stressed that the proposed mobile-missile ban would be dropped only if the Soviet Union could satisfy American verification concerns. The Soviet Union has said in Geneva that it is willing to agree to verification measures, but has not been specific. The Russians are thought to have an advantage in long-range mobile missiles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/19/business/briefs-659486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 167, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt *********** Eastman Kodak Co. is offering in the United States bond market $100 million (New Zealand) of 17 percent notes due 1990 at a price of par, through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

The nation's third-largest soft drink company introduced its new advertising agency and hinted that new beverage lines were on the way. **********All went well - except for those recurring rumors that Seven-Up's corporate parent, the Philip Morris Companies, does not want to own the soda company anymore. **********Peter Sullivan, financial vice president for Beverage Management Inc., a 7-Up bottler, who attended, said speculation was widespread. ''Everybody is asking them,'' he said. ''They don't give you any answers.'' **********Wall Street has no answers either, but analysts who follow the beverage industry have plenty of questions. ''There has been talk in beverage circles that something is afoot at Seven-Up,'' said Joseph Doyle, who analyzes the soft drink industry for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. **********Although the name Pepsico repeatedly pops up as a possible buyer of Seven-Up, which Philip Morris bought for $520 million in 1978, some industry watchers think the St. Louis-based company would fit more easily into some company not now involved with the beverage industry. **********With the soft drink field as competitive as ever, however, analysts think it may be difficult to find a novice willing to take the plunge with a product like 7-Up, which has been staggering under the one-two punch of the leaders, Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. **********This causes some industry observers to think that Seven-Up's management may be the best potential buyer for the soft drink producer. Edward W. Frantel, Seven-Up's president and chief executive officer, did not return telephone calls made to his office yesterday. **********Philip Morris, meanwhile, declined to say anything about all the conjecture. ''It's been our long-standing policy not to comment on this sort of thing,'' a Philip Morris spokesman said when asked if Seven-Up was for sale. **********Industry analysts and people in the investment banking industry think the answer is yes. One investment banker, who asked to remain anonymous, said, ''All I've heard is that they are stepping up efforts to get rid of it.'' **********All of which suggests to industry analysts that while something may be bubbling with respect to the divestiture of Seven-Up, nothing is imminent. It could be, they speculate, that Philip Morris wants to spruce up Seven-Up before looking for a buyer. That would explain the new ad campaign (which the Leo Burnett Company, Seven-Up's Chicago advertising agency, says is still a secret) and the plans for new products. **********The conjecture about Seven-Up comes just a few months after Philip Morris acquired the giant General Foods Corporation for nearly $5.7 billion in a move that was widely seen as an attempt to diversify its business further away from risky tobacco products. Although Philip Morris said it planned to keep most of General Foods' operations, it said nothing about any of its own operations. **********''I think Hamish Maxwell is very hard-nosed about demanding performance, and that unit is on notice to shape up,'' said Diana Temple, who follows the company for Salomon Brothers. Mr. Maxwell is Philip Morris's chief executive officer. **********Analysts expect Seven-Up to report a slight deficit for 1985, following a profit the year before. They say the main problem is competition. Coke's Sprite and Pepsi's Slice have been nibbling at 7-Up's niche. Now the addition of small amounts of fruit juice to lemon- and lime-type sodas means that 7-Up may be facing yet another market interloper. **********Seven-Up's share of the overall soft drink market has been eroding in recent years, according to industry analysts, who say the company now captures only about 6.9 percent of the soft drink business handled by food stores. Seven-Up's market share stood at about 8.5 percent in the mid-1970's, before the company was acquired by Philip Morris, and was at that level as late as 1984. The Coca-Cola and Pepsico families of products each grab about 30 percent. Every percentage point represents about $100 million in sales. **********To increase its competitive position, Seven-Up over the last few years has introduced new products such as caffeine-free soda, and it is now test-marketing the juice-soda concoctions. But any innovation in the soft drink industry soon invites imitators, and 7-Up's market performance has sunk as more soft drinks become available. **********Acquiring Seven-Up, of course, would give the buyer a recognizable name to build a family of products around. That may be one reason why industry people think Pepsico may be interested. **********But others say a union of Pepsi and 7-Up might cause trouble with the Government. ''I've heard rumors of Pepsico, but that seems inconceivable to me'' because of antitrust problems, said Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle. Still, according to some analysts, now could be a fine time for such a merger because the Reagan Administration has been interpreting antitrust law liberally. **********Pepsico would not comment on the rumors. Peter Sullivan, the 7-Up bottler, said he does not care who owns the soft drink maker, adding that it has a ''wonderful product'' but poor management."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/19/business/kodak-reports-a-loss-after-taking-writeoff.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-02-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 452, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KODAK REPORTS A LOSS AFTER TAKING WRITEOFF", "print_headline": "KODAK REPORTS A LOSS AFTER TAKING WRITEOFF", "body_text": " **********The Eastman Kodak Company reported yesterday that it took a charge against earnings of $494 million in the fourth quarter to pay for its forced withdrawal from the instant-photography business.

Levine, on insider trading charges bolster the view that more individuals will be charged in the investigation. **********The sources declined to indicate which individuals besides Mr. Levine, a former managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., recorded conversations. They also declined to say if Mr. Levine had taped Ivan F. Boesky, the Wall Street aribtrager who settled insider trading charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 14. Wide Access to Others **********It was reported last week that Mr. Boesky had allowed his business conversations to be recorded to gather evidence against other investment community figures. That disclosure added to the effect of Mr. Boesky's involvement in the scandal because he was known to have had access to a range of senior Wall Street figures. **********Such recordings could provide incriminating evidence against other individuals and thus might result in further charges by the S.E.C. and the Justice Department. People implicated in crimes sometimes agree to such recordings to try to mitigate their penalties by helping bring in other offenders. **********The apparent leniency of Mr. Boesky's penalty compared with the maximum penalty allowable under securities laws suggests that he provided valuable information to the investigators. **********The sources, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said Mr. Levine tried to bolster his position by allowing recordings after his arrest. It is not known if the recordings made by Mr. Levine and others have led to charges against any individuals. Mr. Levine's attorney, Martin Flumenbaum, would not comment yesterday. Neither would the S.E.C. **********Lawyers said it was possible that some people not named publicly as being involved in the scandal might have volunteered to cooperate and might be recording their conversations. **********''This is a business that, at bottom, is driven by information - that's why you live by your telephones,'' said one major arbitrager. ''You don't know who you can talk to or what you can say. You're almost paralyzed.'' **********Wall Street has been shaken by the news of the widening investigation into insider trading. **********The fragments of information that have leaked out or that have been provided in public documents show signs that the investigation is getting at the heart of the corporate takeover boom. **********Details revealed so far seem to make up a wheel, with its hub consisting of Mr. Boesky, a takeover-stock trader, financier and arbitrager. There could well be many spokes off that hub, of which Mr. Levine, the investment banker who earlier pleaded guilty to insider trading charges, might be one. **********This suggests that the S.E.C. is striking at the enormous influence developed by arbitragers, the professional investors who speculate in the stocks of companies involved in takeovers, in recent years and at the networks that tie them to investment bankers. For some time S.E.C. officials have expressed concern privately that the relationships of the ''arbs,'' as they are known, with deal-making professionals created opportunities for many conflicts of interest and breaches of the insider trading laws. **********Since these takeover speculators collectively could buy up significant amounts of a target company's stock, they could sway the outcome of corporate takeover battles. They were thus courted by both sides in these struggles. And the arbitragers courted investment banking sources to bolster their information. **********''Everyone spoke to Ivan,'' said the head of mergers at a top Wall Street firm, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. ''If you suddenly say you didn't, you're a liar. He was important to this business.'' Official Frustration **********S.E.C. officials became increasingly frustrated over their inability to crack the problem although examples of insider trading grew common. It became almost routine for the stock of a company chosen as the target of a takeover effort to rise sharply before the public heard any announcement of a bid. **********Those who have acknowledged receiving subpoenas in the investigation are Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the powerful investment banking house; Boyd L. Jefferies, the chairman of Jefferies & Company, a Los Angeles-based brokerage firm that has figured in many takeovers, and a former senior executive at Jefferies, Michael C. Singer. **********So extensive are the requests for information in the subpoenas - which in themselves do not imply any wrongdoing - that Robert Linton, Drexel's chairman, said it was disrupting the firm's ability to conduct its regular daily business. **********Mr. Singer's subpoena, the sources have said, asked specifically about an invoice that he prepared for Mr. Jefferies that was sent to Mr. Boesky and about Jefferies & Company's dealings in several stocks. Both Drexel and Mr. Jefferies have denied any wrongdoing. **********Drexel has said that several of its executives also received subpoenas from the S.E.C. and the United States Attorney, who is conducting the criminal investigation. **********Drexel did not identify these executives, but sources with knowledge of the investigation said they include Michael Milken, the 40-year-old financial expert behind Drexel's pre-eminent role in takeover financing, and Martin A. Siegel, a top merger and acquisition professional who recently joined Drexel from Kidder, Peabody & Company. **********The sources also said that Carl C. Icahn and Victor Posner, entrepreneurs who have initiated takeover efforts with Drexel's help, received subpoenas. Mr. Icahn issued a statement acknowledging that the S.E.C. had made ''certain inquiries.'' Mr. Posner has not commented. 12 Transactions Subpoenas sent to other individuals asked for information about 12 proposed or completed merger transactions, going back to the end of 1984. Drexel served as the investment banker for the initiator of nine of those deals. **********Entrepreneurs such as Mr. Icahn, T. Boone Pickens, Saul Steinberg and Ronald Perelman owe at least some of their influence in the world of takeovers to the financing capability of Mr. Milken's organization through the use of ''junk bonds.'' **********Drexel, these entrepreneurs and other arbitragers apparently were tied together in financial links where each invested in the other's ventures. For instance, many of the enterpreneurs Mr. Milken helped in acquisitions often become substantial buyers of junk bonds -which are high-risk, high-yield securities - to aid other takeovers. It has been widely reported in the business press that they invested in Mr. Milken's ventures or received a personal investment from him. Drexel invested money with Mr. Boesky and owned part of a company he once controlled, Northview. **********Other arbitragers have participated financially in deals with Drexel or Mr. Milken. For instance, Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, a securities firm with a substantial arbitrage department, has made commitments to buy large amounts of junk bonds to support takeovers to be financed by Drexel and Mr. Milken. The 'Third Market' **********The Jefferies brokerage house on the West Coast has played a key role as a ''third market'' firm. Since it is not a member of the New York Stock Exchange, it is not bound by the rules barring member brokers from trading in Big Board stocks outside of normal trading hours and when trading is halted for extraordinary reasons. **********Jefferies is close to the community of arbitragers, which can collectively own a major portion of the stock of companies that are rumored as takeover targets. Therefore the firm knows where to go to quickly line up huge transactions on behalf of corporate raiders who want to buy a controlling interest in a company. As a major takeover stock speculator, Mr. Boesky would often hold decisive amounts of stock in companies pursued by raiders. PROXMIRE PLANS INQUIRY **********WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 (Reuters) -The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee said today he would start an investigation of Wall Street insider trading and that Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager, was likely to testify. Senator William Proxmire, a Wisconsin Democrat, also said Congress should consider new controls on insider trading. **********Appearing on the ABC-TV News program ''This Week with David Brinkley,'' Mr. Proxmire said there was nothing wrong with junk bonds.

But there was little doubt among politicians today that the resignation Thursday of the defense chief, Michael Heseltine, cut short a seeming revival in the Prime Minister's political fortunes. **********It was the first walkout from a British Cabinet meeting since Joseph Chamberlain broke with William Gladstone on the seemingly eternal Irish question 99 years ago. But Mrs. Thatcher went on about her business with the purposefulness that has been her hallmark since she came to power in 1979. **********In a meeting today with American journalists, she said she was sad to ''lose'' Mr. Heseltine, then briskly pronounced the matter closed. ''We shall have to put this behind us,'' she declared. **********But the issues Mr. Heseltine had scattered in his wake seemed certain to reverberate for weeks to come. **********Least significant of these, in the view of most politicians, was the one that seemed to matter most to Mr. Heseltine: that of the future of a nearly bankrupt helicopter company with no pending commercial orders that has somehow become the prize in a hard-fought battle between two multinational consortiums that are offering to bail it out in exchange for a minority holding. The general view was voiced by a member of the Cabinet who dismissed it as ''the most piddling affair.'' Company Became a Symbol **********The future of the Westland company, he said, mattered only because Mr. Heseltine had made it symbolize latent divisions over the Government's role in managing the economy and Britain's role in Europe that persist in the Conservative Party after a decade of Thatcherism. **********Mr. Heseltine accused Mrs. Thatcher of ''ill-tempered attempts'' to block the bid advanced by a consortium of five European companies that he was trying to help. He said the ability of Britain and Europe to remain competitive in high technology was riding on the outcome of a shareholders' vote due next week. **********The Prime Minister insisted in public that the decision on whether to accept the other bid from a consortium led by the Sikorsky division of United Technologies was a matter only for the shareholders, not the Government. But the abstruse fiscal and technological issues on which the vote turns have become so confused with high-stake Tory politics that Mr. Heseltine will appear to have won a moral victory at Mrs. Thatcher's expense if, as seemed increasingly likely this evening, the shareholders fail to give the Sikorsky bid the 3-to-1 endorsement it requires. A Schoolmistress, Cowering Boys **********Still, the sense that the affair was more than ''piddling'' for Mrs. Thatcher had little to do with Westland. It may have had more to do with Mr. Heseltine's charges about her overbearing way of managing the Cabinet. **********The notion that the Prime Minister is only ''first among equals'' under Britain's unwritten constitution has a mystical appeal to many here, but Mr. Heseltine's charges could hardly be characterized as revelations. Political satirists and caricaturists have spent the last six years portraying Mrs. Thatcher as a stern schoolmistress in a room full of cowering boys. **********The theoretical question of ''Cabinet responsibility'' is of interest to few beyond Cabinet ministers and political scientists. It is not the sort of issue on which elections are fought or lost. Nor does anyone seriously imagine that Mr. Heseltine, an activist with a reputation for not cultivating political allies, would be content to function as chairman of the board rather than chief executive officer if he inherited the leader's mantle. **********By process of elimination, it has come to seem that if the core issue is not really the future of Westland or that of Cabinet responsibility, it has become, for the time being at least, Mrs. Thatcher herself. Debate Over Thatcher as Leader **********Whatever the merits of the arguments over Europe, helicopters, high technology and the unwritten constitution, Mr. Heseltine's challenge to the Prime Minister has made her seem not only overbearing but vulnerable to attack, particularly in a week in which unemployment and interest rates both rose. In recent polls, the Conservatives have held a narrow lead over the Labor Party because the political debate has focused on the question of whether Labor is fit to govern. **********Mrs. Thatcher does not have to call an election for more than two years, but to have the focus of debate shift to her own leadership was enough to make many Conservatives wonder whether she can really lead them to victory for a third time. **********If there is any chance for Mr. Heseltine and his rival brand of Toryism, Mrs. Thatcher's backers pointed out today, it would be only in the aftermath of a major setback at the next election in the three-cornered race that will also include the Social Democratic-Liberal Alliance. **********Other refugees from the Thatcher Cabinet who have been exiled to the back benches of the House of Commons have quickly been written off by their party. But few commentators were saying the flamboyant Mr. Heseltine's political life expectancy had been exhausted at the age of 52. **********''He's the first person,'' one of his backers said, surveying the succession of ministers who have been dropped from the Thatcher Cabinet, ''about whom it couldn't be said at the time he went to the back benches that it was the end of his career.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/13/business/l-brand-names-669486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Letter", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRAND NAMES", "print_headline": "BRAND NAMES", "body_text": " **********To the Editor: **********I believe Benjamin Stein misses three critical points when he questions how ''uniquely valuable brand names'' can go undiscovered by investors for decades (''The Bizarre Logic of Market Analysis,'' Forum, Feb. 9). **********First, a chasm exists in this country between the business of companies (e.g., their brands) and their stocks. **********Stocks, by and large, are bought and sold on the basis of short-term earnings potential (the numbers) not on the strength of the brands which may, in fact, produce the numbers. **********Second, investor relations departments rarely make specific brands and their historical performances a major theme in communications with shareholders. The dominant themes tend to be financial projections and results, company direction and investment strategy, and special events. **********Third, a company's shareholder base evolves constantly, a situation that limits the sum of knowledge shareholders have about brand performance.

Perhaps fewer than half a dozen are left of a population that was small even at its height -from 100 to 160 people. **********Jews from Eastern and Central Europe went to Nicaragua in the early part of this century seeking business or job opportunities and, later, asylum from the Nazis. Most left after the devastating earthquake in 1972 or after July 1979, when the Sandinistas overthrew Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Slogans Remembered **********Several Jewish emigres interviewed in the Miami area said they fled the country because of harassment by the Sandinista Government. They said an anti-Semitic campaign began years before the changeover, when the Sandinista rebels began receiving military training from the Palestine Liberation Organization. Anti-Jewish feelings, they said, increased later as Israel became a major supplier of weapons to the Somoza Government. **********Elena Gorn, 32 years old, who lives in Hollywood, Fla., said she remembered slogans reading ''Out with the Jews'' and ''Death to the Zionists'' painted on the walls of the only synagogue in Managua and elsewhere in the city. **********She said her father-in-law, Abraham Gorn, the recognized leader of Nicaraguan Jews, was arrested soon after the takeover on what she said were trumped-up charges of tax evasion. Mr. Gorn, then 75, was ordered to sweep the streets while his jailers taunted him with anti-Semitic jokes, she said. **********After a week, she said, he was released and given official apologies that his detention had been a mistake. But a month later, she said, police officers raided his house at 11 P.M. and told him that the house, his businesses and all his possessions were being confiscated. He left the house with only a robe over his pajamas, she said, and sought asylum at the Costa Rican Embassy. He now lives in Costa Rica. 'Handwriting on the Wall' **********''The Jewish community in Nicaragua was always independent economically and politically and always very united,'' she said. ''After what happened to my father-in-law, we saw the handwriting on the wall, and very soon all of us left.'' **********Isaac Stavisky, 48, of Miami, who owned a yarn and textile factory that employed 1,200 people, said he left after his life was threatened. He said that before the Sandinista takeover, he saw a fire at the Managua synagogue on a Sabbath eve after Sandinistas attacked it. **********An almost totally different picture was painted by two Jews interviewed in Managua. **********''I have never felt persecuted,'' said Rolando Najlis, a retired merchant in his early 70's who described himself as Jewish by ethnic identification but an atheist by belief. ''If there was the smallest manifestation of this sort against against Jews, I can assure you I wouldn't stay in Nicaragua.'' **********Perhaps, he said, Jews left after the Sandinista victory because they ''thought that the behavior of Israel in its links with Somoza could bring reprisals against them.'' **********Jaime Levy, 72, once an active member of the Managua synagogue, said the Sandinistas had never bothered him and suggested that those who fled had been ''very good friends of the former regime.'' **********''I have seen persecution of Jews in Europe,'' he said. ''Here, to be honest, I haven't seen that happening.'' Son Differs With Father **********But Mr. Levy's son Gabriel said in a telephone interview from Houston that his father was being ''used'' by the Government because it was concerned that the influence of United States Jews not be used to its detriment. **********''The truth is that we all left because we were Jews,'' he said. His father, he said, remained because he did not have enough money to leave and was too old to resettle elsewhere. **********In 1979, Gabriel Levy recalled, he and his father were denounced as ''Jewish exploiters'' during a large university demonstration called to protest the death of a Sandinista who, he said, had been shot by a private guard while trying to rob the Levy jeans import business. **********Mr. Levy said he, too, was at the synagogue when a firebomb was thrown against the outside doors and he recalls the terrified worshippers hearing shouts from outside of ''Jewish pigs'' and ''Judaism and Somozaism are the same thing.'' The fire, he suggested, did not cause much damage. **********Herty Lewites, Nicaragua's Minister of Tourism, whose father was Jewish and whose mother was Roman Catholic, said assertions about a firebombing were ''totally false'' and denied the Government was anti-Semitic. **********The building that housed the synagogue is now occupied by the Sandinista Children's Association. Roger Toledo, an association employee, said the building's contents had been looted by members of the National Guard, the military force loyal to General Somoza, during the 1979 insurrection. **********The elder Mr. Levy voiced no interest in a return of the synagogue to the remaining Jews, saying: ''If tomorrow they told me, 'Here it is, take it,' what would I do with it?

In 1842, wanting to give his feet a rest, the peddler opened a wooden-fronted pot and lace store not far from the Wabash River in Vincennes, Ind., the first Gimbel store. **********He wrote a sign that he hung on the wall: ''If anything said or done in this store looks wrong or is wrong, we would have customers take for granted that we shall set it right as soon as it comes to our knowledge. We are not satisfied unless customers are.'' Decades later, that statement continued to be printed on the reverse of every sales slip made out in Gimbel stores. Two Sons Took Charge **********Two of Adam Gimbel's sons, Isaac and Jacob, soon after took charge of the business and opened stores in Milwaukee in 1887 and Philadelphia in 1894. Meanwhile, Isaac's son, Bernard, became a forceful advocate for bringing the Gimbel name to New York City. **********His view eventually prevailed. A plot of land was purchased in Greeley Square at Broadway and 32d Street and up went a 10-story emporium with three basement levels. When it opened in 1910, it represented the first major department store to open in New York at a full size, while others grew piece by piece. It boasted nearly a million square feet of floor space. **********The zestful Bernard Gimbel eventually succeeded his father and built the operation into a mammoth merchandising operation. Under his leadership, new stores were opened in several cities and the Saks Fifth Avenue chain was acquired in 1923, giving the family a network of stores catering to the luxury set. Private Brands Stocked **********The Gimbel stores were early proponents of several retailing techniques. They were one of the first to stock private brands to augment national brands, to create boutiques within a large store and to divide merchandise into small categories for better profit control. The Gimbel basement, like Filene's in Boston, became known for selling less expensive goods to customers who rarely ventured into a department store. **********Bruce Gimbel, the great-grandson of the founder, took the mantle as chief executive of the chain in 1961. Under his stewardship, a Gimbel store was opened in the early 1970's on East 86th Street, on New York's more affluent Upper East Side. **********The chain grew to 36 stores, 10 of them in the New York metropolitan area. However, the Gimbel stores, despite the long hold they had on shoppers, had already begun to lose their way, rocked by the dramatic gains made by discount stores and by the more aggressive posture taken by a longtime rival, R.H. Macy & Company, whose flagship store squats across from the Gimbel store in Greeley Square, In 1973, when the company was acquired by B.A.T Industries, the Gimbel family's leadership came to a close."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/03/business/mortgages-bill-signed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 34, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Mortgages Bill Signed", "print_headline": "Mortgages Bill Signed", "body_text": " **********President Reagan signed emergency legislation today that will allow the Federal Housing Administration and the Government National Mortgage Association to resume activities in the mortgage markets, the White House said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/business/early-regulatory-reaction-seems-favorable.html": {"writer_name": "Nathaniel Nash", "pub_date": "1986-10-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 440, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Early Regulatory Reaction Seems Favorable", "print_headline": "Early Regulatory Reaction Seems Favorable", "body_text": " **********Federal banking regulators indicated today that they had few initial objections to the offer by First Interstate Bancorp to buy the BankAmerica Corporation, and several of them said they saw significant benefits to the proposed merger. **********However, they all emphasized that no firm position would be taken pending study of the final offer. **********The regulators would not speak for attribution since they had not seen details of the proposal.

Experience? One of them was an editor of her high school paper, whose name she can't remember, and worked briefly in the business press. **********However, while all around them publishing corporations with generations of experience will continue to produce their occasional multimillion-dollar bombs, these two are probably going to make it. **********That's because Susan Ross, 28 years old, and Felice Shapiro, 29, have enthusiasm and sales talent, are adept penny pinchers, are each equipped with an M.B.A. and can write mighty business plans. And, in Mrs. Shapiro's words, ''we are extremely driven.'' **********The publication is New York Family and it is expected to get a 30,000 distribution, largely in Manhattan, through Fleet Services. Fleet will deliver in bulk, not to residences, as Judy Price's highly successful Avenue magazine is, but rather to places where parents assemble. **********Up and down the East and West Sides as far south as Chambers Street and as far north as Riverdale in the Bronx, the publication will be turning up in such places as day-care centers, private schools, museums and pediatricians' and dentists' offices. For test purposes a number of copies will also be for sale for $2 a copy at a total of 50 bookstores and newsstands. All copies will carry subscription offers of 12 copies for $18. **********For starters the magazine will be black and white and published for the first three issues at an every-other-month frequency. It will go monthly in October. The women - each is a co-editor and co-publisher - are operating out of an office at 420 East 79th Street without secretarial help but with a telephone answering machine and a personal computer. Among other things, they are using the computer to make the entire magazine ready for their printer in Pennsylvania, which gets all it needs on the computer disks. **********They were quick to discover that anything you need is available from a freelancer in this town. **********Because they have to watch their pennies at the beginning, Miss Ross and Mrs. Shapiro have been pretty successful at getting some of their editorial material at no cost. In two cases they have rewarded writers with a third of a page of advertising space. **********Those pages are selling for $1,200 and the first issue carries 32 pages and a back cover. **********''Advertiser response has been overwhelming,'' Mrs. Shapiro said. As a matter of fact, the magazine is running ahead of the business plan. **********The magazine, Miss Ross said, is not just another parents' magazine. It is a magazine for parents raising children in Manhattan, busy people who don't have time to research what's available to help them in being parents. **********And the advertising fits right into the editorial, Mrs. Shapiro added, being largely retail, everything from shoe stores featuring chic footwear for the young to banks offering layaways for Junior's future. **********Each issue will carry a calendar of events, a great boon for advertisers, since, said Miss Ross, the phrasemaker, it will give the magazine ''coffee table endurance.'' **********The two ladies have started their operation with $50,000 of their own money, most of which came from Miss Ross's stock market successes. They had no choice; they had no luck at the banks. But the way things are going - and they have a thorough knowledge of cash flow - they feel that will be adequate. **********Miss Ross grew up in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and graduated from Franklin and Marshall, and Cornell. Her associate and pal is a Bostonian and an alumna of Georgetown and George Washington. They met when the former, then manager of financial planning in Purchase, N.Y., for the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group, interviewed the latter for a job. Similar in personality, they were to become close friends. And as the friendship grew, each became convinced that a joint venture was very much in their futures. **********Miss Ross left Pepsico in 1984 to work in corporate planning at Macmillan in the area of publishing controlled-circulation, single-sponsor magazines for health-care professionals. It was here that the future became clear - free-circulation magazine publishing. **********It took a while but she and Mrs. Shapiro, having discarded a number of other publishing targets, finally decided on the young parent, a group that Mrs. Shapiro and her husband, Alan, the marketing man, will soon be joining."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/10/business/monetary-plan-urged-by-baker.html": {"writer_name": "Peter Kilborn", "pub_date": "1986-04-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1029, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MONETARY PLAN URGED BY BAKER", "print_headline": "MONETARY PLAN URGED BY BAKER", "body_text": " **********Saying that ''we need to improve the functioning'' of the world's currency market, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d today offered a prescription for a more regulated monetary system. **********In a speech to the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Baker listed five ''qualities'' he would seek, including ''automaticity,'' which would require countries to alter policies when their economies fall out of line with those of other nations. **********It was the first time that Mr. Baker has openly embraced so rigid a concept of economic regulation, and Treasury officials said the plan was likely to become part of the proposals that he is putting together for the seven-nation Tokyo economic summit conference that President Reagan will attend the first week of May. **********In saying that a new system should be ''flexible,'' Mr. Baker stopped well short of suggesting a return to the Bretton Woods system of rigidly fixed currency rates that was abandoned 13 years ago, but economists said Mr. Baker appeared to want much tougher arrangements than those currently in effect. **********Ministers Expect Rate Cuts **********On another major issue, the finance ministers and central bankers meeting here today told reporters that new declines in world interest rates appeared likely, and some officials said the current economic environment favored concerted action by governments to force the decline. **********In United States credit markets, it is widely expected that the Federal Reserve will act to further reduce interest rates. Short- and long-term rates declined today, and the corporate bond market was flooded with new issues.  [ Page D19. ]  The concept of automaticity introduced by Mr. Baker startled some economists. **********''Automaticity means there should be predetermined rules under which countries do things automatically,'' said John Williamson, a British expert on monetary affairs at the Institute for International Economics here. ''American officialdom has been against automatic rules.'' **********Mr. Baker and other senior Treasury officials could not be reached last night for comment on the Baker speech, but economists said that such predetermined rules could apply to unemployment rates, growth rates or trade balances. Some Favorable Views **********Mr. Baker addressed the top economic officials of the 149-nation International Monetary Fund, which is conducting a semiannual weeklong meeting with its sibling international lending institution, the World Bank. **********On the matter of lower interest rates, West German officials, whom Treasury officials often cite as the main obstacle to a new concerted reduction by major countries, spoke favorably of a further action, although they stopped short of predicting an immediate one. Just a month ago, Japan, West Germany and the United States collaborated in such a cut. **********''We have seen some success in coperation as far as interest rates are concerned,'' said Karl Otto Pohl, chairman of West Germany's central bank. ''We hope that's going to continue.'' **********Gerhard Stoltenberg, the West German Finance Minister, said, ''We think it's desirable to have a further decline in interest rates, but I doubt if there will be a commitment here.'' **********Mr. Stoltenberg and other officials said that Mr. Baker favored a further reduction of the dollar against all currencies and that the British and Germans favored a further rise of the Japanese yen alone, which would mean a decline of the dollar against the yen. But none said the issue was as pressing as their widespread desire for lower interest rates. Group of 10 Seeks Reform **********Mr. Baker's remarks on monetary reform followed a communique, published at midnight Tuesday by the ministers of the 11 largest industrial countries, known as the Group of Ten. The group urged ''further progress'' toward reform of exchange rates and the monetary system within the framework of the I.M.F. They also said ''it might be useful'' for countries to include such objectives as growth rates and trade balances in their efforts to coordinate their economic policies and thus to stabilize the global economy. **********With that communique in the background, Mr. Baker then spelled out his criteria for monetary reform. In so doing, the Treasury Secretary indicated that he had gone far beyond President Reagan's order to him to explore the feasibility of merely calling a monetary conference. **********Mr. Baker listed five items as ''qualities that we should be looking for in any strengthened system.'' They are ''symmetry,'' to insure the compatibility of nations' domestic economic policies; ''policy breadth,'' to facilitate convergence of nations' economic performance; ''flexibility,'' to respond to unexpected economic developments; ''political will,'' to insure nations' commitment to the policies, and ''automaticity.'' **********Most countries accept four of those qualities, but with ''automaticity'' he introduced a new criterion to the United States agenda. **********''It can be argued that the current system has too much flexibility,'' he said. ''Any strengthened system should, therefore, contain a somewhat greater degree of automaticity in addressing problems that develop.'' Response to Lending Plan **********In an earlier address today to both the World Bank and the I.M.F., Mr. Baker took note of the favorable response to the plan he proposed seven months ago to increase lending to debtor nations in return for their adoption of growth-oriented domestic economic policies. But he offered no concessions to take account of objections to the plan from private banks, who would be major participants, and some of the developing countries. **********Developing countries have criticized the plan's proposed $29 billion in new lending over three years as insufficient, and they say they find the plan arbitrary and a threat to their national sovereignty. **********''The Baker plan is good,'' a senior Argentine official, who asked not to be named, said after hearing Mr. Baker's remarks. ''But we think it's insufficient and it has to be more flexible.'' **********The decline in oil prices permeated the discussions here, bringing cheer to the vast majority, who benefit from them, but also appeals for aid to poorer oil-exporting countries, such as Mexico. Delegates to the meeting here said the United Staters opposed the creation of a special loan fund and saw little likelihood that one would be created."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/07/world/egypt-and-israel-report-progress-in-border-dispute.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1986-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 664, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EGYPT AND ISRAEL REPORT PROGRESS IN BORDER DISPUTE", "print_headline": "EGYPT AND ISRAEL REPORT PROGRESS IN BORDER DISPUTE", "body_text": " **********Under renewed pressure from the United States, Egypt and Israel were reported to be near agreement today on final technical details that could lead to the settlement of a border dispute. **********The dispute, over Taba, a 25-acre wedge of desert on the Gulf of Aqaba, has been a major obstacle to better relations.

''They're hammering it out now.'' **********Although Mr. Bush failed to achieve a breakthrough while he was here, Egyptian officials credited him and Mr. Murphy with giving fresh impetus to the slow-moving talks. **********The chief delegates from Egypt and Israel, who had met on Tuesday, said after meeting again this morning that they had made some progress.

It is a tourist resort with a luxury hotel and a 700-yard wide beach frequented by Israeli swimmers and sunbathers. Symbol of Claim to Sinai **********The Egyptians paid little attention to Taba until it emerged in the frictions that followed the early glow of the 1979 peace treaty. It has come to symbolize Egypt's claim to the entire Sinai. **********Egypt recalled its ambassador from Israel nearly four years ago after the Israeli Army invaded Lebanon and said he would not return until three conditions were met. These were Israel's military withdrawal from Lebanon, an improvement in conditions for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza and agreement to arbitrate the dispute over Taba. **********Israel initially insisted on nonbinding conciliation of the Taba issue. But in January, after heated Cabinet debate, the Government of Prime Minister Shimon Peres conditionally agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration. The negotiators have argued since over the wording that framed the question for the arbitrators, believing that it will influence their decision. **********Israel has also sought assurances that Egypt, in return for a concession on arbitration, will take steps to improve not only diplomatic relations but also the faltering trade and tourism between the two countries."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/business/key-rates-279486.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-28", "snippet": "", "word_count": 121, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/world/french-link-syria-to-terror-group.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1986-10-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 897, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FRENCH LINK SYRIA TO TERROR GROUP", "print_headline": "FRENCH LINK SYRIA TO TERROR GROUP", "body_text": " **********A senior French official cited evidence today linking Syria with the group that the police believe carried out a series of bomb attacks here this month. **********The official, Michel Aurillac, who is the Minister of Cooperation in the conservative Government, said in a newspaper interview that people believed by the French police to be responsible for the attacks were ''exfiltrated'' from France with the help of ''professional secret agents.'' **********Mr. Aurillac, who made a hastily scheduled trip to Damascus for talks with Syrian leaders recently, stopped short of accusing Syria of backing the terrorists. **********But he linked Syria to the group believed by the Government to have carried out the attacks, saying that several of its members appeared in a Lebanese region that is ''controlled by Syria'' where they have made statements to reporters. **********'Virtually a Certainty' **********Mr. Aurillac's remarks, published today in Le Figaro, the rightist daily, were consistent with a growing belief among analysts here that the terror campaign was backed by Syria's secret service. **********''With us now the Syrian angle is virtually a certainty,'' an official here said today.

The new movement has presented a contrast with the old one, leaving the impression that while students are always a volatile lot, prone at times to rouse themselves against a Gaullist government, there are differences as well. **********The students at Nanterre and elsewhere in France, some of whom were born in 1968, are protesting a program that would slightly increase tuition fees in the state university system, now generally less than $100 a year, and give each university greater power to select students -rather than admitting anyone who has completed the college-preparatory academic program, as they have done for decades. **********Government spokesmen defend the proposal, which Parliament is to consider and presumably approve on Thursday, by asserting that it will encourage higher standards and give more value to university degrees. **********The students, who are making posters, holding nonstop meetings and attending giant daily assemblies to denounce the Government plan, contend that it will open the university system to a new elitism, ending guarantees of state-supported university education for everybody. **********Most of all, the students are unleashing a mood of discontent that has not been seen in France since the upheavals of 18 years ago. On Tuesday, as students at 66 French high schools boycotted classes, several thousand teen-agers briefly occupied a major Left Bank intersection in Paris, tying up traffic and chanting slogans aimed at persuading Alain Devaquet, the Cabinet minister who drafted the proposal, to resign. A Violent Confrontation **********Today, for the first time, there was violence. A group of student demonstrators were attacked at a Left Bank campus with sticks and unlit firebombs by what were described by Agence France-Presse as members of an extreme rightist group. Five people were reported slightly injured. **********The movement may not last long. Its leaders, a coordinating committee elected at the striking universities in the last few days, say their immediate objective is to organize a huge demonstration in front of Parliament on Thursday. **********''After that, and if the law is not withdrawn, we will have to get together and reflect on further steps,'' said Claire Dufour, a leader of the movement at Nanterre. She spoke in a smoky, soiled student activities room in the liberal arts division. Pieces of abandoned furniture lined one wall; the voices of student agitation pulsed through adjacent corridors and meeting rooms. **********The wave of protest has already thrust forth a student leader portrayed by French newspapers and television as a kind of successor to Mr. Cohn-Bendit. She is Isabelle Thomas, a 24-year-old student of business law at Villetaneuse. **********The documentary series by Mr. Cohn-Bendit provides a striking basis of comparison for Ms. Thomas and the generation whose symbol she has suddenly become. The series, ''How We Loved the Revolution,'' is based on recent interviews by Mr. Cohn-Bendit with leaders of the 1960's protests, and it reflects a rueful, resigned sense that the revolution so beloved had been an unrealistic aspiration. A Lawyerly Leftist **********Ms. Thomas does not for the moment appear to be a new Danny the Red, even if some newspapers are pushing that image. She is calm, often elegantly dressed, more lawyerly than revolutionary in her television interviews; she describes herself as ''on the left, a Socialist,'' but utters no revolutionary rhetoric. **********Asked in one interview what she thought of Mr. Cohn-Bendit, she replied, ''He was a long time ago.'' And about May 1968? ''That was a long time ago, too,'' she said. **********It could be said that Ms. Thomas reflects an end of revolutionary ideology in a country where its adherents clung to it tenaciously. A major reason the events of May 1968 turned from a protest about overcrowding at Nanterre into a violent social revolt is that student groups that described themselves as Marxist and revolutionary were active and waiting for an opportunity to strike. Realism and Principles **********Now the student groups are far from Marxist. Some commentators, in fact, are describing students these days as different both from the protest veterans of 1968 and from the overtly ambitious, establishmentarian students of the early 80's. The current troops, the daily Liberation said the other day, ''are an original mix of realism with intangible moral principles.'' The organization they admire most, the newspaper said, is S O S Racism, which holds concerts and meetings to fight what it sees as an increase in racist, anti-immigrant sentiment from the extreme right. **********Today's strike leaders also show a schooling in modern public relations techniques. One of the first actions by the protest organizers was to create a press committee to keep the newspapers and television stations notified of their doings."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/15/business/advertising-two-new-commercials-promoting-wplj-fm.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-09-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 225, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Two New Commercials Promoting WPLJ-FM", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Two New Commercials Promoting WPLJ-FM", "body_text": " **********The people behind the clever TV commercial that shows a radio station's janitor lip-syncing the programming as a way of promoting the contemporary-hits format of WPLJ-FM will today introduce the first of two 30-second TV commercials that will promote the featured players in its popular morning drive-time program, ''Jim Kerr and the Morning Crew.'' **********They are the frantic Mr. Kerr, the equally frantic Howard the Cab Driver, whose infrequently used surname is Henkin, and the more sedate, and also pregnant, Shelli Sonstein. **********The Capital Cities/ABC station will be spending $1 million during the fourth quarter to increase its audience, which Joseph E.

And in a stopgap operation, the Government agreed to pour $206 million into the company and to pass legislation to overhaul the country's system of nationalized business. **********The need for a far-reaching plan was emphasized by the plight at Voest, a $5 billion group that is Austria's largest industrial concern. The company, which has not made a profit since 1976, has dug deep into its pockets to turn around an unprofitable steelmaking operation and expand into new markets to offset the decline in smokestack activities. **********But Voest's losses, which are regularly absorbed by the Government, were compounded last year, after the company's trading division, Intertrading, lost $84.8 million through bad deals on the market for oil futures. Crucial to Economy **********Voest's problems are crucial to Austria's finely tuned economy, whose overall well-being depends heavily on nationalized industry. **********Economists estimate that nationalized companies generate more than one-fifth of Austrian exports and employ about one-fifth the national work force. Moreover, nationalized companies order nearly $800 million worth of goods a year from suppliers throughout the country, further stimulating the economy. **********Since World War II, successive governments have been committed to a policy of full employment. Even now, when unemployment throughout most of Europe is stubbornly stuck in double digits, Austria has been able to keep joblessness below 5 percent. **********But the sizable losses in some nationalized industries are taxing the Government's ability to pay for the luxury of a full-employment policy. Government officials and bank economists agree that a temporary solution lies in a further boost in the Government deficit, which was equivalent to about 4.4 percent of gross domestic product last year - far larger than the 2 percent recorded in 1981. 'This Is a Test' **********''This is a test for the country's brand of Government-owned industry,'' said a banker at Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank. **********Nationalized industry, to be sure, is not all iron and steel. Virtually every branch of the economy is represented, from tourism to paper making and forestry products, and most of them are making money. **********But in a small country of 7 million people, Voest's losses divert money that is badly needed by other nationalized companies for crucial modernization and product development, as they struggle to shake off the effects of the 1981-82 recession. **********Part of the Government's plan was in a vaguely worded proposal empowering the Government to study ways to reduce the taxpayer's burden that might include some privatization. It also included a nine-point restructuring program that would unite all the nationalized companies under one huge holding company, clarify auditing practices, unify strategic planning and tie executives' salaries to performance. **********Karl Aiginger, an industry expert at the Austrian Institute for Economic Research, said a large part of Voest's problem was the collapse of the steel market worldwide in the late 1970's. Partly, too, it was management gaffes, such as an ill-starred steel mill in Louisiana and a money-losing project to manufacture semiconductors with American Micro International, an electronics company in Santa Clara, Calif. Losses at Bayou Steel **********The Bayou Steel Corporation was set up by Voest to showcase its technology in the United States, including its advanced continuous casting machinery. But there were unexpected cost overruns and the decline of the American steel market just as the mill came on stream, leaving Bayou awash in losses. Voest is now negotiating to sell it. And the venture with American Micro to manufacture semiconductors in Austria came just as the bottom fell out of the chips market. **********But the real blow came elsewhere. Ten years ago, Voest set up Intertrading, an Austrian-based subsidiary, to meet the growing demand by cash-strapped third world and East bloc countries for barter deals. Intertrading dealt in virtually all kinds of raw materials and finished products, and under its aggressive chief executive, Gernot Preschern, business boomed. Last year, the trade volume exploded to more than $7 billion, from $186 million in 1980. **********Although the business was welcome at a time of otherwise slow growth, it also raised questions about the risk involved. But they were regularly dispelled by Voest's chief executive, Herbert Apfalter, a respected manager who assured Government supervisors that the loss risk at Intertrading, by company policy, would not exceed $23 million. Warning Lights **********In November, however, warning lights began to blink, as Mr. Apfalter reported that third- and fourth-quarter trading losses might total about $50 million. A week later, he was forced to increase the estimate to $84.8 million. **********Oil industry experts say that, by the size of the loss, Intertrading must have handled about 220 million barrels of crude oil last year, up from 140 million in 1984. **********Combined with losses of other units of the company, Intertrading's problems left Voest's total loss for the year at about $322.3 million. **********Chancellor Fred Sinowatz, in reporting to Parliament in December, said Voest's losses were the result of ''grave management blunders,'' such as decisions to move into new industries ''without possessing, in each case, sufficient know-how.'' **********Justice officials have been questioning Mr. Preschern at Intertrading to determine whether charges should be brought for criminal negligence. And the minister responsible for nationalized industry, Ferdinand Lacina, told Parliament in December that he assumed that Mr. Apfalter, the chief executive, had been ''seriously misled,'' but no one was willing to rule out an investigation of his responsibility. **********Indeed, some experts suggested Intertrading's exuberance was a sign of desperation over management's inability to turn around the ailing Voest. ''They were like the little shopkeeper who resorts to the gambling table,'' one Viennese banker said. Some Praise for Apfalter **********Economists acknowledge that Mr. Apfalter went a long way toward returning Voest to profitability in the 10 years he ran the group. **********Last year, the long-ailing steel division made a profit, and other units, such as its stainless steel and plant-making divisions, were in the black. The company is negotiating to sell Bayou Steel to RSR, a Dallas-based finance group, and is talking about a joint venture in electronics with Japan's Oki Electric Industry Company it hopes might offset the problems at the semiconductor venture. **********Indeed, some analsyts say the real problems at Voest were made not by management, but by political leaders too eager to meddle in the company's affairs to gain pork-barrel projects or save jobs in their constituencies."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/14/business/international-report-computers-impact-growing-in-india.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Weisman", "pub_date": "1986-07-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1383, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "COMPUTERS' IMPACT GROWING IN INDIA", "print_headline": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; COMPUTERS' IMPACT GROWING IN INDIA", "body_text": " **********Slowly but perceptibly, computers are insinuating themselves into Indian life as a result of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's 19-month-old policies encouraging their use and production. The effects could be far-reaching and profound. **********For instance, in the south Indian city of Hyderabad, computers have helped speed test results to students, match job applicants with available jobs and slash long lines of customers waiting to buy train and bus tickets. Here in New Delhi, computers are even churning out horoscopes. **********''Computers are finally having an impact on the day-to-day life of people,'' said Dr. N. Seshagiri, director of the Government's computer policies. ''It is more than I expected when we started in 1984. A whole new culture is growing up.'' **********Sweeping Efforts **********At the center of sweeping efforts to cut taxes and curb Government regulations, the effect of Mr. Gandhi's computer policies are easily measured: Indian manufacturers will produce 8,000 home and office computer systems this year, compared with 1,200 in 1984, according to the Department of Electronics. Next year, the number is expected to reach 20,000. **********In addition, officials expect to reverse past practices and arrange about a dozen equity participation plans with foreign companies, including Burroughs, Hewlett-Packard, Data General and International Computers Ltd. of Britain. Import barriers are also being lowered, and a few major deals are under way to purchase advanced computer systems from abroad. **********For instance, the Control Data Corporation recently won a bid over Honeywell Bull, a French company, to sell to the Indian Government sophisticated mainframe computers worth several hundred million dollars. Such deals, involving the transfer of American technology to India, were made possible by an accord last year between Prime Minister Gandhi and President Reagan. **********According to American officials here, computer sales are part of a dramatic increase in the number of American companies interested in developing a presence in India. One official estimated that 100 of the Fortune 500 companies are looking at Indian markets - a sixfold increase in the last year and a half. Wipe Out Classic Image **********If India's computer plans succeed, they would wipe out the classic image of overworked clerks laboriously keeping records by hand on huge, dusty ledgers at banks, railroads, airlines and businesses. Computers will also be used for tax collection, economic planning, production and warehousing, health systems, immigration and many other areas. **********Yet, there are problems: Power failures are epidemic, telephone lines are poor and tales of glitches and bureacratic snags abound. Officials also acknowledge that India would have a hard time training 100,000 professionals necessary to run and maintain the computers. **********In addition, most industries - including the computer industry - remain so highly regulated that businesses still face layers of clearances before they can import or manufacture computer equipment. **********Robin Stone, general manager of Tata Burroughs Ltd., a Bombay-based partnership owned 40 percent by Burroughs, praised the new policies, but complained of ''ridiculous bureacratic practices'' strangling the industry. ''They could have gone a lot further,'' he said of the Government. **********There are other problems as well. ''There is connivance and there is corruption, especially at the level of customs officials,'' said Vinay Bharat Ram, an executive at D.C.M. Ltd. and leader of the main computer manufacturers trade association. Self-Sufficent Philosophy **********Since its independence in 1947, India has been guided by a philosophy that places a premium on self-sufficiency. Even with a selective lowering of import barriers, that philosophy is not expected to change. Thus, some foreign companies, which hoped to increase sales of computers here, are finding that India is less interested in large-scale imports than in using foreign parts, expertise and capital to develop its own industry. **********Dr. Seshagiri and others admit that the basic object of India's computer policy is to encourage indigenous manufacturers for home and office computers, and to curb imports except for the nation's most-advanced computer needs. **********''All personal computers for India can be made within India,'' said Dr. Seshagiri. **********However, many of India's 300 computer companies are still at the stage of ''screwdriver technology.'' They import computer kits from Taiwan, Hong Kong or Singapore and assemble them here. The Government is trying to withhold production licenses for these companies, hoping that they will then turn to assembling and making their own components. **********''The intention has never been to permit a very free environment for foreign investors,'' said Shyam Malhotra, editor of Dataquest, a computer magazine. ''Foreign companies will have to be very patience oriented, not result-oriented.'' Protectionist Policies **********As a result of India's protectionist policies, domestically manufactured home and office computers - like many other consumer products - sell here at twice the price of their equivalents in the international markets. But the companies say they cannot increase production fast enough to cut prices because of the Government's slow pace in liberalizing regulations. **********''Give us a chance, and we will produce low-cost computers,'' said Aparna Mafatlal, chairman of two computer companies in Bombay, who added that she was unable to get licenses for the 50,000 computers she wants to produce. ''We had high hopes for Rajiv Gandhi,'' said Ms. Mafatlal. ''but at the moment, computer manufacturing in India is a joke.'' **********India's computer policies had been in the works well before the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on Oct. 31, 1984, but they have come to be identified with her son and successor, who announced them two weeks after he took office. **********Mr. Gandhi, 41 years old, has a desktop computer in his office, but has run into his own problems. Critics of any of the Prime Minister's policies usually attribute the problems to the ''computer boys.'' A recent cartoon showed Mr. Gandhi abandoning a smashed up computer terminal because it had failed to find a solution to the Sikh crisis in the northern state of Punjab. Computer Imports Cited **********In addition, Mr. Gandhi is repeatedly accused of rupturing India's trade balance by allowing too many computer imports. Others, worried about computerization putting many out of work, have organized strikes and labor disruptions in protest. **********Lately, the Prime Minister has chosen to publicize the benefits of computers for a wide variety of people and new systems are being developed in Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telegu, Marathi and other regional languages. But critics still insist that computerization will make life more comfortable for the elite, while providing too few jobs - a view Mr. Gandhi and his aides say is short-sighted. **********India used to be a big exporter of machine tools, for example, but its overseas markets evaporated because it could not produce equipment compatible with computers. Now, Dr. Seshagiri said, India would soon be poised to recapture the market. **********India has already become a major exporter of computer software, largely because of a Government policy permitting the importing of computer equipment if a company promises to export 100 percent of its software. And computer specialists note that India could help fill the worldwide shortage of skilled computer programmers with people who will work at a fraction of the Western wage rate. **********Indian software exports are therefore growing by 40 percent a year. Some companies such as Texas Instruments Inc. develop the software here, and then beam it direct to the United States or elsewhere using the Government's satellite. 'Tremendous Demand' **********''We are able to get into the American market because there is such a tremendous demand,'' said Koka Ravindra, head of Era Electronics, which sells software to doctors' offices in the United States. **********Even the International Business Machines Corporation, which has won Washington clearance to sell computers to India for oil and natural gas exploration, is considering starting a software exporting operation in India, according to Dr. Seshagiri. **********Such moves would carry great symbolic importance, since I.B.M. left India in 1978 rather than give up its equity in its operation here. **********The relationship between I.B.M. and India remains as sensitive as ever, however. Dr. Seshagiri said the giant company was still opposed to investing in computer production here because it did not want to give up majority participation with its equity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/27/business/finance-new-issues-us-steel-s-offering-raised-to-400-million.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Steel's Offering Raised to $400 Million", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; U.S. Steel's Offering Raised to $400 Million", "body_text": " **********The United States Steel Corporation yesterday began offering $400 million of notes due Jan. 15, 1992, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc.

The failure to do so represents a serious error in judgment for which I accept full responsibility.'' Disputes Shultz's Assertions **********Later, in a speech in suburban Washington, he said that George P. Shultz, the Secretary of State, had been aware of the operation. **********''It was not kept from the Secretary of State,'' Mr. McFarlane said, according to The Associated Press. ''I am somewhat surprised at the portrayal that it was. I told him repeatedly and often of every item that went on in this enterprise.'' **********His comments contradicted Mr. Shultz's own assertions that he was not fully aware of the operation. **********Mr. McFarlane's abrupt reversal of his earlier views came in the aftermath of opposition to arms sales to Iran by Mr. Shultz, and by Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. **********Nonetheless, Mr. McFarlane's earlier comments, made to The Washington Post, were especially shocking to senior White House officials because overtures to Iran began during Mr. McFarlane's tenure as national security adviser. After Mr. McFarlane left his White House job in December 1985, he remained a dominant figure in secret talks with the Iranians, making a clandestine trip to Teheran in May on a plane crammed military equipment. **********''It's all puzzling and pretty incredible,'' a senior White House official said. ''When he was director of the N.S.C. or since or on the mission he never gave any indication that he thought it was a mistake.'' **********Donald T. Regan, the White House chief of staff, was described as ''upset'' about Mr. McFarlane's comments. Officials said they were unaware of President Reagan's reaction. **********Mr. McFarlane, in his interview with The Washington Post, said it was a ''mistake'' by the Administration to provide arms as part of a deal that included the release of American hostages. The newspaper, quoting a source believed to be Mr. McFarlane, also said he had opposed sending arms. **********One senior White House official said, using Mr. McFarlane's nickname: ''People were flabbergasted at what Bud said. He was instrumental in developing the policy. He was in the middle of it. How could he call it a mistake?'' **********Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said Mr. McFarlane phoned him this morning to say that ''the article mispresents his views on this matter.'' Mr. Speakes said the former security adviser planned to issue a clarifying statement later in the day. Political Dialogue Was Sought **********In that statement, Mr. McFarlane said he decided in 1985 to seek a ''political dialogue'' with Iranians. He said he could ''understand and endorse'' the need to strengthen certain moderate Iranians, including ''the provision of modest levels of defensive military equipment.'' **********''While today, I can draw a distinction between the need to strengthen reform-oriented Iranians and the unacceptable trading of arms for hostages, it is apparent that as events have become public, this distinction is not accepted by the American people,'' he said. **********Some White House officials were pleased at the explanation, while others were not. One official said: ''It stops the firestorm from breaking out. There won't be any headline tomorrow saying, 'McFarlane Breaks With Reagan.' '' **********But another official said: ''We're incredulous at this. It's got everyone's attention. Who was the national security adviser when the Iran operation began? This is not some stranger. It was a good idea at the time, but now that it went wrong, it was a bad idea? That seems to be the message.'' Mr. McFarlane has publicly endorsed the arms sale several times, as recently as Sunday on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' Mr. McFarlane said sending ''modest levels of arms'' was a ''reasonable price to pay'' for developing a working relationship with moderate elements in Iran."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/world/blacks-honor-white-foe-of-apartheid.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1986-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1221, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BLACKS HONOR WHITE FOE OF APARTHEID", "print_headline": "BLACKS HONOR WHITE FOE OF APARTHEID", "body_text": " **********To the strains of black nationalist chants and Christian hymns, one of South Africa's most prominent white activists was cremated today after a funeral ceremony that became an emotional tribute by thousands of the poor and voteless blacks whose cause she had espoused. **********Molly Blackburn, who died in an automobile wreck on Dec. 28, was ''a warrior for justice who walked briefly in a troubled land,'' said Sheena Duncan, leader of Black Sash, a white women's anti-apartheid group to which the dead activist belonged. **********More than 10,000 blacks flooded into Port Elizabeth's white areas to attend what turned into the biggest funeral rally in South Africa's recent history for a white anti-apartheid politician. **********''Africans in this country,'' said Mkuseli Jack, a prominent black leader in this port city, ''are walking tall in the trail she blazed.'' **********Boesak Speaks at Service **********He and others, including the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, spoke from the pulpit of St. John's Methodist Church, where young black militants, clad in a kind of uniform of sand-colored fatigues, stood over the coffin, in the manner of the many funerals of unrest victims in black townships that Mrs. Blackburn attended. **********Inside the church, the order of service offered hymns such as ''Onward Christian Soldiers.'' Outside, young black activists sang in support of the overthrow of white minority rule and chanted: ''There is no freedom in South Africa without bloodshed. There is no freedom in South Africa without war.'' **********Many carried the black, green and gold colors of the outlawed African National Congress, which has wide support among many black activists. **********Outside the church, under trees full of foliage that offered shade from a harsh sun, an old black woman, who did not want to give her name, took a reporter to one side to explain not so much the politics, but the frail strand of hope that Mrs. Blackburn seemed to impart to many of the blacks she knew. 'A Human Being, Straightaway' **********''At many white homes,'' she said, ''you, as a black, are made to stand at the gate. At Molly's home, you felt at home, a human being, straightaway.'' **********''She was our mother,'' the woman said, full of the tears that many shed openly inside the packed church. **********In harsh counterpoint to the emotions expressed at the service, the death toll in unrest in the first two days of the new year was reported to have passed 20 with more bodies discovered in the Moutsie district, north of Pretoria, where black residents are resisting an official attempt to incorporate them into the so-called tribal homeland called KwaNdebele. **********The people of the Moutsie district belong to the North Sotho-speaking Pedi tribe but the authorities wish to incorporate the area into KwaNdebele, a homeland for the Ndebele tribe. **********The deadline for the incorporation of Moutsie into KwaNdebele was believed to be Dec. 31, and Wednesday vigilantes from KwaNdebele were said by residents to have flooded into the Moutsie district to enforce the edict. At least 10 people were reported killed by Wednesday night. **********Two black policemen were said to be among the latest killed in the area, bringing the death toll to 17, while the police reported two additional deaths Wednesday, one in Durban and one in Middleburg in the Eastern Cape. Several Slain Near Cape Town **********Several more people were said to have been killed in black squatter camps and segregated townships on the fringes of Cape Town, where the police say older blacks are chastising young militants for confronting the white authorities. **********The Eastern Cape, around Port Elizabeth, is the area where Mrs. Blackburn was best known among blacks. she had traveled frequently to black townships there, gathering information about police behavior. **********Mrs. Blackburn, 55 years old and the mother of seven children, was a member of the Progressive Federal Party, the official white parliamentary opposition, a Black Sash worker and one of the few whites in South Africa to be welcomed and accepted in segregated black townships. Politically, her friends said, she had moved far beyond the policies of her own party, and referred frequently in private conversation to her association with ''the struggle'' - the term used by black activists for their war against white rule. **********Mrs. Blackburn and a fellow anti-apartheid campaigner, Brian Bishop, died on their way back from an investigation of purported human rights violations in the black township outside Oudtshoorn in the Eastern Cape. Head-On Collision **********Their car collided head-on with another vehicle driven by a solitary black man, who also died. In an interview, Mr. Bishop's widow, Di, who was in the car at the time, said the oncoming vehicle seemed suddenly to appear from the darkness and drive into the car her husband was driving. **********There have been no suggestions so far among the relatives of the dead that the accident was contrived by the authorities, but such is the mistrust of the Government among blacks that when news of the auto wreck first became known, many assumed there had been foul play. **********''Molly continues in death what she did in life,'' Dr. Boesak said at the church service. ''She brings us together in anticipation of what this country of ours could and should be.'' **********''Molly showed us how to live, how to love, how to care,'' he said. ''She died still trying to mold out of the hatred and misery and suffering of our people something new, joyful, beautiful.'' Policemen Arrive at Funeral **********However, South Africa's realities of separation and mistrust seemed to intrude. Riot policemen arrived with dogs, shotguns and whips, but a confrontation was averted at the end of the funeral when black activist leaders loaded the thousands of blacks who had come into buses so that they could be driven back to their segregated townships without incident. **********Whites living near St. John's Church looked on in bemusement at the spectacle outside their doors of blacks chanting revolutionary slogans - a sight common enough in black townships, but one from which whites are shielded by geographic separation and by official information policies under which such scenes are kept off the Government-run television. **********When one white activist joined the thousands of blacks filing towards the church at the start of the funeral, holding aloft a clenched-fist salute, many blacks cheered and shouted ''Viva!'' **********The implication seemed to be that after years of enforced separation, so few whites openly identify with black hopes that a single white such as Mrs. Blackburn inspires a great affection among those for whom a white face has been synonymous with rejection. **********The disciplined mood among blacks at the funeral, an activist leader said, was designed as a tribute to Mrs. Blackburn, a message to her in death that those she had embraced would not permit her funeral to become engulfed in violence, and a message to other whites that their vision of blacks as unruly and violent was ill-founded. **********''We do not hate whites,'' a middle-aged black woman in the crowd told a reporter.

Neither protectionist nor overtly mercantilist, the agreement promotes American interests while helping world trade. **********The deal guarantees the United States ''more than 20 percent'' of Japan's semiconductor market by 1991, compared with only 8.2 percent today. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry will monitor prices and clamp down on dumping of selected semiconductors exported to America and third markets. In exchange, we have suspended retaliation against alleged unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductors. **********Such an agreement will be attacked from every angle: for raising prices to American consumers; for violating President Reagan's free market principles; for setting a dangerous precedent in other sectors. **********Yet all of these dogmatic free trade arguments miss the point. When an industry is dynamic, export-oriented, and systematically attacked by foreign competitors, the Government should intervene. And if there was ever such an industry, it is semiconductors. **********Unlike steel, apparel and most declining industries, few semiconductor trade problems have been of their own making. Since the American invention of the transistor in 1947, American companies have been technological leaders. The semiconductor industry spends more on R.&D. (10.7 percent of sales in 1985) than any other American industry (average 3.1 percent). And unlike most industries, chip makers have never myopically focused on the domestic market. Through 1984, American chips outsold Japan's by 5 to 1 in Europe. **********Despite the dynamism and export orientation, American semiconductors never deeply penetrated Japan. Since 1973, our share of Japan's market has hovered mysteriously around 10 percent. Moreover, some Japanese companies began an unabashed attack to dominate their American competitors. A Hitachi memorandum, which ordered its sales force to quote 10 percent below United States companies, no matter what the cost, was one of the clearest examples of predatory pricing in recent trade history. **********The semiconductor agreement attacks these problems head-on. By specifying a target market share in Japan for American chips, it necessitates some Japanese liberalization. Virtually every year since 1981, Japan has trumpeted a series of market opening measures. Nonetheless, Japan's total imports were lower in 1985 than they were five years ago. Without a precise market share goal, nothing is likely to be accomplished. Similarly, the monitoring system for checking prices should prevent a repetition of the Hitachi debacle. And since the United States only suspended its retaliation against Japan, the Government has maintained its leverage in case of future violations. **********In addition to helping our semiconductor industry, this agreement should help world trade. With the American trade deficit running at an annual rate of $170 billion, Congress wants action. Last September, the President promised a new trade policy and he will finally support that promise. The semiconductor agreement undoubtedly helped the Administration avert a Congressional override of the textile quota bill - a bill that would have destroyed the recently renewed Multi-Fiber Arrangement and any chances for a new GATT round. Furthermore, the agreement is not truly protectionist. Its most important feature is opening the Japanese market, not closing the American. By not including in the agreement producers from Taiwan, Korea and Europe, American manufacturers will continue to have incentives to be innovative and efficient. **********The agreement may also promote world trade by helping Japan open its domestic market. Bureaucratic and popular resistance to purchasing more foreign goods has frustrated some Japanese political leaders as much as American industry. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone knows that Japan must reduce its trade surplus, projected to reach $60 billion in 1986. But he also realizes the futility of pleading on Japanese television for every citizen to buy $100 of foreign goods. **********Japan alters its trade policy only when foreign nations apply pressure. The bureaucracy and many Japanese companies have long resisted domestic political efforts to create a new trading strategy. However, when foreign governments credibly threaten Japan, as the United States did in autos in 1981, Japanese politicians can use the foreign threat to force changes. Thus, this agreement may not only assist Mr. Reagan with Congress, it may help Mr. Nakasone fight protectionist leanings in Japan. **********The agreement is not perfect. It excludes 1 megabit D-RAMS, which are the future in semiconductor trade. And it will also require constant American vigilance. A similar export monitoring arrangement for steel in the late 1970's fell apart when it was circumvented by many American importers and foreign exporters. **********No matter what the problems in implementation, this agreement sets the right precedent for a new American trade policy. It tells Japan that we will assist important industries in international trade; it tells Congress that there are alternatives to protectionism, and it tells American business that if you are dynamic, export-oriented and unfairly attacked, the Government can be an ally."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/01/world/ignored-by-television-aquino-reinvents-pre-video-politics.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1986-02-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "IGNORED BY TELEVISION, AQUINO REINVENTS PRE-VIDEO POLITICS", "print_headline": "IGNORED BY TELEVISION, AQUINO REINVENTS PRE-VIDEO POLITICS", "body_text": " **********On official television, Corazon C. Aquino's presidential campaign goes virtually unnoticed, which only made it all the more remarkable this morning when she was mobbed by tens of thousands of people in this verdant outpost of rice and coconut farms. **********In the United States, the scene would have been a political press agent's dream. The candidate politely went through a day of reeling, tactile adulation of the sort that in America was last seen in the final campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. **********But as usual, barely a few token minutes of television time, the coin of the realm in American politics, were alloted to Mrs. Aquino's campaign on the Government news show. **********In contrast, President Ferdinand E. Marcos was receiving coverage throughout most of the half-hour program. A reporter intoned mock objectivity to describe the President's ''eloquent speech'' that effectively silenced ''slanted reports'' about allegations directed against Mr. Marcos. The allegations were not detailed on the Government-owned station. No Pictures of Arrival **********The official coverage did not include pictures of the vivid sight of Mrs. Aquino's arrival here this morning along the airport road and main street, which were crammed with families, workers, farmers, youngsters crying ''Cory! Cory!'' waving hand-printed signs, reaching to touch her. **********The scene suggested that this island nation, scattered like a green galaxy on the blue Pacific, is able to resist the power of television that fuels American political campaigns. **********For President Marcos gets the lion's share of television politicking, but Mrs. Aquino gets the throngs. Those who turn out to see her are not trucked to stadiums and kept attentive by celebrity entertainers, as the President's partisans often are. **********Aquino officials are trying to embarrass the Government into alloting them more television time. But visitors familiar with the electronic leaps and bounds so predictable now in American politics have to hope nothing ruins the flesh-and-blood quality of Filipino campaigning exemplified in the Aquino phenomenon. **********In the United States, a professional politician might only fanatasize about such a grand entrance as Mrs. Aquino had this morning, rich with the simple human tableaux that lie beyond the wiles of advance men. **********A local entrepreneur had rigged his horse-and-buggy taxi with a dented public address speaker through which he exuberantly screamed ''Cory!'' A few steps beyond, a toothless, gray-haired woman suddenly darted from the mob to jig with joy in the candidate's path. **********Mothers held their infants up as if for a blessing or a glimpse of passing history.

These are weary two-story storefronts that were swarming with people who reached out from windows, rooftops, porches, throwing confetti salvaged from scrap paper, eyeing Cory Aquino. Assassination in Background **********Through some process of social osmosis, the phenomenon of the Aquino candidacy has become a craving among villagers. As with the Kennedy romance, it is steeped in the national tragedy of the assassination of her husband, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., popularly known as Ninoy, in 1983. **********She talks of him at every stop. ''Support this cry of Ninoy for freedom,'' she pleaded to voters here. **********Riding next to Mrs. Aquino in her open car was Marcial Pimentel, a seasoned politician who wondered enviously at her crowd-drawing power. He is a former Foreign Minister to President Marcos who has come across to the opposition camp. **********''Of course Marcos will have to cheat in the election - you see why,'' he contended nonchalantly, nodding at the mass of people. ''But the tide for Cory will be so huge that it would take a month, not just days, for him to shave that many votes.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/business/champlin-chief-gets-new-post.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 150, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Champlin Chief Gets New Post", "print_headline": "Champlin Chief Gets New Post", "body_text": " **********William T.

The impact of plunging oil prices rippled through many other industries as well, dragging down earnings. Many banks, for example, reported lower results in part because of the deteriorating conditions of their energy-related loan portfolios. **********Mixture Within Industries **********Generalizations about other sectors are more difficult because of mixed returns within industries, such as computers and automobiles. The International Business Machines Corporation, for example, reported an 8 percent decline in profits, while the Digital Equipment Corporation posted a 139 percent gain. **********The difference is attributed mainly to Digital's new product line and its cost-cutting program, but it also points to a major theme in the second-quarter results: The economic recovery that began in early 1983 has become more uneven as time goes on. **********As the economy became more sluggish, only the best-positioned companies or industries - those with newer products, lower costs or popular services, for example - were able to show improved earnings. **********''There was uneven growth by sector and within industries,'' said a Stanford University economist, Michael Boskin. ''But profitability will continue to vary until the economy shows a strong general growth.'' **********One of the barriers to that growth, economists say, is the disinflationary environment that has caused prices to be held down, especially in those sectors vulnerable to imports. **********But some economists think that growth may pick up in the second half of this year. John Hagens, an economist with Chase Econometrics, said that corporate revenues will likely increase in the third and fourth quarters because companies will feel less pressure to cut prices to compete with imports as the weaker dollar makes imports more expensive.Tax Changes a Factor **********One of the reasons for the the lackluster showing in second-quarter profits, many believe, is the tax-revision legislation before Congress. The low level of capital spending is attributed by many executives to the ambiguity of what depreciation methods will be allowed under the new tax code. Also, the quarter brought a rash of write-offs, partly attributed to the expected lowering of the corporate tax rate. **********Those areas that turned in the best profit performance in the quarter included building materials and forest products, publishing and communications, financial services and other companies geared to the service sector. The building materials and forest products industries was one sector helped by lower interest rates, as construction of single-family homes continued at a brisk pace. **********Similarly, the financial services sector was helped by strong demand for home mortgages and by an interest rate drop that lowered the cost of funds, and many thrift institutions reported record second-quarter income."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/08/world/around-the-world-small-bomb-is-found-at-bonn-aide-s-home.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 106, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Small Bomb Is Found At Bonn Aide's Home", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Small Bomb Is Found At Bonn Aide's Home", "body_text": " **********A device described as amateurish and ''not highly explosive'' was discovered today outside the home of the chief West German Government spokesman, Friedhelm Ost. **********The police said Mr. Ost's wife, Erika, had found a World War II grenade casing filled with screws, nails, sand and a small firecracker with a fuse in the front yard below the second-floor master bedroom. **********The police said they did not believe the device was placed by the terrorist Red Army Faction because it was so inexpertly put together.

Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d just as the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are getting under way in Washington. **********In his Congressional testimony this week, Mr. Volcker said that he thought the dollar had declined enough and that other policy changes were needed to reduce America's trade deficit. But Mr. Baker, only a few days earlier, had declared that a further decline in the dollar would be needed unless other countries stepped up their economic growth. The Baker statement raised the international temperature. European central bankers, meeting at Gleneagles, Scotland, reportedly warned that, to prevent a further dollar drop, they were prepared to intervene in currency markets. **********Mr. Volcker's interpreters at the Fed are not denying that he was seeking to distance himself from Mr. Baker's position on the dollar and warning the Administration and Congress that monetary policy alone could not solve the trade, growth and debt problems that fiscal policy had created. **********''What we are going to have to do,'' he said, ''is consume less and export more.'' This implies that Japan, West Germany and other European countries need to consume more and export less. **********If the United States refuses to face up to that need, according to Mr. Volcker, it is in for serious trouble. Americans have been living, he said, in a ''false paradise'' - the common phrase is ''fool's paradise'' - with the country living beyond its means and depending on borrowing from abroad to support its standard of living. This imbalance would have to end in facing the painful adjustments of cutting America's budget and trade deficits. ''We have been lucky to get by for five years, but we aren't going to get by much longer,'' he said. **********The action taken by the House of Representatives this week to trim the 1987 budget deficit by $15.1 billion - through a package that includes sales of Federal assets, bookkeeping changes, tighter enforcement of the tax laws and a new customs fee - will do little to disprove the belief of the Europeans and Japanese that neither Congress nor the Administration is ready to attack the budget deficit in a serious and enduring way. **********And the new tax overhaul legislation, though advertised as revenue-neutral, has aroused concerns that it will instead prove to be one more tax cut, with the reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates likely to stick while the intended revenue gains from the closing of loopholes are steadily eroded by lobbies and tax accountants. Charges are flying that once it becomes law, tax rates and revenues will again be raised to close the budget gap. But President Reagan, campaigning for Republican House and Senate candidates, continues to inveigh against any tax increases. **********A significantly tighter United States fiscal policy, which both Mr. Volcker and the foreign finance ministers and central bankers say is crucial for healing America's trade deficit, still looks at least two or three years away - after the 1988 election. **********Significantly, Mr. Volcker's statement that the dollar had fallen far enough did not send it higher. On the contrary, following his testimony, foreign-exchange traders moved the dollar further down. **********Yet Mr. Volcker's realism should help to calm the Europeans. He is by no means at odds with the Administration on the need for the Germans and Japanese to accelerate their growth. Nor, despite his warning to Americans that they must consume less and export more, does he want the United States to slide into recession as a means of solving the trade problem. He is really talking about relative, longer-range shifts in the composition of America's gross national product. **********But his concerns about aggravating the weakness of the dollar have led him to take a different line from the Administration for the time being in delaying another cut in the Fed's discount rate, while keeping pressure on the West German Bundesbank to cut its own rate before a Fed move. **********With the decision of Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, to delay his departure for Washington so he could head a meeting of its central council, it looked as though the West Germans were rethinking their interest-rate policy. A cut in the German discount rate would greatly ease the tensions between Washington and Bonn and do much to improve the atmosphere for the current meetings of the I.M.F. and World Bank. Even more important, it would help stabilize the world economic situation and ease the danger of excessively depressive forces hitting the United States dollar. But the Bundesbank said after its meeting yesterday that its discount rate remained unchanged. **********Nevertheless, the game is not over. The Germans are likely to feel more pressure to lower rates at the meetings in Washington - and not just from the United States. France's Finance Minister, Edouard Balladur, said at a news conference in New York yesterday that he hoped to have ''a better idea in three days'' whether interest rates would be coming down. ''I do not issue public warnings,'' he said. ''I prefer to speak in private.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/world/white-house-crisis-president-won-t-throw-people-wolves-reagan-turns-down-calls.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1238, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "REAGAN TURNS DOWN CALLS TO DISMISS SENIOR OFFICIALS", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS: PRESIDENT WON'T 'THROW PEOPLE TO THE WOLVES'; REAGAN TURNS DOWN CALLS TO DISMISS SENIOR OFFICIALS", "body_text": " **********President Reagan today rejected Republican appeals to oust additional senior officials from his Administration in connection with the diversion of funds from Iran arms sales to the contras. **********Mr. Reagan, at a meeting with 17 Republican Congressional leaders, was urged to remove Donald T.

One Senator quoted the President as responding that it would be unfair ''to throw people to the wolves without adequate cause.'' **********The President announced he would not convene a special session of Congress in a statement late today after first saying that he would delay making a decision. Such a session had been urged by some Republicans in Congress, including the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. **********The White House statement said Mr. Reagan had received assurances from the bipartisan leadership that planned select committees in the House and Senate would proceed ''expeditiously'' with the investigation into the Iran arms sales and diversion of funds to the Nicaragaun insurgents. Reagan Expresses Concern **********Mr. Reagan had expressed concern about the duplication that would come from numerous committees in Congress looking into the secret dealings. **********The White House, in announcing Mr. Reagan's decision, said the President would make sure ''all members of his Administration cooperate with Congress in getting all the facts out and putting this matter behind us.'' **********Mr. Reagan also continued to deny knowledge of the secret scheme to sale American weapons and spare parts to Iran and to divert the profits to Nicaraguan insurgents. At his meeting with Republican Congressional leaders, one of two sessions held today with legislators, the President insisted he was unaware of diversion, Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, said. **********Mr. Domenici said Mr. Reagan had looked at each of the 17 legislators present and had said: ''I knew nothing about it.'' On Removal of Aides **********Mr. Regan, the chief of staff, was in the room when the President was urged to shake-up his staff in the hope of restoring the Administration's credibility and of helping it to focus on other issues, participants said. They said that both Mr. Regan and Mr. Casey were named. **********Mr. Reagan's rejection was the strongest indication to date that he would not order the removal of more aides at this time. **********''The President said it would be unfair in his judgment to throw people to the wolves just because people are demanding it,'' Senator John Chaffee of Rhode Island said. ''He said he had no reason to do it except people were demanding it and that's not an adequate rationale.'' **********Lawmakers said after the meeting that it had featured frank exchanges. One participant, Representative William S. Broomfield of Michigan said the Republican leaders had gotten ''a lot of things off our chest and the President had listened attentively.'' **********Describing the session, Mr. Domenici said there had been suggestions from various Senate and House members ''about various people in the White House going.'' **********''The President continued to take the position that to his knowledge they had done nothing wrong and they would stay there and help him,'' the Senator said. **********Mr. Reagan accepted the resignation of Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter as national security adviser and dismissed Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, a National Security Council official, after Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d first disclosed the secret funding for the Nicaraguan rebels last week. **********Calls for Mr. Regan's ouster have come from some longtime political supporters of Mr. Reagan and from some Republican in Congress, including Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Robert Michel, the House minority leader. They have suggested that the move was needed to restore the Administration's credibility. **********Mr. Regan, who has been chief of staff since February 1985, has said he had no knowledge of the diversion of funds to the rebels. **********One senior White House official said Mr. Regan had told other top aides he had no plans to resign at a staff meeting Thursday. **********Aides to Mr. Reagan said he had rejected the request for a special session after being assured by Democratic leaders at a second meeting today that they would expedite and consolidate the number of Congressional inquiries into the Iranian arms sales and diversion of funds. The Senate had agreed to establish a 13-member panel with two ex-officio members and the House, a 15-member committee to examine the affair when Congress convenes next month. Opposed by Democrats **********Mr. Dole and some other Republican Congressional leaders had urged that the special session be called so that Congress could begin investigating the secret dealings before the Senate shifts to a Democratic majority in January. The move had been opposed by Democratic leaders, including Robert C. Byrd, who will become the new Senate majority leader next month, and Jim Wright, who will become the House Speaker. **********''We don't believe anything worthwhile would be achieved by it,'' Mr. Wright said today. ''Time would be wasted, not saved. '' **********White House officials said Mr. Dole had sought the session, which would have been the first one held since 1948, in a manuever to secure concessions out of Mr. Byrd on the special committee that was established. **********''He concluded that he had gone as far as he could go,'' he said, explaining why the President's announcement had come today. Some Public Bickering **********Republicans and Democrats in Congress displayed other partisan feelings today as they bickered in public. Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, denounced the state's Democratic senator, Ernest F. Hollings, for remarks made earlier this week. **********Mr. Thurmond lashed out at Mr. Hollings for asserting that the President knew more than he was admitting and urged him to come clean. **********''Our citizens do not want to see us run roughshod over people's rights in a zealous pursuit of headlines and political gamesmanship,'' Mr. Thurmond said. **********In other developments, Secretary of Education William J. Bennett attacked those Republicans who, he said, have failed to demonstrate adequate loyalty to President Reagan and have questioned his veracity. He said he was not referring to any Reagan Cabinet members, although some supporters of the President have accused Secretary of State George P. Shultz of disloyalty for publicly criticizing the secret dealing with Iran. 'Loyalty Is a Virtue' **********''Some may agree or disagree with different foreign policy strategies, but for those who have worked closely with the President, who have benefitted from him, who have basked in his glow, they should not be scurrying to the wings and trying to put distance between themselves and the President,'' Mr. Bennett said at an education conference here. ''Loyalty to this good and decent man is a virtue, too.'' **********Meanwhile, Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said Mr. Reagan agreed that mistakes had been made in the implementation of the Iran policy, which Vice President Bush said in a speech Wednesday. Mr. Speakes, however, told the ''CBS Morning News'' that Mr. Reagan still believed that the policy was sound. **********''The President believes his policy approach was the correct one, but there were mistakes made,'' Mr. Speakes said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/world/christian-militias-rivalry-erupts-into-battle-in-beirut.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1986-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 542, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHRISTIAN MILITIAS' RIVALRY ERUPTS INTO BATTLE IN BEIRUT", "print_headline": "CHRISTIAN MILITIAS' RIVALRY ERUPTS INTO BATTLE IN BEIRUT", "body_text": " **********Heavy fighting raged around the capital today between Christian militiamen loyal to President Amin Gemayel and rival Christian forces. **********The gunbattles broke out as Mr. Gemayel flew to Damascus for talks with President Hafez al-Assad on a Syrian-sponsored peace accord that was signed by Moslem and Christian militia leaders last month.

At the time, Mr. Hobeika accused President Gemayel's chief of security of leading the attack on Mr. Shaftari's motorcade on a highway north of here. Mr. Shaftari was unhurt, but an aide was killed when their car was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades. Gemayel's Trip to Damascus **********The fighting erupted during the early hours of the morning shortly before President Gemayel set out for Damascus for his talks with President Assad on the pact which Mr. Hobeika signed Dec. 28 with the leaders of the Shiite Moslem and Druse militias. **********Mr. Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, and several other Christian figures have said the agreement makes too many concessions to the Moslems. Under the accord, the Maronite share of parliamentary seats would be cut from 30 percent to 21 percent to insure equality between the Maronites and the two largest Moslem communities, the Shiites and the Sunnis.

There are shelves of sexual paraphernalia. And there is the pornography industry's fastest-growing offering: racks of video cassettes, with breathless headlines and glossy packaging, that show overdeveloped young people in positions never found in Grey's Anatomy. **********Most important, however, is what you don't see: lots of shoppers. **********Erotica is under siege. In the last few years, at least half of the nation's adult movie theaters have closed down. Playboy Magazine's circulation has tumbled, and its cable television channel is losing subscribers. Its female counterpart, Playgirl Magazine, is reorganizing its finances in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Even sales of X-rated videos, once the industry's best hope, have leveled off. Some 1,600 adult videos will be released this year, down by 100 from 1985, according to Adult Video News, a trade publication. As more video cassette recorders are sold, adult video sales are likely to pick up again, but not to soar - and any gain will probably be at the expense of X-rated magazines. **********The pornography industry's plight is due partly to legal challenges, political pressures and even health concerns; fear of the sexually transmitted disease AIDS is making it more difficult to find actors and actresses. In Los Angeles County, X-rated film producers are being charged with pandering. With a little help from the Reagan Administration, an unlikely alliance of conservatives and feminists has persuaded many retailers to stop carrying adult magazines and videos. The Reagan-appointed Meese Commission, headed by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, has issued a scathing report on pornography. Such pressures ''have had a tremendous effect on sales,'' said Martin W. Turkel, general manager of the Video Company of America, one of the largest distributors of adult videos in the country. **********''Next year is going to be the roughest year in the history of the industry.'' **********But most of all, according to many people both in and out of the industry, the fault lies in the pornography itself. ''X-rated movies are boring,'' said Arthur Morowitz, who formerly made adult movies and now is president of the Video Shack chain of outlets based in New York. ''Generally it's a novelty buy. But it's like peanut butter - a little goes a long way.'' **********Americans have always been ambivalent about pornography. Many have sought to quash it as morally offensive or positively dangerous. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence in the marketplace that it has a large following. Indeed, pornography seems to be an ever-increasing presence on the American scene. Depending on how one defines pornography, the industry has sales somewhere between $2 billion and $10 billion a year. **********At the same time that pornographic material has become widely available, however, the mass media -from perfume advertisements to radio sex counselors - are treating sexuality more frankly. Psychologists suggest that people may be losing their appetite for fruit that is no longer forbidden. ''The initial thrill of seeing any sexual activity excites people once or twice and then gets boring,'' said Helen S. Kaplan, a psychiatrist who heads the human sexuality program at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. As people feel freer to act out their sexual fantasies, she added, they feel less need to indulge in pornography. **********All this is bad news for the makers and merchants of pornography. Reluctantly, most people in the business have written off the prospect of an X-rated video boom and recognize that video production is ripe for consolidation. But the industry continues to believe there is still room for significant growth in certain markets -specifically, women and heterosexual couples - and even for higher-quality videos that offer plots and what are known in Hollywood as production values. **********ONLY a decade ago, X-rated videos looked like the industry's future. The immensely successful movie Deep Throat had been made for $25,000 in 1972, and reportedly grossed more than $50 million. The video revolution seemed to promise even more potential. Initially, almost the only home videos available were pornographic ones. As VCR sales took off in 1980, the industry started counting on new customers -young professionals, middle-aged suburban couples and women - who shunned the often seedy adult movie theaters but might watch X-rated films at home. ''I never liked going to those theaters,'' said Candida Royalle, who starred in about 30 X-rated films and two years ago formed Femme Productions to make adult videos. **********Femme Productions is one of some 85 companies, mostly small, privately held firms in the Los Angeles area, that are now engaged exclusively in producing X-rated videos. **********Some cater to an even smaller audience, with all-male films for homosexual viewers. In some respects, Femme is a typical operation: a low-volume start-up - to date, it has made three videos - that has eked out a small profit. Entry into the X-rated video business is easy, requiring little more than a hand-held camera, a couple of actors and a motel room; the scripts are so minimal that, according to the Meese Commission, some have been used for more than one video. In the last few years, the video companies churned out thousands of low-quality X-rated videos, often spending no more than $5,000 or $10,000 apiece. **********''The market is in absolute chaos,'' said Howard Farber, president of Video-X-Pix, a New York-based manufacturer and distributor of adult videos. ''It's like people running out on the field after a Mets game. **********Too many people have jumped into the business, and the quality is horrendous.'' The result has been a glut of **********X-rated videos at the video retail outlets, which buy both X-rated and mainstream cassettes from producers and rent them to customers. **********The stores, which once paid producers $90 for an adult video, now pay around $40. While customers select theatrical film videos on the basis of word-of-mouth and reviews, they usually choose X-rated videos for their titles and packaging. Thus video stores, with shelves of adult titles, tend to invest instead in the latest Warner Brothers and Paramount releases. Most of the video market's growth has been captured by theatrical films with ratings of R or even PG; adult videos have declined to somewhere between 5 and 15 percent of rentals. And even the most successful adult videos fare modestly; the most popular X-rated videos may sell only 10,000 cassettes to stores. **********But while the X-rated video revolution never materialized, video has left its stamp on the urban landscape -and on the rest of the adult entertainment industry. Adult movie houses, often the linchpin of a scattering of sexual offerings in downtown areas from New York's Times Square (See box) to San Francisco's Tenderloin district, have been badly hurt by the VCR as well as by urban redevelopment. An estimated 300 to 400 adult theaters remain open across the country, down from 800 to 1,200 a half-dozen years ago. Adult bookstores have also closed. **********Magazines have suffered a similar fate. The circulations of Penthouse, Playboy, Gallery, Oui and other mainstream men's magazines have all dropped sharply since 1980, and seem still to be headed down. In July Playboy announced that it was reducing the circulation base it guarantees advertisers to 3.4 million, from 4.1 million, and slashing advertising rates by 17 percent, effective with the November issue. The more sexually explicit Hustler Magazine has declined in circulation, from 1.9 million a decade ago to 800,000 today - and holds on to many of those readers, the magazine concedes, because of its reviews of X-rated videos. Playgirl Magazine got off to a spectacularly successful start in 1973 with photographs of nude men, but circulation since then has fallen 60 percent, to 575,000 last year. **********SOME of the magazines' problems come from Washington. **********In the past 18 months, more than 17,000 stores have stopped carrying sex magazines. About half of those stores succumbed to pressure, including picketing, from an unlikely combination of conservatives and feminists who feel that pornography degrades women. The rest of the stores, including some 4,500 7-Eleven convenience stores owned by the Southland Corporation, fell into line after they got a letter last February from the Meese Commission, warning that they might be named in the panel's report. **********The response of some of the magazines may be a measure of their plight: They are jumping into the beleaguered video business. **********Last year Bob Guccione, the chairman of Penthouse International, started a video subsidiary that so far has produced two cassettes. The first, ''The Girls of Penthouse,'' an hour-long series of soft-core vignettes featuring more nudity than sex, sold well, but at a price too low to make much profit. The second, ''Love Stories,'' was only recently released. But within seven years, Mr. Guccione said, he expects Penthouse films and videos to outearn all of Penthouse's magazines. ''That's the direction the industry has to go: television and video,'' he said. He maintains that video sales will pick up because people will begin to buy, rather than rent, cassettes, and more women and couples will seek X-rated material. **********Playboy Enterprises also is making a major foray into electronics, with its cable television channel and soft-core video cassettes, but with mixed results. It has spent heavily on programming for its cable channel but, as with many pay-cable services, the number of subscribers has fallen: it dropped to 633,000 at the end of June, from 753,000 a year earlier. Playboy's 25 video cassettes, such as ''Farmers' Daughters'' and ''Playboy Video Centerfold,'' have sold well, reaching the top five on the video charts, but they have been priced at a bargain-basement $9.95. **********While profitable even at these prices, margins are very thin. Playboy Enterprises lost $62 million in its 1986 fiscal year, which ended June 30, including a $7.2 million loss in its video division. **********NOR is oversupply video's only problem. For years prosecutors in Los Angeles have occasionally brought charges - generally without much success - against X-rated film makers for ''pandering'' by hiring actors to perform sex acts. **********Recently the statute was toughened to mandate a three-year jail sentence, and last year it was used successfully for the first time, against Harold Freeman, who runs Hollywood Video Productions. He is appealing the conviction and the prosecution is appealing the sentence, which the judge limited to 90 days plus probation and a $10,000 fine. Several more cases are pending, according to John H. Weston, a Beverly Hills lawyer who has many clients in the adult entertainment industry. **********Video, along with print, was denounced in July by the Meese panel, in a 1,960-page report linking pornography to violence and other social ills. **********There is no consensus in the industry, however, about the commission's impact. Adult Video News suggested that retailers display copies of the report so that browsers could read descriptions of some of the videos in stock. ''There will always be controversy surrounding pornography,'' said Paul Fishbein, the trade magazine's president. ''There will always be pornography.'' **********In fact, one trend that comforts the industry these days is the growing interest among women in adult videos. **********A recent survey of 500 retailers found that women rented 32 percent of all X-rated videos, while men rented 37 percent; heterosexual couples rented the balance. Accordingly, X-rated producers are making more ''couples videos'' - embellishing the plot, reducing the number of close-ups, adding foreplay and afterplay to the sex act itself. Some of the couples videos have done very well. Ms. Royalle, the former actress, said that Femme Productions' first video, ''Femme,'' cost $25,000 to make and had sales of $50,000. The second, ''Urban Heat,'' cost $40,000 and is beginning to turn a small profit. In describing her videos, Ms. Royalle uses such words as ''art'' and ''sensitive.'' But for pornography to sell, it has to be X-rated, and she cautioned that ''you don't want to make so much of a story that sex gets pushed to the back.'' Mr. Turkel of the Video Company of America agreed. **********''People still want raunch,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/world/soviet-sees-us-violation.html": {"writer_name": "Serge Schmemann", "pub_date": "1986-03-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 269, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SOVIET SEES U.S. VIOLATION", "print_headline": "SOVIET SEES U.S. VIOLATION", "body_text": " **********The Soviet Government press agency Tass today characterized the American order as an ''unprecedented'' and ''hostile'' move that violated the United States' commitments as the host country for United Nations headquarters. **********Apparently alluding to Washington's charges of espionage among staff members of the Soviet missions, the Government press agency said that the action had been taken ''under farfetched and groundless pretexts.'' **********''It is obviously aimed at further undermining the United Nations, Tass said, adding, ''A whole number of countries have been voicing quite justified doubts about the expediency of having the United Nations' headquarters in the United States.'' **********Alluding to previous United States actions to curb the movements of personnel from Soviet-bloc nations and a number of other countries, Tass said the order was part of a series against ''socialist states and developing countries whose policies do not suit the White House.'' **********It recalled that Washington had already limited the movements of United Nations employees from the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iran, Cuba and Libya to a 25-mile radius of Manhattan. **********As of Jan. 6, the United States also restricted the movements of diplomats or United Nations staff members from East Germany, Poland, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia. **********The Soviet Government press agency said: ''The United States, seeking to force changes in United Nations policy to meet Washington's interests, is not stopping short of crude pressure and blackmail or shrinking from direct violations of its international commitments in a bid to work up an atmosphere around the United Nations that hinders the work of this authoritative international forum.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/21/business/company-news-bank-board-clears-aid-for-talman.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bank Board Clears Aid for Talman", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Bank Board Clears Aid for Talman", "body_text": " **********The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it cleared the way for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to contribute $150 million to Talman Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of Chicago and to forgive $71 million of income capital certificates, in the event Talman converts from a mutual thrift to a stock institution.

In late September the Dow Jones industrial average dipped below 1,300 and then went on to finish the year at 1,546.67.

Japan accounted for $348 million of this figure, while the Middle East oil producing countries purchased $316 million. **********Net purchases of foreign stocks by United States investors also set a new high of $2.1 billion, surpassing the former record of $1.9 billion for the final quarter of last year.

Setting Targets for the Dow **********As the Dow closed yesterday at 1,885.05, or just shy of a new high, Laszlo Birinyi of Salomon Brothers kept his eyes fixed on a considerably loftier goal. **********The equity market analyst has set a goal of 2,073.02 for the blue-chip barometer. What's his target date for such a precise benchmark? ''I never set time frames,'' he said. **********Nonetheless, his predictive record in the past has stood the test of time quite handsomely. On Dec. 13 of last year, when the industrial average closed at 1,535.2l, he announced a goal of 1,600. **********When the Dow moved past that mark in early February, Mr. Laszlo set a new target of 1,696. At the time the Dow stood at 1,613.42. **********About two weeks later - the average was climbing much faster at that stage of the bull market -his moving target was reached again. Thereupon Mr. Laszlo established a new goal of 1,800.22. On March 20 the Dow swept past this figure to close at 1,804.24. **********On the following day, the Salomon analyst established his present goal of 2,073.02. **********Just how did he arrive at this figure? ''The strongest postwar rally began in September 1953 and ended in September 1955 when President Eisenhower's heart attack sent the Dow down by 31.89 points, or 6.54 percent, in one day,'' the analyst said. ''That two-year rally saw the industrial average climb 90.79 percent.'' **********The last major correction for the stock market -a pullback amounting to 15.59 percent - ended on July 24, 1984, with the Dow at 1,086.55. In arriving at his present goal, Mr. Birinyi applied a similar 90.79 percent increase to a base of 1,086.55. **********Of course, he cannot guarantee that the Dow will reach 2,073.02. But he said, ''Our view remains positive, and our previously stated goal remains intact.'' **********By analyzing actual transactions of market participants, the analyst noted, ''We know what investors are doing - not what might develop.'' The most critical element reinforcing his positive view is that institutional selling pressure has not developed on days when the market fell. Such declines, he added, ''have been more a function of buyers pulling back.'' **********Mr. Birinyi regards money flows within the industrial average as the market's most critical indicator. During the current bull market, he said, this indicator basically has shown accumulation of stocks by investors.

He noted that sudden fare wars and declines in travel were quickly reflected in the earnings of airlines, while hotels often could better withstand such shocks. Mathew P.

It was no coincidence, for example, that there had not been a companywide strike at Lehigh since 1964 - and that one lasted only a week. **********But the good feeling began to sour in May 1983, a year before the union contract expired, when the company asked its employees to forgo an already negotiated wage increase, amounting to about 35 cents an hour.

A second, including the brothers' share of a landmark office tower here and valuable land north of the city, is scheduled for next Tuesday in Texas. **********Edwin A. McCabe, a lawyer for the Hunts, said it was ''unlikely we will do nothing'' before the first foreclosure proceeding on Friday. But he said a decision on filing for bankrutcy was not likely today. 'The Cheapest Way' **********A Dallas investment banker, who asked not to be named, said that a filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code, which permits a company to reorganize its debts under court protection from creditors, ''would be the cheapest way for the Hunts to forestall'' the foreclosures. **********First, however, the Hunts could appeal today's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans. **********One lawyer for the banks, who asked not to be named, said he expected that the Hunts would decide to ''continue litigation in one or more courts.'' **********In a statement, a spokesman for Penrod and Placid said, ''Nothing the court has done changes our determination to prosecute vigorously our lawsuits and the larger issues they present.'' He added, ''In the meantime, we do not intend to let the banks dismantle Penrod and Placid.'' **********The Hunt brothers, Nelson Bunker, W. Herbert and Lamar, sued 23 banks in June, accusing them of failing to negotiate fairly to extend the payment terms on a total of $1.5 billion in loans to Penrod and Placid. **********Both companies have been badly hurt by the decline in oil prices and drilling activity. The banks, seeking full repayment of the loans, initiated the steps toward foreclosure on six assets owned individually by Hunt family trusts earlier this month. **********In his strongly worded ruling, Federal District Judge Harold Barefoot Sanders rejected arguments by the Hunts' lawyers that the operations of both Penrod and Placid would be irreparably damaged by the foreclosures. Judge Sanders wrote that foreclosures typically occur when markets are depressed and are ''usually most needed by lenders.'' He added that it was unclear whether the Hunts would suffer more if the foreclosures took place than the banks would if they did not. 'Difficult Hurdles' **********On the broader questions raised by the Hunts in their suits against their lenders, Judge Sanders wrote that the Hunts ''face difficult hurdles.'' He added that he could not determine ''at this early stage'' whether the Hunts would succeed. **********Mr. McCabe acknowledged that Judge Sanders's ruling against delaying the foreclosures was a setback, but he termed it a minor one. He noted that the judge made it clear that the Hunts could sue the banks for damages resulting from foreclosures if they won the broader lawsuits. **********''It was a very narrow decision, a cautious one at the very early stages in what will obviously be a long and very complex case,'' he said. **********Lawyers for the 23 banks declined to comment on Judge Sanders' ruling. **********Stephen Gordon, who argued the Hunts' case along with Mr. McCabe, said the foreclosures were merely the first of several that would be sought by the banks, a point that lawyers for the banks did not dispute. **********David R. McAtee, one of the banks' lawyers, told Judge Sanders during the court session that the Hunts' attempt to block the foreclosure was simply an effort to avoid the embarrassment of a Chapter 11 filing. 'Would Welcome' a Filing **********''They are saying, 'We don't want to do what other people do when they can't pay their debts,' '' Mr. McAtee said. He indicated that the banks would welcome a Chapter 11 filing, compared with a waiver of foreclosure sales, because the banks then would have some control over how the Hunts managed the cash flow at Penrod and Placid and prepared a plan to repay their debts. **********Mr. McAtee said the banks had been more than conciliatory in rescheduling payments on the loans, which were originally set in an agreement signed by the Hunts in 1984.

While it is devoted to improving the quality of medical care, education and the profession, it also operates as a cartel to protect the economic interests of its members. Although the A.M.A.'s recent report on physician manpower reflects both personalities, the cartel strain is dominant. The report's assertion of a physician surplus and its recommendation that the surplus be eliminated by curtailing medical school enrollment are a blueprint for anticompetitive action. **********On the central and difficult question of whether a surplus actually exists, the report is shaky at best. This judgement is particularly complex given the extensive government regulation and subsidies that affect physician supply. Even after conducting ''an extensive review of the data and literature,'' the A.M.A. acknowledges that the studies produce ''little consensus about the adequacy of physician supply'' and that an acceptable measurement standard does not exist. Thus, the report states that policy makers must base their conclusions on ''perceptions and professional judgment,'' implying that the A.M.A. knows what supply of physicians best serves society. **********Another flaw is the recommendation that the medical education system ''establish appropriate medical school enrollment.'' Assuming one could determine that a physician surplus exists, it does not follow that the appropriate remedy is to limit medical school enrollment. Such a solution implies that society is better served by excluding new physicians rather than existing ones. Arguably, given advances in medical education, the opposite may be true. **********Moreover, the recommendation that our ''future needs for additional physicians will be more than satisfied through the U.S. medical education system'' unfairly lumps all foreign medical education into the same dismal category. One does not have to read Doonesbury to know about the low quality of some foreign medical schools. However, other countries have high quality medical education. Imagine if American auto makers announced that our ''need'' should be fully satisfied by American cars. **********In addition, the A.M.A. ignores the economic reality that physician supply is influenced by the demand for medical education. This demand is determined by the students' expected benefits (income and non-monetary) as physicians and the costs (tuition and others) of becoming a physician. For some years, prospective students have anticipated a high income as a result of their educational investment, and medical school tuition has been priced well below the cost of educating students. Both these factors have produced a shortage of spaces in medical schools relative to the demand by quality students. The response has been a substantial American student demand for foreign medical education. **********Rather than confronting the true determinants of physician supply, the A.M.A., like a classic cartel, proposes to restrict supply artificially by controlling medical school enrollment and slowing the flow of foreign-trained physicians. However, excessive demand for medical education will persist as long as its value to prospective physicians exceeds what it costs them. I am not advocating that medical schools auction off spaces to the highest bidder. We should insure that all groups have access to medical school. **********The report's conclusion that a surplus of physicians ''is likely to have negative consequences on the quality and cost of patient care'' is puzzling. Apparently, the A.M.A. believes that if doctors are too plentiful they will not perform medical procedures often enough to maintain the needed skill level. While possessing some merit, this position is overbroad. **********The connection between physician surpluses and a pervasive reduction in quality is unproven. Moreover, it seems more appropriate to encourage physicians who have not performed procedures with sufficient frequency to refer patients to other physicians and to discipline incompetent performance. More generally, the A.M.A. should focus on policing the conduct of existing physicians rather than restricting new entry. **********Further, the report makes the dubious assertion that an oversupply will produce a greater tendency for specialists to provide primary care at a higher cost than generalists. But an increase in physicians should lower costs by creating greater competition among both physicians and delivery systems. Specialists could raise prices only if they had monopoly power or if patients or third parties paid whatever price the specialist charged. Given the widespread adoption of cost containment and alternative delivery mechanisms such as health maintenance organizations, these assumptions seem unrealistic. **********Just as dubious is the argument (not made by the A.M.A.) that a surplus would cause physicians to perform unnecessary procedures to maintain income. This problem is most likely when services are rendered under a retrospective cost-reimbursement system that lacks any controls to monitor overutilization. Once again, the increased use of controls, cost-containment measures and incentive-based systems substantially reduce this problem. **********To its credit, the report's recommendations dealing with insuring high quality medical education and improving the distribution of physicians reflect the positive strain of the A.M.A.'s personality. Unfortunately, the report's cartel-like preoccupation with restricting physician supply overwhelms the salutary aspects."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/world/greek-socialists-defeated-in-3-big-cities.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1986-10-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 662, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "GREEK SOCIALISTS DEFEATED IN 3 BIG CITIES", "print_headline": "GREEK SOCIALISTS DEFEATED IN 3 BIG CITIES", "body_text": " **********The Socialist Party of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou suffered a painful defeat Sunday as conservative challengers ousted the Socialist mayors of three of Greece's four largest cities in runoff municipal elections. **********In a statement congratulating the winners, Mr. Papandreou acknowledged the importance of the results but said he would not change his policies. **********The result was the first major setback for the Socialists since they gained power in 1981, but it does not immediately threaten their hold over the national Government. They control Parliament by a 160-to-110 margin over the conservative New Democracy Party, the main opposition. **********National parliamentary elections are due in 1989, but political analysts believe New Democracy is likely to urge early elections. **********In Athens, Salonika and Piraeus, the New Democracy candidates claimed victory shortly after midnight, when counting neared completion.

Traditionally, the parties of the left back the top Socialist or Communist candidate in runoff elections. **********The Communists' Central Committee singled out Athens only in urging members to withhold their votes from Mayor Dimitris Beis, the Socialist. It urged Communists to support Socialist candidates elsewhere. **********Left-wing opposition to Mr. Papandreou's policies was clearly strong enough to overcome this injunction. Enough Communist or left-wing Socialist voters appeared to have cast blank ballots to turn the conservative plurality of last Sunday into a majority. **********In the largest cities, an exceptionally high proportion of more than one-quarter of the voters cast blank ballots. Abstention is illegal in Greece. **********The conservative victory was biggest in Athens, where Mr. Evert, a member of Parliament and former Finance Minister, won 54.5 percent of the vote, as against 45.5 percent for Mayor Beis, who was seeking a third term. **********In Salonika, New Democracy's candidate, Sotiris Kouvelas, led with 52.8 percent. In Piraeus, a traditional left-wing stronghold, the conservative, Andreas Andrianopoulos, held 50.8 percent.

Marcos to holdings around the world, according to Philippine officials and private consultants to the Government. **********Steven Psinakis, an adviser to the Philippine commission investigating Mr. Marcos's wealth, said today that a raid Friday night at Manila offices used by Imee Marcos, the daughter of the former President, turned up ''many valuable documents which confirm that others are holding properties for Marcos.'' **********Even as the search for information about the Marcos wealth was being pressed, officials acknowledged they still face a long and difficult process in trying to recover any of the holdings. **********After the new Philippine Government finds holdings of the Marcos family, it must still show that they were acquired illegally by misuse of Government funds or violation of Philippine law, according to Michael Ratner, a lawyer in New York representing the Manila Government, as well as other lawyers and Philippine officials. **********Task of 'Tracing the Money' **********''Actually tracing the money from the Philippines to various properties is clearly the issue,'' Mr. Ratner said. **********Bonifacio H. Gillego, an official in New York of the Philippine commission set up to recover Mr. Marcos's ''hidden wealth,'' said: ''I see the enormity of the task. It will take a long, long time and will be very difficult.'' **********Mr. Psinakis said Philippine officials were looking at a $30 million loan in 1981 from the Central Bank of the Philippines to an associate of Mr. Marcos, which they say may have figured in the purchase of the Crown Building in New York City, one of the holdings identified in Congressional hearings as being held by the Marcos family. **********The head of the Philippine commission, Jovito R. Salonga, is due in New York next week with newly found documents that are said to tie Mr. Marcos to real estate holdings there. The Manila Government is engaged in a legal battle in New York State Supreme Court over the properties. **********Mr. Psinakis said the documents seized in the raid were contained in a real estate office building in Manila that had been used by Imee Marcos in the recent presidential campaign. Among the documents were papers showing that Roland C. Gapud, a Manila banker, was acting on behalf of Mr. Marcos in several business deals, according to Mr. Psinakis. **********Real estate documents in the United States show that Mr. Gapud and his group were the real owners of four New York City properties worth more than $300 million. **********The documents seized in Manila, according to Mr. Psinakis, also link Mr. Marcos to Jose Y. Campos, a Manila businessman who owns millions of dollars of real estate in the Western United States, according to documents. **********To help overcome the various legal and investigative problems, Manila is seeking political solutions, including action by Congress and the Administration. **********In addition, according to American tax attorneys and former Treasury officials, a tax treaty between the United States and the Philippines that calls for information sharing may allow Manila to obtain documents from Washington. **********Under the treaty, an official agency in either country, such as the United States Justice Department, can request documents and testimony as part of a criminal tax investigation. Copies of Mr. Marcos's tax returns left behind in Manila show he reported minimal income, and Philippine officials said they expected to pursue a criminal tax investigation against him. **********A former Treasury official familiar with the treaty said it called for the United States to supply the information if was in the interests of the Philippine Government. Can't Use Federal Courts **********Under American court procedures, the Federal courts cannot be used to recover property or assets if an alien is involved. Both Mr. Marcos and the Philippine Government would be considered aliens. **********But Mr. Ratner said Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, was introducing a bill that would allow the Federal courts to be used in cases like the one involving Mr. Marcos. The chances for passage of such a bill are not clear. **********There are few precedents for recovering the wealth of former national leaders. The Iranian Government was unsuccessful in its suits against the former Shah in New York State court as well as courts in Switzerland. But lawyers familiar with those cases say Iran's unpopularity and disorganized Government contributed to the failure. Offshore Companies Used **********According to Mr. Gillego and other commission officials, Manila is seeking to hire investigators familiar with the use of offshore corporations and secret bank accounts. Documents recently discovered in Manila as well as evidence produced in hearings by a Congressional subcommittee headed by Mr. Solarz are said to show that Mr. Marcos and his associates have used offshore companies, trusts and bank accounts in their financial transactions. Many of those entities are based in such countries as Panama, Switzerland and Hong Kong, which have strict secrecy laws. **********Faced with such obstacles, Philippine officials are using a variety of political tactics. Mr. Solarz, in addition to offering possible jurisdiction legislation, has talked with Philippine officials about trying to gain access to documents in Hawaii brought by in Mr. Marcos and his party after they fled Manila last month. **********The documents, now under the custody of the United States Customs Service at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii, contain valuable clues to unraveling Mr. Marcos's wealth, including the names of companies used to hold assets, according to an Administration official familiar with the documents. **********According to Mr. Ratner, top Philippine officials are asking the United States, through diplomatic channels, to provide certified copies of the documents. So far, however, the United States has only talked about providing an inventory of the material and is preparing to let a Federal court decide who should ultimately obtain it. **********Mr. Ratner said trying to gain access to the documents through litigation would take at least two years and was an unsatisfactory option for his client."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/world/european-trip-cancellations-growing-after-raid-on-libya.html": {"writer_name": "George James", "pub_date": "1986-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 844, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EUROPEAN TRIP CANCELLATIONS GROWING AFTER RAID ON LIBYA", "print_headline": "EUROPEAN TRIP CANCELLATIONS GROWING AFTER RAID ON LIBYA", "body_text": " **********Officials in the travel industry across the country yesterday reported a surge in cancellations by travelers to Europe in the two days since the American bombing raids against Libya. **********''I would put it in the category of devastating,'' said one New York travel agent, Hal Green, president of the MacPherson Travel Bureau, when asked what effect the air raids and fear of reprisal by terrorists were having on flights to Europe. **********''It's understandable, because people are apprehensive at the moment,'' said Mr. Green, who estimated cancellations by pleasure travelers at 90 percent. **********Some agents in Philadelphia, Detroit, Miami and Chicago said sales had declined between 20 to 80 percent.

''I just helped a woman today who canceled a summer trip to Europe and who is now booked for California.'' **********During what is considered in the travel industry the critical period for summer vacation planning and bookings, many people have been calling airlines, airports and travel agencies to express fear for their safety and to seek reassurance about security arrangements. **********Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration said yesterday that it had imposed special new security requirements on United States airlines operating to foreign countries. Extra Vigilance Urged **********In addition, the agency called on all the nation's airlines and airport authorities to be ''extra vigilant'' as a result of the American air attacks in Libya, according to a spokesman, Fred Farrar. **********The warning was issued Tuesday, just hours after completion of the air assault. **********The F.A.A. said details of the new security measures were being kept secret ''for obvious reasons.'' **********Government sources said they were ''significant and sweeping.'' They added they would probably have been issued even if there had been no Libyan bombing because of the surge of terrorist incidents in recent months. **********Even business travelers, who constitute a major segment of international travel, have voiced their concern, although there does not appear to have been any decline in business travel abroad. **********And for some travel agents, like Mr. Green, business travel in the last two days has actually increased. Called to Foreign Offices **********''We've had a fair number of our international accounts being called over by parent companies to see what is happening to foreign subsidiaries because of all of this,'' he said. **********Many people have altered their plans to avoid certain European countries -such as Italy, Greece, and to a lesser degree, France, Britain and West Germany - and rebooked to other sites. **********A pattern that has been developing over the last few months has been increased travel within the United States and to countries and regions considered more safe. These include Canada, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, Scandinavia, the Caribbean and the Far East. **********Some travel officials saying that cancellations had been minimal, took a cautious ''wait and see'' attitude. 'Too Premature' to Tell **********Speaking for many of these officials, Donald McSullivan, chairman of the North American Committee of the European Travel Commission, a promotional agency consisting of 23 European national tourist offices, said it was ''too premature'' to evaluate the aftereffects of the raid Monday. **********''Certain tour operators, depending on the types of business they're involved in and the countries they serve, are substantially down in their business,'' Mr. McSullivan said of tourism in recent months. ''Others are suffering, but to a much lesser extent.'' **********A sense of increasing anxiety over terrorist acts since the hijacking of a Trans World Airlines flight out of Athens last June, punctuated by the raid on Libya, took many forms across America yesterday. **********In the Detroit area, Linda Davney, manager of the Birmingham, Mich., office of Elliott Travel said she returned Tuesday from a five-day trip to Germany, Switzerland and Austria where the mood was ''very tense.'' Security Called Tight **********She flew on an American airline where security was the tightest she has ever seen, she said. Bookings have been down 80 percent in the weeks since United States military maneuvers over the Gulf of Sidra. ''With Qaddafi saying he had people even in the United States, people aren't crazy about getting on an airplane,'' she said. **********Bookings in Miami were called slow to nonexistent. ''People are not even taking advantage of the $150 trip discount a number of airlines offered,'' said Eva Swift, owner of Sunset Travel. And at least three travel agencies in Houston were deluged with calls by prospective clients, some of whom were canceling flights even though they face penalties of $75 to $100. **********One Houston travel agent was advising clients to use ''low-profile'' European airports and airlines rather than the major airports and escorted American tour flights."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/business/briefs-993686.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 100, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " **********Debt American Telephone and Telegraph Co. is calling for redemption of $600 million of 10 3/8 percent, 10-year notes with a maturity in 1990. *********** Apache Corp. has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $50 million of convertible subordinated debentures due 2006 through Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. *********** Citicorp is issuing in the Euromarket approximatetly $300 million of 12-year floating-rate notes through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.

Like 90 percent of their fellow officers, they are Protestants. **********Gary Gracey, who is 23 years old, has twice been blown off his feet by bomb explosions, which have left him with what may turn out to be a permanent hearing impairment. His brother Nigel, five years older, has been shot at four times by the underground Irish Republican Army. Ronnie, the eldest at 36, has not only been shot at but badly beaten on two occasions in pitched battles between the police and supporters of the nationalist cause in Roman Catholic ghettos. **********So the Graceys are used to the idea that they are targets. But when marauders turned the living room of the family home into a tinderbox one night last month by dousing it with gasoline and hurling in a crude fire bomb, the Graceys lost more than a home and its furnishings. They lost their bearings in the conflict that conditions every aspect of their working lives, for they knew at once that the attackers were Protestants, not Roman Catholics. Family Faces the Unexpected **********''You could expect this sort of thing from republicans but not so-called loyalists,'' Nigel Gracey said, using the political euphemisms by which the sectarian factions are usually identified. **********The Royal Ulster Constabulary became a target for Protestant wrath on the day a little more than six months ago that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed a treaty with the Irish Republic giving Dublin a deliberately vague and ambiguous consultative role in governing the province. **********The Protestant loyalists, also known as unionists, instantly expressed their loyalty to the British crown and the idea of Northern Ireland's indissoluble union with Britain, in what might seem to be a self-contradictory manner, by calling for boycotts of British institutions and assailing British officials. **********The more they lashed out in frustration, the more they found themselves in conflict with the Royal Ulster Constabulary, whose members, as private citizens, were overwhelmingly sympathetic to their cause. The Rev. Ian Paisley and James Molyneaux, the leaders of the two main Protestant parties, bought newspaper advertising space in early March for an open letter to the police, telling them the British-Irish Agreement meant they were now being directed by ''a foreign power,'' one that, the letter said, ''still harbors the murderers of so many of your gallant colleagues.'' **********The letter was intended as a blow against the agreement, not an incitement to attacks on the police, but senior police officials appear to feel that it had that effect. In less than three months, there were 361 attacks on the homes and families of members of the force, which has 11,000 full-time officers and 2,000 reservists. **********Sixty-six of these families concluded it was no longer safe for them to go on living in their Protestant enclaves, just as the minority of Catholic officers long ago had to conclude that it was unsafe for them to live in Catholic areas. **********Most Protestant political and church leaders, including Mr. Paisley and Mr. Molyneaux, condemned the attacks. One who stopped short of outright condemnation was Peter Robinson, a member of Parliament from Mr. Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party who is now widely portrayed as having taken his mentor's mantle as the most unyielding Protestant politician in the province. **********''It will be a very sad development,'' Mr. Robinson commented in an interview, ''if we end up having the police force as a third community living in its own protected police estates.'' That would be the result, he seemed to be suggesting, if the British-Irish Agreement were not shelved. **********Protestant constables who conclude that their families are at risk in working-class Protestant areas tend to take refuge by heading upscale into middle-class suburbs where Catholics and Protestants still manage to withstand the sectarian apartheid that now relentlessly defines embattled inner-city sections. In a small way, such forced moves underscore the message that the British and Irish Governments are seeking to convey through their agreement, that cooperation is the only way out of their bitter impasse. **********The attacks on the police reached a zenith in April after street violence in Portadown in which a young Protestant was killed by a plastic bullet fired from a police riot gun. They have since tapered off but never quite ended. **********According to an officer of the Police Federation, the union that speaks for Northern Ireland's constables, the ordinary officer lives now with the grim conviction that the attacks will again reach epidemic proportions in the summer, the season when loyalist movements take to the streets to march under their traditional banners. **********The question of whether the attacks were organized or orchestrated is answered ambiguously by Andy Tyrie, the head of the Ulster Defense Association, the largest of the Protestant paramilitary groups. **********''I'd be telling lies if I said members of our organization hadn't anything to do with it,'' said Mr. Tyrie, who conceded that the police have no choice as to how they carry out their duties. ''Their only choice is to resign, and I wouldn't ask them to resign,'' he said. 'Nothing But Criminals' **********At the same time, Mr. Tyrie thought the attacks conveyed an important message to the police. Putting it into words, he said, ''We find it very difficult to see you beating up loyalists and then coming back in the evenings to our communities.'' **********''A lot of these people calling themselves loyalists are really nothing but criminals,'' Constable Nigel Gracey reflected as he stood in the burned-out living room of his father's home. As serving officers, the Gracey brothers dutifully declined to discuss their views of the agreement. But their father, who retired from the force 22 years ago, felt no such constraint. **********''I'm a member of the Orange Order and the Black Institution,'' Fred Gracey said, naming two die-hard Protestant groups, ''and I believe our identity is threatened.'' At the same time, he was quick to point out that Catholic neighbors helped to extinguish a fire that was so intense that it melted the clock on the kitchen wall. The Catholic neighbors, he said, now felt impelled to move out of the public housing development here in Lisburn, a bedroom community south of Belfast, figuring that they could not be safe where police families were threatened. **********Fred Gracey told the story as if it were the unraveling of a curse, mentioning the gruesome murder and dismemberment some 15 years ago of a Protestant neighbor who strayed into a Catholic area and whose fatherless sons then became fodder for lawless Protestant groups, the sort that could have been responsible for the attack on his home. **********''It's not over yet,'' Gary Gracey said.

The preliminary pricing for the stock, with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. acting as lead underwriter, is between $17 and $20 a share. **********The principal product of MAI Basic Four, which is based in Tustin, Calif., is a multi-user computer system that allows a group of people to share the same computer. The company's primary customers are small to medium-sized businesses in such specific fields as retailing and health care, and it has an installed base of about 30,000 systems. **********''Analysts are generally positive about the company's management and large customer base but are unsure about the company's ability to attract future customers,'' according to the latest issue of Going Public: The IPO Reporter. This publication monitors new issues. **********In San Francisco, Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, said yesterday that MAI Basic Four had ''reasonably good prospects ahead of it and could grow at 15 to 20 percent a year.'' As for the terms of the new offering, he added that ''it seems pretty fairly priced.'' **********The company was a division of Management Assistance Inc. until January 1985, when it was acquired in a leveraged buyout. For the 12 months ended March 31, it showed revenues of $266.1 million and earnings of $1.08 a share, based on the 10.5 million shares outstanding at that time. **********One industry observer, however, said yesterday that he was ''unimpressed'' by the potential of MAI Basic Four compared with that of other seasoned computer companies. ''Revenue multiples are more important than earnings multiples for comparison purposes in the new issue market,'' said Richard A. Shaffer, publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter, a newsletter on emerging companies in the computer industry. ''Although MAI Basic Four technically qualifies as a new issue, frankly I regard it more as a refurbished old company with known products.'' **********''However that may be,'' he added, ''when this company goes public it will be trading at one or more times trailing 12-month revenues, while such companies as Compac Computer, Wang Laboratories and Data General are selling at less than one times trailing revenues.'' **********And while the new-issue market is booming again, high-technology deals - after going through a boom-and-bust cycle three years ago - have generally taken a back seat this time around to such other favored sectors as brokerage firms, biotechnology enterprises and closed-end investment companies that invest in foreign countries. **********In 1986's first five months, $6.1 billion has been raised in initial public offerings. This is a record amount for any similar period. For a full year, the record of $12.5 billion raised in new issues belongs to 1983, when high-technology offerings accounted for nearly one-third of the volume. **********So far this year, some new issues in the high-technology field have moved to premiums above their offering price in the aftermarket, while others are trading at close to their initial price to the public. **********One standout in terms of performance has been the Microsoft Corporation, a leader in the personal computer-software industry. It went public in March at $21 and subsequently traded as high as $35.50. Yesterday, in the over-the-counter market, the stock was unchanged at $32.75. **********During May, new-issue volume amounted to $2.6 billion. That figure included the biggest initial public stock offering in the American securities market. Investors snapped up $1.2 billion worth of stock in the Henley Group Inc., a collection of 38 diverse companies spun off by Allied-Signal Inc. The offering price was $21.25 a share. The stock rose 75 cents yesterday, to $20. **********Among this year's offerings, the hottest new issue has been Home Shopping Network Inc., a specialty retailer that markets consumer products by means of viewer-participation, televised sales programs that are broadcast live over its own networks. **********Originally, Home Shopping planned to go public at around $14 to $16 a share. In response to demand, the offering was enlarged last month to 2 million shares from 1.3 million shares and the initial price was set at $18. The first trade after the offering was at $42. On the American Stock Exchange, Home Shopping rose $3.375 yesterday, to $71.875. Also yesterday, the company reported that earnings for the quarter ended May 31 jumped to 36 cents a share from 1 cent a share in the corresponding period a year earlier."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/business/continuing-problems-for-copper.html": {"writer_name": "Jonathan Hicks", "pub_date": "1986-07-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1189, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CONTINUING PROBLEMS FOR COPPER", "print_headline": "CONTINUING PROBLEMS FOR COPPER", "body_text": " **********Although tentative labor agreements at some copper companies last week eased fears of a strike this summer, the nation's troubled copper companies continue to face a number of problems that analysts and experts say will keep the industry in the doldrums for some time. **********A worldwide oversupply of copper persists, continuing to keep prices depressed in spite of the nation's economic recovery. The major exporting countries also continue to churn out huge amounts of copper to help pay their debts. And these major producers -Chile, Peru, the Philippines, Zaire and Zambia - have labor costs that are dramatically lower than those of United States companies and operate on land that has an ore grade that is considered better and less expensive to mine. **********''The outlook for copper mining companies in this country is grim,'' said Thomas D. Kaufmann, a professor of mineral economics at the Colorado School of Mines. ''The South American countries have a great advantage in that they have lower production costs and they have a much better quality of ore.'' Rich Ore From Mines **********Mr. Kaufmann noted that many South American countries mine ore that is 3 percent to 4 percent copper, compared with less than 1 percent in many mines in the United States. ''That means that the costs to produce copper in this country are far higher,'' he said. **********Copper producers acknowledged that prices have remained low, but insisted that the outlook for the industry was somewhat brighter than the forecasts offered by many analysts. They have made considerable progress in cutting their production costs, they said, and recent wage concessions would help reduce costs further. They also predicted that demand would rise as new uses for copper develop - although not to historical peak levels. **********''Prices are still depressed, yet world inventories of copper are at their lowest point in some time,'' said Richard W. Pendleton, senior vice president of the Phelps Dodge Corporation. ''That's a good sign.'' Phelps Dodge would not disclose its production costs, but the company said it had cut its copper-making expenses by 33 percent since 1981, while producing 20 percent more copper. **********''Our optimism is based on our belief that we are getting our costs reduced to the point that our production will be efficient no matter what happens with prices,'' Mr. Pendleton said. Only Two Profitable **********Phelps Dodge is one of only two copper producers to make a profit in the first quarter of this year, and analysts predict that it and the Newmont Mining Corporation will be the only profitable companies in the industry this year. **********''This year, I think that copper companies will find profitability a little hard to come by,'' said Robert L. Decker, a copper analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago who predicted that price increases were going to be more difficult to come by in the future. **********Copper is now selling for about 66 cents a pound, roughly the same level as about a year ago. ''I don't think we're ever going to see copper prices that were common during the early 1970's, when it was selling for $1.10 to $1.30 a pound,'' he said. **********According to the Colorado School of Mines, about 10 percent of the United States copper demand is from the automobile industry, and electrical and telecommunications uses account for more than 50 percent. The extent to which those figures will change in the future is hotly debated. **********As fiber optics are used to replace copper wiring in the telecommunications industry and aluminum is used increasingly to replace copper parts in cars, Mr. Decker and others believe that copper consumption will continue to decline - a view not shared by the copper producers. **********According to the Copper Development Association, an engineering- and marketing-development organization for the copper industry based in Greenwich, Conn., the amount of copper used in each newly assembled car increased to 48.3 pounds in 1985, from 36 pounds in 1980. Figures at Odds **********But the association's figures are dramatically at odds with those of car makers. For example, the Ford Motor Company said its use of both copper and brass amounted to 25 pounds a car in 1985 and said that figure would fall to 24 pounds this year and drop further to 22 pounds in 1987. Ford said that it would phase out the use of copper in its car radiators, for instance, by 1988. ''We conducted some studies and determined that aluminum is more reliable and more lightweight,'' said William C. Selover, a Ford spokesman. ''The use of copper and brass in our cars is definitely diminishing.'' **********Copper industry officials, however, contended that while the use of copper in automobile radiators has declined in the last five years, the reduction has been more than offset by increased use of copper wiring in the electrical systems of cars. **********Harold Jackson, a spokesman for the the General Motors Corporation, said that the increased use of copper in the electrical wiring of cars had increased modestly in recent years, but ''it has only partially offset the reduced use of copper in radiators.'' He added: ''The net result is that the use of copper in our cars has declined and that decline is accelerating.'' **********Still, George M. Hartley, the president of the Copper Development Association, insists that ''cars are now being built with much more electrical wiring because of an increase in electrical controls. So a decline in the use of copper in radiators has not affected the overall use of copper in automobiles.'' **********While Mr. Hartley acknowledged that ''copper use has been repeatedly squeezed by fiber optics,'' he added that the growing use of copper in residential and commercial fire sprinkler systems and in roofing material constituted ''red-hot markets for the copper industry.'' ----Kennecott Vote Set SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., July 6 (AP) - Copper workers at the Kennecott Corporation were to vote Monday on a new contract that would recall laid-off workers but slash wages and benefits, after about 1,650 copper workers at Asarco Inc. agreed to 20 percent wage cuts over three years. **********Meanwhile, talks between unions and the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company are scheduled to resume Tuesday. The company said it had made a new offer Wednesday but did not give details. **********On Thursday, Asarco workers voted to approve the contract tentatively accepted last weekend. The pact would cut wages about 20 percent, to an average of $11 an hour. **********The copper talks come months after the end of a long and violent strike that began three years ago at the Phelps Dodge Corporation, which continued operating through virtually the entire period. **********The copper companies have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, and employment has plummeted to 7,000, from about 25,000. **********Last week, employees of two subsidiaries of the Newmont Copper Company approved contracts that would cut their wages by 20 percent, to about $11 an hour."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/07/business/m-a-com-sells-units.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 145, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "M/A-Com Sells Units", "print_headline": "M/A-Com Sells Units", "body_text": " **********The General Instrument Corporation, a leading maker of cable electronics equipment, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the cable and home communications businesses of M/A-Com Inc. for $220 million. **********The operations included in the deal are M/A-Com's coaxial cable business, equipment for encoding and decoding satellite television programming, antennas and electronic products for earth stations and converters for the reception of cable television programming. **********Frank G.

He said he hoped that on Tuesday, as scheduled, the House Foreign Affairs Committee would take up his bill for rejecting the sale.

Murphy, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, went to Europe this month to confer separately with King Hussein and Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel. He was seeking agreement for an international conference that would provide a setting for direct talks between Israel and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian group. But no accord has been reached on the details for the conference, or on which Palestinians could participate. **********The Administration had hoped that if Mr. Murphy achieved some progress, Congress could have been swayed from blocking the sale. **********Testifying before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Tuesday, Mr. Murphy made a strong appeal for the arms sale. **********''There is no doubt,'' he said, ''that Congressional support for the proposed Jordan arms package would have a positive influence on our efforts to sustain peace process momentum, Arab states' confidence in the United States as a reliable security partner, and Jordan's self-defense capabilities.'' Discussed for 4 Years **********The arms sale, which had been under discussion with Jordan for four years, was proposed last October. In addition to 40 fighters, which were to be either F-16's or F-20's, it provided for the sale of mobile antiaircraft weapons and armored personnel carriers. **********But on Oct. 23, Mr. Reagan bowed to Congressional pressure and accepted a Congressional resolution to put off submitting the arms package to Congress until March 1, in the absence of direct and meaningful negotiations. **********Last week, in meetings with Congressional leaders, Mr. Reagan urged acceptance of the sale, but his aides recognized that there were not enough votes, particularly in a Congressional election year, to sustain his position."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/10/world/the-talk-of-port-moresby-the-queen-betsy-ross-and-papua-new-guinea.html": {"writer_name": "Barbara Crossette", "pub_date": "1986-05-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1054, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE QUEEN, BETSY ROSS AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA", "print_headline": "THE TALK OF PORT MORESBY; THE QUEEN, BETSY ROSS AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA", "body_text": " **********Because this is a Commonwealth country, there was an official parade recently in honor of Queen Elizabeth II's 60th birthday.

If Papua New **********Guineans seem indifferent to a distant sovereign, it is because, they say, this robust young democracy, once a colony of Australia, has a lot of other things on its mind at the moment. **********There are domestic worries -crime got so bad in Port Moresby last year that a state of emergency was declared - and there are international tensions. **********Across the border, in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, people are resisting Jakarta's rule. Many Papua New Guineans instinctively want to help them, a course of action the Government here cannot afford and does not want to take. 'Our Brothers' **********''These are our brothers,'' a young woman said. ''It would be inhumane not to do something for them.'' **********Franzalbert Joku, a Port Moresby journalist who was born into a prominent family in Jayapura, on the other side of the border, said he thought the support here for fellow Melanesians in Indonesia was overwhelming. So much so, he said, that he is regularly accused of not doing enough to help the Irianese cause through The Times of Papua New Guinea, a weekly that he edits. **********Mr. Joku, who went into exile in the 1960's, soon after Indonesia annexed the territory, is now a leading figure in one of the freest presses in the Asian-Pacific area, and he wants to keep it that way. **********''I tell my friends, I understand as a Melanesian how you feel,'' he said. ''But when you talk to me as a journalist who has to uphold the ethics of the profession, you are talking to a different person.'' **********A free press, made more independent by the heavy support of local commercial advertising, is one of many aspects of Papua New Guinean life that win the enthusiastic applause of Western diplomats here. **********Another is the absolute freedom of speech and assembly that the country's 3.2 million people enjoy. There is also a strong parliamentary system, which has weathered a lot of stormy - some would say riotous - debate and several changes of government. **********Now and then, some adjustments are made. Prime Minister Wingti found it necessary recently to order four ministers to stay out of Port Moresby's discotheques, after reports that they were behaving scandalously. **********People here approved. Influenced by their own cultural egalitarianism and the ''mate'' mentality of Australians, they like people taken down a peg or two now and then. **********''These big men get to think they are too important,'' a Trobriand Islander said, delivering a couple of ''coldies'' to beer drinkers in a cafe. **********Democratic Papua New Guinea even has its own Betsy Ross.

Then she borrowed yellow from the flowers and white from the lime chewed with betel nut, and made them into a bright bird of paradise and the stars of the Southern Cross. **********People say it is not surprising that Susan Karike should have been a student of Sogeri National High School, one of four two-year institutions that prepare the brightest Papua New Guineans for higher education. **********Sogeri, high on a plateau in the steep forested hills behind Port Moresby, has been particularly successful at keeping the traditional arts alive in a country of many extraordinary cultures. **********Life has changed abruptly for the people of Papua New Guinea, most of whom had no contact with the outside world until this century - some as late as the 1950's. **********''The past was beautiful,'' said Powesiu Lawes, another Sogeri graduate and Port Moresby physician in his 20's, who draws contemporary, expressionist scenes of traditional life and adds commentaries from a not-too-distant childhood. **********The past ''had plenty,'' he recalled in ''Wati Kui,'' a collection of his youthful works. ''Plenty of food grown in the gardens and harvested for special traditional gatherings.'' **********Now, he concluded, ''the era of rice and canned fish is at hand.'' **********There are many dislocations born of the gap between a city life dominated by affluent Australians who run many of the country's businesses and poor barefoot boys down from the wild, dramatic mountains of an almost inaccessible interior. **********This city of 175,000, scattered over hills and valleys, is harassed by ''rascals.''

Heyman, chairman of GAF, drops out of the fight. **********Several traders said that, if Mr. Heyman was planning to do something, he would have to do it by tomorrow morning, when advance trading will begin in bonds that Carbide is expected to issue in a few weeks. **********The bonds are tailored to limit sales of company operations if anyone takes over the company. GAF has devised a plan to defuse the bond provisions, but its plan would be much harder to carry out once professionals began trading in the bonds because they would become widely disseminated. Even though GAF has offered to buy the bonds as a key part of its takeover offer, traders say that the price it is offering is not enough and that it will have to offer more. **********GAF is offering to pay $74 a share, or $5.1 billion in cash, for the big chemical company but has said it would raise the price to $78, or $5.5 billion, if Carbide was supportive. **********The decision Mr. Heyman faces is whether to increase his bid to as much as $85 a share, or nearly $6 billion in cash, the level that professionals thought it would take to win. He must decide whether to pay a very full price or withdraw with $200 million in after-tax profits for GAF stockholders on its 10 percent Carbide stake. **********Mr. Heyman has already paid $48 million in commitment fees to GAF's fund raiser, Drexel Burnham Lambert, and to Drexel's stable of wealthy investors for enabling him to go as far as he has in his takeover bid. **********In a move to buy its own stock and simultaneously foil GAF, Carbide is offering $85 a share, made up of $20 in cash and the rest in the special bonds. But Carbide wants only 55 percent of its stock. **********Shareholders who do not sell to Carbide would also get roughly the equivalent of $85 after Carbide's pending sale of its consumer operations. If these operations bring at least $2 billion, Carbide said, stockholders would get a special dividend, originally estimated at $28 but now revised to $31.33. **********That dividend, traders said, plus the estimated market price for Carbide stock after Carbide stops buying, should be close to $85. The dividend would be $40.03 if the consumer operations brought $2.25 billion or $48.73 if they brought $2.5 billion. **********GAF's original plan was to buy the stock directly from stockholders. But after Carbide introduced its $85 buyback plan, GAF devised a new tactic to buy only from those who first sold to Carbide. Thus shareholders were encouraged to sell to Carbide and then sell all the proceeds from Carbide to GAF. This way, GAF would get most of the bonds and then eliminate the special limitations in them. **********However, the deadline for stockholders to take back their shares from Carbide expires at midnight tonight. Carbide is expected to announce the results of its offer quickly, after which traders will begin dealing in the bonds almost immediately. **********Meanwhile, documents filed by GAF with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that the company is willing to pay a hefty premium to get financing.

Health Ministry records show 921 people diagnosed with the disease - 54 percent of them already dead - as of Nov. 20. **********But state officials believe that, allowing for unreported cases, the real figure is 20 to 30 percent higher and will probably reach 2,000 by the end of 1987. More than half the AIDS victims are residents of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, while a quarter come from Rio de Janeiro. **********''Brazil has the potential to have an African-style epidemic of AIDS,'' Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's program on AIDS, said this month in a reference to the large number of victims identified in Central Africa. ''In Brazil, as in the rest of Latin America, the Government still wrongly believes that AIDS is not a major problem.'' Panic Set Off **********Dr. Alvaro Matida, an epidemiologist who runs the local AIDS program in Rio de Janeiro, recalled that ''press sensationalism created a panic'' about AIDS last year, but there was little follow-up. ''We need to focus on the deficiencies of the public services,'' he said. ''In Brazil, the average survival after diagnosis is one to two years while in the United States it is four to six years.'' **********Nudged by the criticism and by new press attention to the problem here, the Health Minister, Roberto Santos, announced this month that several initiatives would shortly begin, including a prevention-orientated education and publicity program and, to protect hemophiliacs, obligatory screening of the supplies of all blood banks for anti-bodies of the AIDS virus. **********''I know there has been criticism,'' Dr. Miriam Franchini, who works in the ministry's special AIDS program, said, ''but it took time to form teams. This office was only set up in April. How can you care for AIDS cases without forming the proper teams to deal with all aspects of the problem - medical, therapeutic, psychological, judicial and so on?'' **********Another reason for the ministry's slow response is that several other infectious diseases, among them malaria, yellow fever, tuberculosis and Chagas' disease, affect a much larger segment of the Brazilian population than does AIDS. Carlos Sant'Anna, who served as Health Minister until last February, said that in this context it was difficqlt to consider AIDS a priority. 'A Very Wearing Business' **********As a result, until now most of the burden of handling victims of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, has been carried by local health authorities. ''It's a very wearing business,'' said Dr. Teresa Klieman, who works on the state program in Sao Paulo. ''You're dealing with patients who are going to die and a problem that keeps growing.'' **********Over the past two years, Sao Paulo has developed a 100-member team that is now training health workers from elsewhere in Brazil as well as running an outpatients' clinic. But even in Sao Paulo, the shortage of beds for victims who need hospitalization is acute. ''First, there is the fear of the medical personnel,'' Dr. Franchini said. ''Then there is the extraordinary cost of caring for these patients.'' **********In Sao Paulo, Dr. Klieman estimates some 400 AIDS victims are still alive and only 150 beds are available, although this figure is challenged by Paulo Cesar Bomfin of the Group to Support the Prevention of AIDS, who contends there are only 60 beds. In Rio de Janeiro, the situation is more serious, with only 16 beds for more than 100 surviving AIDS patients. **********''At a state level we're still doing far less than we should,'' Dr. Matida noted, ''but isolated measures are not going to have any impact. This is a national problem that must be faced nationally.'' 'Whole Population at Risk' **********Mr. Bomfin, whose group is made up mainly of homosexuals, concurred. ''You can't just talk of high risk groups because the whole population is now at risk,'' he said, noting the growing number - over 20 percent of the total - of bisexual victims of AIDS here. **********Nonetheless, health authorities have so far given little importance to providing information about prevention of AIDS to the population at large. ''It's still a taboo subject,'' Mr. Bomfin said. ''Ninety percent of patients face rejection by their family and friends. Our group hasn't even been able to rent space because of discrimination. And meanwhile the saunas are still full of homosexuals who seem to have forgotten that AIDS exists.'' **********Mr. Bomfin said there was an urgent need for a nationwide education program. ''People have to ta p precauonons,'' he said. ''You dot t ban driving becausearars can kill. You tell people to wear seat belts and drive slowly. It's the same here. You don't have to stop sex just because AIDS kills. We're saying you should wear condoms and have less partners.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/world/aquino-vows-protest-campaign-if-cheated-in-vote.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1986-01-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 816, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AQUINO VOWS PROTEST CAMPAIGN IF CHEATED IN VOTE", "print_headline": "AQUINO VOWS PROTEST CAMPAIGN IF CHEATED IN VOTE", "body_text": " **********Denouncing President Ferdinand E.

Denunciations Please Crowd **********The partisan crowd seemed to savor particularly the audacious personal denunciations she aimed at the ailing 68-year-old President as an old man given to lying, cheating and assassination. **********She charged he had decreed himself king, emperor, military governor and even occasional pope. **********The 54-year-old novice candidate cautioned against the election fraud that critics of the Marcos Government here and in the United States have asserted it is preparing. **********''I believe in a peaceful process and I warn Mr Marcos: make sure that the people are not frustrated again,'' she said in response to a question after her address.

Her impression of political crowds lately, she added, was that they might take action if she urged, ''Let's bring this dictator down.'' **********She said she was resolved on a path of democratic change, however, and she drew repeated laughter and applause with her characterizations of Mr. Marcos as a master of thievery doubly threatened by age and rejection by voters. **********In promising greater democracy, Mrs. Aquino said she favored eliminating the Constitution's Article 6 giving the President unchallenged powers of decree. But she said she would be forced to use the article initially as President to order an end to dictatorial powers if the pro-Marcos National Assembly were to oppose her legislative proposals for eliminating martial law. **********''I shall use Amendment 6 only as a last resort and only to destroy itself,'' she said.

''And may the better woman win!'' she declared as the crowd of middle-class urbanites cheered. **********The scene before a luncheon of more than 1,000 supporters at the Manila Hotel presented something of a crosscut of moods. The grim call to end the martial-law rule sounded across an upbeat Rotarian gathering as hearty as any in the United States ''Welcome, welcome, guests of Rotary,'' the well-dressed crowd sang minutes before Mrs. Aquino warned that ''Mr. Marcos is determined to remain permanent dictator come hell or high water.'' **********''I am determined to stop him,'' she added. **********Wearing a dress of bright yellow, her campaign color, Mrs. Aquino promised to restore a presidential system of checks and balances with the legislature and courts. She also promised full restoration of habeas corpus and freedom of the press and an investigation of Government corruption. Reproach for the U.S.  Denying President Marcos's charge that she has Communist sympathies, Mrs. Aquino promised to declare a six-month cease-fire with Communist insurgents and to seek to negotiate their legitimate grievances. The President's rapacity, she charged, has relentlessly pushed the nation to insurgency these past 20 years. **********Asked about relations with the United States, Mrs. Aquino said she has been very disappointed with American policy during martial law, particularly with what she considered a lack of concern over human rights abuses.

But as securities firms have scrambled to install the computer systems needed to compete in the new era, it has become clear that a technological revolution is also being unleashed - for which few seem well prepared. **********Some are coming around to the view that the real Achilles' heel of London's securities industry, and its individual firms, may be inadequate or unreliable technology, not just the increased competition Big Bang will bring. **********''There has been incredible naivete among the senior management at many firms about what could be achieved in such a short period of time,'' said Gordon Clarke, senior manager of the Information Technology Group at the London office of Deloitte Haskins & Sells, the accounting and consulting firm. ''Given the time frame, a lot of corners have been cut in putting the systems together. Some have been lashed up and stitched together in a pretty crude way, and they're vulnerable.'' **********Number of Changes **********The critical role technology will play results from the number of changes that will take place. Commission rates on securities trades will be negotiated, rather than fixed. The barrier between brokers, who can only act as agents for stock trades, and jobbers, who can purchase shares for their own account, will be lifted. **********Also, the stock exchange had operated for nearly 200 years as a secretive, cartel-like market where traders operated face-to-face. As of Monday, the floor will become nearly obsolete. Most trading will instead take place behind computer screens, displaying information in a rainbow of colors, in brokers' offices off the floor. The firms will also be handling what is expected to be a substantial increase in trading volumes with these little-tested machines. **********Information about trades in the most active stocks that was hidden from view before will now also be available electronically for market participants, heralding something of an information revolution. The omnipresent ''tape,'' which for decades has displayed details on just about every trade on the New York Stock Exchange, is unknown here. And trades between brokerage firms will be settled electronically, eliminating most paper records. Poorly Informed on Demands **********The concern raised is that, with many firms admittedly tardy in designing and installing new computer systems and often poorly informed on the technical demands, there is a clear possibility of problems that could cause financial losses at some companies or even force stock trading to a halt. This is what happened on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1960's when it was swamped by growing trading volumes. **********''I would be willing to put money on some really nasty hangups in the next couple of months,'' said Tim Simon, chairman of Consultants (Commercial & Financial) P.L.C., one of the major suppliers of computer and clearing systems to securities houses. ''People just haven't been realistic in the past year about what they could accomplish in such a short period of time.'' **********The two critical areas have been in building the technology to clear and settle transactions and in getting the computer systems at each firm to communicate with the stock exchange's computers. **********Clearing problems in particular could be costly. If, for instance, one firm's system fails, it would not be able to properly match up its trades with other brokers or determine whether it completed trades for its clients. All would be in limbo, not knowing whether buy or sell orders had gone through. If one client or a broker had tried to sell a stock whose price had subsequently dropped sharply, and then found out that the sale was not transacted because of a clearing foul-up, it could end up holding a big paper loss. **********''If one of the major players runs into big problems, it all comes back to us as well,'' said J. .E. Scholes, an assistant director at Kleinwort Benson Ltd. in charge of information systems. ''We could all be in deep trouble if somebody else has problems.'' **********In a preview of the new systems, the stock exchange ran its one and only dress rehearsal on Oct. 18, a Saturday, in which there was simulated trading. Although some at the stock exchange and a few firms called the rehearsal a success, most admitted there were a number of major hangups. The mock session was marked by frustrating delays in transferring information, several breakdowns at firms and heated discussions between the stock exchange and some firms over who was to blame for the glitches. Communication Difficulties **********An important shortcoming was getting different computers to ''talk'' to each other, transferring data smoothly. There were also communication foul-ups, with some firms unable to reach other securities houses. **********This was not always accidental, however. Firms are obliged to trade at the bid and offer prices they punch into the stock exchange's central trading system, called Stock Exchange Automated Quotations, or SEAQ, which is modeled on America's National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system, known as Nasdaq. **********When some of the firms had trouble that Saturday updating their quotes, and then did not want to trade at old prices that would have cost them money, they simply let their phones ring, which is a breach of the exchange's rules. **********Tempers have cooled since that rehearsal, though, partly because the firms have not had time to fret in the rush to prepare for the real thing on Monday. **********''The stock exchange is no different than the rest of us,'' said Matt Devereux, head of management services at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, a unit of Barclays Bank. ''They've run out of time as well.'' Options Trading a Strain **********Another worrying sign was problems faced earlier this year in the computer system for the trading of individual stock options, which is also conducted through the stock exchange. Options trading had been relatively light, but as it began to increase the system was strained to the breaking point, dealers said. **********The stage for Big Bang was set in 1983, giving firms roughly three years to prepare. But some executives argue that there were major questions about the structure their firms would take and that those questions had to be resolved before they could decide what sort of technology would be needed. **********''The difficulty we all faced was in trying to assess what the implications of Big Bang were first,'' said John Watson, chief executive of Scrimgeour Vickers Services, which handles the technology and computers for Scrimgeour Vickers & Company, a unit of Citicorp. ''You can't start to build your technology until you know the structure of your company.'' **********The rule changes led to a wave of acquisitions and mergers between securities houses, for instance. Scrimgeour Vickers, for one, is made up of four brokerage firms and a discount house. After the consolidation took place, firms were often left with a variety of incompatible computer systems from the original component companies. They then had to decide whether to operate separate systems, try to build on what they had or scrap everything and start over. **********''Instead of evolving our technology, as you did in the States, we're going there in one jump,'' Mr. Watson said. ''We're changing absolutely everything you can think of. Our technology people haven't had a weekend off since June. But it would still be astonishing if all the technology worked.'' Great Demand for Experts **********The experts who design and install these complex machines have been in enormous demand in the past two years. In fact, there has been a shortage of trained computer experts, which has led to an escalation in their salaries similar to the sharp jump in compensation for young stock traders here. **********Mr. Simon said that his firm's staff has grown from 40 just 18 months ago to 220 today. ''And if I had another 50 people I could use them all,'' he remarked. ''We've had to turn away a lot of business.'' **********Despite all of the millions of pounds and thousands of hours devoted to the task, most admit that they have been able to construct little beyond basic systems. **********''We've got a functioning system,'' said Doug Strachan, director of information systems of Shearson Lehman Brothers International, parent of L. Messel & Company. ''But it's nothing fancy, to put it mildly. We're at the base line.'' **********The real test, Mr. Scholes of Kleinwort Benson added, will be if trading volumes do jump as expected in coming months, particularly in late November when the huge public offering by the Government of shares in British Gas is scheduled to begin trading. **********''I think our system has worked superbly, but I do have worries what will happen when real volume hits us,'' Mr. Scholes said. ''We're going around here touching a lot of wood.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/03/world/us-czech-exchange-accord-reached.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 684, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S.-CZECH EXCHANGE ACCORD REACHED", "print_headline": "U.S.-CZECH EXCHANGE ACCORD REACHED", "body_text": " **********The United States and Czechoslovakia have agreed on the first cultural and scientific exchanges between the two nations, Administration officials said today. **********They said the development had come amid signs of growing interest here in improving ties with Soviet bloc nations. **********Rozanne L. Ridgway, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, is to travel to Prague in two weeks to sign the accord. The agreement will open up the prospect for the largest artistic and cultural exchanges since the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 replaced a relatively liberal leadership with a more repressive government. **********At the same time, officials said they were weighing the prospects of easing strains with Poland after an unusual mission to Warsaw last month by Walter J. Stoessel Jr., former Deputy Secretary of State and a former Ambassador to Poland. Secretary of State George P. Shultz had asked Mr. Stoessel to undertake the trip to investigate the possibility of normalizing relations with the Government of Gen. Wojiech Jaruzelski. Later Conferred With Pope **********After his talks with General Jaruzelski and with Jozef Cardinal Glemp, the head of Poland's Roman Catholic Church, Mr. Stoessel flew to Rome to confer with Pope John Paul II, officials said. A major part of the mission, they said, was to encourage a dialogue between the Polish Government and the church and to discuss the release of the 200 political prisoners in Poland, along with a lifting of remaining American sanctions against Poland. **********Officials said Bulgaria, another Warsaw Pact nation with cool relations with the United States, had also been signaling an interest in improved ties. They said steps toward that end might be undertaken now that the trial in Rome has ended with the acquittal of the Bulgarian defendants who had been accused of conspiring to kill the Pope. **********These developments, Administration officials said, have occurred in the aftermath of November's summit meeting in Geneva between President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, where a cultural exchange accord was signed. Even though Moscow and Washington have been sharply at odds over arms control and regional issues, the cultural accord has gone into effect, and this seems to have spurred interest here and in Eastern Europe in widening ties, Administration officials said. **********Ever since the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981, the Reagan Administration has divided Warsaw Pact nations into two categories. In one, Hungary and Rumania were given preferential treatment in trade and other relations because of Hungary's relatively liberal domestic policies and Rumania's independence of Moscow on some foreign policy questions. **********The other Soviet allies - East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria - were regarded as more repressive and therefore deprived of favorable treatment. **********Secretary Shultz visited Hungary and Rumania in December, and while in Budapest he signaled the American interest in gradually improving ties with Eastern Europe. Accord on Gold Reached **********Efforts have been made gradually to test the possibility of improving contacts. In 1981 a major impediment to relations with Czechoslovakia was removed when an agremeent was worked out to allow Prague to recover 18.4 tons of gold, which had been seized by the Nazis, in return for settlement of financial claims by about 2,500 Americans. **********The United States has been interested in a cultural exchange accord with Prague for some time as a way of broadening American influence there and allowing more American contact with Czechoslovak intellectuals, who have been living in what is generally regarded as a harsh atmosphere. **********The relations with Poland have gone through several ups and downs in recent years. After imposing a set of political and economic sanctions for the martial law action in 1981, the Administration gradually removed most of them, but efforts to return to more normal ties foundered in a strained atmosphere. The United States expressed concern over the continued detention of about 200 political prisoners and refused to have any contact with General Jaruzelski when he went to New York last fall for the United Nations General Assembly session."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/01/business/30-year-mortgages-below-10.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Hayes", "pub_date": "1986-03-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 811, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "30-YEAR MORTGAGES BELOW 10%", "print_headline": "30-YEAR MORTGAGES BELOW 10%", "body_text": " **********With increasing frequency, conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are being offered at interest rates below 10 percent. This week marks the first time in more than six years that single-digit rates have been available on fixed-rate mortgages. **********The rates reflect the broad decline in interest rates on a wide range of money-market instruments. As recently as a year ago, rates on 30-year mortgages were as high as 13 percent. In 1971, mortgage loans reached 17 1/2 percent and higher. **********The drop in rates has ''really been quite remarkable,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, in Washington. ''The rally in the money markets has gone beyond what anybody had expected.'' Wave of Refinancings **********The recent drop in interest rates has accelerated a wave of mortgage refinancing that began early this year. The lower mortgage rates do not necessarily mean it is advantageous for a homeowner to refinance, however; other costs must be considered. **********The Veterans Administration announced today in Washington that it also had cut the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages a full percentage point, to 9.5 percent. The new rate is to go into effect on Monday. **********The last time that the national average for 30-year mortgage loans registered below 10 percent was in November 1978, at 9.97 percent, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. An 'Avalanche' of Demand **********Mr. Lasko said he expected 30-year rates to become commonly available below 10 percent to qualified borrowers within two or three weeks. ''There will be an avalanche of new loan demand,'' he said. **********Charles Breinig, president of the Mortgage Reporting Service of Jenkintown, Pa., said 15 of the 300 institutions surveyed by his concern dropped their conventional mortgage rates under 10 percent this week. Nearly half of the institutions reduced their rates, an unusually high total, he said. **********''Investors who are buying mortgages feel much more secure these days about inflation being under control,'' he said. ''We've had an artificially high interest rate for at least two years because of the worries about inflation being reignited.'' Rates in New York **********The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the New York metropolitan area is now 10.66 percent, according to a survey by HSH Associates of Riverdale, N.J. At least one local lender's simple interest rate is under 10 percent, however: The Merit Mortgage Company of Staten Island reported a rate of 9.9 percent. **********''The trend of the past month has been a downturn,'' said Albert J. Sorentino, a vice president of Citibank, whose simple interest rate is 10 7/8 percent. ''We do our pricing as of Monday, and we'll probably be going down a little on Monday.'' **********Several mortgage banks in the Boston area were reported to have dropped mortgage rates below 10 percent. Halmark Mortgage of Shrewsbury cut its conventional rate to 9.75 percent, and the Farragut Mortgage Company of Belmont was charging 9.95 percent. **********The average rate for conventional mortgages surveyed in the Philadelphia area by Mr. Breinig was 10.48 percent, with the lowest rate at 9.5 percent. The rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages was 10.23 percent, and for one-year adjustable mortgages it was 9.21 percent. **********Richard A. Beckwith, an official of Anchor Mortgage Service, a unit of the Anchor Savings Bank of Manhattan, said the drop in rates had touched off a surge of refinancing applications from borrowers with three- and four-year-old mortgages bearing rates several percentage points higher. **********''It looks like 1986 is shaping up as the year of the refinancing,'' he said. ''We've been busy for six weeks, and I think it will continue at least another 60 to 90 days.'' THE GOOD AND BAD OF REFINANCING **********It pays to refinance a home mortgage when there is a two to three percentage point difference between the interest rate on an existing mortgage and the currently available rate, according to experts in the mortgage field. The reason such a spread is necessary before refinancing is profitable is that the closing costs of a new mortgage encompass many charges, such as appraisal fees, mortgage recording tax, title search, survey and legal fees. However, some of these expenses can be reduced or eliminated if the new mortgage is obtained from the same lender as the existing mortgage. **********A major refinancing expense, moreover, is the one-time origination fee - amounting to 3 percent or more of the borrowed amount and generally known as ''points'' - charged by the lender. Other considerations include the loss in tax deductions for mortgage interest when a lower-interest loan is secured, the loss in after-tax earnings if the money used for closing costs had been invested instead, and the prepayment penalties ranging up to 3 percent of the outstanding principal allowed in many states."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/business/amc-head-in-renault-post.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A.M.C.

Issued April 15 and accompanied by threats to impose civil penalties and even ban the airline from doing business in the United States in the case of noncompliance, it had infuriated Tokyo. **********The order, approved by Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, complained of ''arbitrary restrictions'' that Japan was imposing on all-cargo flights between Anchorage and Tokyo. Requirement on Unloading **********Japan had insisted that American carriers bound from Tokyo over polar routes to points in Western Europe unload half their cargo in Anchorage. The United States does not make reciprocal demands on Japanese carriers, which Washington says gives the Japanese an unfair advantage. **********The American request for data covering the period Jan. 1, 1985, to March 31, 1986, was seen as preparation for applying a similar restriction to the Japanese. **********The airline issue is one of prickliest in the bilteral relationship and, trade experts said, has much higher political visibility in Tokyo than in Washington.

Judging from the response I have received, a lot of readers have been wondering, as I did, why such a seemingly natural combination has been so late in arriving. After all, the underlying technology is the same, and having one unit to serve both purposes would save time, space and money. **********Unfortunately, to answer a question asked by a number of readers, the machine in question, the Xerox 4045 ($5,395 and up, depending on the options, from Xerox, (800) 832-6979) does not yet work with Apple's Macintosh. However, I would wager that this additional capability will not be long in coming. **********The Xerox 4045 performs handsomely as a copier. But how does it work as a printer? To answer that question, with the machine hooked up to a Leading Edge Model D, I proceeded to attack a software package called Lasersoft ($295 from Business Systems International, Canoga Park, Calif., 91304, (818) 998-7227), a copy of which had been shipped along with the Xerox copier/printer to provide some grist for the mill. **********Impatient, as usual, for results, I inserted the Print Sample Program disk rather than wading through the manual to start the program itself and typed FONT4045 as directed on the accompanying sheet. The red light on Drive A indicating that the disk was being read flashed on for a moment, and the message '' Copy Font 4045.CPU PRN'' appeared on screen. **********Then the computer and I stared at each other until, 45 seconds later, the disk drive light again flashed momentarily on. I waited, poised for action. For several minutes, absolutely nothing appeared to happen. **********The instruction sheet had warned me that there would be ''a short delay during the loading process.'' But, by my stopwatch, three minutes had elapsed, and the computer was still just sitting there, not even reading the disk. I dialed the Lasersoft assistance number. Just as I was put through, more than four minutes after entering the load command, the 4045 cranked out a status sheet indicating its readiness to go to work. **********Since I had already placed my call, I chatted for a while with the helpful service representative. What I had failed to take into account, he explained, was how long it would take the computer to load all the complex fonts included in the Lasersoft program into the 4045's memory. When I got back to the keyboard, I found myself gazing at a menu of sample forms ready to be printed out. **********Among the selections offered were Form 1040 and Schedules A and B as well. Having had to request an extension from the Internal Revenue Service in order to gain enough time to straighten out my papers sufficiently to even file my tax return, I chose to pass over these particular examples and started instead with a bar chart entitled Order Activity Analysis. The results of the Xerox printout were impressive, the various shadings of the bars and the lines and alphanumerics appearing crisp and clean. **********One difference I did note between the 4045 as a printer and the machine as a copier: The density of the ink deposition seemed to vary with the function. As a copier, the device produced a heavy, almost Thermofax-like image, whereas in the printer mode the inking seemed slightly lighter. In both cases, however, the quality of reproduction remained high. HAVING treated myself to the instant gratification of a demo, I turned to Lasersoft itself. The program is somewhat clumsy to deal with - at least initially - because of its unorthodox approach to data entry. Such special keys as Escape are not utilized by the program at all, for instance, and the 10-key numeric pad is automatically disabled, although it can be activated by pressing the old pain-in-the-neck ''Num Lock'' key. **********The Up-arrow cursor key acts as a tab-back key, moving the cursor back to the previous blank, while the Down-arrow takes it forward in the same manner. These functions can also be performed in the usual way, the Tab key taking the cursor forward, the Shift, Tab combination taking it backward. **********The Enter key, whose original sole function I feel really ought to be left sacrosanct, can also be used to jump the cursor forward a blank at a time, although I would certainly not recommend acquiring the habit of employing it to this end. Frankly, I consider this aspect of the program to be at best a bad piece of human engineering. **********In case you were wondering, the manual explains that ''the F10 (PROCESS) key works as a true ENTER key.'' Why the Enter key is not a ''true'' Enter key I don't know. Still, the program, even with its design shortcomings as regards interaction with human users does allow one conveniently to create custom forms in a myriad of designs. **********Although the Xerox 4045 can be shared among as many as four personal computers, Lasersoft, which uses the key-disk copy protection scheme, can be utilized by only one. On the positive side of the program's ledger is its merge facility, which allows the custom forms created by the program to be combined with the data those forms are designed to carry, and both can be printed simultaneously, producing finished results, all filled in, at a keystroke. **********Back to the Xerox 4045, which, when equipped with the appropriate add-ons, goes beyond the functions of copying, word-processing and forms-generation. A machine with the right extras can inscribe envelopes (albeit not yet the standard number 10 envelopes), gummed labels, prepunched paper and transparencies. It can print using many different fonts. Up to four font cartridges, each supplying multiple fonts, can be inserted in the machine at a time. Additional typefaces can be downloaded directly from the computer into its memory, giving the user access to even more styles. **********If these attributes make the Xerox 4045 sound like an all-purpose small printing machine, well, in fact, it is. About the only thing it will not do is work as an image digitizer. That is, you cannot insert printed copy and ask the 4045 to translate it into the electronic equivalent for your computer. But it seems to me that the technology for accomplishing this is avalable, and that it's only a matter of time until the 4045 adds image-digitizing to its repertoire. Then, as a combination copier/printer/digitizer, this machine will be a real breakthrough product. **********Before too long, laser printers will have affected the output of this country's offices as much as personal computers have altered the way in which data is processed. The proof of the pudding will lie, as always, in the durability and stamina of the machines. But at the risk of losing my reputation as a curmudgeon among computer reviewers, I must say that the Xerox 4045, with its broad applications and low cost-to-utilization ratio, seems to stand head and shoulders above the rest of the small crowd of laser printers."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/business/rapid-growth-at-bell-canada.html": {"writer_name": "Douglas Martin", "pub_date": "1986-04-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1112, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "RAPID GROWTH AT BELL CANADA", "print_headline": "RAPID GROWTH AT BELL CANADA", "body_text": " **********In the three years since its formation as a holding company, Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. has earned a reputation as a hungry corporate acquirer, straying far from its core telephone business. **********''Our pond is very big,'' Jean de Grandpre, Bell Canada's chairman, said recently. ''We are essentially a Canadian-based international organization.'' **********Just this month, Bell Canada - the country's most profitable company -set its sights on Hiram Walker Resources Ltd., the big liquor and oil producer. Bell Canada made its bid through Transcanada Pipelines Ltd., in which it holds a 48 percent stake. But, for once, Bell Canada may not get its way. Transcanada withdrew its offer Tuesday - at least temporarily - in the face of a higher bid from the Gulf Canada Corporation, controlled by the Reichmann family. **********'Macho Aggressiveness' **********''It seems only the mighty Reichmann empire can match the macho aggressiveness of Bell Canada,'' said The Financial Post, a national financial newspaper. **********Indeed, while still depending on its Bell Canada phone unit for more than 60 percent of its earnings, the Montreal-based Bell Canada Enterprises has expanded rapidly into areas ranging from real estate and energy to printing and computers. **********Last year, Bell Canada Enterprises became the first Canadian company to earn more than $1 billion (Canadian), and has set the goal of $2 billion annual profits by 1992 or 1993. The Canadian dollar is now worth about 72 United States cents. **********But almost from the beginning of its buying spree, the holding company has been criticized for veering away from its traditional area of expertise, the rapidly evolving and increasingly unregulated field of telecommunications. Bell Canada was set up to separate such unregulated activities as its 52 percent-owned Northern Telecom Ltd. - the second-largest North American designer and manufacturer of telecommunications equipment - from the phone company's rate base. Effect on Phone Unit **********The critics have asked whether Bell Canada Enterprises' concentration on other businesses has hurt phone service, as well as whether the phone monopoly gives the company an unfair advantage in its other operations. **********Bell Canada serves seven million customers in Ontario, Quebec and the eastern Arctic. In the Maritime Provinces, Bell Canada Enterprises owns big chunks of the local phone companies. **********With the breakup of the Bell System in the United States two years ago, Bell Canada became the only major communications organization in the world that still had telecommunications operations, equipment manufacturing and research and development functions under one corporate roof. And, unlike A.T.&T., it still enjoys a monopoly on long-distance service. **********''With a growing and large pool of capital, you cannot sit on your haunches,'' Mr. de Grandpre said in countering the company's critics. ''We're ready to seize any major opportunity that may suddenly arise.'' And phone service has not suffered because of that strategy, the company has contended. Increased Stake in Transcanada **********The first such opportunity that Bell Canada seized was to buy a 43 percent stake - later increased to 48 percent - in Transcanada, one of the world's largest natural gas pipeline companies, with a 2,500-mile network from Alberta to Montreal. **********In early 1985, Bell Canada swallowed 69 percent of the Vancouver-based Daon Development, Canada's largest real estate company. Smaller acquisitions include Computer Innovations, a home computer company; the Case-Hoyt Corporation, the printer of Architectural Digest and annual reports for such companies as Exxon and I.B.M., and a computer maintenance company, TRW Data Systems. **********Last month Bell Canada bought the majority of the United States real estate holdings of Oxford Development Group Ltd. of Toronto, acquiring property valued at $1.39 billion for $172 million in cash. **********All along, Bell Canada has said that its principal responsibility was to use its vast asset base - $20.6 billion at the end of 1985 - to maximize returns for its 330,000 shareholders, by far the most of any Canadian corporation. Some Question Acquisitions **********Some critics remain unconvinced, however. Hudson Janisch, a University of Toronto law professor, asks whether Bell Canada's ''binge to buy outside the communications area'' is proper for a company that receives most of its profits from a regulated monopoly. **********''In many ways, it seems to be an old-fashioned conglomerate,'' Mr. Janisch said, pointing out that A.T.&T. has done very well since the divestiture of its regional operating companies by concentrating on communications-related high-tech endeavors. **********Melvyn L. Misner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Canada, observed that although ''the party line is that it will not become a conglomerate like ITT,'' Bell Canada's behavior indicates that it might be doing just that. **********Moreover, to these observers, the diversification effort reflects more the choices of a portfolio manager than a coherent business strategy. **********''I don't think it's clear that they have a defined diversification objective,'' said an analyst who declined to be identified because of the close ties of his investment house to Bell Canada. ''They seem to look at things as they come along.'' **********Partly as a result, they say, profits are expected to edge downward. Other reasons for the predicted downturn are a less-than-expected rate increase in 1985 for Transcanada, fears that the same thing will happen to the phone unit this year and the decline in oil prices, which will affect Bell Canada's energy properties. **********Analysts also point to an expected slowdown in earnings at Northern Telecom. ''They've had such phenomenal success, it's hard to have an encore,'' Mr. Misner of Merrill Lynch said. **********A longer-term concern is that Bell Canada's international consulting business will not be able to find a replacement for its $1.6 billion contract with Saudi Arabia, which expires in 1987. The company was active in 35 countries last year, but all at a considerably smaller scale than in Saudi Arabia. A Future in Acquisitions **********Despite those concerns, however, acquisitions appear to be the way of the future for Bell Canada, particularly if it is to meet its growth targets. **********Indeed, the fight for Hiram Walker is not necessarily over. In withdrawing its $4.2 billion offer Tuesday, Transcanada left the door open for a higher bid next week. And discussions have been held between top Transcanada and Gulf Canada executives that have raised the possibility that the competing bidders may cut a deal to divide Walker's assets. **********''We are committed to nurturing what we already possess, while we seek to discover, acquire, invest in and develop new enterprises,'' Robert J. Richardson, president of Bell Canada, said in a speech last month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/01/business/investing-in-a-rising-market-roundtable-experts-name-their-investment-choices.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 4141, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Interview", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Roundtable: Experts Name Their Investment Choices", "print_headline": "INVESTING IN A RISING MARKET; Roundtable: Experts Name Their Investment Choices", "body_text": " **********Amid one of the strongest bull markets of the postwar period, three leading Wall Street figures were asked to assess the outlook for the next six months to a year and discuss investment strategies appropriate for individuals. They are: Elaine M. Garzarelli, director of sector analysis and executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.; A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., and James S. Martin, executive vice president of the College Retirement Equities Fund. They were interviewed by Jan M. Rosen and Vartanig G. Vartan of The New York Times staff. **********QUESTION: Looking at the second half of this year, what is your forecast for the stock market and its potential? Elaine? **********GARZARELLI: I don't see any greater correction than 4 to 7 percent over the next six months. **********We're still in a very strong bull market and can go up another 15 to 20 percent at current interest rates. I'll give you an S.&P. forecast - 280 to 300 on the S.&P. 500-stock index in the next six to 12 months. I have an indicator that for the last 20 years has told me when a serious correction was coming. The indicator is the three-month Treasury bill rate. Every time in the last 20 years the bill rate has gone up 20 percent from its low point in a cycle, that has sparked a 10 to 15 percent correction. In April, the bills got below 6 percent for the first time, so a level of 7 percent on the Treasury bill rate would be the danger signal. From our forecast, I actually don't see it for the next six months at all - probably not into the next 12. I have a valuation model, too. I look at cash flow to bond yields. The key is not to look at earnings yields, but to look at cash flow yields. **********Q.: Jim, what do you see for the market over that time frame? In mid-1983 you said, ''I can see the Dow at 2,100 in 1987.'' **********MARTIN: We rarely make short-term forecasts, but I'll stick by that. We think the market is driven by fundamentals, and looking out over the next two years, the economic fundamentals look very strong. That should lead to good worldwide real growth and then good worldwide corporate profit performance. We were also thinking of a lower oil price and interest rates. So I would stick with 2,100 sometime next year, and higher than that looking out later in the decade. **********Q.: If it gets to 2,100 next year, do you see it falling back before it moves higher? **********MARTIN: It always has to. If history is any guide, somewhere in here there's a pullback. I don't think it's a dangerous kind of downside risk - 10 percent or 7 percent - it's not 20 in our opinion. Not until it looks as though the fundamentals that underlie the process are beginning to become excessive, but we're not there yet. Q.: Mike? **********LIPPER: You've heard from two bulls, I guess it's appropriate that I be at least cautionary by contrast. First, over the six-month period from the end of September to the end of March many equity funds have grown at a rate of 30 percent or more. I would not expect equities to continue to grow at that rate. The second point that I would suggest is that in a period of deflation you can have very nasty credit surprises, and it would not surprise me at any time to have a very scary headline about someplace in the financial structure. It doesn't have to be in this country. It can be anyplace in the world, and with the interrelationships of markets, it would impact us. So I would suggest a bit of caution. **********Q. You said deflation; you didn't say disinflation. Do you really see that? **********LIPPER: Yes, in terms of commodity prices, farm prices, oil, to some degree copper, even New York City co-op apartments, prices are lower. The worst of it may be over, but it may just tip off something. And remember, it's been a long time since we've had a major fraud. We know that in history we have them - some name that we all think is absolutely wonderful and clear, the assets aren't there. Q.: You mean like the Pennsylvania Railroad debacle?  LIPPER: Yes, something like that can happen. So while I can see the market moving to the level that Jim and Elaine mentioned, I would be cautious, because I think there can be problems. **********Q.: Elaine, you're a specialist in the sector part of the market. In one of your recent reports you referred to several sectors as double whammies that you think have a chance of outperforming the general market. What are the double whammies and why are they attractive? **********GARZARELLI: The double whammies I'm talking about have two things going for them - good earnings growth and good valuation. I look for industries that are going to have earnings superior to the S.&P. over the next 12 months and that are also cheap. That way you can't go wrong no matter what the market's looking at right now. Some of these are attractive because of the oil price decline - groups like air freight, truckers and rails and airlines. Computer stocks are also attractive because I think they're hitting bottom now in terms of earnings. I also like leisure time. Consumers are going to have an extra $20 billion to spend on things besides gasoline, so they're going to spend it on fun things. General merchandise chains and retail drugstores are aided by the consumers' rise in real disposable income. Drugs and soft drinks look good because they are dollar-related - it's dollar-related and energy-related areas that are the best. **********Q.: Conversely what areas do you not look upon with enthusiasm? **********GARZARELLI: The broadcast media has become fully valued, and is selling at the upper end of its cash-flow range. The food industry is also at the upper end of its cash-flow relative range. The gold mining group is unattractive because I believe in very low inflation. Natural gas and the oils, even if we do have a pop-up in oil prices, are long-term unattractive areas. Textiles have moved too fast too far. And tire and rubber because of flat earnings in '87. Those are my underweights. I have 22 attractive groups, and I have fewer unattractive groups at this point. **********Q.: What are some of your favorite companies in the attractive groups? **********GARZARELLI: Under technology I have two stocks, Seagate Technologies, which is selling at about 12 now, and Digital Equipment. I think that the small stocks will outperform the large stocks over the next year. In the drugs I like Erbamont. Under leisure, I like Brunswick and Disney. In the trucking industry I like R.L.C. Corp., and a restaurant stock that has lagged the industry that should catch up is Chi Chi's Inc. Q.: Do you emphasize cash-flow more than earnings?  GARZARELLI: Absolutely. Cash-flow is a much better measure of the ability of a company to pay dividends, buy back its stock and increase its return on equity. Cash flow is income plus deferred taxes plus depreciation with an adjustment for inventory profits. We have put together a formula for calculating it with the Commerce Department. We tested this measure back to 1950 to see if it's related to the valuation in the stock market, and we found that whenever the cash-flow yield is 450 basis points higher than the bond yield, the market is fully valued. Currently, the cash-flow yield is 13.3 percent, bond yields are 7.5 percent, so the spread is over 600 basis points. So we're still in a positive zone. At current interest rates, to get to a 450 spread, which is a sell signal, the market can rise to 300 on the S.&P. 500. **********LIPPER: By the way, cash flow is probably a good way to analyze companies across national borders and national tax systems. If you take countries that have very different tax provisions for depreciation, it's much better to use cash flow as your measure of value, comparing, say, a European company with a Japanese company. It works quite well internationally. **********Q.: Jim, you're running $24 billion in equity money. Looking out over the second half of this year, what sectors of the market, and what stocks within those sectors, appeal to you? **********MARTIN: We're focusing largely on companies that have some sensitivity to the cycle, because we're looking for accelerating growth as we go through the balance of the year. As Michael said, there might be some surprises out there, but I think they're manageable. We're focusing on things like the technology area, whether the office equipment sector or electrical equipment sector - what we call growth cyclicals, perhaps. We don't think the consumer's dead, either. It seems to me all cocktail conversation these days is about having to refinance your mortgage, and at what rate, with whom, adjustable or conventional. And the impact of that can be substantial. If some equity is extracted, that can be a fairly significant amount. That's part of what supports continued consumer spending. Also, some of the tremendous increase in assets in the stock market and bond market will flow through to the consumer. So we're thinking autos, housing, other consumer areas. In general, small stocks are underpriced relative to large ones now, and unit growers are probably underpriced relative to the market. Q.: What are some unit growers that are underpriced? MARTIN: Almost any of the ethical drug companies, the soft drink companies, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsicola, some of the food companies, niche companies, companies that have a market position of leadership. We continue to believe inflation is not going to be a problem, so nominal growth in this environment is not going to be anything like what we saw back in the early 80's. So real growth counts. Q.: Do you see any danger of deflation? MARTIN: We've had deflation in a couple of places. I think we've seen the worst of that. The best inflation numbers are here, they're likely to rise, not decline, from here. Nineteen eighty-six will probably see inflation at 2 percent or below, but I think that inflation will be rising later in the year, and we say 4 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, in 1987. We're not talking about a return to high single digits or double-digit inflation anytime in our forecast horizon. Q.: What do you see interest rates doing? MARTIN: In the short term, probably a bit lower; looking out six to 12 months, higher - the short rate in particular, not so much the long rate. But we would see some backup in the T-Bill rate, which, if we go back to Elaine's indicator, might give the market some pause. But I would suggest that at that time we're going to be seeing earnings strongly moving ahead, and the market will be looking at that rather than at the discounter. **********Q.: You have mentioned that your favorite will be auto stocks. Do you like all the Big Three? **********MARTIN: We prefer Ford if we had to pick one, but really it's hard to distinguish. I think the question in Chrysler is what are they going to do with their pile of cash. Are they going to make a major acquisition? An acquisition for Chrysler could be far more important than an acquisition by General Motors. All of their financing subsidiaries are getting more important. **********Q.: Among technology companies is I.B.M. one of your favorites? **********MARTIN: Yes, it's everybody's favorite, I guess, and it's hard to understand why it's not doing very well. Perhaps it's just a question of it being such a big stock, that even if you're underweighted in I.B.M. you may have 5 percent of your portfolio in it, and that's a very important portfolio position. We also agree on Digital Equipment as still being very attractive. In the electronics area, Perkin-Elmer and Tektronics still are attractive. In the electrical equipment area, General Electric and Emerson Electric still look good. 3M is another of the old nifty-fifty type companies, but many of those companies really look to be good values. **********Q.: Is this a time to be fully invested, or would you reserve some cash? Where should an individual investor be in terms of stocks, bonds, funds or cash? **********MARTIN: Professionally I have to be fully invested, but for an individual, I think reason would dictate some cash here. How much is a function of people's circumstances, depending on time horizons, what the money is being invested for. If it's for retirement, that's one thing; if it's for college in five years, that's another thing; if it's for a down payment on a house two years from now, that's another thing. Too many people think of the stock market as an alternative to a trip to Las Vegas. And perhaps, looking one year ahead, it is. But if you're looking five or 10 years ahead, it isn't. It can be viewed as an investment that has a prospect of a good inflation-adjusted rate of return. But a year at a time is hazardous. The market can fluctuate 20 or 30 percent either way, as we've all seen. **********Q.: Mike, the mutual fund business has been going like gang-busters. Why should an individual even try to pick his or her own stocks? Why not just pick a mutual fund and let some professional or group of professionals do all the work? **********LIPPER: They probably should do both - use funds for a core in their investment, and use individual investments, if they happen to have a particular view, where they don't need diversification. The relative size of the core versus the size of the portfolio of individual securities may be a good way to address the question of mixing. I suggest that normally when people are bearish in their equity investments, the fund core might represent 75 percent of the total and the other side 25 percent. The diversification probably means that you lose less. And when one is very bullish, it might be 50-50. **********Q.: How does one go about picking core funds? Is there any guideline, any road map? **********LIPPER: There is no easy way. A most important thing to do is to try to determine what your investment objective is and to find funds that in general fit that objective. In the accounts that we manage in funds, we will spread through a number of funds, or a number of different types. We also try to find funds that have a long enough history that we can identify those periods where they do badly. If you can eliminate the bad securities, or the bad funds, the general pull of the market will give you a very good result without your having to be super bright and pick the absolute winners. **********Q.: In recent years the precious metal and gold funds have not done well relative to other funds. Should one have a precious metal fund in one's portfolio? **********LIPPER: If you go back in history, even to biblical times, there's always been a place for precious metals, well actually, gold. We've talked today about low inflation, we've talked about deflation. Where one loses money or makes a great deal of money is a function typically of surprise, and I would say the great surprise might be inflation. If we had some sort of collapse, the central bank would step in and pump money in, unleashing an unexpected inflation. In a period such as that, yes, I would like to have some hard assets. A lot of people would be nervous owning gold for political or social reasons. One other choice that doesn't correlate as well would be oil, and the natural resource funds were the worst-performing funds in the first quarter. Normally, that means that at some point they're going to be attractive. **********Q: One of the big disappointments in the economy last year was that Standard & Poor's 500-stock index went up roughly 31.79 percent in total returns, and the earnings of the same index fell about 11 percent. Earnings obviously were a big disappointment. Are they going to come back this year? **********MARTIN: Part of that was write-offs, and there'll probably be some more this year. But yes, earnings will come back. We're thinking 10 or 12 percent this year from a number that's adjusted for some of those write-offs, not 15 or 20 percent, as some people have said for a couple of years. But earnings will grow enough to justify a good return on stocks over the next several years. **********Q.: Let's talk a bit about your foreign equity commitments. How much do you have invested? MARTIN: About $2.5 billion. Q.: How do you break that down among the top three countries, say? **********MARTIN: Japan is by far the largest with about 45 percent of the money. Britain is next, about 18 percent, and Canada would be third at about 12 percent. The yen return last year, if you were a dollar investor, was substantial. The market may not have been a winner, but the yen was. **********Q.: Can you forecast whether foreign stocks will outperform United States stocks over the second half of this year? **********MARTIN: We don't have a measure of that. We do believe that most foreign economies are going to grow at rates better than thought, say, six months ago, and you see the numbers being revised upward in Europe in particular. The German market, for example, in dollar terms last year was up 139 percent. The best-performing funds, as Michael well knows, were the international funds last year, and again in the first quarter they did very well. But I think most of the dollar return has been achieved. We think the dollar has a bit further to go, but that should be a gradual process over several months to a couple of years. And it may be no more than 10 percent from here. So the dollar returns don't seem to be a prospect. If we look at things like cash flows and yields, those markets aren't cheap any longer relative to the United States. **********Q.: How do you two feel about that? **********LIPPER: I think markets are driven, in part, out of fundamentals and part out of cash flow from investors, both individuals and institutions. In European equity markets there is still significant underinvestment, particularly on the Continent, by their financial institutions. Also, European governments are encouraging capital formation at the individual level by giving tax breaks for investment in securities. That will last longer than perhaps the valuation gap that probably has been closed. **********MARTIN: It's true, Michael, isn't it, that pension funds and other institutions in Germany are still only invested 4 percent in their own market? **********LIPPER: Yes, it's also true of the insurance companies in the Netherlands, which is one of the great cheap markets of the world. **********Q.: Do you think any particular foreign countries are attractive now? **********GARZARELLI: How about Italy? **********LIPPER: Italy was very strong. But there's a significant problem about settlement of trades in Italy. MARTIN: Without question. LIPPER: The cheap markets around the world typically are there because there is an apparent reason for them to be cheap. They typically are commodity-based, such as Mexico or Canada. Or they lack liquidity, such as Korea. Or they have had a lot of internal problems - Singapore and Malaysia. The easy money's been made, I think, pretty much around the world. What we have to do now is sift through those things that haven't gone up and try to find a reason to contradict the popular view that they're not great investments. **********Q.: If a person should have part of his or her portfolio in mutual funds, should overseas funds be part of that pot? **********LIPPER: I think very definitely, because it's much easier for the individual to invest overseas through a fund than in individual securities. I also think that if you look at the world economy and the world stock markets, the United States now represents under 50 percent of the total. And if you were running your own portfolio on a world basis, you would have 50 percent outside. We are driving cars in which at least some parts - if not the nameplate - come from overseas. And you're probably watching a television set in which at least some parts, if not the whole thing, came from overseas. So we have a very real personal dollar risk. So I think that we should be internationally diversified, and for both individuals and most institutions, mutual funds are the preferred way to do it. **********Q.: In the next year or two, do you see any fundamental new developments within the mutual fund industry? **********LIPPER: Right now the creative juices of the investment community have been primarily directed into fixed income, and fairly little of it in equities. At some point that will be rebalanced, and therefore a lot more money will come into equities, and we will have new types of equity funds. For example, I'd like to see a fund that followed Elaine's cash flow analysis. That might work very well. And it certainly might give those of us at portfolio funds some very real diversifications. It would take us into securities that are not popularly owned. That's going to be the trick, to find securities and funds investing in those securities that are not popular that work. **********MARTIN: Do you think there's going to be any decline in the industry's fee structure, given the huge increase in the number of funds? **********LIPPER: As long as we're producing double-digit returns, I don't think the market is particularly fee sensitive. Also, as long as the cost to get an investor either to buy an individual security or a fund is going up, I think the expenses are going to be very high. Whether we have a price war in funds, I don't know. There are funds that have lower expenses and they try to make that a virtue, but I don't know anybody who buys a fund because it has a lower expense as its only virtue. **********Q.: Elaine, as a representative of a major investment firm, what are retail customers saying now? **********GARZARELLI: In the last two months we've had a big increase in retail business. A lot of people who want to get into the market now are cashing in their bonds. Seven and a half percent, when they were getting 8 to 10 percent just a little while ago isn't that attractive. So time after time brokers call me and say, ''Do you have any small stocks? Anything under $15? Anything under $10?'' That's really where much of the interest is. **********Q.: If the little guy's rushing in, is it time to get out? **********GARZARELLI: It's too early. You've got another eight months at least. **********LIPPER: The key to this market has been confidence. **********Q.: Confidence in whom or what? **********LIPPER: Confidence, growing confidence that the society is getting better. **********Q.: If that's the key, what's to prevent a tulipomania phenomenon from occuring? **********LIPPER: I would suggest that it's a very real risk. **********Q.: Let's end with a fun question. If you had to pick three stocks and hold them for two years, what would you pick? **********MARTIN: I.B.M., I.B.M., I.B.M. **********GARZARELLI: I'll give you three stocks under 15 dollars: Chi Chi's Inc., Seagate Technologies and the R.L.C. Corporation. Q.: Mike, you can pick funds instead of stocks if you like. **********LIPPER: Okay, Mexico Fund and any one of the natural resource funds - Energy Fund, T. Rowe Price New Era. **********GARZARELLI: Would you name Fidelity Magellan? **********LIPPER: No, that's not a surprise. In this sort of contest you want a surprise. **********Q.: Thank you very much."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/world/the-japanese-sit-on-fence-on-us-raids.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Haberman", "pub_date": "1986-04-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 670, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE JAPANESE SIT ON FENCE ON U.S. RAIDS", "print_headline": "THE JAPANESE SIT ON FENCE ON U.S. RAIDS", "body_text": " **********Japan, rarely bold in its foreign policy, has been thrown into a state of virtual diplomatic paralysis for the last week by the American air strikes against Libya. **********Unlike every other major United States ally, the Japanese Government has yet to issue any statement clearly stating what it thinks of the American action. **********Displeased officials also have disputed senior members of the Reagan Administration, who were quoted in Japanese press reports from the United States as saying that Japan supported the raids. **********Publicly, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and other leaders have said only that they are monitoring the situation and hope that it will not worsen. They have issued no substantive statement indicating support or disapproval of Washington's position. **********Predicament for Japan **********This crisis, more than any other in recent years, has put the Japanese in the predicament of having to choose between its most important ally and an oil-exporting country that enjoys the support of other major oil producers in the Middle East. **********Since the energy crisis of 1973, oil-poor Japan has been careful to say and do nothing that might offend Islamic countries. Now, torn between what it sees as its obligations to the United States and its dependence on Middle Eastern countries for 70 percent of its oil, Japan has elected to say nothing. **********''I think it is difficult,'' said Moto Shiina, a member of Parliament from the ruling party who is involved with international matters. **********Japanese foreign policy is usually given scant attention abroad because it tends to be noncommittal, or else it is articulated too late for anyone else to care. But some Japanese feel that this crisis has placed Mr. Nakasone in the spotlight to an unusual degree. **********For one thing, the American bombing of Tripoli occurred last week just as the Japanese leader was leaving Washington after talks with President Reagan. That coincidence raised questions here about whether Mr. Nakasone was told of the United States' plans and whether he had signaled approval. **********A more pressing worry for the Japanese is the prospect that terrorism will become a priority issue at the meeting of the leaders of the major industrial democracies, to be held in Tokyo from May 4 to 6. Some political analysts here say that if the United States insists on a joint statement denouncing Libya or calling for further sanctions, Mr. Nakasone will be placed in an extremely awkward, and perhaps untenable, position as the conference host. Some Foreign Criticism **********Japanese officials and political leaders are sensitive to occasional foreign criticism that they are ''soft'' on terrorism. For many foreigners, this perception crystallized when the Tokyo Government freed six jailed terrorists in 1977 as demanded by Japanese urban guerrillas who had hijacked a Japan Air Lines jet and ordered it flown to Bangladesh. **********All 156 airplane hostages were released unharmed, but Japan's quick acquiescence to terrorist demands was widely denounced overseas. **********A stir was created here last week when Japanese newspapers quoted the White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, as saying that President Reagan understood he had the tacit support of Mr. Nakasone. Kyodo, the Japanese news agency, also quoted Vice President Bush in a report from New York as singling out Japan and Canada as ''clearly supporting'' the American air raids. **********These assertions were denied by Japanese leaders. **********Mr. Nakasone insisted that while he was in Washington President Reagan had informed him the United States would take action against Libya, but did not say what kind. ''I received no explanation on when or where anything would take place,'' the Prime Minister said. **********In addition, while he also was in Washington last week, Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe said that the Reagan Administration ''must have its own reason'' for the Tripoli bombing. To some people here, that comment suggested support, but the Foreign Ministry has insisted that the Government does not take sides."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/11/business/japan-under-pressure-for-further-rise-in-yen.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1986-04-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 636, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JAPAN UNDER PRESSURE FOR FURTHER RISE IN YEN", "print_headline": "JAPAN UNDER PRESSURE FOR FURTHER RISE IN YEN", "body_text": " **********World financial leaders put Japan on notice today that it must allow the yen to reach still higher values to achieve a more stable international economic order. **********The emphasis on Japan at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making Interim Committee may have amounted to an early test of a newly evolving monetary plan in which international peer group pressure and possibly some automatic guidelines would be applied to assure convergence of economic and exchange-rate policies. **********The Interim Committee today formally directed the I.M.F. staff to come up with a series of economic performance indicators, such as economic growth, the trade balance and interest rates, that could be used as a guide to determine whether individual countries' policies are deviating from international economic goals. **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d was referring to such criteria in a speech to the conference Wednesday in which he said a strengthened exchange-rate system should ''contain a somewhat greater degree of automaticity in addressing problems that develop.'' **********'Peer Group Pressure' **********Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, said he had asked Mr. Baker what he meant by greater automaticity and that Mr. Baker had replied ''peer group pressure.'' Despite the contradiction between the apparent meaning of automaticity and the Baker comment reported by Mr. Lawson, Treasury officials refused to discuss what the Secretary had in mind. Earlier, there had been indications that he may have meant something more far-reaching involving predetermined rules. **********Comments, both public and private, of American, British, German, French and other officials suggested that something like peer group pressure was already being applied very strongly against Japan. **********''Practically everybody, with the exception of the Japanese, felt that the yen needs to go higher,'' Mr. Lawson said. The present value of the yen, around 180 to the dollar, reflected conditions before the collapse of oil prices earlier this year, he said. **********''The Japanese are the biggest beneficiaries of the oil-price collapse, and therefore it would be surprising if there were not some further appreciation'' of the yen, Mr. Lawson said. Japan imports practically all its oil. Effects of Yen's Rise **********A higher-valued yen, combined with increased domestic consumption, would tend to keep more Japanese production within Japan and reduce the surpluses. The yen has risen by about 20 percent in the last six months, and many small and medium-size Japanese enterprises are complaining that their export sales are being hurt. **********The new pressure on Japan has come just before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's weekend visit with President Reagan at Camp David, Md. In three weeks the Japanese leader will be the host of an economic summit meeting in Tokyo. **********The communique issued after the Interim Committee meeting urged that economic policies be conducted in a ''sound and mutually consistent way'' and called the formulation of objective indicators ''an approach worth exploring.'' **********The communique also reflected sentiments of the ministers that there should be a further lowering of interest rates worldwide.

Straight Reports on News **********One is that the Government has obviously not been trying to work up either public fervor or fear. The official nightly news on television tonight reported Mr. Reagan was ''screaming like a mad dog'' in attempts to get European economic sanctions against Libya for ''what he called Qaddafi's terrorism.'' But it was a short item in the middle of the program and was followed with a straight report that American aircraft carriers were returning to sea for an ''unspecified'' time off Libya. **********The report also turned some of Mr. Reagan's descriptions of Colonel Qaddafi into compliments. It said that Mr. Reagan ''publicly admitted that Colonel Qaddafi was leading the world and Islamic revolution.'' **********The report omitted that President Reagan called Colonel Qaddafi the ''mad dog of the Middle East.'' **********Another reason for the lack of public fervor were divisions in the Libyan body politic over Colonel Qaddafi, according to Western diplomats and residents here. Libyan youths who make up many of the ''revolutionary committees'' and local militia have been brought up to back Colonel Qaddafi during his 16 years in power. Much of the working class also backed Colonel Qaddafi, according to the long-time residents. The Silent Opposition **********But many middle-class professionals, shopkeepers and even Government bureaucrats are either silently opposed to Colonel Qaddafi or doubtful about the course in which he is leading his nation, according to the foreigners here. They are concerned about their nation becoming isolated in the world and economically cut off if the American-imposed sanctions spread to other countries. **********In Benghazi, opposition to Colonel Qaddafi is said to be more vocal. The city, the country's second largest, is made up mostly of a different tribal composition than Tripoli. The naval base there suffered the brunt of the casualties in the clashes with the Sixth Fleet nearly three weeks ago in the Gulf of Sidra. A businessman returning from Benghazi reported that a list of 72 names of sailors who had died in the clashes were publicly posted on the base there. Colonel Qaddafi has not acknowledged the deaths except to say that some occurred. **********''It is not important how many people died,'' he said in the news conference.

The economy, they feared, would slip into recession again in 1986, finally tiring after more than three years of solid growth. **********But the feisty stock market and plunging interest rates have changed all that. Economists all over are expecting another respectable - albeit not sizzling -performance this year. (See graphics display on Page 4.) Exploding stock values have added more than $1 trillion to the nation's wealth over the last 18 months, experts say, giving consumers added confidence and new buying power. But business leaders fear that increased competition at home and abroad could make this a tough year. To flesh out the details, industry by industry, The New York Times asked its own specialists to look ahead for 1986. Here are their reports. **********If 1985 was the year when defense contractors realized the party was over, 1986 threatens to be the year of the throbbing hangover. The biggest sustained military buildup since World War II is over, and now the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget measure, signed into law Dec. 12, raises the prospect of real reductions in the Pentagon's weapons-buying. **********The measure, if it survives a constitutional challenge, would set on course a series of automatic budget cuts unless - and nobody is betting on this - Congress and the President can agree to restrain spending on their own. Thus, the initial impact will be to slow the assembly lines churning out tanks, fighter planes and missiles. Pentagon officials say they may also have to renegotiate existing contracts. **********Gramm-Rudman will almost certainly increase the pressure to scrap some programs, beginning with those plagued by technical troubles or cost overruns - Hughes Aircraft's AMRAAM air-to-air missile, for instance. New programs that are just about to blossom into big spenders -the McDonnell Douglas Corporation C-17, or the Midgetman missile -might also be vulnerable. **********Exactly how the cutbacks will be spread across the industry is a mystery, and some weapons makers still hold out hope that Congress will recoil from the consequences of its antideficit measure and raise taxes instead. But most analysts expect Gramm-Rudman to eat away at industry revenues, perhaps severely. Faced with declining budgets, the traditional approach of the military and Congress is to kill nothing, but wound everything. And Gramm-Rudman encourages that approach. **********Budget pressures will probably cut into efforts to infuse more stability and competition into arms-buying. For example, the Navy plans to break the monopoly of General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division on the huge Trident nuclear missile submarine. But efforts to entice Newport News Shipbuilding into competition may be scrapped if the Navy cannot afford to tool up a second shipyard. **********Some players in the Gramm-Rudman guessing game also predict that the military and its manufacturers will contrive to push as many programs as possible under the rubric of the one program with Presidential blessing, ''Star Wars.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/10/business/washington-watch-telecommunications-problem.html": {"writer_name": "Reginald Stuart", "pub_date": "1986-02-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 295, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Telecommunications Problem", "print_headline": "WASHINGTON WATCH; Telecommunications Problem", "body_text": " **********White House personnel officials are trying to figure out how to resolve a politically embarrassing situation regarding the selection of a new Assistant Secretary of Commerce and director of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the agency that advises the White House on telecommunications policy. **********David Markey resigned the post last fall to accept a lobbying job with BellSouth, one of the new regional telephone holding companies. **********With Mr. Markey's blessings, Rodney Joyce, then minority counsel to the House Subcommitttee on Telecommunications, was named acting director by Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige.

However, in his proposed budget for the 1987 fiscal year, President Reagan asked Congress to increase financing for the telecommunications agency by about $600,000, to nearly $14 million. Most of the increase would go toward further development of international telecommunications business opportunities."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/business/tin-decision-is-delayed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-14", "snippet": "", "word_count": 83, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Tin Decision Is Delayed", "print_headline": "Tin Decision Is Delayed", "body_text": " **********The London Metal Exchange has deferred a decision on the future of its tin contracts and will meet again on Jan. 20, the exchange's chief executive, Michael Brown, said today. **********He said no decision had been made because the results of a proposal to rescue the International Tin Council was awaited.

As the new Minister of International Trade and Industry, however, Mr. Watanabe may have a more formidable task -convincing Japanese consumers and business executives to buy foreign goods. **********Mr. Watanabe is noted in Japan as a blunt, earthy politician, with a gift for explaining complex ideas with homey analogies and a passion for taking his case to the public. In one year alone as Finance Minister, he made 118 radio and television appearances and delivered 232 speeches. **********Now he has a new message - the importance of maintaining the free trade system. ''Because we sell goods, we need to buy goods, too,'' he said during a recent interview, getting into the stump speech he is now delivering all over Japan. ''Imagine a liquor seller in a farm village. If he sells a lot of liquor to farmers, and if he strictly demands payment, and the farmers go bankrupt, then his liquor business will collapse. If Japan sells aggressively, and her business counterparts collapse, she cannot collect the money. If the consumers become poor, how can the producer prosper? That is trade.'' Escalating Trade Frictions **********Mr. Watanabe, who is 62 years old, became Japan's Trade Minister last December in a Cabinet reshuffle. He was appointed, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said at the time, to serve as a strong leader for the Trade Ministry at a time when trade frictions were escalating. In his first few months on the job, Mr. Watanabe has already established himself as a forceful presence, in contrast to some recent predecessors. **********A short, somewhat round man with a gravely voice, Mr. Watanabe is every bit the politician. He welcomes visitors to his office by handing out cigarette lighters bearing a caricature of himself and his English nickname, ''Mitchy,'' short for Michio and a pun on the English abbreviation for the trade ministry, ''MITI.'' **********His down-to-earth approach was apparently a hit at the quadrilateral trade ministers' meeting this January in San Diego. And in one of his first moves as Trade Minister, he helped to push the ministry toward an early decision to extend Japan's auto export quotas, thereby deflecting an explosive trade issue with the United States. **********But he is also capable of standing up to American officials. He has supported a controversial loan program to small and medium-sized businesses hurt by the rapid appreciation of the yen. American officials have criticized the program as a thinly disguised effort to keep Japanese exports competitive, and have threatened to file suit under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. When American trade officials were in Tokyo recently to press their views on the issue, Mr. Watanabe reportedly chastised them for getting so upset about a ''trivial'' issue. Stints in Several Ministries **********Such forthrightness, somewhat unusual for Japanese leaders, has been Mr. Watanabe's trademark throughout a political career that has included stints as the Minister of Health and Welfare and Agriculture and Finance. **********Occasionally, his outspokenness lands him in trouble. He was recently forced to make a formal apology in the Parliament for a remark likening Japan's opposition parties to fishermen using a false lure, promising to improve Japanese life without the fiscal austerity deemed necessary by the ruling party. **********But he is still a very popular politician, one often mentioned as a possible candidate for Prime Minister. Mr. Watanabe credits much of his political success to hardships during his youth. He was raised by an uncle, who encouraged him to get an education despite the family's straitened financial circumstances. He was drafted during World War II and became an army accountant. **********After the war, he started a small trading business, buying goods from farmers and selling them in cities. ''As a peddler I learned how to bow, how to catch someone's attention, how to charm,'' he said. ''These were what I needed then to make a living, but now I am good at elections.'' His trading business failed, however, and he returned to accounting. Backer of Farm Aid **********Mr. Watanabe's home district is in rural Tochigi prefecture, and many of his constituents are farmers. He was known in Japan's Parliament as a determined backer of Government support for rice farmers - in one famous incident in 1968, he and some colleagues smashed Coca-Cola bottles and turned over tables to protest low rice prices. Now he is trying to convince farmers, often the most fervent opponents of increasing foreign imports, that they need to put aside their objections so Japan's industry can avoid retaliation from the nation's trading partners that could cause the farmers' relatives and friends to lose jobs. **********And Mr. Watanabe does not hesitate to criticize Americans for failing to make enough of an effort to export to Japan. ''When Japanese businessmen go to America, they speak English,'' he said. ''But when I was at the Ministry of Finance, the presidents of many banks and insurance branches in Japan often visited me. I did not meet any Japanese-speaking foreign bankers. I guess a little bit more effort is needed. And I think many Americans have the misunderstanding that goods that sell in America will sell well here, too.'' **********Despite his folksy manner, Mr. Watanabe has a shrewd and detailed grasp of economic issues. Political appointees to Cabinet posts in Japan are often little more than figureheads, making the rounds of public appearances while career bureaucrats really run the ministries. **********But Mr. Watanabe played a key role in determining financial policy during his term as Finance Minister, and is expected to do the same during his tenure as Trade Minister. His main tasks as Trade Minister, he said, will be to push ahead with the market-opening measures adopted last year by the Government, support the effort to expand Japan's domestic demand to allow consumers and business to buy more foreign goods and continue his public relations campaign."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/business/kohlberg-seeks-to-pay-less-cash-for-beatrice.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1986-01-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 516, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KOHLBERG SEEKS TO PAY LESS CASH FOR BEATRICE", "print_headline": "KOHLBERG SEEKS TO PAY LESS CASH FOR BEATRICE", "body_text": " **********Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, which has agreed to buy the Beatrice Companies for $6.2 billion, has proposed modifying the terms of the acquisition so that it would pay less cash, Beatrice announced today. **********The price of Beatrice's stock plummeted in heavy trading in reaction to the proposed modification in which Kohlberg would pay $40 in cash and $10 in preferred stock. On Nov. 14, Beatrice announced that it had accepted an offer from Kohlberg, a New York-based investment firm, to acquire it for $43 in cash and $7 in preferred stock. **********''They just didn't feel comfortable with that level of debt,'' said William Leach, an analyst with the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation. He estimated that the new package was worth $3 to $4 a share less than the previous package.

Volume was 6.7 million shares, making it the most heavily traded stock. **********Analysts said Beatrice shares fell sharply not only because the proposal was worth less than the previous package, but also because it raised the possibility that the whole deal could fall through.

Carnes, an analyst with Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, speculated that Beatrice's board might shop for new offers. However, he predicted that the deal would go through, as did some other analysts and officials close to the companies. **********''What K.K.R. is proposing is close to its original offer that Beatrice's board rejected,'' Mr. Carnes said. ''But inertia has things rolling, and I imagine it would be pretty tough to stop the deal.'' **********Mr. Carnes suggested that Kohlberg proposed the modification to give the acquirer more breathing room to repay its huge debt. **********A spokesman for Kohlberg said the firm had no comment, as did a spokesman for Donald M. Kelly, the former Esmark chairman who is joining Kohlberg in the deal. Esmark was acquired by Beatrice in 1984. **********One source close to both sides said that Kohlberg, upon examining Beatrice's books, had found its earnings had been inflated more than expected by nonrecurring items. **********''This is not a takeover by a cash-rich tobacco company,'' Mr. Leach said. ''It is a hostile leveraged buyout that entails much more risk.'' **********Although he said the latest development could ''be the tip of the iceberg'' regarding snags in the deal, Mr. Leach predicted that the Beatrice board would accept the deal. If the board were to pull out, he said, Beatrice's stock could drop sharply. **********Beatrice also said today that Kohlberg had said it would immediately begin discussions with its lenders regarding the revised proposal."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/world/around-the-world-ground-fighting-heavy-in-iran-iraq-war.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 170, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Ground Fighting Heavy In Iran-Iraq War", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Ground Fighting Heavy In Iran-Iraq War", "body_text": " **********Heavy ground fighting was reported today in the Iran-Iraq war, and Iranian television showed Iranian soldiers in sight of a large mountain settlement it said was Chwarta, some nine miles inside northern Iraq. **********The Teheran radio said Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas made an overnight attack in support of Iran's offensive on the road between Chwarta and Sulaimaniya, capital of Iraq's Kurdish Sulaimaniya province, a strategic target 170 miles northeast of Baghdad. **********The Iranian press agency said the Kurds captured 40 Iraqi soldiers, while Iranian troops shelled an Iraqi garrison, killing 150 Iraqis. **********A communique issued by Baghdad said 800 Iranian soldiers were killed in battles near Chwarta and Penjwin. **********Gulf shipping officials said a Turkish tanker heading for Saudi Arabia was bombed today by five warplanes, killing the ship's chief officer and wounding a crew member.

Gorbachev, the Soviet leader. **********The two sides remain far apart on the central arms control issues, such as Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative to carry out intensive research on anti-missile systems. But the talks on reducing the risk of accidental nuclear war, officials said, could afford an opportunity to reach an accord that would suffice for a summit meeting. Though the issue is peripheral, it is deemed significant by some Administration officials and members of Congress. **********Russian Indicated Interest **********The Soviet Union conveyed its interest in resuming the talks when Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, came to Washington last month to meet with Secretary of State George P. Shultz, according to Administration officials. **********The officials said resuming the talks was one of the first matters raised by Mr. Bessmertnykh. The United States had proposed a follow-up session at the first round of talks, which took place in early May. **********At the initial round, the United States outlined its proposal to reduce the risk of accidental war through the establishment of ''nuclear risk reduction centers'' in Washington and Moscow. **********According to the Administration's proposal, the centers would be separately staffed by American and Soviet officials and would be used to trade information on military activities to reduce the chances that a nuclear war could arise out of miscalculation. Notice of Tests and Exercises **********One senior Administration official said the information that might be exchanged could include notice of all missile tests and of major exercises involving strategic forces, such as flights of bombers. **********The Administration has suggested in its negotiating proposal in the Geneva arms talks that such information be exchanged as one of its ''confidence-building measures.'' But one official said such information exchanges might be negotiated as part of an agreement establishing risk reduction centers. **********The Soviet Union did not indicate what it thought of the American concept for the centers at the Geneva session. Government experts said it was now up to the Soviet Union to say what it thinks of that proposal or to advance alternative ideas at the next round of talks on risk reduction. **********Richard N. Perle, an Assistant Defense Secretary, and Col. Robert E. Linhard, an Air Force officer and a member of the White House National Security Council, headed the American delegation to the first round of talks and are expected to do so in the coming round as well. **********The Soviet negotiator is Aleksei A. Obukhov, the Soviet negotiator in Geneva on strategic weapons. Promoted by 2 Senators **********The proposal for risk reduction centers has been promoted by Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and John W. Warner of Virginia, members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Administration interest in the talks is, in part, intended to address these Congressional concerns. **********The original concept as advanced by the Senators was more expansive than the one eventually embraced by the Administration. The Senators, for example, have said the centers could be used as a American and Soviet forum on the question of how to cope with episodes of nuclear terrorism. But the Administration has resisted this suggestion and has not formally proposed it to Moscow, Government officials say. **********The risk reduction talks are one of set of negotiations that are expected over the next month or so. **********Administration officials also disclosed today that talks on preventing the spread of chemical weapons were set to resume in September. The first round of those talks in March was said to have been constructive. 'Star Wars' Assailed **********Administration officials said there was no important movement at the recent talks in Moscow dealing with central arms control issues such as the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly called ''Star Wars.'' They also said that while those sessions where basically nonpolemical, they included a speech by Col. Gen. Nikolai F. Chervov of the Soviet General Staff assailing ''Star Wars.'' **********Administration officials gave different evaluations of the value of the Moscow session, which was suggested by the Soviet Union to prepare for a meeting in mid-September between Mr. Shultz and Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister. Spokesmen for the State Department and the White House have described the meetings as serious, substantive and businesslike. **********One Administration officials said it was unrealistic to expect that the sessions would make important progress and added that they had helped improve the atmosphere for negotiations, which he said have been deeply marred in the past by mutual mistrust. **********But some conservative Administration officials maintain that the White House and the State Department are trying to put the best face on the Moscow session for political reasons. **********They say the White House wants to encourage the idea that productive discussions are going on with the Russians to counter the Congressional criticism that Mr. Reagan's decision to repudiate the second strategic arms treaty of 1979 and to press ahead with anti-missile research has upset American and Soviet arms control negotiations. Suggested at Summit Talks **********The suggestion for talks on risk reduction centers and on chemical weapons were contained in the communique at the Geneva summit meeting in November between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev. **********The communique spoke of risk reduction centers in general terms, and it was initially unclear whether they would be the subject of separate talks, as the Americans have proposed, or would be taken up in the larger Geneva arms talks, as the Russians had initially suggested privately. **********The Soviet Union later agreed to separate talks but signaled that it saw a link between the two talks by appointing Mr. Obukhov, of the Geneva arms team, as its negotiator to the risk reduction talks. **********A past Soviet concern was that negotiating an agreement on risk reduction would be a way for the Administration to assert to public opinion that it was making progress on arms control without making concessions on ''Star Wars'' and other major issues. **********But a summit meeting later this year would create pressure on both sides to come up with tangible arms control agreements. And some American officials say they believe the Soviet Union might drop this linkage. SOVIET DOUBTS U.S. SERIOUSNESS  MOSCOW, Aug. 17 (AP) - Talks by American and Soviet officials in Moscow last week do not seem to have produced any progress or to have shown that the United States is ready for a serious summit meeting, a leading Soviet commentator said today. **********The commentator, Aleksandr Y. Bovin, speaking on Soviet television, said that the two days of talks were ''a free search for ideas'' but that there had been ''no movement in positions.'' **********''The Soviet attitude to the new Soviet-U.S. summit is quite clear: We are for a meeting that would help tackle some existing problems and which would be a real and concrete move forward in Soviet-American relations,'' Mr. Bovin said. ''We want it to end in a constructive way and a real and practical step to be made toward disarmament,'' he said. ''But one gets the impression that Washington is not ready for this.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/business/in-pursuit-of-the-perfect-golf-ball.html": {"writer_name": "N.

A golf ball rockets off the tee in a perfect trajectory and then plunks down, skitters a bit, and comes to a stop 247 yards away, slightly down the right side of the 9th hole of the Kittansett Country Club in Marion, Mass. **********Whoosh. This one, bounding down the center of the fairway, expires 266 yards away. **********Some golfer. Fortunately, you'll never have to meet him in the finals of the club championship. He's a robot. This really isn't the 9th hole at Kittansett. This is inside a theater-like room in New Bedford, Mass., at a laboratory of the Acushnet Company, one of the dominant makers of golf balls. The robot - known as ''Iron Byron,'' since its swing mimicks the classic motion of the stellar professional, Byron Nelson - is firing balls at a net, behind which is a slide projection of Kittansett's 9th hole. Infrared cameras connected to a computer reveal precisely where - and how far -the balls went. The researchers have been studying the aerodynamics of a golf ball, in particular what happens when you change the little circular indentations known as dimples. **********It is all part of Acushnet's quest to make a golf ball that goes farther and straighter than any other - satisfying the golfer's longing for a ball that will, undoubtedly, improve his game. ''The golf ball is very elusive,'' says Wally Uihlein, Acushnet's general manager. ''It's a very mysterious little white sphere.'' **********And Acushnet is hardly alone in trying to fathom the secrets of that little white sphere. A small group of sporting goods companies is in hot pursuit of the perfect golf ball, using the latest in high technology and aerodynamics -computers, simulated golf courses, wind tunnels and complicated mathematics - to create a better version of the little ball that's been used in one form of golf or another since the Roman Empire. **********These companies are feisty competitors for a small but lucrative market. Last year, golfers bought 225 million golf balls, about two dozen per golfer, or $250 million worth. The business is a tough one. Since few new courses are being built, sales grow just 2 to 5 percent a year, so the only way to expand is to get golfers to switch balls - and that's why golf ball companies are bending over backward, using big research and development and marketing efforts, to convince players that their balls are best. Anytime someone comes up with a ''better'' ball, it quickly sells millions. **********Acushnet, a subsidiary of American Brands, and Spalding, a division of Spalding-Evenflo Inc., a privately held Florida company, have ruled the ball world for years. Each now makes about 35 to 40 percent of all balls bought, far greater than third-place Wilson. The market shares have held fairly steady for years, but that is not grounds for complacency. More than 350 different ball models are sold - and market shares bob up and down like handicaps, each time some company manages to convince golfers that it has developed a ''better'' ball. **********Evidently, improvement in the business is measured in small ways. Experts at the United States Golf Association do not think balls actually travel much farther now than they did 10 years ago - despite all the high-tech hoopla and advertising. Unlike football players, however, golfers inherently believe that the kind of equipment they use - particularly the kind of ball they use - can make them the next Jack Nicklaus. They'll try anything new. **********''The golfer will never settle for anything,'' explains Dave Lumley, Wilson's marketing director. ''He's too insecure. The golfer is a crazy guy. This guy gets up at 5:30 in the morning. One stroke means more than his mother to him. If he thinks a new ball will go a 20th of an inch longer, that's his ball.'' **********''Longer'' is the operative word. Every duffer craves more yards, and so distance is the special fixation of golf ball companies. Balls hit by strong players these days can soar more than 300 yards, yet no one seems content. ''In golf ball marketing, there's one thing that counts - what is the longest ball,'' Mr. Lumley says. ''And all the manufacturers claim they have the longest ball.'' **********Ads for Acushnet, which makes Titleist and Pinnacle brands, insist that ''golfers agree no other ball comes close to the Titleist 384 DT for distance, feel and control.'' Its major rival, Spalding, disagrees: One of its ads for Top-Flites quotes Alan Shepard, the former astronaut, as saying, ''Look, no other golf ball on earth can beat 'em.'' **********Dunlop's new Master, for its part, is shown in commercials sailing across the Grand Canyon as other balls crash against the rocks. Hogan says its ball has ''unbeatable distance.'' Ram asserts that its Tour 400 ''carries consistently and controllably farther, on the fly, than any leading ball tested.'' And Wilson says that a computer confirmed its Wilson 432 as the best and longest ball. **********Who's right, then? What is the longest ball in golf and how did it get there? THE first golf ball, created by the Romans for a game they called paganica, consisted of feathers wrapped in leather. If you really swatted it, it would go 150 yards. By the mid-15th century, golf as we now know it was being played in Scotland. But major changes in the ball did not come until 1848, with the development of a rubber ball, the gutta percha, which was cheaper and sturdier. It was replaced, in 1899, by much superior ''Bounding Billies'' - rubber bands wound around a small rubber core. At first they were covered with gutta-percha and later with a rubber called balata. **********Then designers learned something odd. A new gutta percha didn't go as far as a feather ball. But once it got nicked and scratched, it soared 60 percent farther. This aerodynamics lesson led, at the turn of the century, to the bramble ball, which was covered with tiny bumps. In 1905, bumps gave way to dimples. **********In the 1960's, Du Pont perfected a cover material called Surlyn, a thermo-plastic that, unlike balata, resisted cutting when the ball was struck improperly, the way most golfers hit it just before they throw their club at a tree. Nine out of 10 players now use Surlyn balls, although the finest golfers favor balata because the ball spins more and stops faster. **********In 1968, Spalding, which counts on golf ball sales for 50 percent of all its sportings goods revenue, rocked the golf world when it created a two-piece ball consisting of a solid plastic center with a Surlyn cover. The ball shot off the tee at a higher angle and flew farther than the old balls. Today, more than half the balls sold are two-piece. **********Things quieted down until, in the 1970's, ball companies went dimple crazy. Dimples, acting like wings on a plane, reduce drag resistance; the number, size, depth and alignment of dimples significantly affect the flight of a golf ball. **********For decades, dimples were arranged in circular rows known as an Atti pattern. In 1973, as the fruit of development work done with M.I.T. scientists, Acushnet brought out a ball with the dimples arranged in 20 triangular regions, a so-called icosahedron pattern. This arrangement resulted in lower drag and more distance. Other ball makers quickly copied it, although Dunlop, in 1981, created a ''dodachahedral'' pattern of 12 pentagons intended to cancel the effect of the ball's seam on its flight. **********Until 1983, most golf balls boasted dimple counts of 324 to 336. In the last few years, though, ball makers have begun suggesting that more dimples mean more distance, even though that is only sometimes true. In 1983, the Titleist 384 Tour ball arrived, named for the number of dimples. Pros said it was the hottest ball ever.  MacGregor countered with a ball with 392 dimples. Hogan followed suit. In 1984, Spalding weighed in with the 492-dimple Top-Flite Plus. That may or may not be the world's most dimpled golf ball. Bridgestone, a Japanese company, makes the Altus, which it claims has 318 tiny dimples contained within 318 larger dimples. Acushnet people, however, say they've put the ball under a microscope and can't find any of the 318 tiny dimples. **********The high-tech research continues. ''We could come out with a ball where every dimple is a different size,'' Mr. Uihlein says. ''We're looking at that. The limit to what you could do is only limited by your imagination.'' **********And the rules. The U.S.G.A., which governs golf in this country, sets limits on size, weight, initial velocity, overall distance and symmetry. Balls, for example, cannot be smaller than 1.68 inches in diameter or weigh more than 1.62 ounces. Under specified swing conditions, they cannot travel more than 296.8 yards, a limit that no balls have reached, though they've gotten close. **********In 1983, Wilson, which had been losing sales, invested a couple of million dollars into computers and set out to find the perfect dimple arrangement. It looked at designs varying from 12 dimples to 1,212; the computer said to try somewhere between 280 and 590. Prototypes were built and Wilson, which became a division last year of the privately held Wesray Capital Corporation, determined that a dimple count of 432 was ideal. In Iron Byron tests, Wilson says the ball went farther than any other. A balata-covered version was introduced for pros and a Surlyn ball, the Ultra, came out last year for the weekend golfer. **********Spalding, meanwhile, has spent the last five years and $5 million producing a cover material it calls Zinthane. It put it on a new ball, the Tour Edition, aimed at better players. It is being priced at $32 a dozen, highest on the market (balls usually sell for between $9.95 a dozen and $28), but Spalding says the ball outperforms balata while resisting cutting. **********''It's always, 'Use this product and you'll hit the ball 20 yards longer,' '' says Frank Thomas, the U.S.G.A.'s technical director. ''Add all the claims up and I should be driving 400 yards. Boy would that be nice.'' **********The truth is, according to Mr. Thomas, the new balls don't go more than about eight yards farther than the models of 10 years ago. The dimple business, he says, is mostly a marketing gimmick. Many golfers are hitting 20 or 30 yards farther, he agrees, but that's because they're stronger, clubs are better, teaching is better and fairways are mown closer. Then aren't the ads misleading? ''Yes,'' he says, ''but that type of advertising and hype is just part of our life.'' **********The reason companies can all claim the longest ball is because they do their comparison tests differently. Most makers use Iron Byrons to hit the balls with wooden drivers. Spalding, though, employs human beings, pointing out that ''machines don't play golf.'' And a company tends to choose only competing balls that it knows it can beat. What's more, Iron Byrons can be set at countless loft angles that will affect the distance of competing balls in varying ways. Climate matters. As Spalding's Mr. Mayer, remarks, ''You give a technician time and a machine and he can design a test that any ball on the market can win.'' JOE TURNESA and Charlie Cook are hunkered over a list of professional golfers in the newly refurbished coffee shop of the Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego. The pros are straggling in to practice for the upcoming Shearson Lehman Brothers Andy Williams Open. **********Mr. Turnesa, who is Titleist's tour director, and Mr. Cook, the company's salesman for the area, are deciding which pros will be getting Titleist balls to use in the competition. **********''John Adams,'' Mr. Turnesa says. ''Give him 384's.'' ''Isao Aoki. He's Dunlop.'' **********''George Archer,'' Mr. Turnesa says. ''I'll tell you what's happening with Archer. He took Pinnacle last week. For some reason, he switched to Dunlop the next day. We'll give him balls. But if he plays Dunlop again, he's finished. No more balls.'' **********A primary marketing tool for golf equipment makers is the professional golf tour, the others being golf magazines and commercials on televised golf tournaments. If the weekend duffer sees Tom Watson winning with a particular ball, then he thinks, maybe that's the one for me. One of Mr. Turnesa's jobs is to see that lots of pros whack Titleist golf balls, a major contributor to Acushnet's more than $100 million a year in golf equipment sales. **********But the reality is that the key factor determining what a pro plays is how much money a company will pay. If a company offered a tour player $100,000 to hit rocks, he might think about it. Wilson, Spalding, Ram and MacGregor each have stables of top pros who are paid, in some cases, more than $100,000 a year to use their equipment. **********Titleist, which has about 80 percent of the players on tour using its ball, operates the ''money game.'' Each week, the 15 leading players using a Titleist ball get cash prizes. The top finisher gets $2,000, and if he also wins the tournament, he gets $10,000 more. Dunlop has a similar money game with a smaller purse. **********How do the makers know the pros are using their balls? The Darrell Company checks. One of its representatives stands on the first tee during the first round of every tournament and asks the players what they're using. The Darrell people also periodically slip out onto the course with binoculars just to doublecheck. **********Curtis Strange is changing into his golf spikes in the Torrey Pines locker room. Last year, he earned prize money of $542,321, making him No. 1 on the P.G.A. tour. He should know the best ball. ''I've always played Titleist,'' he says. ''I once changed and tried another ball and I didn't play very well and switched back. Now, that could have been between my ears.'' So how much difference does a ball really make? ''Not a lot of difference,'' he says. **********Last year, according to tour statistics, Andy Bean averaged 279 yards off the tee, qualifying him as the longest hitter in golf. Mr. Bean is so strong that he would be long using a billiard ball, but since Wilson pays him more than $100,000 a year, he plays Wilson, which gets 10 percent of its revenue from golf ball sales. ''I think Wilson's the best ball,'' he says. Like many long-hitting pros, he says he's less interested in distance than in balls that consistently fly alike. **********If anyone really knows what is the longest ball in golf, it ought to be the men who play the game the best. **********Bob Murphy: ''The Dunlop. No question about it.'' **********Doug Tewell: ''Probably the Pinnacle 384 or the Top-Flite. I probably shouldn't say Top-Flite, since I play Titleist. But that's probably the longest.'' **********Cesar Sanudo: ''Titleist's got them by no less than five yards and maybe ten yards.'' **********Curtis Strange: ''Probably the Dunlop DDH.'' Bruce Lietzke: ''The 384 Titleist.'' Bill Rogers: ''Heck, I don't know.'' **********Nick Faldo: ''I wouldn't really know. All the companies say they have the longest ball.'' THIS story hasn't been fair. It should have pointed out a long time ago, probably right at the beginning, that there is a place that knows what is the longest golf ball. Out at its Far Hills, N.J., research center, the U.S.G.A. has tested every ball model on the market - 357 of them - all under the same conditions. The longest ball goes 288 yards, a whopping 45 yards farther than the shortest. **********So, then, all that needs to be done is to ask Frank Thomas for the name of the ball. ''I can't tell you that,'' he says. ''Why not?'' **********''Because we don't want any commercial exploitation of the U.S.G.A. by a manufacturer.'' **********''Well, has it been the same ball that's been longest year after year?'' **********''Come on, now,'' he says. ''You're getting too close.'' ''What ball do you use?'' ''No way I'm telling you that.'' **********Mr. Thomas does allow, though, that on a good day, when the weather's nice and the course is lush, he sends his mystery ball about 240 yards. Not bad hitting, but maybe if he tried this other ball. . . OF 'PUMPKINS' ANDNIGHT BALLS **********Although golf ball companies are mostly interested in making a ball that goes farther, a lot of gimmicks have been tried over the years to make a ball more attractive. **********One of the most dramatic was Wilson's introduction of an orange-colored golf ball in 1982. The idea was that you could locate it easier than a white ball. The ''pumpkin,'' as golfers called it, rapidly caught on, and other makers copied the idea. Today, you can pick from orange, yellow, blue and pink golf balls. Ping, which is best known for its popular golf clubs, even has four two-color balls. Colored balls, though, have tailed off in sales recently and seem to have bottomed out at about 21 percent of the golf ball market. **********Among the things golfers fear most are hitting a ''slice,'' a shot that veers wildly to the right of the intended target, or a bad ''hook'' that ends up far to the left. In the early 1980's, a company called Polara Enterprises came out with a ball in which the dimples got shallower toward the poles of the ball. It actually did reduce hooking and slicing. The United States Golf Association, however, thought it unfair. A new symmetry standard was introduced in 1981 that made the Polara illegal for competition. Polara sued the U.S.G.A. and ended up getting $1.4 million in an out-of-court settlement of the case. **********A number of small companies ignore the U.S.G.A. stipulations and make illegal balls. Any golfer can use them, of course, except in U.S.G.A. competitions, though most golfers would give icy looks to anyone who played one. There is the Robin Hood, the Renegade 410 and the Hot One. Usually, they are smaller than legal size, and so they go farther. There's also the Night Ball, which the U.S.G.A. has not yet ruled on, which comes with a little illuminated tube that you slip into a hole in the ball.

This message notified Tripoli that the operation had been successfully completed, and that it would not be traceable to the Libyan diplomatic post in East Berlin. At 1:49 A.M. in Berlin **********The explosion at the discotheque, which killed one American serviceman and a Turkish woman and wounded 230 others, came at 1:49 A.M. Berlin time or shortly before the second message was intercepted. **********The thrust of this information was reported Monday in The Washington Post. It was generally confirmed today by Administration officials who said that when these two decoded intercepts were put together with other intercepted messages over about a 10-day period, the totality constituted what they considered ''conclusive proof'' of direct Libyan involvement in the discotheque attack. **********But two of the Administration officials stated The Post's information was not exactly accurate. The Post article said the first message told Libyan officials they ''will be very happy when you see the headlines tomorrow.'' One official stated ''this was the thrust of the message, but not the exact wording.'' He declined to specify the exact words. One Administration official said The Post's rendition was correct. **********The two Administration officials also maintained the second message did not state that the operation was ''happening now,'' as stated in The Washington Post article.

The editor's family said he had been taken from his home Sunday night by armed men in civilian clothes. **********Two other men were also found dead, according to human rights workers and relatives, but few details were available on those cases. **********After the 38-year-old journalist, Jose Carrasco Tapia, was reported to have been dragged from bed, it was widely believed that he had been detained by Government security forces. **********The Chilean leader, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, imposed a state of siege on Sunday night, a few hours after his motorcade was ambushed by guerrillas as he returned to the capital from a weekend in the country. No Record of Detention **********The Government acknowledged today that it had detained 20 people in its crackdown on opponents. But the names of Mr. Carrasco and the two others found dead were not on its list. Family members and others who tried to locate Mr. Carrasco on Monday said today that they had been unable to find any record of his detention. **********The pro-Government newspaper La Segunda quoted civilian homicide detectives as having said a preliminary examination of Mr. Carrasco's body indicated he had been shot a few minutes after he was seized. **********Mr. Carrasco was a member of the executive committee of the federation to which most Chilean journalists belong and a foreign editor of Analisis, one of the weekly news magazines closed Monday by the Government under the state of siege. The two other men who were found dead, reportedly after being detained Monday by armed men in civilian clothes with their faces covered, were identified as Gaston Vidaurrazaga, a teacher in the San Bernardo neighborhood, and Felipe Rivera, a mechanic from the Pudahuel neighborhood. Mr. Vidaurrazaga's mother reported his death, and a neighborhood priest reported that Mr. Rivera had been killed. **********Tens of thousands of people chanting ''Strong arm Pinochet!'' paraded along a downtown boulevard, meanwhile, in a show of support for the military ruler. General on Reviewing Stand **********General Pinochet, wearing a white dress uniform, smiled broadly and waved from a reviewing stand as delegations from up and down the country paraded past him in a sea of red, white and blue banners and posters, many containing his photograph. **********The general seized power in a coup 13 years ago, overthrowing the democratically elected Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens. **********He escaped the attack on Sunday with a minor hand wound, but five members of his police and military escort were killed and 11 wounded. **********Security forces today continued to conduct widespread searches for those who carried out the ambush along the road leading to Santiago from General Pinochet's weekend house. Suspect Is Identified **********The only suspect whom the Government has identified so far is Cesar Bunster Ariztia, the son of man who served the Allende Government as Ambassador to Britain. The authorities said Mr. Bunster had rented four vehicles used in the attack and, with a young woman posing as his wife, had rented a vacation house three weeks ago near the scene of the ambush. **********The 20 detainees acknowledged by the Government are primarily identified with the left of the political opposition. The authorities said they were rounded up beginning in the early morning hours Monday and taken to a jail normally used for people under investigation. But the Government insisted that the 20 had not been detained in connection with the assassination attempt. **********Police sources said Mr. Carrasco's body was found Monday afternoon at the edge of a new cemetery called the Parque del Recuerdo. His wife, Silvia Bera, said as she left the morgue where she identified his body that his head was ''full of bullets.'' Others put the number of wounds at 10 to 13. **********A woman at the Carrasco home who identified herself only as a friend of the family said Mr. Carrasco was carried off shortly before 5 A.M. Monday by two men armed with automatic weapons. She said they had first banged on the door and shouted that they were policemen, then had broken down the door. Driven Off in White Van **********She said Mr. Carrasco was dragged out of the apartment without his shoes and driven off in a white van. Although the two men reportedly showed no identification to the Carrascos, unmarked white vans have frequently been used by state security agents in Chile. At that hour, before the end of the curfew, it is also unlikely that any other vehicles but those of the Government security forces would have been allowed on the street. **********The family friend said Mr. Carrasco had returned to Chile about two years ago from Mexico, where she said he had worked for the newspaper Uno Mas Uno and other publications. She said he had left Chile after being detained in the aftermath of the military coup on Sept. 11, 1973, that ousted President Allende, a Marxist. Dr. Allende died in the coup. 21 ARRESTED IN SPAIN  MADRID, Sept. 9 (Reuters) - The police arrested 21 people who occupied the Chilean Consulate in Madrid today in protest against the state of siege imposed by President Pinochet, witnesses said.

Since then,he has forcibly sought to remake Libyan society according to his own revolutionary precepts. **********Qaddafi's ambitions are not confined within Libya's borders, however. He fancies himself a leader and agent of historic forces that will reorder third-world politics to his taste. His vision provides both a motive and a rationale for providing military and financial aid to radical regimes, and for undermining moderate governments by supporting - or manufacturing - subversive groups and abetting terrorists. **********Qaddafi's aggressive policies increasingly have focused on undermining U.S. and other Western interests in the third world as he sees these as the main barrier to his radical and expansionist goals. Qaddafi's commitment of political, economic and military resources in support of anti-Western activities worldwide may be surpassed only by the Soviet Union, its East European allies and possible North Korea or Cuba. **********He is particularly hostile to Israel and the U.S. His tactics include a mixture of threats and material support for terrorism, offers of cooperation, economic incentives and intimidation and outright military aggression. Libyan Involvement in Terrorism **********Qaddafi has used terrorism as one of the primary instruments of his foreign policy and supports radical groups which use terrorist tactics. Tripoli operates numerous training camps for foreign dissident groups that provide instruction in the use of explosive devices, hijacking, assassination and various commando and guerrilla techniques. Libya also abuses diplomatic privilege by storing arms and explosives at its diplomatic establishments, as occurred during the shoot-out at its embassy in London in April 1984. **********The main targets of Libyan terrorist activities have been expatriate Libyan dissidents and leading officials of moderate Arab and African governments. In almost all cases, the assassins use handguns to kill their victims, often provided by the Libyan diplomatic establishment in their country. Qaddafi generally uses Libyans for anti-exile operations; for other types of attacks he tends to employ surrogates or mercenaries. **********The Libyan Government in 1980 began a concerted effort to assassinate anti-Qaddafi exiles. By the time the first phase ended in 1981, 11 Libyan dissidents living abroad had been murdered. Libya in 1985 sponsored five attacks against exiled Libyan dissidents. Targets of these attacks lived in Greece, West Germany, Cyprus, Italy and Austria. **********Qaddafi has at least twice tried to murder Libyan exiles in Egypt only to have his agents intercepted by Egyptian security. In the more recent attempt, a four-man Libyan team was arrested in November during an attempted attack against a gathering of exiles near Cairo. **********Libya also has plotted anti-exile attacks in the United States. A Libyan exile in Colorado was shot and wounded by a Libyan-hired assassin in 1981. In May 1984, the F.B.I. arrested two Libyans near Philadelphia for attempting to buy silenced handguns - the usual Libyan assassination weapon. A year later, in May 1985, a Libyan diplomat at the United Nations was declared persona non grata and a ring of nonofficial Libyans was broken up in connection with a plot to kill Libyan dissidents in four states. **********Qaddafi also targets moderate Arab governments for their refusal to continue the military struggle against Israel and for their links to the West. There is evidence of Libyan-backed assassination plots against such Arab leaders as President Mubarak of Egypt and former President Nimeiry of the Sudan. For example, those arrested after last November's attempted attack on Libyan exiles in Egypt stated that Qaddafi's target list included President Mubarak. Jordan's King Hussein and Iraq's Saddam Hussein are almost certainly on Qaddafi's list because of restored ties with Cairo and Washington, respectively. **********Qaddafi also has been implicated in plots to assassinate other moderate heads of state. In September 1984 the Chadian Government uncovered a Libyan-sponsored plot in which a briefcase bomb was to explode during a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chadian President Habre. More recently, Zairian officials thwarted a Libyan-sponsored plot against President Mobutu in September 1985. Libyan Links to Middle East Radicals **********Longstanding Libyan support for radical Palestinian groups is growing. Qaddafi has provided safe haven, money and arms to these groups - including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command, the Fatah dissidents and the notorious Abu Nidal group. Training for Palestinians and other radicals frequently takes place at several locations in Libya. **********These anti-Arafat Palestinians are widely engaged in terrorist activities and focus their terrorist activity on Israel and the occupied territories. More recently, however, Libya's support has broadened to include logistical support for terrorist operations. For example, Libya provided passports to the Abu Nidal members responsible for the attack on the El Al counter in Vienna. **********The Abu Nidal group is particularly appealing to Qaddafi because of its track record of successful terrorist operations. Abu Nidal's targeting of moderate Palestinians and moderate Arab leaders is consistent with Libya's antipathy toward participants in the peace process. **********According to Libyan press reports, Abu Nidal met with Qaddafi in Libya at least twice in 1985. Abu Nidal also gave an interview in Tripoli to a German publication last year and met with Qaddafi's chief lieutenant, Abdul Salam Jalloud. **********In addition, Libya has provided sanctuary, training assistance and financial support to the Abu Nidal organization, and there are reliable press and other reports that its headquarters have been moved to Libya. The evidence points to Libya's having been involved in the bloody hijacking of Egyptair 648. **********Libya is trying to improve ties with other regional terrorist groups. Qaddafi would also like closer links to Teheran's terrorist effort. He announced a ''strategic alliance'' with Iran last summer, which he hopes to use as a foundation for joint operational planning for terrorist attacks against various regional foes. He also supports Egyptian and Tunisian dissidents. **********Libya also provided refuge for notorious international terrorist Carlos, who headed a network of terrorists for hire. His group was responsible for numerious vicious attacks, including the hostage-taking of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna in 1975. Libyan Terrorism Against the United States **********During the past 18 months, Qaddafi has made several public references to expanding his terrorism campaign to cover U.S. targets. In a June 1984 speech, he told his Libyan audience that ''we are capable of exporting terrorism to the heart of America.'' **********During a speech last September observing the 16th anniversary of his takeover, Qaddafi remarked that ''we have the right to fight America, and we have the right to export terrorism to them.'' **********Qaddafi recently threatened in a press conference on 2 January to ''pursue U.S. citizens in their country and streets'' if the United States takes action in response to Libya's alleged involvement in the Rome and Vienna terrorist attacks. **********There have been several instances over the years of Libyan-sponsored attacks against U.S. interest. These examples include the sacking of our embassy in Tripoli in 1979, the discovery by Sudanese authorities of a Libyan plot to blow up the American Embassy Club in Khartoum by planting explosives in stereo speakers. U.S. personnel also have been on Qaddafi's target list, as indicated by the plan in 1977 to assassinate our Ambassador in Cairo. Radicalism in the Arab World **********Qaddafi's foremost ambition is to dominate and unite the Arab world. He frequently compares himself to Garibaldi or Bismarck and has justified his use of violence and terrorism against moderate Arab regimes as necessary to achieve Arab unity. **********Egypt, because of its peace treaty with Israel, is a special target. Libyan agents have been active in Egypt since the 1970's, and Qaddafi has offered support to various opponents of the Egyptian Government. In October 1981, immediately after President Sadat was assassinated, Qaddafi called on Egyptians to overthrow their government; within a week at Cairo International Airport two bombs exploded that had been concealed in luggage unloaded from a flight originating in Tripoli. **********More recently, Qaddafi has sought to embarrass the Government of President Mubarak and undermine the Egyptian economy. A Libyan ship captained by a senior Libyan naval commando laid mines in the Red Sea and Gulf of Suez that damaged 18 merchant ships in July and August 1984. **********In May 1985 the Egyptians thwarted a plot by radical Palestinians backed by Libya to destroy the U.S. Embassy in Cairo with a truck bomb. Last summer Qaddafi expelled over 10,000 Egyptian workers in Libya - confiscating their savings and most of their belongings - in what was in part an effort to place a greater burden on the strained Egyptian economy. Also during 1985, Cairo captured several teams of Libyan-supported Egyptian dissidents who reported that their plan was to destablize the Mubarak Government through sabotage and inciting civil unrest. **********Sudan also is a priority target. Qaddafi has long offered training and support to Sudanese dissidents and sponsored acts of sabotage against the Government of former President Nimeiry. He was a major source of arms and money for southern Sudanese rebels that began a guerrilla war against the central Government two years ago. **********In February 1983 the Sudanese, with Egyptian assistance, thwarted a Libyan-sponsored coup attempt, and in March 1984 a Libyan TU-22 bombed Omdurman, Sudan, in a failed attempt to destroy a radio station there that broadcast condemnations of Qaddafi's policies by Libyan oppositionists. **********Since Nimeiry's fall from power, Qaddafi has exploited the resumption of diplomatic ties with Sudan to build a network for subversion inimical to Sudan's efforts to establish a parliamentary democracy. A number of known Libyan terrorists have been assigned to the Libyan People's Bureau (Embassy) or airline office in Khartoum. **********Qaddafi also has provided arms, funding, training and probably direction to the Sudanese Revolutionary Committees, a small group in Sudan dedicated to establishing a government on the Libyan model in Sudan. In May, a planeload of these dissidents arrived in Khartoum armed with assault rifles. **********Qaddafi also is working to expand his influence in the countries of the Arab Maghreb. Qaddafi refuses to negotiate with Algeria to determine the correct location of the Libyan-Algerian border. Perhaps angered over President Bendjedid's moderation, Qaddafi reportedly provides money to Algerian dissidents such as Ahmed Ben Bella. **********In Tunisia, Qaddafi has long sought to bring down the pro-Western Government of Habib Bourguiba. In 1980, Libyan-supported guerrillas attacked the southern Tunisian mining town of Gafsa; when France offered its support to Tunis, Libyan mobs burned both the French and Tunisian Embassies while security forces stood idly by. **********Following bread riots in Tunisia in January 1984 saboteurs originating in Libya dynamited a pipeline near the Libyan-Tunisian border. In an effort to exacerbate social tensions, this past year, Qaddafi expelled over 30,000 Tunisian workers and confiscated their property. **********In September, when Tunisian newspapers attacked Qaddafi for the expulsions, a Libyan diplomat attempted to mail letter bombs to the critical journalists. Several exploded, wounding two postal workers and causing Tunis to sever diplomatic relations. **********Libya is staunchly opposed to the Middle East peace process, and Qaddafi is doing all he can to subvert it. In Lebanon, Libyan arms and money have flowed to different militias and Palestinian groups opposed to the Government of President Gemayel. **********Qaddafi has been especially eager to undermine the influence of P.L.O. chairman Yasir Arafat because Qaddafi perceives him as too willing to consider a negotiated settlement with Israel. As a result, Qaddafi has thrown his support to radical Palestinian groups - including the Fatah Revolutionary Council led by Abu Nidal - that advocate continued war against Israel. **********Since 1981 Qaddafi has shipped these groups items as prosaic as uniforms and as powerful as tanks and BM-21 miltiple rocket launchers. In 1984 Libyan troops participated in the Syrian-backed assault on Arafat's forces in northern Lebanon. **********The Persian Gulf also is an arena for Libyan meddling. Qaddafi has allied himself with Iran in its war against Iraq and has provided Teheran with T-55 tanks, antitank and antiaircraft artillery, ammunition and even SCUD rockets. In addition Libya provides arms and money to Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq and to the anti-Government group the ''Union of Iraqi Democrats.'' **********In 1984 and 1985, Libyan agents attempted to disrupt the Islamic pilgrimmage ceremonies in Saudi Arabia; in 1984 entire planeloads of Libyan ''pilgrims'' were discovered to be carrying arms. **********Libya continues to enjoy good relations with and has provided support to the National Democratic Front that operates out of Marxist South Yemen against the Government of President Saleh in North Yemen. Although Libya restored diplomatic relations with Somalia last May, Qaddafi has not severed his relationship with Somali opposition groups he has long supported. Involvement in Sub-Saharan Africa **********Tripoli views black Africa as a principal arena for forging a group of anti-Western radical states that will strengthen Libyan influence in international fora and confer upon Qaddafi status as a world leader. Qaddafi's aggressiveness has been strengthened by the propensity of the international community to ignore his often blatant disregard for the sovereignty of small African nations. **********Chad, of course, is the most egregious example. In 1973 Qaddafi forcibly annexed the northern portion of Chad known as the Aozou Strip. Throughout the 1970's Libya supported various tribal and guerrilla groups in Chad in a bid to install a pliable regime in Ndjamena. Having failed to achieve this indirectly, in October 1980 the Libyan Army entered Chad and attempted to impose a union between the two countries. **********The Libyan occupation force withdrew in November 1981, but returned in 1983 when the pro-Libyan Chadian leader Goukouni Oueddei was ousted by current President Hissen Habre. Only intervention by French armed forces confined the Libyan occupation to the northern 40 percent of Chad. French forces were withdrawn in the fall of 1984, but Qaddafi reneged on an agreement reached with President Mitterrand and continues to occupy northern Chad with an army of several thousand. **********The drought-battered countries of the Sahel offer Qaddafi many opportunities for meddling. Qaddafi continues to provide arms and training to the nomadic Tueareg tribesmen in an effort to undermine the Governments of Mali and Niger. **********Qaddafi also is determined to topple President Mobutu of Zaire. Qaddafi is motivated by hostility to Kinshasa's close ties to the West, its recognition of Israel and its support for Chadian President Habre. **********Qaddafi also is aware of Zaire's role as a leading producer of cobalt and other strategic minerals. Tripoli provides training in sabotage and small arms to several different guerrilla groups, including the National Front for the Liberation of the Congo and the Congolese National Movement. Libyan diplomatic facilities in countries bordering Zaire are centers of support for these groups. Meddling in Latin America and the Caribbean **********Qaddafi's determination to strike at U.S. interests and to spread his philosophy of revolution has led to a more aggressive Libyan posture in Latin America. Although many governments and groups in this region are wary of Qaddafi, some are willing to accept his financial and military support. **********Tripoli views Nicaragua as its base in Central America and accordingly seeks to strengthen the Sandinista dictatorship in Managua. In addition to several hundred million dollars in economic assistance, Qaddafi's support to the Sandinistas has included antiaircraft guns, SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles and launchers and small arms. At least several dozen Libyan military personnel are in Nicaragua. Libyan support has enhanced the Sandinistas' ability to subvert neighboring states. **********In addition, Libya has provided some arms and money to insurgents in Guatemala and El Salvador, as well as the M-19 terrorist group in Colombia. During the past year Libya has provided training, guidance and funds to a key far-left terrorist group to enable it to expand armed action against the Government of Chile. **********Libyan agents have been increasingly active among the Caribbean islands, especially since the summer of 1984. The loss of its People's Bureau in Grenada following the collapse of the Bishop Government in 1983 forced Tripoli to attempt to establish its centers for subversion in other diplomatic posts in the region. **********Qaddafi also has used religion as a cover for intelligence activities in the area, sponsoring Islamic conferences in which the Libyan participants often are intelligence officers or operatives of the Libyan Revolutionary Committees. Leftist leaders from the Dominican Republican, Dominica, Barbados, Antigua, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, the French departments and elsewhere have also been invited to Libya for ''seminars'' and paramilitary training. Particularly worrisome is Libyan urging of leftist politicians to undertake violent action rather than pursue legal means to replace moderate governments in the region. South and Southeast Asia **********As elsewhere, Libyan diplomatic missions in this region provide the infrastructure for Libyan subversion, disbursing funds and arranging for the training of leftists and other dissidents. **********In South Asia, Libyan activities are focused on the Islamic states. No doubt reflecting his dependence on Russian arms, Qaddafi is one of the few Moslem leaders who does not criticize the Soviet invastion of Afghanistan. Although Libya maintains relations with Pakistan, it has also been involved with the ''al-Zulfikar'' terrorist group. Qaddafi in addition has provided training and money to opponents of President Ershad of Bangladesh. **********In Southeast Asia, Qaddafi concentrates on Moslem minorities. For some time he has provided paramilitary training to the small Moslem insurgency in southern Thailand. In the Philippines, Libya conintues to send assistance to the Moslem Moro separatists on Mindanao despite a 1976 agreement with Manila to cease such aid. **********New Caledonia, a French possession in the South Pacific, has no appreciable Moslem population, but Libya has nevertheless provided military training and some funding to the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the group responsible for most of the pro-independence violence on the island. Libyan intelligence operatives are known to be active on other islands in Oceania. The Erosion of International Norms **********Qaddafi's subversion is not confined to those countries that are the direct object of his ambitions. The international community as a whole suffers from Qaddafi's disrespect for international norms of behavior and accepted practice. **********Qaddafi has abused diplomatic privilege for terrorist purposes, reneged on international agreements and blatantly used terrorist violence against political opponents. In addition, Qaddafi's support of terrorism, regardless of his direct operational involvement in a given terrorist act, helps legitimize terrorism as an acceptable political activity."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/business/economists-await-bottom-of-curve.html": {"writer_name": "Barnaby Feder", "pub_date": "1986-01-31", "snippet": "", "word_count": 588, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ECONOMISTS AWAIT BOTTOM OF CURVE", "print_headline": "ECONOMISTS AWAIT BOTTOM OF CURVE", "body_text": " **********Yesterday's merchandise trade figures were no surprise for many of the nation's economists. The tendency for a nation's trade balance to get worse before it gets better when its currency declines is a well-known economic phenomenon. **********''This may be the bottom of the curve for the decline in the dollar that began last March,'' said Howard Rosen, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. **********A dollar decline may worsen the trade balance for as long as nine months, but the subsequent stimulus may last several years, most economists say. **********Yesterday's merchandise trade figures reflect the immediate impact of the dollar's fall last year on the value of exports and imports. A cheaper dollar means that American exports are worth less. At the same time, it takes more dollars to pay for imports. Thus, the value of exports falls and the value of imports rises, worsening the trade balance. Adjusting Trade Patterns **********This negative effect on the trade balance is inevitable because businesses cannot immediately shift their trade patterns. However, the incentives to adjust grow steadily if a currency shift becomes a long-term trend, such as the decline of the dollar since its peak last February. **********A dollar decline means that American businesses' profits on overseas sales are worth more when translated into dollars. If it appears that the decline is lasting, American businesses are encouraged to increase their efforts to sell overseas and in some cases to cut their prices, which will lead to a growth in demand for their products and in export volume. **********Importers face the opposite situation. When the dollar declines, their sales in the United States are worth less when translated into West German marks, Japanese yen or other foreign currencies. To compensate, they may eventually raise prices or, because their American operations are less profitable, restrict the variety of goods they handle, which will lead to lower import volume. Observing Trend on a Chart **********Economists call the currency-trade relationship the ''J curve'' because the short-term trade balance decline, followed by the long-term upturn, looks something like a J when drawn on a chart. In practice, however, the curve is often hard to discern from the other influences on the trade balance, ranging from economic performance to trade policies. **********Thus, although the pluses from the dollar decline since last spring are probably beginning to outweigh its negative impact on trade figures, the further decline in the dollar following the September meeting in New York of finance ministers and central bankers of the so-called Group of Five industrial nations will continue to drag down trade figures for months to come. **********Indeed, some economists believe these conflicting forces may keep the trade balance from improving much this year. Attracting Foreign Capital **********''This is not just a technical concern,'' Mr. Rosen said. The persistance of the merchandise trade deficit contributes to the increasing need of the United States to attract foreign capital to finance its current account deficit, which in turn forces the country further into debt. **********Behind such worries is the assumption by most economists that the dollar will have to fall further to correct international trade imbalances. That creates the prospect of a situation where the short-term negative impact of dollar declines repeatedly cancels out the positive impact of earlier declines. **********In such a case, Congress and the President would come under still more pressure to resort to other policy measures, such as protectionist legislation, to improve the trade balance."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/06/world/4-key-communists-freed-by-manila-military-objects.html": {"writer_name": "Seth Mydans", "pub_date": "1986-03-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1202, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MILITARY OBJECTS", "print_headline": "4 KEY COMMUNISTS FREED BY MANILA; MILITARY OBJECTS", "body_text": " **********The founder of the Communist Party of the Philippines and three other men said to be key Communist figures were freed today, despite objections from the military. **********The step was part of a mass release of inmates who had been imprisoned by President Ferdinand E. Marcos's Government for what the new administration regards as political crimes. **********The Communist Party's founder, Jose Maria Sison, who is 47 years old, said after his release that he was prepared to support the ''positive aspects'' of the Government of President Corazon C. Aquino. But he declined to renounce the possibility of using armed force in a Communist revolution. **********Supreme Court Justices Quit **********Also today, the resignations of most of the justices on the 13-member Supreme Court were reported. Reports said two or three justices had not complied with Mrs. Aquino's request to step down and allow her to form her own court. **********Released today along with Mr. Sison were Bernabe Buscayno, known as Commander Dante, who is said to have been the leader of the Communist fighting force, the New People's Army, as well as two other men described as members of an assassination team, Ruben Alegre and Alexander Birondo. **********Their release fulfilled a campaign pledge by Mrs. Aquino to release all the prisoners held by the Marcos Government for what the new Government holds to be political reasons. In all, a spokesman for Mrs. Aquino said, 517 detainees are being released; he was unable to say how many had actually left detention so far. Perceived as Subversives **********Most of the 517 were seized by security forces as perceived subversives. They included people charged with planting bombs and others who were simply thought to be Communists. **********The Aquino spokesman, Rene Saguisag, said Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the military Chief of Staff, Gen. Fidel V. Ramos, had ''expressed concern'' over the releases and had objected especially to the freeing of the four Communist leaders. **********At a meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Saguisag said, they told him that ''the release of all detainees could reinforce the insurgency, that the military might lose its initiative because what's the point in capturing one if they would be released later.'' **********Advisers to Mrs. Aquino said earlier that resistance by the military had delayed the release of the four men. **********At a news conference earlier in the day, Mr. Enrile also indicated objections to another of Mrs. Aquino's campaign pledges: a cease-fire and a dialogue with the Communist insurgents. **********While agreeing that ''every possible peaceful approach should be explored,'' he said that he had been fighting the insurgents for 16 years and that he knew them to be ''men who are seekers of power and would use every means to this particular end.'' **********''They will do nothing but what will bring about their goal, a successful revolution,'' he said. He urged ''a prudent and cautious approach to the problem.'' Approaches From Rebel Groups **********Mrs. Aquino's advisers said today that they been approached by different insurgent groups, and that they hoped the approaches would become the basis on which a cease-fire could be discussed. **********Accurate counts of the insurgents are, by common agreement, virtually impossible. The Philippine Government has put the figure at 12,000, while American estimates range as high as 20,000 and the rebels say they field 30,000 armed men and women. **********After their release today, Mr. Sison and two of the other Communist leaders visited Mrs. Aquino in her temporary headquarters at a Manila office building. Inviting Mr. Buscayno to sit with her on a couch, she apologized for the delay in their release, which had been announced last week. **********In a talk with reporters before meeting the President, Mr. Sison said he might go back to writing or teaching, his former professions, ''or I might even volunteer my help to her Government.'' 'Why Should I Disavow?' **********Asked if he now disavowed the use of armed force to bring social change, he said: ''Why should I disavow? I have just come from prison. I stayed there for nine years. I have nothing to turn my back on except prison.'' **********In reply to a question as to whether violent resistance was relevant now that the Marcos Government had been removed, he said: ''I don't know. I shall have to study the situation.'' **********When Mr. Buscayno was asked if he renounced armed revolution, he replied, ''Oh, no, no, no.'' **********Mr. Sison told reporters, ''I think Mrs. Aquino needs support insofar as she needs to assert civilian supremacy and the powers of the presidency. The Aquino Government has done a lot in just a few days to democratize the situation.'' **********But Mr. Sison said: ''I don't think the influence of the fascist dictatorship has been completely eliminated. It is not enough to restore the bourgeois rights and privileges. You still find the problems of a semicolonial and semifeudal society.'' **********Since Mr. Sison was arrested, other men have taken over the leadership of the Communist movement and have been setting policies, with advice from Mr. Sison in prison. **********Sources on the left said these other leaders had been meeting in recent days to formulate their policy after Mrs. Aquino's victory, which many radicals agree has been a setback to their movement. **********Mrs. Aquino's advisers say they believe that her victory over Mr. Marcos and her plans for land reform and an improvement in the economic climate will siphon many supporters from the leftist movement. They say a hard core committed to revolution, whose numbers are difficult to estimate, is likely to fight on. ----Sin Sees Guerrilla Defections ROME, March 5 - Jaime Cardinal Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, said today that he expected some Philippine guerrillas to lay down their arms this month. **********Cardinal Sin said a priest in touch with the Communist guerrillas had told him in a letter that at least some rebels would lay down their arms on March 17, a patriotic holiday, because Ferdinand E. Marcos had been removed from the presidency. **********''Now that he's no longer President of the Philippines, there is no longer any reason for them to stay in the mountains,'' the Cardinal said. ''There is now an atmosphere of freedom in our country.'' **********Cardinal Sin, on a two-day visit here during which he will meet with Pope John Paul II, also said the active role played by the Roman Catholic Church in bringing down the Marcos Government had been organized in the Philippines without Vatican clearance. **********He denied reports of divisions between the Philippine church and the Vatican. ''The Holy Father supported us,'' he said. But he said he had little or no contact with the Vatican in the crisis. **********Vatican officials have said that while the Holy See admired Cardinal Sin and was pleased with the result of his efforts, it had been uncomfortable with the church's deep involvement with the opposition to Mr. Marcos."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/business/business-people-key-big-board-official-is-resigning-his-post.html": {"writer_name": "Kenneth Gilpin", "pub_date": "1986-03-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 346, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "KEY BIG BOARD OFFICIAL IS RESIGNING HIS POST", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; KEY BIG BOARD OFFICIAL IS RESIGNING HIS POST", "body_text": " **********William M.

Gustavo Evens, a Belgian priest whose European skin looks as if it has undergone perpetual roasting during his 21 years here, said he could not recall a time that had been truly good in Potosi, only some ''least bad years.'' **********Mines Are Silent **********This is clearly not one of those years. Cerro Rico, the giant mound of silver and tin that looms over the town of some 80,000 people, has turned out its miners and fallen silent. The mine shafts, lacing it in a haphazard way that Father Evens equated to a Gruyere cheese, are victims of the collapse in world tin prices and Bolivia's outdated mining methods. The crisis in the mines has caused the Government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro to begin curtailing tin mining, closing some mines and imposing austerity measures on others. **********Today, Potosi's pessimists, who appear to be quite numerous, think that the new Government policy has brought their town to the verge of death. There are some optimists, but they are forced to take a very long view and imagine some future time when foreigners would throw countless millions of dollars into Cerro Rico, converting it into an open pit mine so as to scoop out its remaining lodes. **********For more than four centuries, mining has provided the reason for Potosi to exist. In turn, some say it is because of Potosi that Bolivia exists as an independent nation instead of having been absorbed by neighboring countries at the time of independence from Spain. **********Before tin, there was silver. The first coins were struck in Potosi for the Spanish crown in 1574, and during the next century Potosi became the leading supplier of coins in the world. Tin assumed importance late in the last century, although the Potosi tin mine was never as productive as those nearby at Catavi. A Priest's Criticism **********In the view of Father Evens, those who have worked Cerro Rico have never benefited from its fruits. He ascribed that to a combination of what he said had been mismanagement by a succession of Governments since the mines were nationalized in 1954 and a lack of initiative by the miners in defending their interests. **********The priest said he counseled people to work ''with the head, heart and hands, but they are inclined not to use the head.'' **********He added that ''the custom of people in Potosi being dominated comes from the time of the Spaniards.'' **********He went on, ''It means people don't have much initiative and are going to suffer in silence.'' **********Lucio Torrejon, local manager of the Mining Company of the South, a private company with some small holdings here, also lamented what he said was the absence of initiative and creativity among the people of Potosi. But he blamed the Roman Catholic Church. Churches and Investments **********He said the reason there were so many churches in Potosi was that ''that was the way the Spanish chose to dominate people.'' **********Mr. Torrejon said the other problem was that people never reinvested the money that was made in Potosi because ''no one stays at this altitude if he can go elsewhere.'' **********The reception office of the state mining company on the side of Cerro Rico is hung with calendars with large photos of nude women. **********The secretary, a slight man wearing a cardigan sweater against the chill that permeates any place in Potosi where the sun does not shine, said the mine manager had been called away by an emergency and could not receive the visitors. **********Mr. Soliz, the city hall public relations man, told the secretary it was not often that correspondents from two important foreign newspapers would visit Potosi and that perhaps someone else could provide some simple information, such as how many people were being dismissed from the mine. Surely the secretary himself must know those things, Mr. Soliz said. The secretary said he had no instructions. Salvadorans and Sandinistas **********Mr. Soliz insisted, and finally the the visitors were directed through several other offices, again hung with calendars of nudes, until they came to a man bending over ledgers at a desk. No, he said, he could provide no statistics. He had no instructions. **********In the patio behind the administration offices the two small rooms used by the mineworkers' union are hung with posters that support the Salvadoran guerrillas and the Sandinista Front and praise Fidel Castro. There is a Lenin poster and another showing a map of South America being strangled by a dollar bill. **********Even though no one was working inside the mine any longer, Nestor Munoz of the mineworkers' federation said he was there ''to defend our sources of work.'' **********Mr. Munoz said there had been about 2,000 workers at the mine before the closing in August and that 930 remained on the payroll, with some of them soon to go. He said those still employed were primarily doing guard duty. A Radio Fan **********At the workers housing compound a few hundred feet from the mining offices, Felix Garcia, a miner who said he planned to accept retirement in a few weeks, asked whether the visitors happened to be from the Voice of America. He said listening to the United States Government-run radio station was his favorite entertainment. **********Mr. Garcia, 53 years old, the father of seven children, said he had been born at the mining complex. His father was also a miner. He said the housing complex had been built while the mine still belonged to Mauricio Hochschild, the private owner before nationalization and that his family had occupied the four-room house ever since. Mr. Garcia said he planned to open a workshop in Potosi with the severance pay he expected to receive from the Government. **********Miguel Ordonez, one of Mr. Garcia's neighbors, had been out of work since August. The news of the closing, he said, had hit him ''like a bucket of cold water.'' **********Mr. Ordonez, 39 years old and the father of six, said he did not want to move to the countryside and farm, as the Government was encouraging the out-of-work miners to do, because there would be no way to educate his children there. **********''So I'm going to stay here and wait,'' he said, gesturing toward the mine.

Credit markets were also discouraged by comments from Paul A. Volcker, Federal Reserve Board chairman, about the limited impact of a cut in the discount rate. **********The price for the key 30-year Treasury bond fell by a point and a half in early trading, but recouped some of the loss later in the day to finish at 98 27/32, down a point from Tuesday, to yield 7.34 percent. Declines for shorter-term Treasury issues were less steep, ranging from 5/32 to 10/ 32. **********Rates on Treasury bills were up sharply after the release of June data on consumer prices, durable-goods orders and personal consumption expenditures, but also recovered somewhat by late in the day. The rate for three-month bills was 5.80 percent, up five basis points, and the rate on six-month bills was 5.88 percent, up six basis points. **********Traders said that the economic data, while hardly indicative of a robust economy, were sufficiently stronger than the markets had anticipated to quash hopes of another cut in the discount rate any time soon. ''The economic fundamentals remain O.K., but the market had convinced itself the country was on the verge of a recession,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified. ''The new numbers have wiped out that view.'' **********''Psychology is horrible right now,'' the trader continued, adding that the uptick in interest rates had stimulated some retail investor demand for shorter-term Treasury securities. **********However, Albert A. Gross, chief economist for Refco, Inc., a Chicago-based futures brokerage firm, said there were signs that the price slump was the result of a more fundamental change in market psychology. ''The long end of the market is no longer focusing just on the weak economy and the next discount rate cut,'' he said. ''It has been telegraphing concerns there, even before this latest batch of economic data, about long-term inflation and the prolonged, excessive growth of the money supply.'' **********Mr. Gross said the change suggested that the bond market's potential to rally was limited even if there was another cut in the discount rate. **********''If Volcker were to ease right now, I think it's questionable whether the cut would benefit the long end of the market,'' he said, adding that Mr. Volcker's comments to the Banking Committee about long-term inflation concerns suggested that the Fed was also feeling the constraints. **********In his testimony yesterday before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Volcker said that the central bank's conduct of monetary policy could not alone provide the stimulus to keep the three-and-a-half-year-old recovery alive. In some of his toughest language to date, the Fed chairman urged America's major trading partners to stimulate their sluggish economies to help increase demand for American exports and thus alleviate some of the huge United States trade deficit. **********David C. Matthews, a vice president and manager for government bond trading at Harris Trust in Chicago, said that the negative tone in the credit markets had been set by the economic data even before Mr. Volcker began testifying on Capitol Hill. ''A discount rate cut was ruled out by the data,'' he said, noting that there was actually a brief upward flurry in prices when Mr. Volcker said the Fed would be willing to act without Japan or West Germany on a discount rate cut if it felt the circumstances were appropriate. **********''That caught the eye of the markets for about 10 minutes,'' Mr. Matthews said. **********William J. Michaelcheck, a managing director at Bear, Stearns & Company, said the market's reaction to Mr. Volcker's testimony had less to do with what the Fed chairman said than what he did not say. ''The early morning data said a discount rate was going to be put off, and then Volcker didn't have anything to say that was positive for the market,'' he explained. **********Mr. Michaelcheck cautioned against reading too much into the price slumps of the last several trading sessions, arguing that most dealers still had sizable inventories of Treasury securities, which suggests that they remain bullish. ''Even those who still expect a discount rate cut are not expecting it for several weeks, and that's a long time to be carrying inventory unless you believe interest rates are going to come down some more,'' he said. **********Some dealers said that the lingering bullish sentiment was reflected by the aggressive bidding for $10 billion in two-year notes the Treasury auctioned yesterday. The average rate for the notes was 6.67 percent, up 20 basis points from where the notes had been trading on a when-issued basis two days ago, but still the lowest rate since July 19, 1977. **********Following are the results of Teasury's auction of two-year notes: (000 omitted in dollar figures)...

But he was named only after barely winning a straw vote Wednesday over the Finance Minister of the Netherlands, H. Onno Ruding. Mr. Ruding withdrew from the race just before today's vote. **********Mr. Camdessus, who is 53 years old, joins the I.M.F. at a moment of acute tensions over a relatively weak world economy and the seemingly intractable loan payment problems of developing debtor nations. The I.M.F. attempts to help those countries, but also tries to discipline them by requiring sometimes severe economic restraint. **********In international financial circles, Mr. Camdessus is regarded as somewhat more sympathetic to the economic difficulties of the poorer nations than Mr. de Larosiere. But in the last year, Mr. de Larosiere has been adopting more relaxed policies in helping such nations carry their debts. **********The Reagan Administration, although the largest contributor to the fund and thus its greatest influence, was neutral throughout the campaign, contending that the position has always gone to a European and that the Europeans should decide the issue among themselves. **********''We said that both candidates were credible and qualified and that this was a European call,'' said a senior Administration official who declined to be named. Japan and Canada were also neutral. **********Tonight, the Treasury issued a statement saying, ''The United States welcomes and strongly supports Mr. Camdessus's selection.'' **********Tensions could persist, however, because Mr. Ruding remains chairman of a board of 23 of the world's finance ministers - the Interim Committee - that sets policy for the fund and oversees its management. **********Mr. Camdessus, who will take office on Jan. 16 for a five-year term, has been a prominent figure for a decade - as former French Finance Minister, head of the country's central bank and former president of the Paris Club, an informal association of industrial nation finance ministers and central bankers who help to arrange new lending terms for countries having difficulty handling their debts. **********Mr. Camdessus and Mr. Ruding are considered financially cautious and largely apolitical. But Mr. Camdessus rose through French policy-making circles on appointments by Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, and he could prove somewhat more lenient in dealing with debtors than Mr. Ruding. Apparently that was a factor in his election, since it was the votes of the poorer countries that swung the decision his way. **********''Developing countries seem to think he'll be more lenient,'' said Robert Solomon, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and formerly the top international economist at the Federal Reserve Board. ''The French have a long tradition of showing empathy for developing-country problems. He's right in that tradition.'' **********Although such distinctions are important to the members of the I.M.F., sources close to it said the open campaigning for the job had more to do with matters of national prestige. **********With Mr. de Larosiere and Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, two of the last three managing directors of the I.M.F., have been French, and the long terms of both cover almost half of the fund's 40-year history. **********At first, Mr. Ruding appeared to be an easy winner of the job. ''He was always considered the logical contender to succeed de Larosiere,'' said an international financial official here. ''Even before de Larosiere's announcement, he was showing some interest. But then the announcement came, and the French said they had a candidate.'' **********In a straw vote on Wednesday, Mr. Camdessus received 35 percent and Mr. Ruding 28 percent, according to diplomatic sources here. Mr. Ruding's later withdrawal permitted the unanimous election. **********As managing director of the fund, Mr. Camdessus will oversee an organization with headquarters in Washington that emerged with its sister institution, the World Bank, from the debris of the international economy following World War II. Through short-term lending and the imposition of rigid discipline over troubled national economies, the fund, which has resources of $106 billion, attempts to stabilize those economies and prevent their difficulties from undermining the global economy. **********However, over the last year, since the debut of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d's ''Baker Plan'' urging more leniency toward the countries in return for their adoption of policies designed to foster their economies' long-term growth, Mr. de Larosiere's dealings with the countries have become more flexible."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/business/gm-chrysler-layoffs.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 69, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "G.M., CHRYSLER LAYOFFS", "print_headline": "G.M., CHRYSLER LAYOFFS", "body_text": " **********The General Motors Corporation said it would lay off 2,200 workers at its Pontiac Fiero sports-car assembly plant in Pontiac for a week because of rising dealer inventories.

It also paved the way for an investigation into the placing of gypsy infants in foster homes and institutions under the program, which was called ''Operation Children of the Road.'' **********''Federal support permitted the removal of the infants from their families,'' President Egli said in his statement. ''I present my regrets and my excuses before Swiss public opinion.'' **********Historians and lawyers who have studied the program said it was a misguided attempt to provide a better life for the children, who were thought to face a bleak future of wandering and vagrancy with their nomadic families. The program received financial support from the Government, and continued for more than 40 years before the charity ended it in 1973. A Form of 'Kidnapping' **********Although newspapers reports, which often described the program as a form of ''kidnapping,'' were published as early as 1973, little was done to unite the families until recently, when a legal complaint was filed on behalf of the gypsies by a Swiss lawyer and new reports in the press created public pressure, prompting the Government to act. **********''The statement by Mr. Egli was a national holiday for the gypsies,'' said Stephan Frischknecht, the gypsies' lawyer, who filed the complaint on May 30. ''It told them that they have the right to be here, and the right to an answer.'' **********Mr. Frischknecht and other critics of the program said that many of the children wound up in prisons, mental institutions or juvenile detention centers, and were later unable to get in touch with their families. **********President Egli said that the Government would seize certain documents held by Pro Juventute, which means ''For Youth,'' to be studied by officials. 'Enormous' Complications **********''This is an enormously complicated problem,'' Mr. Frischknecht said. ''We don't know where all the children are, if some were adopted, or sent abroad, if some died. The files can tell us that. But it opens the question of how many of the children who are grown-up now want to know where they came from.'' **********The case has created an uproar here in recent weeks. Mr. Frischknecht said that many of the people who were involved in the program are still senior officials in Pro Juventute or in Government institutions that housed the children. He said the officials had tried to keep the story from the public. **********In one case cited by Swiss newspapers, a woman lost five of her seven children to the program and said that when she was reunited with three of them, they no longer regarded her as their mother. **********''Many of children today ask who their brothers and sisters are, and whether they have natural parents, while the parents ask where their children are,'' Mr. Frischknecht said. ''We also need to find out if they want to go back to their families. But the gypsies have fought for this for years.

His goal, he said in a recent interview, is to produce cars with performance to match expensive European models at a fraction of the price. Chrysler executives hope the Shelby models will exert a ''halo effect'' that will promote sales of more modestly powered models in its lineup. **********''We consider the Shelby project to be an important part of our future product plans,'' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman of Chrysler Motors. Mr. Shelby ''has helped us appeal to the driver who wants to have some fun on the road, and to younger buyers,'' he said, adding that the average age of buyers of the Shelby Charger model, which was produced by Chrysler, was 28 years, compared with an average age of 42 years for buyers of other Chrysler products. A Top Racing Driver **********The Shelby name is something of a legend in automotive circles. He gained an international reputation as a top racing driver in the 1950's, but a heart ailment (he drove his final races with nitroglycerine pills under his tongue) forced him to retire in 1960. **********Seeking another career, he figured out a way to stuff a big Ford V-8 engine into a British sports car chassis and created the Shelby AC Cobra. The little two-seater had big performance, and racing versions of it won the 24-hour competition at LeMans, France, two consecutive years. Cobras have since become some of the most desirable collector cars, with models that sold for under $10,000 new now commanding close to $100,000. **********The arrangement that Mr. Shelby has with Chrysler today is similar to the one he had with the Ford Motor Company in the 1960's. The connection in both cases is Lee A. Iacocca, the president of Ford then and the chairman of Chrysler now. ''I'd have never gotten back into this business if it handn't been for Lee,'' Mr. Shelby said. Shelby Mustangs **********While he was associated with Ford, Mr. Shelby bought Mustang models from the company, increased the performance and sold them as Shelby Mustangs. In that era, performance was obtained by using large, fuel-consuming V-8 engines, but by the end of the 1960's increasingly stringent Federal emission standards and fuel economy regulations made it clear that the ''muscle car'' was going the way of the dinosaur. Production of the Shelby Mustangs stopped in 1970. **********The first model out of Shelby Automobiles Inc. is a version of Chrysler's Dodge Omni subcompact sedan dubbed the GLHS (which stands for Goes Like Hell-Shelby). Although the Omni is a 10-year-old design, the addition of a turbocharger and special suspension components give the sports car improved acceleration and handling. **********''This car will blow off a 944 Porsche (a model costing more than $20,000) and the price is $10,990,'' Mr. Shelby said. ''That's what I call affordable performance.'' Unlike his previous models, the current generation of Shelby cars has not sacrificed fuel economy for speed. The GLHS has a Federal fuel economy rating of 20 miles a gallon in city driving. **********The GLHS has received good reviews from auto enthusiast magazines, and dealers report an influx of orders, although some do not have any cars to sell yet. ''My allocation is supposed to be 20 cars,'' said Tom Carey, general manager of Crestwood Dodge, in the Detroit area. ''They're all sold, but I haven't gotten my first car yet.'' An Unexpected Delay **********Mr. Shelby's associates said there was an unexpected delay in obtaining emissions certification, but that shipments are under way. **********The other auto companies have performance programs, too, but they are keeping them in-house. Chrysler seems to be seeking to duplicate what in at least one instance has already proved to be a low-risk approach to developing specialty models. **********When Chrysler revived the convertible in 1981, the first cars were standard hardtops modified by an outside company to avoid the cost of tooling an assembly line. Only when sales rose to mass production levels were convertibles produced in Chrysler factories. **********Under the arrangement with Chrysler, Mr. Shelby will buy limited numbers of different basic models from the company and modify them for resale under his own name. Only 500 GLHS models are planned and all have already been purchased by the 75 Dodge dealers who have signed up for the Shelby franchise. **********Mr. Shelby plans to produce three or four different models a year in volumes of 500 to 2,000 each. If demand outstrips the capacity of the Shelby shop, Chrysler will consider taking over production, as it did with the convertible. ''If Carroll hits a home run, then Chrysler can move production into one of our assembly plants,'' Mr. Greenwald said. 'Starting Out on Top' **********The economic advantages work both ways, Mr. Shelby said. The reason most specialty car makers have failed financially, he said, is that engineering, safety and emissions standards are so costly to meet. **********''When I buy a car from Chrysler, I'm starting out on top of a billion dollars worth of engineering,'' he added. ''There's no way I could operate without a good relationship with Chrysler.'' **********Industry watchers say that Mr. Shelby has chosen an attractive segment of the market to operate in. ''The market for exotic specialty cars has been a growth one, even through the last energy crisis and economic falloff,'' said David E. Davis Jr., editor of Automobile magazine. **********Mr. Shelby's next model will be a performance version of the Dodge Lancer sports sedan that will be a bit more plush than the relatively austere Omni. And, in the wings, are cars that will use 16 valve heads (there are usually eight), rather than turbochargers, to increase power, and others with full-time four-wheel drive. **********Mr. Shelby said that low production volumes would tend to enhance the value of the cars bearing his name, and the current prices of Cobras indicate the approach works. **********''I want to sell 1,000 of a car that could sell 10,000,'' he said. ''People don't want to see themselves coming around the corner. They want something a little special.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/25/world/italian-judge-opens-inquiry-into-charges-of-israeli-abduction.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 344, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ITALIAN JUDGE OPENS INQUIRY INTO CHARGES OF ISRAELI ABDUCTION", "print_headline": "ITALIAN JUDGE OPENS INQUIRY INTO CHARGES OF ISRAELI ABDUCTION", "body_text": " **********An Italian magistrate formally opened a judicial inquiry today into allegations that an Israeli nuclear technician was abducted here and taken back to Israel to stand trial for treason and espionage. **********The announcement came as Israel was said to have asked the Government ''not to take into account'' an allegation by the technician, Mordecai Vanunu, that he had been kidnapped in Rome on Sept. 30, apparently after arriving here from London. **********Mr. Vanunu had written this information on the palm of one hand, and he flashed it to reporters as he was being taken to court in Jerusalem on Sunday. **********The Foreign Ministry said the Israeli Ambassador had described Mr. Vanunu's dramatic gesture as an attempt to manipulate public opinion.

Inventory and employment levels were significantly lower, however. **********Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of purchasing and distribution for Pitney Bowes Inc., attributed the sluggish growth to a prolonged recovery cycle in which overall production has been restrained but firm. ''This is one of the longest periods of recovery we have seen, and it will probably continue for the next six months,'' he said.

''That should change after the first of the year, when companies rush to replenish inventories and new orders pick up,'' Mr. Bretz said. #32% Report Lower Employment The report said that employment declined even further in November, with 32 percent of the purchasers reporting lower employment. This, too, is the highest such figure since January 1983, when it was 36 percent. Industry experts said that the continuing decline in employment is in part due to a slowing of the current recovery and to gains in productivity. ''Companies have just learned to live with and manage a lower base of employment,'' Mr. Bretz said. **********For the third consecutive month, purchasers reporting higher prices exceeded those reporting lower prices by a ratio of more than 3 to 1.

It is widely seen as signaling the possible end of a long era of security. **********Until Saturday, there was no record of a Jew's having been killed in Turkey because he was a Jew. The only known anti-Jewish riots, two days of material destruction in Edirne and other towns of northern Turkey, took no lives, and the Government of Kemal Ataturk acted strongly against rioters and officials who failed to prevent the violence. **********Turkish security officials say they believe the carnage Saturday in Neve Shalom Synagogue was the work of a suicide squad of two Arabs, and Turkish Jews eagerly tell foreigners that it was unthinkable that Turks perpetrated the crime. Yet it has shown Turkey's Jews that an age marked by terror has caught up with them. Turkey Still Tolerant **********Jewish officials, with Chief Rabbi David Asseo setting the tone, say the security of Turkish Jews has not been diminished. They say so because they believe Turkey remains tolerant and because they feel that their loyalty to Turkey requires reaffirmation in a moment of crisis, so that tolerance will not be diminished. **********But in interviews, many Turkish Jews say they fear the end of that sense of security. **********Recalling a punitive tax law directed mainly against the Jewish, Greek and Armenian minorities in the early 1940's and revoked two years later, a prominent Jewish business official said, ''Since then and up to Saturday morning I have never felt in danger because of my religion.'' **********Turkish Jews now note as if it were a thing of the past the fact that even in the 1970's, when this country became a battlefield between leftist and rightist extremists and terrorism was rampant, Jews were never singled out as targets. **********One of the reasons for the comparatively sheltered and low-profile life of the Jews has been deep-seated Turkish isolationism. Governments have always discouraged their citizens from having formal links to foreign or international organizations. As a result, Turkish Jews have never been prominent in international Jewish activities or in public support for Israel. 'Sense of Safety Undermined' **********''Now this sense of safety has been undermined,'' a Jewish resident said, summing conversations with friends. ''People are talking about not going to the synagogue in groups and worry about going to their Jewish clubs.'' **********Because of the closeness of the Jews of Istanbul, who number about 20,000 of the approximately 22,000 Turkish Jews, nearly everyone appears to have known one of the victims or somebody close to one of them. The funeral Wednesday, at the scene of the tragedy, is expected to occasion an outpouring of grief. **********Turkish Jews are generally conservative and religiously observant, and their private lives are lived largely apart from their fellow citizens, who are nearly 100 percent Moslems. There is little intermarriage. **********Except for about 800 Jews of Eastern European origin and a small number of Jews from Georgia, Istanbul's Jews are descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. People are often fluent in Ladino, the Renaissance Spanish the refugees brought with them. **********A larger number of people are descendants of the followers of Sabbatai Zvi, a 17th-century Jew from Izmir who proclaimed himself to be the Messiah but later converted to Islam. **********Although not prominent in politics, Turkish Jews are firm defenders of the secular tenets established by Ataturk, the founder of the republic, and like many Turks they have been concerned over a rise in Islamic fundamentalism. **********''It may sound cynical,'' a prominent Jewish professional said.

F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc., the lead underwriter for the issue, declined to comment. But market sources said L. F.

F. Rothschild officials were confident enough that the transaction would be completed that they ran a standard ''tombstone'' advertisement in the Wednesday issue of The Wall Street Journal. **********But shortly after 4 P.M. on Wednesday, Standard & Poor's announced a new, lower rating of CCC+, citing increased risk to investors as a result of the larger size of the financing. ''With the extra amount of debt, the B- rating was no longer reflective of the risk to investors,'' said Keith Mulhare, an analyst at S.&P. He noted that the B- rating was assigned last Friday, two days before L. F. Rothschild increased the size of the issue. **********In its announcement of the CCC+ rating, Standard & Poor's said New World's ability to generate cash was ''insufficient'' to adequately service the expanded debt and noted that the company's aggressive financial posture and future acquisitions might cause even greater indebtedness in the future. **********New World, a movie producer and distributor that is also active in the home video business, has not identified the acquisitions it plans to finance with the debenture proceeds. **********Some analysts were skeptical of the 12 1/4 percent yield on the 12-year debentures even before the lower rating was announced. **********Philip T. Maffei, executive vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, a New York credit rating firm, issued a report last week saying investors should expect a 13 percent yield on the ''relatively high risk'' debentures.

But yesterday, most of the action, and the reason stock prices rose at the close, was due to the relationship between the price of the March Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract and the underlying stocks. **********'A Brilliant Move' **********''The index arbitragers pulled a brilliant move,'' said Jack Barbanel, director of futures trading at Gruntal & Company. ''What they did was sell March futures, which were trading at a hefty premium, bought stocks and allowed their December futures contracts to expire at expiration.'' **********There was in fact a great deal of stock selling at the close yesterday. But the sell orders were more than offset by a rush of buy programs, a surge which pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up by a little over 6 points in the final minute. **********By initiating an arbitrage between the March S.&P. contract and the cash market, Mr. Barbanel said that program traders not only picked up stocks cheaply relative to that contract, but also enhanced the value of the expiring December contract. **********''As they were buying stocks, the value of the cash S.&P. index was pushed up,'' he explained. ''That in turn raises the price of the expiring futures contract.'' **********At expiration the value of the expiring contract and the underlying stocks are at parity. Concern About a Contract **********Before the opening bell yesterday, a number of analysts were worried about an abnormally large open interest position in the December S.&P. 500 contract that expired at 4 P.M. At the close on Thursday, open interest in the December S.&P. contract was more than 56,000 contracts. Since futures contracts must be closed out on expiration, this meant that potentially billions of dollars worth of stock would be traded at the close yesterday. **********''The great fear was that the open interest was comprised of people who were long stock and short futures, and that people would be selling stock at the close, '' said Edward F. McCartin, chairman of the equity indexes committee at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the S.&P. 500 contract is traded. The reason traders would sell stock would be to raise cash in order to honor the terms of the future contract. **********Estimated volume figures from the Chicago Merc suggest that some of the unusual activity involving the sale of March contracts and the purchase of stock may have been going on. **********Trading in the expiring December contract was just over 25,000 contracts yesterday, by far the lowest volume recorded on the last five triple expiration days. The fact that so few changed hands suggests that traders hung on to their positions and settled for cash at the close. **********By contrast, more than 80,000 March contracts changed hands yesterday. **********Mr. McCarran acknowledged that there was some selling of the March contract, but added that other factors may have also been at work. **********''The March S.&P. contract was not the only index contract that was trading at a premium to stocks,'' he said. ''From what I understand, there was a very large buy program associated with the Value Line index, which was also selling at a premium to the market.'' **********According to unsubstantiated rumors, Salomon Brothers initiated a buy program, and purchased around $2 billion worth of stock at the close. The Value Line index future that is traded at the Kansas City Board of Trade is the broadest index product available, tracking movements in more than 1,000 issues."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/business/company-news-employee-unions-sue-safeway.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Employee Unions Sue Safeway", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Employee Unions Sue Safeway", "body_text": " **********Safeway Stores Inc. said that unions representing its employees had filed suit in California Superior Court in Alameda County against the company; Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, and others, including Safeway shareholders and the banks providing financing for the pending leveraged buyout of the supermarket chain. **********The suit does not seek a preliminary injunction to block the buyout, but asks the court to declare the transaction a fraud, restrain Safeway's assets and appoint a receiver so that the union's and employees' claims as creditors can be answered.

Walter Thompson, U.S.A., the domestic company, and general manager of the Chicago office. Donald G. Sullivan, 45, is being brought in from the presidency of Ketchum Advertising/ USA to fill the post. **********A major change within the JWT Group that Mr. O'Donnell did not decide on was the promotion of Robert L. Dilenschneider, 42, to president and chief executive of its Hill & Knowlton subsidiary, the world's second-largest public relations firm after Burson-Marsteller. He replaces Loet A.

Well, he got where he is without plotting a career path even though he did attend business school. He also played rugby and that tells you something - here's a man that grabs for the gusto. **********Perhaps more important to some, he's been a golfer since before joining the team at Columbia, where, it may be noted, he was also a defensive middle guard on the football team that shared the Ivy League championship with Harvard in 1961. **********After getting his bachelor's degree and studying for a while at business school, while playing on the Old Blue rugby team, he was pretty much headed toward a career of coaching football. But he decided to give the business world a try. ''And I never looked back,'' he said. A number of agencies wanted him, but Jack Connors, publisher of Travel & Leisure and a brother-in-law of a brother-in-law, advised him to chose Doyle Dane Bernbach. **********He must have taken to account work because he was a vice president and management supervisor in three and a half years and before he hit 30. He left to be executive vice president of Cox & Company, where he learned the business as one can only learn it from the perspective of a small agency. **********His next step was J. Walter Thompson. Here he was to be tested and not found wanting. **********The first major test was to be the top man on the Ford account in the Detroit office, starting in January 1978, just as a scandal began to erupt involving volume discounts to the sales promotion unit not being passed along to Ford. Mr. O'Donnell quickly closed the sales promotion unit. And, eight months after arriving was made head of the office. One of his major tasks was to restore staff confidence. **********Mr. O'Donnell was shifted four years ago to the Chicago office, an agency much in need of growth. It was billing some $260 million then and is billing $470 million now. So the shots apparently worked. Mr. O'Donnell, who has the habit of following the mention of an admired person's name (like Ned Doyle or Don Johnston) with ''God bless 'em.''), did not think there was anyone inside the Chicago office that was ready to follow him and continue the changes there. That, he said, was the reason he went outside for Mr. Sullivan. **********Mr. O'Donnell is the sixth chief executive in the 122-year history of the agency, which ended last year with billings of $2.52 billion. **********In a recently mailed ''Industry Review,'' Charles G.

And one of the areas likely to come under close scrutiny in the weeks ahead, along with intense lobbying pressure, is the section that would impose changes in the increasingly popular 401(k) retirement plans. **********Such plans, also known as salary-reduction plans or qualified cash-or-deferred arrangements, are established by companies and let workers voluntarily reduce part of their pay, which is then invested by their employer. Not only is there no current income tax due on payments made to this type of account, but investment earnings also accumulate on a tax-free basis until the money is withdrawn. In the last few years, these plans have become the fastest-growing employee benefit. **********Since 401(k) plans - named after the section of the tax code describing them - were introduced in 1978 and proposed regulations were written three years later, about 10 million of the 19 million eligible employees have chosen to participate. Employers matched employee deferrals, wholly or partly, in more than 80 percent of the plans last year surveyed by Hewitt Associates, a benefit consulting firm. ''They've been extremely popular among employees,'' said Tom Butterworth, a Hewitt consultant. ''It's the combination of retirement savings and the fact that it can be done in a tax-sheltered way.'' **********The bill passed in 1985 by the House of Representatives would make a number of major modifications in the way that 401(k) plans operate. Perhaps the most controversial is the segment dealing with the relationship between 401(k)'s and Individual Retirement Accounts. **********Under current law, workers can have both 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s. The maximum that can be contributed to a 401(k) is $30,000 or 25 percent of nondeferred compensation, whichever is less. The majority of corporations with plans set lower percentage limits for contributions. Yet whatever the amount, an employee can still put up to $2,000 of earned income into an I.R.A. **********The House bill, however, limits the annual cap on deferrals to the lesser of $7,000 or 25 percent of nondeferred compensation, which would probably cover the amount that most employees could save this way. But a proposal that could be even more significant is the first-dollar I.R.A. offset for 401(k) plans. **********What this means is that 401(k) contributions would reduce the $2,000 I.R.A. deduction dollar-for-dollar. Because of this coordination, an employee would not have the right to put $2,000 in an I.R.A. and $5,000 in a 401(k), as many individuals assume. A contribution of, say, $1,500 to a 401(k) would restrict the employee's I.R.A. contribution to $500. **********''People will tell you there's a $7,000 cap on 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s, but that's not really true,'' said Peter I. Elinsky, Washington tax partner of Peat Marwick, the certified public accounting firm. ''It's a trick done with mirrors. If you want to put in more than $2,000, the only way to do it is in a 401(k).'' **********Furthermore, the House measure, formally known as H.R. 3838, calls for a Jan. 1, 1986, effective date on this aspect of the new tax law. While there is a chance that the date will be changed at the conference to reconcile the House bill and the possibly forthcoming Senate bill, it poses problems for those now investing in their 1986 I.R.A.'s The reason is that, if the House restrictions on I.R.A.'s for workers with 401(k) plans are enacted, an employee's deposits in an I.R.A. this year could be turn out to be too large. And while those excess contributions can be withdrawn without an Internal Revenue Service penalty before an employee files a 1986 tax return - which for most taxpapayers is April 15, 1987 - there may be a separate penalty imposed by a financial institution on premature withdrawals from long-term certificates. **********''If you think the House bill will pass, you should put your I.R.A. money this year in a flexible account, like a money market fund or a bank money market deposit account,'' said David S. Rhine, a partner in the certified public accounting firm of Seidman & Seidman/BDO. ''Don't invest it in something like a five-year C.D., because you may be subject to a withdrawal penalty.'' **********Many other variations from the current 401(k) rules are also in the proposed House legislation. Among them are these: Public and nonprofit employers would not be able to establish plans, the tax break of 10-year forward averaging for distributions from a plan could no longer be used and the excise tax on withdrawals before age 59 1/2 would be increased to 15 percent, unless paid out as a life annuity. Furthermore, when a plan lets employees borrow from their accounts, the interest on those loans could not be deducted. **********Many financial advisers believe that, even if the effective date for the 401(k) plan requirements is not postponed to next Jan. 1, Congress may still make special provisions for actions taken by taxpayers this year. Therefore, in the event an employee's company has a plan currently in effect, it might be advantageous to contribute as much as possible to the plan or borrow from the plan whatever may be necessary in 1986."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/world/lebanese-premier-calls-for-a-new-political-system.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1986-01-21", "snippet": "", "word_count": 576, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEBANESE PREMIER CALLS FOR A NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM", "print_headline": "LEBANESE PREMIER CALLS FOR A NEW POLITICAL SYSTEM", "body_text": " **********Prime Minister Rashid Karami called today for a new political system for Lebanon, including an immediate end to Christian dominance, as a substitute for a foiled Syrian-sponsored peace accord. **********Mr. Karami, apparently alluding to President Amin Gemayel, a Christian, said the presence of a ''party man'' as head of state was a mistake.

The militia, the National Syrian Social Party, has dug trenches a few miles east of Mr. Gemayel's hometown, Bikfeiya. **********According to the Beirut press, Mr. Hobeika is expected in Damascus shortly and will then go to the Christian town of Zahle in eastern Lebanon to set up a headquarters from which to challenge Mr. Gemayel and his supporters.

''It made a mockery of the country's Constitution,'' he said. **********The best solution for Lebanon's political disputes, the Prime Minister declared, would be the immediate ''cancellation'' of the 42-year-old system of assigning state posts along religious lines. Mr. Karami noted that the Syrian-sponsored peace pact had provided for a 15-year transition to a new system, but he said no such transition should now be provided. **********Under the current system, Christians are assigned the leading executive and military posts, as well as the larger number of seats in Parliament. **********The Moslems say they have become the majority and are demanding parity with the Christians in the Cabinet and Parliament. Christian leaders have objected to any change in the distribution of seats, saying it would bring them under Moslem control."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/world/around-the-world-no-fishing-zone-imposed-off-falklands.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 109, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "'No Fishing' Zone Imposed Off Falklands", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; 'No Fishing' Zone Imposed Off Falklands", "body_text": " **********Britain moved today to halt overfishing around the Falkland Islands and to head off Argentine encroachment by declaring a 150-mile protected zone. **********In Buenos Aires, a spokesman for President Raul Alfonsin's Government, Jose Ignacio Lopez, rejected the declaration, calling the decision an affront to Argentine sovereignty in the area of the islands. **********The Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, announced the decision in Parliament and cited among the reasons ''aggressive patrolling'' by Argentina and Argentina's failure to cooperate in reaching a fisheries agreement. **********Britain told the United Nations that the establishment of the fishing zone was a temporary measure."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/world/around-the-world-swedish-police-doubt-chilean-connection.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 139, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Swedish Police Doubt Chilean Connection", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Swedish Police Doubt Chilean Connection", "body_text": " **********The Swedish police cast doubt today on a British newspaper report that said investigators suspected the Chilean secret police had plotted the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme. **********A police spokesman, Leif Hallberg, said that the leads in the investigation were ''not inclined in the direction'' that the killing was ordered from outside Sweden. **********Mr. Hallberg said the field of suspects had ''narrowed gradually,'' but that current leads ''cannot be told to the outside.'' **********On Sunday, The Observer quoted an unidentified Swedish government source as saying Sweden was ''actively investigating a Chilean connection'' in the assassination of President Palme on a Stockholm street Feb. 28. **********The Observer said the Chilean secret police ''are known to have plotted for more than a decade'' to kill President Palme."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/24/world/jury-in-el-al-bomb-case-begins-deliberations.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1986-10-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 706, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "JURY IN EL AL BOMB CASE BEGINS DELIBERATIONS", "print_headline": "JURY IN EL AL BOMB CASE BEGINS DELIBERATIONS", "body_text": " **********With a parting glance at Nezar Hindawi as he sat staring from the Old Bailey dock, the 12 members of the jury began verdict deliberations today on the charge that the 32-year-old Jordanian tried to blow up an Israeli airliner. **********After five hours of conferring, the jury retired for the night with deliberations to continue Friday morning. **********Prosecution and defense offered the jury diametric depictions of the defendant as either a committed terrorist with possible ties to Syria, or as a duped drug smuggler who had no idea that he was handing a luggage bomb to his lover April 17, when he dropped her off at Heathrow and told her to head for the El Al counter. **********''He got very close, didn't he get close, to getting that bomb on board that aircraft,'' the prosecutor, Roy Amlot, told the jury in his summation, contending that shortly before the defendant kissed his lover goodbye he casually armed the sophisticated, well-concealed luggage bomb to destroy the plane as it flew above Europe with 375 passengers, including the woman and his unborn child. **********In his final argument for freedom, Mr. Hindawi and his lawyers presented a theory that the whole affair was engineered not by Syrian intelligence agents, as the prosecution has suggested, but by Israeli intelligence agents aiming to embarass Syria in ''the comity of nations.'' **********''Forget the Middle East and its repercussions,'' said the defense attorney, Gilbert Gray, after darkly summoning up the possible implications of a guilty verdict. ''If war starts the day after tomorrow, it is not your fault.'' **********The judge, Mr. Justice William Mars-Jones, a meticulous, normally merry-eyed man, soon was scowling in reprimand at the defense counsel. ''It is a suggestion which should never have been made,'' he declared, telling the jurors their verdict was only about an alleged bomb plot and would ''not make the slightest difference'' in international relations. **********The latter is a contention that clearly would not be endorsed by some of the diplomatic observers awaiting the outcome of the trial, with its testimony from Mr. Hindawi that Syrian officials extended help to him when he fled to their embassy after the bomb plot was discovered. He said they provided him with transportation and shelter not because they were bomb plotters but because they suspected a ruse to embarass Syria. **********Syria has denied any involvement in the bomb plot and declined to waive diplomatic immunity. Nevertheless, a guilty verdict for Mr. Hindawi would likely raise the question of whether Britain might feel compelled to take some diplomatic action. **********Within the court, the most remarkable point in the summations has been the judge's clear skepticism toward some of the things the defendant and his lawyers have told the jury. Today, for example, Justice Mars-Jones focused on the defense contention that the police fabricated a confession that included a specific phone number in Damascus. **********''Where could the police have got that from except from him?'' the judge asked. ''If he said that, there's no doubt about it, this man placed that bomb in his girlfriend's luggage.'' **********The defense, to the contrary, has argued that the hand of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, was clear in the affair from the very lack of telltale clues. **********The judge emphatically instructed the jurors to note that there had been no evidence introduced to substantiate a theory of Mossad complicity. He also instructed them not to pay excessive attention to Mr. Hindawi's testimony that might imply complicity by Syria. **********''What he has said may be evidence against him, but it is not evidence against the Syrian Government,'' the judge said. **********Mr. Gray focused on the testimony of Ann Murphy, the defendant's lover, that Mr. Hindawi gave her a reddish brown piece of luggage, not the generally blue bag placed in evidence. Therefore, Mr. Gray contended, the bag had been switched at the El Al counter. **********Mr. Amlot said the conflict in description was an innocent error and that Miss Murphy was a ''simple, unsophisticated Irish lass and a Catholic'' who had been seduced and exploited."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/business/briefs-605686.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 226, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BRIEFS", "print_headline": "BRIEFS", "body_text": " *********** Chevron Corp. said it expects to conclude soon the sale of Chevron's Italian refining and marketing operation to Isab S.p.A.

The investigators said they would check to determine if copies of any of the missing documents were contained on the disks. **********According to the burglary report filed after the second interview with Mr. Dunbar, he told the officers that the file contained ''information concerning the sale of weapons and nuclear devices to Iran and an involved party in Korea.'' Later, he explained that he was not referring to nuclear weapons but to equipment for a security system for a nuclear power plant in Korea. **********Mr. Hakim and General Secord are partners in a company, Stanford Trading Group International, that has offices in suburban Virginia near Washington and in Campbell, which, like Los Gatos and Cupertino, is situated about 50 miles south of here near San Jose. A Series of Burglaries **********The break-in was the latest in a series of burglaries that have been reported recently at offices involved in one way or another with United States activities in Central America. **********Early this month, the Center for Constitutional Rights, a New York-based lawyers' group that has been critical of Reagan Administration policies in the region, said its Washington office had been burglarized. Officers of the group said they had information that during the past two years at least 25 other small political groups that had opposed Administration Central American policies had been burglarized. **********There has been no evidence that the burglaries are related. **********According to detectives, the burglary of Mr. Dunbar's office occurred Saturday night. At 10:40 P.M., they said, a private security company retained by the law firm received an alarm indicating that a silent burglar alarm at the law office had been triggered. Within five minutes, they said, the company advised the Sheriff's Department that a burglary was apparently in progress. Door Pried Open **********Five minutes later, Lieutenant Davis said, a patrol car arrived at the law office in a low-slung office building, but the burglars had disappeared. A wooden door leading into the office had been pried open, he said, triggering the alarm. **********The investigators said that the burglars appeared to have been in the law office for only 10 minutes. **********''They appeared to know what they were looking for,'' Lieutenant Davis said. ''I gather it was quite a thick file.'' **********After he was called to his office by the deputy sheriffs who responded to the burglar alarm, Mr. Dunbar said that the office appeared to have been untouched except for the missing box of computer disks. **********A short time later, he called the deputies and said he had discovered the file regarding Mr. Hakim's activities had been stolen.

Walsh has spent 50 years weaving the threads of public service and private representation into a career that has included frequent troubleshooting missions, occasional controversy, moments in the spotlight, experience as a prosecutor, judge and advocate and service at the highest levels of the profession. **********Today he said that the job of independent counsel was ''probably the most important that I've been asked to do.'' Then he added: ''And so I wanted to do it.'' **********Thirteen years ago Mr. Walsh was on the list of potential special prosecutors to head the Watergate investigation. For decades, his name has been on nearly any list of lawyers required for various blue-ribbon assignments. Over the years, one of his former law partners said today that ''private clients have turned to him when they were in trouble and public officials have turned to him when government was in trouble.'' **********A trim and vigorous six-footer who will turn 75 on Jan. 8, Mr. Walsh was once described as looking as if he had stepped out of the pages of a Louis Auchincloss novel about a Wall Street lawyer. Wall St. Practice **********Indeed, Wall Street law practice was his professional center of gravity for most of his career. For 20 years, he was a partner in the firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, specializing in litigation on behalf of corporate clients. **********In 1981, before he turned 70, the usual retirement age for partners in the firm, he left Davis Polk and moved to Oklahoma City, his wife's hometown. He established an active law practice there that frequently brought him back to New York in collaboration with his old law firm. **********But in those years on Wall Street, private law practice was scarcely all-consuming. First, Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller called on him for a yearlong assignment as head of a special commission to recommend reforms in the way New York State regulated the liquor industry. Then Mayor-elect John V. Lindsay put him in charge of an anti-crime panel. **********As a trustee of Columbia University and president of the university's Alumni Federation, he made recommendations to the university in the wake of the 1968 student riots. He urged Columbia and its alumni to ''forthrightly attack the problem of making Harlem a self-sufficient, healthy community.'' Deputy at Paris Peace Talks **********In 1969, President-elect Nixon named Mr. Walsh as the deputy to Henry Cabot Lodge, the chief United States negotiator at the Paris peace talks seeking an end to the war in Vietnam. The talks foundered, and both men resigned later that year. **********Mr. Walsh was the chairman of the American Bar Association's standing committee on the Federal judiciary when that panel approved two of President Nixon's Supreme Court nominees, Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. and G. Harrold Carswell. The Senate rejected both nominees, and both the bar association and Mr. Walsh came under intense criticism. **********''I still carry scars from that,'' he said in an interview some years ago. ''It's not a job to do if you're afraid of scars.'' **********Asked at a news conference today whether he wished he had handled the matter differently, Mr. Walsh said today that he would still recommend the confirmation of Judge Haynsworth, who had a respected career as a Federal appellate judge. Of Mr. Carswell, he said: ''I'm not going to express any view on him now. It's no longer important.'' **********Months later, Mr. Walsh's committee refused to endorse two other Nixon Administration choices for the Supreme Court, Herschel H. Friday and Mildred Lillie. Mr. Nixon and his Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, were so angry that they cut the committee out of the nomination process and shunned Mr. Walsh, who had enjoyed easy access at high levels of the Administration. Worked Against Meskill **********In 1975, Mr. Walsh, then president-elect of the American Bar Association, led a long and unsuccessful effort to defeat the nomination of Gov. Thomas J. Meskill of Connecticut to the United States Court of Appeals in New York. President Nixon had nominated Mr. Meskill before resigning the Presidency. **********Although Mr. Walsh is often addressed as judge, his judicial tenure was a short chapter in his career. President Eisenhower named him to the Federal District Court in Manhattan in 1954. In his most important judicial assignment, he presided over the litigation resulting from the 1956 collision of the Andrea Doria and the Stockholm. **********He left the bench three years later to become Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 job in the Justice Department. The Attorney General, William P. Rogers, was an old friend and colleague from the days when the two young lawyers worked for Thomas E. Dewey, the Manhattan District Attorney, in the late 1930's. **********When Mr. Dewey became Governor of New York, Mr. Walsh went to work for him as an assistant counsel and was named chief counsel in 1950. The next year, he became chief counsel of the state's Public Service Commission. In 1953, he was named executive director and general counsel to the Waterfront Commission, which had the mission of cleaning up corruption on the New York docks. Born in Nova Scotia **********Lawrence Edward Walsh was born Jan. 8, 1912, in Port Maitland, Nova Scotia, a fishing town where his father, Cornelius Edward Walsh, was a physician. His mother was the former Lila May Sanders. The family moved to New York when he was 2 years old. He grew up in Queens and became a naturalized citizen at the age of 10. **********He graduated from Columbia College in 1932 and from the law school in 1935. For seven summers, he earned money by working as a merchant seaman. He had originally intended to be an engineer until he discovered he was ''incompetent'' at mathematics. **********Mr. Walsh's first wife, Maxine, died. In 1965 he married Mary Alma Porter of Oklahoma City. He has four daughters and a son. **********Mr. Walsh's reputation for being unflappable was put to the test as he approached a crowded news conference today. A radio reporter and a photographer standing near him practically came to blows over who could get the closest. He glanced at the contenders, and then he walked calmly into the room. **********He turned away concern that he was too old for the job. ''I haven't been concerned with my own age,'' he said. ''So I'm satisfied.'' **********And he prompted much laughter among reporters when he good-naturedly defended himself against allegations that his ties to the Republican Party might affect the investigation's objectivity. **********''If you have to have a career in one party or another,'' he said, ''I can't think of a better party.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/23/business/tax-trial-only-one-of-posner-problems.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1117, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TAX TRIAL ONLY ONE OF POSNER PROBLEMS", "print_headline": "TAX TRIAL ONLY ONE OF POSNER PROBLEMS", "body_text": " **********The long-delayed tax-evasion trial of Victor Posner is scheduled to start today in the Federal District Court in Miami, affording a rare public glimpse into the dealings of the secretive financier and corporate raider. **********Mr. Posner is accused of artificially inflating the value of a 22-acre tract of land he donated to Miami Christian College in the mid-1970's.

A reorganization plan is expected to be approved soon, and it is likely that, for the first time, Mr. Posner will be forced out of a company he controls. **********Another Posner holding, the Sharon Steel Corporation, is in default on some bond interest payments and has warned that it too may have to seek protection from creditors. Hurt by Interest Rate Rises **********Mr. Posner's hallmark has been to invest in undervalued companies, often borrowing against the assets of other holdings. When interest rates skyrocketed in the early 1980's, however, Mr. Posner was caught in the squeeze, Wall Street sources said. **********Now, lackluster companies saddled with enormous debt characterize many Posner holdings. And shareholders have criticized Mr. Posner for paying himself huge salaries while his companies post mounting losses. **********Mr. Posner did not return phone calls to his office late last week. But other Posner executives said in interviews that Sharon Steel and Evans Products were isolated failures, bedeviled by poor market conditions or blunders by prior managements, which give otherwise sound holdings an undeserved black eye. **********''DWG has a ton of fantastic companies,'' said Bruce Paparella, vice president of investment research for the Posner-controlled concerns, referring to the DWG Corporation, one of three umbrella holding companies through which Mr. Posner controls dozens of other corporate entities. Among the healthy companies Mr. Paparella cited were the National Propane Corporation and the Royal Crown Cola Company. Royal Crown had profits last year of about $20 million, he said. **********''Whatever else people say about him, he didn't put Evans in bad shape,'' said Abraham Zaleznik, a professor at the Harvard Business School and an Evans Products director from 1971 until 1983, when Mr. Posner took control of the Portland, Ore., company. Mr. Zaleznik, who nonetheless was critical of Mr. Posner's management style, said that Evans Products had posted losses for a few years before the takeover. **********Mr. Posner and his family holding company, the Security Management Corporation, own controlling stakes of between 17 and 38 percent in the three umbrella companies, DWG, NVF and the Pennsylvania Engineering Corporation. Mr. Posner serves as chairman and chief executive of these companies and their subsidiaries. All three umbrella companies are losing money. **********NVF has not paid a cash dividend since 1982 and has lost about $200 million in the past two years. **********''NVF is being weighed down by Sharon Steel,'' said Mr. Paparella. The Pennsylvania steel company, which is 86 percent-owned by NVF, lost $64 million last year and $145 million in 1984 as a result of the downturn in the steel industry, he added. Resistance by Bondholders **********According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March, Sharon has a negative net worth of $197 million. Bondholders have resisted offers to refinance the company's publicly held debt with an exchange of new securities. ''Barring the exchange, Sharon will go into bankruptcy,'' Mr. Paparella said. **********''And if Sharon goes under, it'll probably take NVF with it,'' said William E. Paxton, a certified public accountant in Cleveland who spent six weeks last year analyzing the Posner holdings for The Wall Street Journal. **********In the past 16 months, Mr. Posner has raised more than $400 million by selling his stock in companies such as Peabody International Inc., Johnson Controls Inc., the City Investing Company and the National Can Corporation. A large portion of the proceeds went to pay off Sharon's $200 million in bank loans. **********Even DWG, a once-profitable holding company with interests in apparel, liquefied petroleum and public utilities, has felt the strain. For the nine months ended Jan. 31, DWG reported a loss of $5.9 million, compared with a net income of $8.4 million for the same period a year earlier. As of Jan. 31, DWG had $568 million in debt, according to George A. Niemond, an analyst with Value Line Inc., a New York investment services company. The American Financial Corporation, which is controlled by Carl H. Lindner, the Cincinnati financier, recently acquired warrants for between 20 and 32 percent of DWG's common stock in exchange for a $55 million loan. Onus Put on Textile Company **********The Posner management puts the onus for DWG's problems mainly on one subsidiary, the Graniteville Company, a textile manufacturer battered by cheaper imports. **********Mr. Posner pocketed $8.1 million in salary, stock and bonuses from DWG and its subsidiaries in the year ended April 1985, as compared with $1.9 million for the year before. He drew additional compensation from the other two holding companies and their subsidiaries. **********That has angered some shareholders. ''He felt he was entitled to it,'' said Mr. Paparella about the salary that made Mr. Posner one of the nation's highest-paid executives last year. Mr. Posner's personal fortune is estimated to exceed $100 million. **********Analysts and Wall Street insiders say Mr. Posner's personal wealth is well insulated against his empire's troubles. Whether his companies, which, according to Mr. Paxton, the Cleveland accountant, now carry about $2 billion in debt, can survive without selling off big chunks of assets is problematic. **********''We don't have any debt on any of the companies that we can't handle,'' said Mr. Paparella. **********''I think he's in too deep to get out now,'' said Mr. Paxton. ''I see the end of the empire coming up.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/01/business/pulitzer-sued-by-7-relatives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 176, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pulitzer Sued By 7 Relatives", "print_headline": "Pulitzer Sued By 7 Relatives", "body_text": " **********Seven members of the Pulitzer family sued the management of the Pulitzer Publishing Company yesterday in Federal District Court in St. Louis, accusing it of fraud and violation of securities laws.

He also made the point that the spot has a lot of energy. ''You get a lot of energy when you get 12 scenes in 20 seconds.'' **********With him at the time were Arthur Cohen, executive vice president, advertising, for Revlon Beauty Products, and Chris Miller, senior vice president, managing director of the agency. **********Mr. Cohen and Ms. Miller explained that when Charlie was introduced, its spirit was embodied in the free-spirited blonde model Shelly Hack, who whirled through the introduction commercial to the accompaniment of Bobby Short at the piano. **********''It captured the spirit of young women in the late 1960's and early 70's,'' Ms. Miller said. ''It was more than a fragrance, it was an attitude, and the advertising reflected it without defining it.'' **********The early Charlie woman was a single, independent working woman who was phased out in 1982 with a new campaign that substituted a woman who was seeking marriage and a family. **********Now, said Ms. Miller, it is sort of a combination of both attitudes, a woman who does want marriage and a family, ''but that isn't all she talks about.'' **********The concept of the descriptive Charlie commercial evolved as Mr. MacDougall and his creative partner, Catherine Campbell, a vice president and senior art director, were going through stacks of photos seeking models with the right look for a Charlie commercial. They got into the habit of saying, ''She's a Charlie,'' when they thought they spotted one. Then, realizing the potential, they built a commercial around that idea. **********There were some 600 to 700 photographs from five top model agencies to screen. Then the creative pair enplaned to Los Angeles to continue the auditions. Out there they saw in person or on videotape 125 women. Then, having winnowed the list to 25, they called in Mr. Cohen and his masterful eye. **********The search was for a woman of proper age who was beautiful, intelligent and energetic. Since the script also calls for kissing, their abilities in this form of interface were also tested, using the face of Nick Ciarlante, an agency producer, who in the commercial is also the one who gets his bottom patted by a Charlie. He gets paid for his work. **********The director of the spot was Jim Giddens of GMS Productions, Hollywood, who has never done a fragrance or cosmetics spot before. As a result, the Charlie spot is fresh and comparatively wholesome and quite unlike the rather weird Chanel and Obsession commercials or the blatantly sexual Paco Raban. **********''Sex is not everything to a girl who wears Charlie,'' explained worldly and loyal Mr. MacDougall, ''but she's as good at it as anybody else.'' **********The agency really had to work pretty fast creating and producing this advertising, since the fourth quarter - specifically early December and, most important, the six days before Christmas - is when fragrances really sell. **********The retail market is something like $2.5 billion in annual sales, according to Revlon, which also estimated advertising spending in the category at about $110 million. And that is for cyclical advertising programs, not for year-round ones. **********Because it is a terribly competitive, though scented, scene, Mr. Cohen is closed-mouthed about exact advertising budgets, preferring to say between $5 million and $10 million. The budget will all go into television, invested equally in spot TV, which H.H.C.C. buys, and network, for which Bozell Jacobs Kenyon & Eckhardt is agency of record."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/26/world/around-the-world-pakistan-says-4-outposts-were-shelled-by-afghans.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 165, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pakistan Says 4 Outposts Were Shelled by Afghans", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Pakistan Says 4 Outposts Were Shelled by Afghans", "body_text": " **********Afghan Government forces have heavily bombarded four Pakistani border posts in an area where an Afghan jet was reported shot down recently, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said today. **********It said in a statement that Afghan artillery shelled the militia posts on Wednesday in the northwestern Kurram tribal district, and then planes dropped 60 to 70 bombs on two of them. **********The statement said the posts were damaged but there were no casualties. **********It said Pakistan lodged a strong protest with the Afghan charge d'affaires in Islamabad over the attacks and the shelling on Friday of the Mohmand area northeast of Kurram. **********Pakistan said its F-16 jets shot down a Soviet-built Afghan ground-attack plane and hit another of four intruding planes on May 17. **********Afghanistan denied the report but said two planes were damaged that day in internal operations against Afghan guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/business/sales-soft-ibm-cuts-pc-prices.html": {"writer_name": "David Sanger", "pub_date": "1986-07-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 768, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SALES SOFT, I.B.M.

CUTS PC PRICES", "body_text": " **********A rapid erosion of the International Business Machines Corporation's lead in the personal computer market has forced company officials to take a series of urgent actions in recent weeks to restore I.B.M.'s position, computer retailers and industry analysts said yesterday. **********Their comments came a day after I.B.M. notified its dealers that it was cutting the wholesale price of several of its personal computer models, including one version of its top-of-the-line PC-AT, by up to 18 percent. It is unclear whether the action will result in any price savings for consumers. **********The price cut was apparently prompted by complaints from retailers that widespread price-cutting in the industry - sparked largely by the unexpected success of low-priced personal computer ''clones'' from overseas - had cut deeply into their profits in selling I.B.M. equipment. **********'Profits Are Eroding' **********''Dealers, not just Businessland and Computerland, can no longer make money selling the I.B.M. PC,'' Esther Dyson, a widely read industry analyst, said yesterday. ''Profits are eroding, for them and for I.B.M.'' In recent weeks, both Businessland and Computerland, two of I.B.M.'s largest retailers, have introduced ''private label'' I.B.M.-compatible computers for their stores that will compete with I.B.M. models. **********But in a telephone interview yesterday, the president of I.B.M.'s Entry Systems division, which is responsible for personal computer operations, denied that the company's price cuts were a sudden move or that changes in the personal computer market had taken the company by surprise. **********''I have not seen anything that surprised me,'' said the executive, William Lowe. He described the cuts as a ''continuation and extension'' of a promotion that started in April, though he said that the action was taken after an ''inquiry'' by dealers. **********That inquiry seemed sparked in part by what analysts call an unexpected reversal of fortunes for I.B.M. 'A Big Drop' in Market Share **********Surveys by Inforcorp, a market research firm in Cupertino, Calif., indicate that in the first five months of 1985, I.B.M. commanded about 30 percent of the personal computer business, a figure that fell to 25 percent during the same period this year. ''It's a big drop,'' said David A. Carnevale, the director of microcomputer research at Inforcorp. ''Suddenly this year, 'clone' is no longer a dirty word.'' **********That change in attitude, many believe, marks a significant turning point for the personal computer market. Through most of last year, the biggest purchasers of personal computer equipment, large businesses, trusted only I.B.M. or its major PC competitors, companies like the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Compaq Computer Corporation. And neither of those competitors significantly underpriced I.B.M., instead offering machines with additional features or greater power. **********In recent months, however, lesser-known brands such Leading Edge and Epson, produced in Asia, have gained increasing respectability, largely on the strength of favorable reviews from trade journals and consumer magazines. **********''Companies realized that for their low-end 8088 machines,'' Mr. Carnevale said, referring to the computers powered by the Intel Corporation's basic 8088 microprocessor, ''they didn't need I.B.M.'s umbrella of warmth, comfort and service. They just needed something that worked.'' **********At I.B.M., Mr. Lowe insisted that such changes had been fully expected. ''The key for our business has always been I.B.M. value-added and product differentiation,'' he said, ''and that's still the direction we intend to head.'' New PC-AT Expected **********According to industry reports, I.B.M. will soon introduce a new version of its PC-AT, its most profitable personal computer, that will include technical changes that competitors will probably have a difficult time matching. ''We haven't seen I.B.M.'s last shot at the clones,'' said Anthony Morris, the head of Morris Decision Systems, a Wall Street personal computer retailer, which sells mainly to large businesses. I.B.M., citing longstanding policy, declined to comment on future entries. **********The wholesale price cut is only I.B.M.'s latest move to mollify its retailers, who say that they have increasingly found themselves competing against I.B.M.'s own direct sales force for the largest personal computer accounts. **********Last month, the company announced a new program that allowed customers, for the first time, to get volume discounts on I.B.M. equipment regardless of whether they purchased the equipment directly from I.B.M. or through a retailer. I.B.M. sales personnel will be allowed to credit those sales toward their own quotas, even if the retailer made the sale. **********''Over the long run, it should bring more business to computer retailers,'' Mr. Morris said. ''It validates the role of the retailer, and it might even make us more profitable.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/business/excerpts-from-president-s-economic-report-to-congress.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1464, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC REPORT TO CONGRESS", "print_headline": "EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S ECONOMIC REPORT TO CONGRESS", "body_text": " **********Following are excerpts from President Reagan's Economic Report, sent to Congress today: **********The major economic objectives of my Administration from its beginning have been strong, sustainable, noninflationary economic growth and expanding economic opportunities for all Americans. To achieve these goals, we have pursued policies that are in the long-term best interest of the nation. **********The benefits of this approach are now clear. The economy has entered the fourth year of a robust expansion that has dramatically increased opportunities for all Americans. Millions of new jobs have been created. Investment opportunities have increased. Standards of living have risen. Moreover, this success has been accomplished without rekindling inflation. **********America's optimism concerning continued growth in economic opportunities is shared by business and individuals throughout the world. The United States has been and remains one of the few major immigrant-receiving countries, reflecting in part the economy's ability to generate economic opportunities. During the current expansion, profitable investment opportunities in the United States have also attracted foreign capital, helping to finance the rapid growth in investment. The inflow of foreign capital indicates a strong economy. As other nations continue to move toward market-oriented policies and reduce excessive government spending, taxation and structural rigidities, they too will generate increased investment opportunities, resulting in increased growth and stronger currencies as more capital flows into their economies. **********The Economic Outlook **********Many factors point to continuation of the current expansion. Economic conditions at the end of 1985 were more favorable than they were at the beginning of the year and are expected to improve further. Interest rates have continued their decline, promising to spur additional capital spending. Furthermore, the warning signals that typically precede the end of expansions have not been observed. Thus, we feel confident that the current expansion will continue through 1986. **********We expect increased growth in real G.N.P. of 4 percent in 1986, continuing throughout 1987 and 1988 and declining gradually in 1989-91 as the economy approaches its long-run real growth trend. Given the monetary and exchange rate developments during the past year, we anticipate a slight rise in inflation in 1986-87. However, if the Federal Reserve reaffirms its resolve to achieve price stability, a goal that I support without reservation, the downturn in inflation should resume in later years. The Economic Role Of Government In formulating our program for healthy and continued economic expansion, we recognized the limited role that Government properly plays. The Federal Government cannot provide prosperity or generate economic growth; it can only encourage private initiative, innovation and entrepreneurial activity that produce economic opportunities. An overly active Government actually hinders economic progress. Federal spending absorbs resources, many of which could be better used by the private sector. Excessive taxation distorts relative prices and relative rates of return. **********We will not ignore the less fortunate in this society. My Administration continues to provide an appropriate safety net to aid those individuals who need help. At the same time, we have worked to develop a strong, vibrant, opportunity-generating economy that can offer meaningful jobs to all who are able to work. The economic expansion has done much more to reduce poverty than any Government transfer program. Control Federal Spending **********In spite of our efforts, spending remains excessive and has been the primary cause of the large budget deficit. Tax rate cuts did not generate this deficit; in fact, current tax receipts are as large a share of G.N.P. as they were in the late 1970's, even after the reduction in tax rates that we initiated in 1981. The key to resolving the Federal budget deficit is to restrain unneeded spending. **********I applaud and support the newly enacted Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, known commonly as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, as a way to work with the Congress to reduce Federal spending and the deficit. I intend to submit budgets in each of the coming years that satisfy the act's deficit targets. Reform Taxes **********In May 1985, I submitted to the Congress a comprehensive reform of the tax code to make it simpler, fairer, and more conducive to economic growth. Despite substantive differences between my proposal and the House bill, I urged its passage to move the legislative process forward. We will now work with the Senate to generate a fair and simple tax code that is truly pro-family, pro-jobs, and pro-growth. Eliminate Counterproductive Regulation The regulation of domestic oil prices provides a good example of the deleterious economic effects that regulation can have as it distorts relative prices and prevents necessary adjustments. The results of my accelerating the deregulation of oil prices in January 1981 are now apparent. Oil imports have declined, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has found it impossible to sustain its previous levels of high prices. In contrast, the natural gas market is still plagued by distortions induced by price controls. We will again pursue legislation that would completely deregulate natural gas prices. In addition, we are proposing further deregulation of the trucking industry. **********We will continue efforts to reduce Government involvement in two particular sectors of the economy. First, the banking and credit system remains rife with regulations and loan guarantees that arbitrarily allocate credit and hamper the system's ability to adapt to changing economic conditions. While we must continue to protect the public against severe economic disturbances, we should allow financial institutions greater freedom in determining the composition of their assets and liabilities so that they can respond more flexibly to the changes they encounter. **********Second, heavy Government involvement also persists in many agricultural markets. Government policies, intended as solutions, have so distorted incentives that they have actually caused some of agriculture's current problems. The bill passed by the Congress in late 1985 contained some of my proposed reforms, but preserved some of the policies that now hamper agriculture. In particular, it maintained counterproductive Government intervention in the dairy industry, mandated export subsidies and continued costly distortions of the sugar market. We will continue to pursue further agricultural reform that lessens Government involvement in these areas and increases opportunities for farmers to complete successfully in world markets. Transfer Some Services To the Private Sector The Federal Government has increasingly sought to provide services that can be more efficiently provided by the private sector. To address this problem, I have established a working group to investigate which Government functions could be effectively returned to the private sector. Maintain Free and Fair Trade **********Our international trade policy rests firmly on the foundation of free and open markets. The benefits of free trade are well known: it generates more jobs, a more productive use of a nation's resources, more rapid innovation and higher standards of living both for this nation and its trading partners. While a unilateral commitment to free trade benefits the nation, Americans gain even more when U.S. trading partners also open their markets. My Administration will actively pursue this goal. An important part of our trade program is to begin a new round of multilateral trade negotiations. **********We do not blindly pursue free trade. We also strive to ensure that trade is fair by vigilantly enforcing current trade laws. Unfair trade practices abroad harm U.S. exporters as well as reduce standards of living worldwide; this is unacceptable. **********The large trade deficit that has evolved during the current expansion has subjected our free and fair trade policy to much criticism, especially from the Congress. during the past year, more than 300 pieces of protectionist legislation have been considered or proposed. While the conditions that have led to the trade deficit have adversely affected some U.S. industries, increased protectionism is not the solution. Protectionist measures will have little effect on the trade balance and will only decrease standards of living and inefficiently redistribute resources within the economy. **********Our agreement with four other major industrialized nations in September 1985 was an important recognition that economic policy changes across countries (not only in the United States) are essential to correct trade imbalances worldwide and to realign currency values. Conclusion **********My Administration recognizes the responsibility of the Federal Government to promote economic growth and individual opportunity through policies that lead to maximum employment, production and purchasing power. We intend to maintain this course with policies that continue to promote strong, sustainable, noninflationary growth and provide expanding economic opportunities for all. We shall continue to resist additional Government involvement as a solution to short-term problems. Such involvement has been unsuccessful in the past and ultimately becomes part of the problem rather than part of the solution. With the cooperation and support of the Congress and the independent agencies, we will pursue the appropriate policies necessary to sustain the current expansion and to stabilize prices."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/18/business/trafalgar-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 74, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Trafalgar Bid", "print_headline": "Trafalgar Bid", "body_text": " **********Trafalgar Holdings Ltd., a private investment company headed by Charles W.

McCormick Jr. has generally won praise for steering the nation's 14th-largest utility away from financial disaster. But many skeptics contend that a vital element of the company's turnaround may yet elude him. **********The root of the problems confronting the 41-year-old chairman and chief executive is Consumers' 18-year, $4.2 billion attempt to construct a nuclear power plant in Midland, Mich. In 1984, when Consumers abandoned the installation, then 85 percent complete, the utility was saddled with debt and losses, and the Michigan Public Service Commission forced it to cancel dividends on its common stock until 1988. **********Now Mr. McCormick's hope is that the cause of Consumers' downfall can be used to insure its comeback. His goal is to convince the Public Service Commission to approve rate increases so the company can recoup, over 15 years, $2.1 billion of the $3.7 billion in Midland investment that is still on its books. **********During a recent interview at Consumers' modest, 14-story headquarters in this city of about 40,000 people, the importance of the rate increase was acknowledged by Mr. McCormick, who has a bachelor's degree in engineering physics from Cornell and a doctorate in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He said the financial health of Consumers, which provides gas and electricity to two-thirds of Michigan's nine million people, ''still depends upon recovery of a substantial part of our investment in Midland.'' Bitter Dispute with Dow **********Another element of Mr. McCormick's strategy is ending the company's bitter legal dispute with the Dow Chemical Company. In 1983, as the cost of the nuclear plant project mounted uncontrollably, Dow canceled a contract to take steam and electricity from the plant. Dow's corporate headquarters is just across the Tittabawassee River from the site of the Midland project, where about a half-dozen buildings have the hardscrabble look of a ghost mining camp. **********In September, in a giant step toward restoring good will between the two companies, Mr. McCormick struck an agreement in principle for Dow to convert the sprawling Midland facility into a gas-fired co-generation project. **********''McCormick was new to Consumers; I was new to this post,'' said F.R. (Pete) Lehman, a Dow vice president, who as head of the company's Michigan unit negotiated the co-generation agreement for Dow. Mr. Lehman was named to his past last January. ''Neither of us was encumbered by the baggage of the past dispute. We looked at it as a business deal, and went from there.'' **********Mr. McCormick, on the other hand, takes a larger view of the agreement. He maintains that the proposed conversion of the plant would provide a viable, necessary solution to Consumers' financial needs, and to Dow's and Michigan's energy requirements as well. Growth in Demand Seen **********Referring to a study of Consumers' options for the Midland site that he had commissioned upon taking office, he said that that report and several others had shown not only an unmistakable growth of demand in the company's service area, but also the likelihood that demand would continue to grow by nearly 2 percent a year into the 1990's. The company, which cites rising employment in the state, says it will not be affected by General Motors' decision to close several plants. **********He contends that Consumers needs the co-generation facility just to keep pace with demand and to build its reserve margin - the standby capacity available to respond to peak demand in certain periods - back to prudent levels. **********The joint venture, as now conceived, would use about $1 billion of equipment from the nearly finished nuclear project and spend an additional $560 million converting part of the sprawling site to a 1,300-megawatt plant to begin operations in 1989. Consumers would own 49 percent of the plant, the maximum stake allowed by Federal regulations, and the rest would be owned by Dow and other investors who have not been selected. Better Public Relations **********Experts on the Consumers Power situation agree that Mr. McCormick's low-key sincerity and flawless public relations instincts have, at least for the moment, given Consumers a fighting chance to regain its financial balance. **********In the months since Consumers Power marked its centennial last fall, he has virtually eliminated the once-widespread hostility, of government officials and Michigan residents, toward the company. And he has helped to lift employees' morale, which had been at rock-bottom. With 10,500 employees, it is one of the state's largest employers. **********''The fact that Consumers' proposals are now getting a serious hearing within Michigan is an accomplishment in itself, given its recent past,'' said Ernest S. Liu, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who added that Mr. McCormick had ''been a ball of fire since taking over.'' Company Has Made Strides **********Since losing $390 million last year, Consumers has made financial strides, earning $8.8 million, or 10 cents a share, in the third quarter this year. By year's end it will have reduced or replaced more than $450 million of its high-cost debt, and Mr. McCormick said it intends to increase that figure another $400 million by next July. With total debt of $3.4 billion, Consumers' debt-equity ratio is 54 percent. In addition, the company's stock, which fell below $5 a share in late 1984, now trades in the $15 range, and its bond ratings have been raised. **********A small victory for Consumers came in late October, when the Michigan Public Service Commission ruled that the utility could spend $50 million of its own or borrowed funds on the co-generation project. The move clarified an order the agency issued last year in granting Consumers rate relief of $91 million over six years. **********But utility industry analysts, Michigan state officials and spokesmen for utility watchdog groups question whether Mr. McCormick's maneuvers will be enough to gain a favorable ruling on its more crucial request for a rate increase. **********Indeed, his gains in the last year were helped by one stroke of fortune: The heads of both the state regulatory commission and the Michigan division of Dow were replaced, helping to eliminate the seemingly personal animus that had made Consumers Power's relations with each notably difficult. **********Critics such as Joseph S. Tuchinsky, executive director of the Michigan Citizens' Lobby, point out that key elements of the Consumers-Dow deal - such as the rate that the utility's customers would pay under the co-generation proposal - have yet to be made public. **********Even Mr. McCormick acknowledges that the deal has not been fully fleshed out, although he asserts that the proposed rates would be below the maximums recommended in Federal and state utility guidelines. The commission, which began hearings on the matter in September, is not likely to issue a ruling for at least a year. **********''Rate payers should not bear the burden for the company's mistakes at Midland,'' asserted Frank Kelly, Michigan's longtime Attorney General, who is a persistent critic of Consumers Power. Awaiting 'Missing Pieces' of Plan **********And Roderick Coy, general counsel to the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, whose members include Consumers' most influential industrial users, said the ''missing pieces'' of Consumers' proposals made it impossible to render a definitive judgment on them. ''We're awaiting hard information on just what is being proposed in the joint venture and the rate-relief request,'' he said. **********The decision by the coalition to oppose the completion of the Midland nuclear project was a key factor in the utility's decision to abandon construction. **********In fact, some members of the broad coalition that fought Consumers on the Midland nuclear facility believe that the lack of details on these proposals is a deliberate effort to create a reservoir of ''good will'' for the company without having to debate the proposal's full economic ramifications. **********Consumers Power's problems remain immense, but Mr. McCormick said it was those very challenges that convinced him to join the company. The utility lured him from American Natural Resources, the Detroit-based pipeline concern where he was president for seven years after working for the Defense Department, the White House, the Department of Energy and the American Gas Association. **********''I knew of its problems,'' he said of Consumers Power, ''and I knew that it needed to get straightened out because it's a very important influence on the state's economy.'' Speaking in his typical understated fashion, he added, ''I thought it would be an exciting opportunity and a challenge to try to get it back on track.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/26/world/shultz-meets-with-shevardnadze-on-daniloff-a-3d-time-this-week.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1986-09-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 981, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHULTZ MEETS WITH SHEVARDNADZE ON DANILOFF A 3D TIME THIS WEEK", "print_headline": "SHULTZ MEETS WITH SHEVARDNADZE ON DANILOFF A 3D TIME THIS WEEK", "body_text": " **********Secretary of State George P.

Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze drove off without speaking with reporters. Mr. Shultz also waved off questions as he left the building. **********Shortly before the meeting, Mr. Shultz said he hoped an agreement could be achieved before Mr. Shevardnadze left Tuesday for Canada. **********Package Deal Being Sought **********It was their third known meeting here this week as they try to shape a deal that would resolve the cases of Nicholas S.

He said: ''Obviously, it is desirable to settle it as soon as possible if it can be settled on the right basis. But it may not be possible.'' **********Mr. Shultz said that he and Mr. Shevardnadze had developed ''a good personal capacity for talking to each other'' and that he believed the Foreign Minister, who is a member of the Soviet Union's ruling Politburo, was trying to reach an accord. **********''That does not mean we are going to succeed,'' Mr. Shultz added. **********At an earlier news conference, at the United Nations, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the two sides were discussing ''several options, all of them good.'' **********''It is up to the American side, and to the Soviet side, too, to decide which is best for the benefit of both sides,'' Mr. Gerasimov said, adding that the charges against Mr. Daniloff and against Mr. Zakharov represented two ''bumps'' on the road to the summit. **********He said a third ''bump'' was the American order that designated 25 members of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations to leave by Wednesday. **********He said the Soviet Union had refused to accept the expulsion order in principle and had asked the United States to reconsider. Otherwise, Mr. Gerasimov said, there would be a fourth ''bump'' - a Soviet retaliation for the expulsion of the 25 members of the Soviet Mission. **********''We have this road to the summit,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. ''It must be smooth. We must remove the bumps, maybe one by one.'' **********Mr. Shultz said the United States would not back down. He repeated that if the Soviet Mission fell below the limit of 218 set by the United States, the mission could fill the vacancies. The Russians say the total is now 205. The Possible Terms **********The two sides are reportedly considering a deal under which Mr. Daniloff would be allowed to return to the United States, after which Mr. Zakharov would be permitted to return to the Soviet Union and a number of Soviet dissidents would emigrate. **********The issue of an informal deadline arose because Mr. Shevardnadze is to leave Tuesday for Ottawa. Mr. Shultz is to return to Washington Friday and come back to New York Sunday. **********''Well, Mr. Shultz is leaving for Washington, and Mr. Shevardnadze is leaving for Ottawa on Sept. 30,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. ''There is a kind of deadline.'' **********He said that if a formula could not be achieved by Tuesday, ''both sides will be the worse for that.'' **********''We don't want it to miss,'' he said. ''We have several ideas. They are being discussed.'' **********There are many complex aspects to the projected package deal, officials said. These include the question of whether Mr. Zakharov would have to stand trial, as insisted on earlier by the United States, or whether both he and Mr. Daniloff would be allowed to leave without going to court. **********Under American law, President Reagan could ask the court to dismiss the charges against Mr. Zakharov on the ground of national security. **********There is also the question of the time interval between the return of Mr. Daniloff and that of Mr. Zakharov. The United States, insisting that Mr. Daniloff is a ''hostage'' and Mr. Zakharov ''an accused spy,'' has said that it will not accept equivalency. **********Another issue is the identity and number of Soviet dissidents to be permitted to emigrate. The United States has given the Soviet Union a list of priority cases. **********Mr. Gerasimov ridiculed a report in the West German newspaper Bild that Mr. Daniloff would leave the Soviet Union as part of an East-West exchange on the Glienicke Bridge on the border of the American sector of West Berlin and East Germany. **********''I don't know why they must use a bridge,'' Mr. Gerasimov said. ''If the solution is found, Daniloff can take the first flight home from Moscow.'' **********On the expulsion order, Mr. Gerasimov said the Soviet Union was already well below the limit of 218 permitted by the United States. He said that of the 25 on the American list, 6 or 7 had already left on their own. **********He said that what was at stake was the principle of whether the United States could order any Soviet Mission staff members to leave."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/17/world/the-white-house-crisis-pros-and-cons-of-immunity-text-of-reagan-statement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 354, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Text", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "TEXT OF REAGAN STATEMENT", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS: PROS AND CONS OF IMMUNITY; TEXT OF REAGAN STATEMENT", "body_text": " **********Following is the text of President Reagan's statement today urging the Senate Intelligence Committee to seek limited immunity for Vice Adm.

I. Sopher & Company in April or May. The rents for studios are expected to be about $850 to $900 a month. The address will be 250 West 19th Street. **********The builder is the Marose Construction Company, headed by Ben Caiola, 55 years old, who began as a construction laborer in the Bronx when he arrived from Italy at the age of 16. He built apartments as a general contractor in the 1970's and now is building for his own account. **********In Chelsea he bought an old garage building on a shallow site with a long midblock frontage - 265 feet. With his architect, Stephen B. Jacobs & Associates, he planned a building under the city's ''housing quality'' ordinance. When it was rejected in the city's land-use review process, he designed a different building, one that conforms with R-8 zoning and requires no special permit. The contrast between the two shows how complex zoning rules work. **********Under the optional housing-quality ordinance, a builder can get as much as a 20 percent bonus in floor area for a building that meets fairly specific quality standards. Such a building would have greater-than-average light in the hallways and apartments of greater-than-average size. **********During the review process, however, Community Board 4 rejected the housing-quality proposal. Mary Brendle, who was board chairman at the time, said the board had supported the position of residents on the block. The housing-quality building would have extended all the way to the lot line, which residents opposed, she said. They also considered the tenant amenities excessive, she said. Mr. Caiolo, however, said he thought the block residents ''didn't want any building at all.'' **********The actual building, being constructed under ''as-of-right'' R-8 rules, is set back 15 feet from the lot line on 19th Street. There is a 55-foot side yard, to be used as the entrance to a 40-car garage, though it is more than is needed for that purpose, Mr. Caiola said. **********The City Planning Commission, backing the Planning Department staff, approved the housing-quality plan. But the Board of Estimate overruled the commission and rejected it. **********The housing-quality building would have been 11 stories tall on the west, dropping to 10 stories on the east. From the eighth story up, it would have stepped back slightly, forming terraces for high apartments. **********Inside, there would have been extra square-footage for recreational space for tenants, including a noncommercial club, a fitness center and a gym. Outside, two types of brick would have been used in the facade. **********There would have been 174 apartments - 22 two-bedrooms, 143 one-bedrooms and 9 studios. **********The actual building is to be 16 stories tall. To meet the R-8 setback and side-yard requirements, it must rise on a smaller base. Since it does not have to meet minimum square-footage requirements per apartment, the mix in the 200 apartments is quite different: 182 L-shaped studios, with 650 square feet of space, and the rest one-bedrooms or two-bedrooms. **********''It would have been more urbanistic as a housing-quality building,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''Now it's taller, and there is less lot coverage.'' **********Under housing quality - as well as under proposed new zoning regulations that would make many of the housing-quality principles optionally as-of-right in R-6 to R-8 zones - there is more flexibility for shaping a building to its plot. With larger floor sizes in lower buildings, greater architectural variety is hoped for. **********The building will have a 40-car underground garage. This, too, is as-of-right. Under housing quality, the garage would have had 65 or 70 spaces. **********Mr. Caiola said he would not apply for tax abatement under the Section 421a tax abatement program, for which the building would be eligible. Tax abatement would bring 10 years of rent regulation, but as a taxpaying project the rents will be unregulated. That is also the case at other recent Marose rentals, including the ones at 451 East 83d Street, with 81 apartments, built last year, and 205 East 27th Street, with 68 apartments. **********''Sometimes the legal rent is much higher than the market rent, but you can't get it,'' Mr. Caiola said. He said he has apartments rented at $1,150 or $1,200 a month that legally could rent for $1,500 a month. But he said he avoids tax abatement because there is no assurance that stabilization, once in effect, will end. **********One reason for planning so many studio apartments, the builder said, is that rents can be lower and therefore more easily obtained. He told of a rental building he recently finished in which only half the apartments have rented after a year. That building is a mix of two-bedroom apartments renting for $2,500 a month and two-story three-bedrooms with terraces renting for $4,500."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/world/around-the-world-liberal-leader-wins-party-vote-in-canada.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-12-01", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Liberal Leader Wins Party Vote in Canada", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Liberal Leader Wins Party Vote in Canada", "body_text": " **********John Turner won a resounding endorsement today for his continued leadership of the Liberal Party at a national convention. **********Delegates to the convention voted to keep Mr. Turner by a margin of 2,001 to 622. **********Gathering 76.3 percent of the vote, Mr. Turner considerably surpassed the total various foes had said would be necessary for him to continue. **********Mr. Turner's victory represents a major comeback from his September 1984 defeat by the Progressive Conservative Party, led by Brian Mulroney. **********''Now I know that I have your confidence,'' Mr. Turner told the convention.

Those measures included price rises and tax increases aimed to reduce excessive demand and slow economic growth. **********Mr. Funaro's offer to step down also coincided with increasing concern that a drop in Brazil's trade surplus and foreign exchange reserve might seriously complicate the country's negotiations to restructure most of its $105 billion foreign debt.  [ Thousands protesting Brazil's new economic measures marched through the capital Thursday as riot police and army troops battled the demonstrators, the Associated Press reported. ]  The worsening of Brazil's economic picture was brought on largely by a boom in consumer spending that the Government moved to tame only after Congressional elections on Nov. 15. Leaders of the governing Brazilian Democratic Movement Party are pressing the Sarney Administration to adopt a tougher stance in dealing with the country's governmental and commercial creditors. **********''The point is that the country cannot continue paying at current levels,'' said Pimenta da Vega, the majority leader in the Chamber of Deputies. Ulysses Guimaraes, the President of the Chamber, said the domestic economy could not be put in order until the debt problem was resolved. Bargaining Position Weakens **********Until now, Brazil has taken the position that it could demand good terms in the debt talks, while excluding the International Monetary Fund from an important role. A large trade surplus and healthy foreign reserves permitted it to forgo a request for ''new money'' from commercial banks. Officials have also argued that last Friday's measures should boost exports and reserves. **********Nonetheless, Brazil's bargaining position may have been undermined by recent developments. In October, for example, the trade surplus was $210 million, after averaging more than $1 billion a month between January and August.

The bankers also noted that Brazil's commercial debt would not be restructured until a broad agreement was worked out with the creditor governments. Payments Might Be Suspended **********Mr. Funaro is the architect of the country's strategy of excluding the I.M.F. from involvement in domestic policy-making, and financial experts said Mr. Sarney's decision to retain him suggested that Brazil was unlikely to soften its position in next month's debt negotiations. **********Mr. Funaro told reporters Wednesday night: ''The country must be united for the foreign debt negotiations.'' In answer to a question about a possible suspension of some debt payments, he was quoted as saying: ''A moratorium is always a hard, a difficult, path, but someday it may be necessary.'' **********Meanwhile, Brazilian newspapers gave prominence to remarks attributed to the American economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who met Wednesday in Brasilia with President Sarney. According to the reports, Mr. Galbraith said he did not expect commercial banks to take reprisals if Brazil suspended some debt payments for a few months.

Somehow its reputation for worldliness survives, but in fact it has become elegant and shabby at the same time, so that many of those who identify with the Champs-Elysees of the good old days say they are fighting a rear-guard battle to keep it from falling into cheapness and dilapidation. **********Many here, reluctant to see the street as anything but the center of the world, preface their remarks about the Champs-Elysees with the phrase ''It's true,'' as though conceding a point in an argument. **********''It's true, and it's sad to say, that the Champs-Elysees has become a kind of factory for food,'' Jenny-Paule de Rabaudy, the manager of Fouquet's, said in her office recently. **********''It's true that very little remains of the old Champs-Elysees,'' she went on, naming, among the few institutions reminiscent of the old elegance, Fouquet's itself, Guerlin, the perfumery across the street, and a shoe shop with a wood exterior called Weston. **********''It's true that the Champs, like other areas of Paris, has lost a lot of its character,'' said Jean-Pierre Silvere, the manager of the Drugstore Publicis, at the head of the street. Interchangeable Parts **********Mr. Silvere's shop is itself a reflection of the Champs-Elysees of modern times; it is a restaurant attached to a store of highly polished nooks and crannies where leisure time equipment, books, newspapers, magazines, gifts, electronics, records, tapes and so forth are sold. The space used to be the lobby of the Astoria, one of Paris's grandest hotels, destroyed in a fire in 1972. **********''The Champs is less different from the rest of Paris than it used to be,'' Mr. Silvere went on. ''The city is becoming like interchangeable parts; there is less variety. Maybe it's because people are all asking for the same things; maybe it's because we live in a society where everybody is looking for standardization.'' **********The best view of the avenue is from the east where it begins a gentle ascent toward the Arc de Triomphe, which is its glory. Chestnut trees and sycamores line the slope like a pale green Venetian blind screening the commercial colors of the street - the the banks, the nightclubs, the sprawling outdoor cafes, the automobile showrooms, the posters, the billboards, the movie marquees, the shop windows, the game parlors, the signs identifying places with names like Quick Elysees, Monsieur Elysees, Pop-Inn, Hippo-Citroen, Free Time. **********In many of these establishments, a lot of the talk is about two related subjects: the threat of terrorism and the relative absence this year of American tourists. **********Early this year, terrorist bombing attacks occurred at the Claridge arcade and at another arcade called the Point Show, killing two people and wounding 36. There have been no bombings since March, possibly because the two dead are presumed by the police to have been the ones who planted the bombs. But there are more policemen and a mood of caution. The Record Stays Unbroken **********''It's a worry and we pay a lot of attention,'' Mr. Silvere said. ''Security is not a matter of a guard at each door. It's more an internal system. Each person who works in the shop has to be vigilant.'' **********Diagonally across the street from the Drugstore is a Peugeot dealer; then a Volvo dealer; then a Mercedes-Benz showroom. Near that is the Lido, the famed supper club, where the show requires the most elaborate stage machinery of any theater in Paris except for the Opera. **********''We were hoping to break all the records this year,'' Christian Clerico, the Lido's manager, said, ''but with all the troubles, we won't. **********''Still,'' he went on, ''it's not a disaster. What is obvious is that the Americans in groups are not coming. By themselves, however, they come. And maybe if they pass the word that nothing dangerous is happening in Paris, more will come later in the summer.'' **********There are some - whether nostalgic or not - who remember the old days. The Lido was once a swimming pool, with columns and an arched bridge over it. The street was lined with the homes of the rich. Later, it was a family entertainment area, where parents would take their children to one of the large movie houses and then to a restaurant for a late dinner. **********Nowadays, the avenue is a commercial and shopping district by day. The movies are most active at night, but then the seediness overwhelms the elegance, making the changes on the street more conspicuous and less welcome. The Railway Link **********Some of the character of the street is widely attributed to a supposed improvement of some 10 years ago, the construction of a subway station attached to Paris's super-efficient regional railway line, known locally as the R.E.R. **********''All the changes on the Champs-Elysees were facilitated by the R.E.R., which connects it directly with the most doubtful suburbs of the city,'' said Francois Lebel, the Mayor of the Eighth Arrondissement, where the street is situated. **********''Imagine,'' Mr. Lebel said, ''if you're young, perhaps unemployed, and living outside of Paris, you can get to the heart of the Champs-Elysees in 15 minutes and then you can be among lots of other people like you. The merchants naturally adapted themselves to the new clientele, so you had this explosion of fast food places, of entertainments, the movies.'' **********''There are 11 fast-food places on the street,'' Mr. Lebel went on, ''and despite the efforts of the city of Paris to keep it clean, the place is kind of dirty.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/world/101-members-of-nonaligned-movement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 243, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "List", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "101 MEMBERS OF NONALIGNED MOVEMENT", "print_headline": "101 MEMBERS OF NONALIGNED MOVEMENT", "body_text": " **********Following is a list of the 101 members of the Nonaligned Movement who are attending the conference here:  Afghanistan  Algeria  Angola  Argentina  Bahamas  Bahrain  Bangladesh  Barbados  Belize  Benin  Bhutan  Bolivia  Botswana  Burkina Faso  Burundi  Cape Verde  Central African Republic  Chad  Colombia  Cameroon  Comoros  Congo  Cuba  Cyprus  Djibouti  Ecuador  Egypt  Equatorial Guinea  Ethiopia  Gabon  Gambia  Ghana  Grenada  Guinea  Guinea-Bissau  Guyana  India  Indonesia  Iran  Iraq  Ivory Coast  Jamaica  Jordan  Cambodia  Kenya  North Korea  Kuwait  Laos  Lesotho  Liberia  Lebanon  Libya  Madagascar  Malawi  Malaysia  Maldives  Mali  Malta  Mauritania  Mauritius  Morocco  Mozambique  Nepal  Nicaragua  Niger  Nigeria  Oman  Pakistan  Panama  P.L.O.

Only one-half of 1 percent of all the state's civil employees would exceed the new limits, according to New York City and state officials, but a single violation would jeopardize an entire pension fund. **********''The provision was really aimed at dealing with abuses in the private sector, where you have companies sheltering income by paying huge pensions,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York. ''But when you draw a broad statute like this, it could have a calamitous effect on hard-working people.'' **********The House tax revision bill has a similar provision, but it sets a $65,000 benefit limit for people retiring at 55. The House bill also lowers the maximum for those retiring at 65 to $77,000, while the Senate version maintains the current $90,000 limit. **********Officials of New York State and New York City and representatives of organizations representing state and local governments are asking members of the House-Senate tax conference to exempt state and local pensions from the provision. **********Barring that, said Cathie Eitelberg, chief lobbyist for the Government Finance Officers Association, ''we think existing public employee plans should be grandfathered and the states should be given two years to design plans for new employees that would stick to the limits.'' **********The implications of the provision, which would change the defined pension payment caps in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, were overlooked initially, said Judy L. Chesser, Mayor Koch's representative in Washington, because officials were preoccupied by the struggle to retain the deductibility of state and local taxes and sales taxes. **********Mr. D'Amato said he was made aware of the problem by New York State's Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, who is the sole trustee of the $31 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund, which has about 600,000 beneficiaries. **********The Senator said he had been in touch with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representative Charles B. Rangel, both New York Democrats who are on the tax conference committee, and was ''optimistic that we will be successful in protecting our public employees.'' **********Mr. Moynihan said that revising the provision would be ''a real problem,'' since the committee ''is not in the exempting business.'' He added that he intended to ''press the issue,'' and would ''be hugely disappointed if it doesn't get worked out.'' **********Both the Senate and the House proposals make exceptions for police and firefighters - who, because of the dangerous nature of their jobs, tend to retire earlier - and set higher limits for them. But they may be jeopardized, officials said, because the bills require that all personnel in a department be in the same retirement fund and, in most cases, uniformed officers are in a plan separate from other department employees. **********The other states that would be affected by the measure are California, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and Vermont."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/20/business/washington-watch-conrail-fight-in-senate.html": {"writer_name": "Clyde Farnsworth", "pub_date": "1986-01-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 214, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Washington Watch; Conrail Fight in Senate", "print_headline": "Washington Watch; Conrail Fight in Senate", "body_text": " **********When the Senate returns to work this week, its first item of business will be the Administration's proposal to sell the Government's 85 percent interest in the Consolidated Rail Corporation to the Norfolk Southern Corporation for $1.2 billion. **********Scattered but persistent protests from a handful of Republican and Democratic lawmakers have delayed consideration of the sale legislation since last June and will make tough sledding for the bill once it hits the floor, Congressional aides said. **********What may be fatal is that, while the opponents are committed, there are few ardent supporters of the sale to Norfolk. **********Both Arlen Specter and John Heinz, Republican Senators from Pennsylvania, where Conrail is based, oppose Norfolk Southern and have advocated selling Conrail as an independent company, as does Conrail management.

They have come to hear his latest pronouncements. **********The man mumbles and the reporters thrust their tape recorders close to his face or lean down, straining to hear him. **********What he says is reported in detail, often on the front pages of Mexico City's many daily newspapers. Government officials, businessmen, diplomats and politicians read his words carefully, dissecting them for hidden meanings or special messages. **********The man's name is Fidel Velazquez, or just Don Fidel, and he is Mexico's most prominent labor leader. **********A dairy worker early in life, Mr. Velazquez has for 50 years been a force in Mexican labor and for the past 40 years the general secretary and absolute ruler of the Mexican Confederation of Workers, or C.T.M, the country's largest and most powerful labor union group. Dominant Labor Leader **********The confederation, which has about five million members. represents Mexico's obreros, those at the bottom of organized labor's ladder. They are the men and women who toil for the minimum wage, which is now about $4 a day. **********Although he does not directly control Mexico's many other labor confederations, by dint of personality, political influence and decades of power-brokering Mr. Velazquez is a dominant labor leader outside his own group. **********His thoughts and opinions have been important in Mexico for decades, but his voice has a particularly potent lure at the moment because of Mexico's worsening economic situation. **********Inflation, which Government planners consider Mexico's No. 1 economic problem, has been running above 60 percent a year, but Mr. Velazquez has agreed to increases in the minimum wage well below that. He settled for a modest 32 percent increase in January. **********Continued restraint by the C.T.M. is seen as a critical weapon against inflation. Some Lurking Questions **********Government officials and businessmen pay close attention to Mr. Velazquez's pronouncements about how much the minimum wage should be raised. They watch for signs that his avowed belief that the Mexican worker has to make economic sacrifices, too, if the country is to weather its economic crisis might be crumbling. **********Behind the immediate question about the minimum wage is a much larger consideration: How much more of Mexico's worsening economic situation can the lowest levels of the Mexican work force endure? Should some form of unrest develop among the workers, to what extent would the C.T.M. and Mr. Velazquez be able to hold the rank and file in line? **********Asked that in an interview, Mr. Velazquez said: **********''Mexico is a country that has peace in the labor movements. There are no great strikes or general strikes. We have laws and priorities that are factors of equilibrium between the bosses and the workers. There is a preference to negotiations over a strike.'' **********Diplomats and academics who follow Mexico's labor movement and Mr. Velazquez's role agree with his assessment. **********''Fidel Velazquez and the C.T.M. have the power to create a desperate situation for the country with a general strike of their workers,'' said Rafael Segovia, a professor at Colegio de Mexico. ''But I don't see it happening.'' A Section of the Ruling Party **********The major reason is the relation between Mr. Velazquez and the Mexican Government. **********The C.T.M. is a part of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I., which has ruled Mexico for nearly 60 years. Mr. Velazquez holds no post in the Government, but as the head of the C.T.M. he is a powerful force behind the scenes. **********At any one time, two and sometimes three of his lieutenants serve as governors of various Mexican states. Four or five dozen of his associates are members of Mexico's Congress and hundreds more of the labor confederation's lesser lights sit as city and town mayors or members of state legislatures or hold other elective posts. **********Mr. Velazquez is listened to carefully by the Government, from the President down. **********''We are the most numerous, the most representative organization, and we have the most influence in national politics,'' Mr. Velazquez said. Labor Peace Is the Payoff **********The relationship between Mr. Velazquez and the Mexican political system is regarded by diplomats and academics as a good example of the manner in which the Government and the ruling P.R.I. have been able to insure stability. In this case, a major sector of organized labor has been brought under the umbrella of the Government and the party as a means of assuring labor peace. **********''In return for the political power that the C.T.M. has and which Don Fidel can wield, the payoff is that the C.T.M. keeps the workers under control and in the workplace,'' a diplomat said. **********It is widely believed, for example, that in return for agreeing to a 32 percent minimum wage increase in January, the C.T.M. was promised that its people would be the P.R.I.'s candidates for governor in at least one and perhaps more of the state elections this year. At the moment, the governors of Nayarit and Campeche are C.T.M. officials. Succession Is an Issue **********Over the years, the C.T.M. and Mr. Velasquez have used their political power to alter the shape of Mexican social landscape. **********The C.T.M. gets much of the credit for creating the Mexican social security system, which provides a range of services to the worker. The C.T.M. is also a major force in the creation of affordable housing for the country's lowest-paid workers. **********Mr. Velazquez will be 86 in April. The state of his health is remarked upon in Mexican Government and business circles almost as much as his Monday news conference pronouncements. **********''If Don Fidel were to die . . .'' exclaimed a senior Government official, rolling his eyes and making a gesture to indicate the labor chaos that would follow. Peaceful Transition Seen **********It is commonly assumed that a bitter struggle for supremacy within the C.T.M. would ensue, leading to the risk of serious labor trouble. But those who closely follow C.T.M. affairs say they now believe that Mr. Velazquez has taken steps to clarify the lines of succession. **********Three substitute general secretaries have been named. One, Emilio M. Gonzales, the Governor of Nayarit, is now regarded as the clear successor. AT C.T.M.'s 50th anniversary national congress recently, Mr. Gonzales sat always at Don Fidel's right hand. **********''The events at the congress made it clear who the successor will be,'' a labor expert here said. ''I think there will be a peaceful transition.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/01/business/mining-chinatown-s-mountain-of-gold.html": {"writer_name": "N.

Fewer than 10,000 people, most of them down at the heels, lived in the area, making do in some of the city's most dilapidated housing. What future, what fortune could possibly lie there? **********Unlike many other Chinese immigrants, he could pick his opportunities. The son of a Hong Kong judge, Mr. Chu had graduated from college and gravitated to real estate. Though he possessed only a fumbling command of English, he suspected brighter horizons lay in America. But finding Chinatown so desolate, he retreated to Hong Kong. Not until 1955, his purpose rekindled, did he return. **********Replaying those days on a recent afternoon, the smartly dressed, jockey-sized Mr. Chu sipped tea and laughed. He shook his head. He laughed some more. ''Yes,'' he said. ''At first, I come here and there is nothing. A big zero.'' **********Who can better laugh now than Joseph Chu. For many years he has been Chinatown's biggest landlord and one of its most prosperous citizens. Once his buildings loomed everywhere, but he has moderated his activities in recent years. ''I'm 66 now,'' he said. ''It's awful. Too old.'' These days, Mr. Chu lives in the posh Galleria in midtown Manhattan. He likes to bicycle in Central Park. A keen interest is grooming his 38-year-old son, Alexander, to take command of his empire. Mr. Chu still has eight Chinatown buildings and enough money to live out any fantasies. **********''I make out O.K.,'' he said. ''I say that I'm very comfortable. Very comfortable.'' **********Since the 1960's, New York's Chinatown has been a sweet land of plenty for scores of footloose and ambitious immigrants like Joseph Chu. Yet the squalid streets and ramshackle tenements make Chinatown seem like a ghetto. In some ways, it is. Women toil in sweatshops, sewing garments for meager wages. Waiters shuttle plates for 15 hours a day. But that is a partial picture. Peter Ng, the head of the Queu-dun Corporation, one of Chinatown's biggest realtors, supposes that there are at least 50 millionaires among a population of 100,000. It is no wonder that when the Chinese talk of America, they call it Gum Shan, the Mountain of Gold. **********It was 145 years ago that Chinese people began filtering into the twisting streets of lower Manhattan. First there was a tea merchant, Quimpo Appo, who made Doyer Street his home. After that, a man named Wo Kee opened a general store at 8 Mott Street. Slowly, more Chinese came, and more. When the Government loosened immigration quotas in 1965, tens of thousands poured into the quarter-mile square below Canal Street, and it jelled into a miniature world of teeming sidewalk markets and tightly bunched restaurants. **********Over the last 10 years, in particular, many millions of dollars have poured into what has become the nation's largest Chinatown. The British lease on Hong Kong expires in 1997, and hordes of jittery Chinese want to get their assets out of the colony. Chinese from many other parts of Asia also keep pressing in, and Chinatown's borders have spilled across Canal Street into Little Italy and along East Broadway to claim portions of the Lower East Side. **********The core businesses of Chinatown are its 450-odd garment factories and the more than 300 restaurants. For the last decade, however, real estate has been the most dazzling lure. Prices seem to climb hourly, and are rarely justified by the low rents that the buildings throw off. Yet speculators turn them over for still steeper sums. Virtually no building can be had there for less than $1 million. **********''Speculation has been undercutting some of the dynamism of Chinatown,'' said Peter Kwong, a professor of politics at the State University Center at Old Westbury, who has studied the community for years. ''Because of high real estate prices and high rents, factories are having trouble maintaining themselves. Restaurants have to get bigger to survive. So you have a very unstable economy.'' **********In a sense, the golden period that started in the 1960's is drawing to a close. No longer is anyone likely to come to Chinatown penniless, start a garment factory and retire a millionaire. Even real estate investment is being viewed as too dicey by some long-time players, prodding them to place their bets elsewhere. **********Still, opportunities persist in the traditional ethnic community for those willing to try something different. Any number of real estate investors are angling to convert run-down space into something grander - a hotel, a shopping mall. Gourmet bakeries and specialty restaurants are winning a prosperous clientele. **********The Chinese are secretive. They prefer not to discuss how much they have. Some operate through front companies, so no one will know that their dollars are involved. Nonetheless, over the years, it has become apparent who some of the money people are, and the differing paths they took to their personal mountains of gold. Snagging Real Estate Joseph Chu's name scarcely ever turns up in print. Ask to photograph him, and he begs off. And though he could afford many of them, he chooses not to keep his own office. But he is one of the high citzens of Chinatown. The other day at Eastbank, a community bank where his son Alexander is chief executive, Mr. Chu sat still for a bit and gave a rare glimpse of a life spent making money. **********After his initial trip here and swift retreat, Mr. Chu returned to work as a personnel clerk at the United Nations. At the same time, he represented a group of Hong Kong friends who wanted to invest in real estate. **********Mr. Chu soon fell in with Irving Raber, one of the few brokers familiar with the community. Mr. Raber, an exception to the prevailing rule that only the Chinese operate in Chinatown, had drifted into Chinatown real estate in 1933 and is still the biggest manager of property there. He took some plunges with the young Mr. Chu in his maiden ventures, and to this day manages all of Mr. Chu's buildings. ''The Chinese are great buyers,'' Mr. Raber says. ''They'd rather have bricks than dollars.'' **********Working with Mr. Raber, Mr. Chu first looked to Brooklyn, where he bought the mammoth St. George Hotel and tried to convert it to apartments. He failed and wound up losing money. Soured, he trained his sights back on Chinatown, where he quickly developed a winner's aura. **********With Mr. Raber's help, he snagged five buildings clustered around Chatham Square in the early 1970's for about $500,000; they were sold a year or two later for a handsome profit. ''We bought all the good corners, like Mott and Canal,'' Mr. Chu said. ''We bought and sold, bought and sold.'' As his riches grew, Mr. Chu increasingly bought buildings on his own. **********Now, even though brokers report that building prices keep escalating, Mr. Chu has become inactive in Chinatown speculation. ''The price is too high,'' he said. ''How can you buy for $1 million and no return?'' Noting that many of the buyers are from Hong Kong, he added, ''They want to get their money out. So they don't care if there's no return.'' **********Mr. Chu has stepped into Flushing, Queens, where the numbers make more sense. Two years ago, he was part of a group that acquired an empty Korvettes store on Kissena Boulevard and transformed it into Flushing Plaza, a complex that combines apartments and offices. **********Mr. Chu is still keen to fulfill a long-time vision for Chinatown. He owns land off the Bowery that houses the Canal Arcade, a sprawl of 33 stores. One of his adjacent tenants is the Silver Palace, Chinatown's largest restaurant. Mr. Chu wants to build a 400-room, $40 million hotel on the site. Standing in his way are the lengthy leases his tenants hold. **********He says he has interested a number of investors and has had talks with Holiday Inn as a possible operator. But he has not yet freed the land. ''I am waiting,'' he said. ''I am trying.'' **********The heir apparent to the Chu empire, Alexander Chu, is a reed of a man who studied urban design at Harvard and got a law degree at Fordham. He practiced law for six years before forming Eastbank. **********Banking is considered glamorous by the Chinese, and new lending institutions keep springing up, despite the failure of the Golden Pacific National Bank last summer. Roughly 20 banks now handle the money of Chinatown. **********The younger Chu is also nurturing real estate deals of his own. He recently bought raw acreage in Hunterdon County, N.J., on which he hopes to build homes. Chinatown prices exasperate him, too. **********He compares it to maintaining a wine cellar. ''When you drink a bottle, you want to buy another one to put in its place,'' he said. ''In Chinatown, you drink the bottle and you can't replace it. Because you can't afford it.'' Selling Dim Sum Ming Chan cut hair. He was a barber. **********In 1962, when he was in his early 20's, he came here from Canton, where his father, aunt and grandfather were opera performers. Mr. Chan, as a youngster, sang in the opera, too; he carries pictures of himself on stage, looking very strange in fanciful costumes and headgear. **********When he arrived here, his eye settled on the restaurant business. Mr. Chan wanted to introduce the Cantonese specialty known as dim sum -steamed and stuffed buns, fried dumplings, chicken wrapped in lotus leaves and other finger foods, all shuttled on heated trolleys so diners can pick what whets their appetite. **********But interest was slight; the major wave of immigrants had not yet hit. What's more, to really score in the restaurant business in Chinatown, you have to please the American palate - and that would take time. So Mr. Chan toiled at various restaurants, learning the ropes. To make ends meet, he clipped hair. **********He acquired a wife, Grace, who had come here in 1963. She had multiple occupations: she sold souvenirs at the World's Fair, she was a radio announcer for the Chinese Broadcasting Corporation, she rang up checks in Chinatown restaurants. **********In 1971, using savings from Mr. Chan's family and some friends, the couple opened their own dim sum restaurant on the Bowery. The establishment was called H.S.F., from the Chinese phrase ''Hee Seung Fung,'' meaning ''happy reunion.'' **********The Chinese immigrant population had ballooned by then, and business was brisk right away. Before long, H.S.F. was one of Chinatown's biggest hits. In 1978, a second restaurant opened in Kip's Bay, and in 1980, a third H.S.F. went up in tony Bridgehampton, L.I., where the Chans own a weekend house. A fourth just opened in midtown Manhattan. **********The Chans related all this over the inevitable cups of tea at the original H.S.F. restaurant. Mr. Chan's English is ragged, so his wife did most of the talking. **********One of their ventures, she said, was a total bust. In 1979, they tried to take H.S.F. nationwide through franchising: they hoped to have dim sum fast-food eateries dotting the country. But the Chans badly misjudged the time and money necessary to get each franchise off the ground. In 1981, with eight franchisees signed up, the whole idea dissolved. ''That is a total failure for us,'' Mrs. Chan said. ''We ran short of capital. For everybody, it was a bad investment.'' **********After that fiasco, the Chans began speculating in Chinatown real estate, and, with friends, they have bought and sold a number of buildings. Grace Chan has even become a licensed real estate broker. **********At the moment, the Chans are leading an 11-member investor group that is attempting to make splendor out of rubble. There is room to build something under the Manhattan Bridge across from the Bowery. Nothing is there, yet it borders on the busy thoroughfares of Chinatown. Small wonder, then, that despite the overhead thunder, investors have wished to develop it. Some came and pondered a parking lot. Others thought of apartments. But they left. **********The Chans' project is the East Broadway Mall, which would be the biggest mall in Chinatown. The venture would cost in excess of $4 million. ''We are at the stage of signing some of the leases,'' Mrs. Chan said. ''Construction will start after we get all the approvals. Hopefully, we break ground in July.'' Factories and Fashions When a guest enters the musty Lafayette Street office of Hung Luk, the manager at John Lam's Fashion Group, the eye settles on the dresses dangling on the rack next to the door and the clothes piled on the filing cabinets. Fabric swatches lie on Hung Luk's desk. Sewing has made John Lam's fortune. **********Now 34, John Lam came here from Hong Kong 17 years ago with his parents, who were small merchants in the handbag and accessory business. He worked in garment factories, and then, with some savings of his father's, he started his own factory in 1971. At the time, Chinatown garment factories trafficked almost exclusively in budget clothing. Mr. Lam decided to turn out moderate- and higher-priced garments. The idea clicked, and Mr. Lam opened more factories. His sisters worked as supervisors. His brother and his parents helped manage the plants. **********''Down here, it's really a case of looking for your niche at the right time,'' Mr. Luk said. ''When John got into apparel, there was a demand for quality garments and so he picked the right time.'' **********The empire has grown to 15 factories, employing 1,200 workers. They do sewing for such companies as Evan Picone, Leslie Fay and Liz Claiborne, ringing up some $40 million worth of business a year. In recent times, though, the Chinatown factories, which pay union wages of $5 or $6 an hour, have come under fierce pressure from lower-priced overseas labor and from the wild real estate speculation in Chinatown, which has made factory space very costly. Mr. Lam's operations are no exception. **********''We're looking right now to move some factories, because the leases are coming up,'' Mr. Luk said. ''Rents are going to triple what they were four or five years ago.'' Some garment executives figure that in time many of the factories will be driven to other boroughs and to Long Island and New Jersey. **********''We're O.K., but we're not growing,'' Mr. Luk said. ''I think the future growth of our business will be if the retailers come straight to us as a place to source goods and not go through the designers. The Limited is going in that direction.'' **********Mr. Lam, though, has a mix of other businesses to keep the fires burning. His Shanghai cousins got him into silk, and his wife, Winnie, presides over their sizable trading company, the Silk Dragon. Fibers from China are woven in Hong Kong, then sold as finished garments in this country. There is Mr. Lam's own higher-priced Silk Dragon line of blouses, skirts, pants and dresses, in addition to the private label business. **********Like other Chinatown money people, Mr. Lam has been diversifying into real estate and banking. With various partners, he has bought several buildings. He is also one of the stockholders, along with the Chus, in Eastbank. Money in Chinatown often bumps into itself. An Eye for Sweets Maria Lee rarely appears in Chinatown. People think of her, though, when they eat. Ah, the butter egg rolls. The mango cream cakes. She is the Chinese pastry queen. **********You get these goodies at one of Maria's bakeries. Five of them have opened in New York in the last two years. Each mimics the others: There is an orange awning outside and the simple name ''Maria's.'' **********In Hong Kong, where she lives, Mrs. Lee is omnipresent. At the age of 58 she is a multimillionaire from her Hong Kong empire of 62 bakeries and fast-food establishments, catering services, kitchenware, television programs, cooking school and a monthly women's journal. The daughter of a Chinese cookbook writer, her reputation as a cook spread when she got her own show on Chinese television. Looking to cash in on her fame, she began opening bakeries and has never stopped. **********In New York, her partner is Danny Li, a man of 50 with a wise, puckish face. His offices are in the basement of a nondescript building on Canal Street. When guests drop by, someone is dispatched across the street to Maria's bakery for sweets. **********Mr. Li had been an opera manager in Hong Kong, when he decided to come here in 1970. He worked in a garment factory, saved up, and opened his own sportswear factory. Soon there was a second factory. The businesses did well, but there were always aggravations. His wife, in particular, suffered from nervousness. Twice she had miscarriages. Mr. Li, wanting to father a child, concluded that the demon was the factories. So he sold them in the late 1970's and returned to Hong Kong, where he rejoined the opera for three years. Sure enough, Mrs. Li gave birth to a healthy girl. **********In Hong Kong, all he saw were Maria's bakeries. He had been noticing that more prosperous immigrants were settling in Chinatown. There were plenty of mundane bakeries, but no higher-priced pastry shops like Maria's. Shouldn't they click in Chinatown, too, he asked himself. In 1982, he talked it over with Maria Lee and they formed a joint venture. **********The first shop opened at 421 Broadway in December 1984. Three more have followed in Chinatown, as well as a fifth in Flushing, Queens. The headquarters is a huge Maria's bakery at 148 Lafayette Street, where all the goodies are cooked. **********Mr. Li says that the capital investment comes from the Hong Kong company, which retains ownership of the bakeries. He, however, gets a salary and a split in the profits for managing the enterprise. **********Naturally, like anyone of means in Chinatown, Mr. Li also dabbles in real estate. He owns, with partners, several Chinatown buildings. And when he is hungry, it pays for him to go to the restaurant called 20 Mott Street, since he owns part of it. **********Mr. Li expects bakery revenues to surpass $1 million this year; because of start-up costs, he said, there have not yet been any profits. However, he talks about eventually marketing Maria's like David's Cookies or, better yet, McDonald's hamburgers. He intends to open two or three bakeries uptown and then, who knows. **********''Once others acquire the taste for Maria's, I see this really going big,'' he said. He bit into a peanut butter pastry, and gave a smile. ''How they not like this?'' he said. ''It so yum.'' THE YOUNG BECOME YUPPIES **********''You would never have seen a firm like ours before down here,'' says Irwin Liu. ''It can all be summed up by the fact that people have more money now and they need new services.'' **********The career road in Chinatown is altogether different for many of the community's younger generation than it was for the Chinese immigrants. Just take a look at Mr. Liu. He is a 33-year-old son of immigrants, and he never contemplated owning a garment factory or a restaurant. He runs a title insurance company on Pell Street and the Bowery. **********His parents' story was fairly classic. Chin-po and Diane Liu came from China in 1947 as exchange students. Chin-po Liu studied public administration, but could not land a job and ended up in Chinatown as a waiter. As he delivered dishes, he noted the great quantities of bean sprouts being consumed. By 1953, he was growing them to sell to restaurants. This venture evolved into a bustling business that he sold six years ago and retired. **********The young Liu studied English at Boston University, before earning a law degree at Emory University. After a brief stay at a midtown Manhattan law firm, he returned to Chinatown. ''The climate was changing,'' he says. ''People had more money and more problems. They had tax problems. The Chinese were realizing things like they could sue one another and not be deported.'' **********After a year of general practice, Mr. Liu settled in with the firm of Gim and Wong, doing real estate and immigration law. After three years, he left to form a partnership with a tax lawyer named Peter Chu. Along with Mr. Chu and several others, Mr. Liu organized Summit Associates in March to specialize in title insurance. **********''Now our clients are other Chinese lawyers rather than just other Chinese,'' Mr. Liu says. ''They're more sophisticated, and I want to become a more sophisticated lawyer. It's sort of like we went into wholesale rather than retail.'' **********He figures that at least 60 Chinese lawyers now practice in Chinatown and ''I think everyone can pull $60,000 a year.'' **********''There will always be money made in restaurants down here, and there are still lots of real estate deals,'' he goes on. ''But it's services that the younger Chinese are going into. Insurance, banking, law, computer services, phone services.'' **********He laughs about how different things are for him than they were for the early immigrants. ''I even have an Irish secretary and she can answer the phone in Chinese better than I can.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/08/business/advertising-itt-unit-names-fallon-for-xtra-computers.html": {"writer_name": "Isadore Barmash", "pub_date": "1986-08-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Advertising; ITT Unit Names Fallon For XTRA Computers", "print_headline": "Advertising; ITT Unit Names Fallon For XTRA Computers", "body_text": " **********The ITT Information Systems division of ITT Corporation, San Jose, Calif., has named Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis, to handle its ITT XTRA family of microcomputers, which adds up to seven figures in billings. **********The selection follows an extensive review of 10 agencies over the last several months.

Modest gains in employment, if accompanied by declines in manufacturing payrolls, help keep alive hopes that the Federal Reserve would try to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates. **********Economists also said the case for lower interest rates in America was helped by West German data showing a 1.5 percent decline in industrial production during September, following a 1 percent decline in August.

But even those barriers, most experts predict, will come down within the next five years. **********''The issue has become increasingly moot as more and more states have taken the initiative instead of Congress,'' said Kenneth McLean, a top aide to Senator William Proxmire, the incoming chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Laws in 36 States and D.C.  Currently, 36 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws permitting out-of-state banks to buy institutions in their states, laws similar to one passed just this fall by the Texas Legislature that permitted the Chemical-Texas Commerce transaction. Of those states, 27 plus the District of Columbia are part of regional compacts that have banking arrangements with nearby states, while the other nine have effectively opened their borders to all banks in the country. **********''It's the typical process of the Congress sitting back and not being able to come to grips with an issue until the marketplace has taken care of it,'' said William M. Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. **********And Karen Shaw, executive vice president for the Institute for Strategy Development, a Washington economic consulting group for banks and other industries, predicted that the only time the Congress will look at interstate banking again will be when ''it is so obvious that we have de facto nationwide banking, that any repeal of the Federal statutes will have no adverse political consequences.'' Two Restricting U.S. Laws **********Two basic laws restrict the interstate activities of the nation's banks. They are the McFadden Act, which prohibits banks from setting up branches across state lines, and the Douglas Amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act, which prohibits, except where permitted by state law, a holding company to own a bank in any state other than its state of domicile. **********Though the nation is not seeing a rash of interstate branching, which is still widely prohibited, it has seen a rush by scores of banks to find merger partners in other states. As a result, the shares of the better regional banks have traded at a substantial premium since the new state laws have made them prime takeover candidates. **********Federal regulators have not held up the merger wave in the banking industry. Mr. Isaac predicted that the Federal Reserve Board, which must approve the transaction, would quickly give its blessing to the Chemical-Texas Commerce deal. **********In such mergers the Fed looks at the capital levels of the resulting institution, the quality of its management, the effect on the local community and any anti-competitive issues. **********''There are certainly no antitrust problems,'' the former regulator said, adding that Chemical plans to raise new capital for the transaction and both banks are considered well managed. **********A spokesman for the Fed said the board would have no comment. **********The push to interstate banking was both the product of increased competition from less-regulated financial institutions and hard times for the banking industry. **********''As brokerage firms and insurance companies began encroaching on the traditional customers of commercial banks through offering such competing products as money-market mutual funds, the banks had to begin looking for other sources of deposits and new outlets for their services,'' Mr. Isaac said.  In addition, the high-interest rate problems experienced in the banking industry in the 1980's created situations where regulators needed to go out of state to find strong buyers for hundreds of failing banks. Regional Compacts a Defense **********As a kind of defense mechanism against too swift interstate expansion by the money-center banks, the use of banking compacts developed, which has proved to be the prime vehicle for regional interstate banking since 1984. **********These reciprocal compacts generally involve states in a certain area, such as in the Southeastern United States, passing laws permitting only banks within that region to acquire each other. **********First introduced by the New England states, the concept was challenged in court and upheld by the Supreme Court. In the wake of that decision, several regional compacts have been formed. **********Currently, 27 states and the District of Columbia have entered into banking compact agreements. Of that number, nine have a provision that permits the money-center banks to enter their region after three to five years of strictly regional acquisition activity. **********At the same time, nine states have already passed laws that permit banks from any state to merge with their banks. **********Three other states have passed laws permitting a bank to set up a credit card operation within their boundaries, and one state, New Mexico, has passed a law permitting an out-of-state bank to acquire a failing bank. **********Though the Southeastern states in particular have vigorously opposed letting in the money center banks, banking experts say their opposition is diminishing. Merger activity had produced a number of very large and highly profitable regional banks that do not carry the burdensome third-world debt or high levels of beleaguered energy and real estate loans. **********Thus, they are becoming more confident in their ability to compete against the multinational institutions."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/24/business/impasse-at-coffee-talks.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 31, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Impasse at Coffee Talks", "print_headline": "Impasse at Coffee Talks", "body_text": " **********Negotiations over market shares at a conference of the International Coffee Organization remained deadlocked today.

It is a desire that hangs tenuously on unity talks aimed at merging his Zimbabwe African People's Union with the party of his longstanding political rival, Prime Minister Robert Mugabe. **********While Western diplomats and Zimbabwean political experts doubt that the now stalled talks will be successful, Mr. Nkomo insists that the discussions have not failed. He said Mr. Mugabe was ''studying the minutes'' of a meeting in December between the two sides and could ''call us at any time'' to continue the talks. **********But Mr. Nkomo, 68 years old, said progress had been hampered by a ''small group'' of members of Mr. Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front. 'Little Political Castles' **********''There is a small group of men and women who want to preserve their little political castles,'' said Mr. Nkomo, a burly man who spoke barely above a raspy whisper at times. **********''They're doing everything they can to hinder an agreement,'' he continued. ''They are chaps who see unity as a disaster for their political future. I hope the Prime Minister will manage to get over the problem of these chaps. What we need for unity to succeed is just common sense and honesty and determination.'' **********While he would not say who these people were, he suggested that some were ''influential'' members of Mr. Mugabe's party. Western diplomats have said the talks, begun last September, have stalled over several issues, including resistance by some senior members of Mr. Mugabe's party who fear they would lose personal influence in a merger. **********Mr. Nkomo initiated the unity talks, apparently in an effort to preserve some semblance of meaningful political participation as Mr. Mugabe pushes the nation toward a socialist-oriented, one-party state. His party has fallen increasingly into disarray under the pressure of repeated crackdowns by the ruling party against what the Government insists are armed and lawless dissidents loyal to Mr. Nkomo. **********The opposition leader, whose party holds 15 of the 80 seats reserved for blacks in the 100-member Parliament, has complained that his supporters have been harassed and detained and his home raided and that his political fiefdom, Matabeleland, has been virtually under siege by Mr. Mugabe's army. Amnesty International has charged that many of those arrested have been tortured or mistreated. Kinship Over Unity **********Mr. Nkomo, once the most venerated of Zimbabwean nationalists, believes that independence has not been particularly kind to him. While Mr. Mugabe has reached out to whites who once systematically oppressed the black majority when the country was called Rhodesia, Western diplomats say, the Prime Minister has dealt harsh punishment to Mr. Nkomo and his followers. **********In this sense, they say, unity has taken a back seat to kinship. Mr. Nkomo is the leader of the country's Ndebele-speaking minority, while most of Mr. Mugabe's supporters speak Shona. The rivalry between the two tribes is deeply rooted in history. **********''The Prime Minister seems to be hostile toward me,'' Mr. Nkomo said, resting a walking stick against his chair in his sparsely furnished office. ''I've suffered much more in the last four years than in the 30 years of my struggle for independence. I have nothing against him myself. Why should I?'' **********The view from Mr. Mugabe's perspective may be different, according to some of the Prime Minister's supporters. The radical wing of Mr. Mugabe's party has long considered Mr. Nkomo a sellout to the cause of liberation, criticizing him for being too moderate and negotiating with the former white minority Government of Ian D. Smith. **********In the seven-year war for majority rule, Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Nkomo maintained a loose alliance called the Patriotic Front but kept their guerrilla armies separate. The alliance fell apart when a British-sponsored peace was proclaimed in 1980, elections were held and Mr. Mugabe emerged the winner. Dismissed From Cabinet in 1982 **********The two armies were integrated into a national force. When, however, Mr. Nkomo was dismissed from Mr. Mugabe's Cabinet in 1982 for purportedly plotting a coup - Mr. Nkomo denies the charge - some of his supporters deserted the new army and became armed dissidents. **********In February 1983, when Government troops were accused of massacring civilians in Matabeleland, Mr. Nkomo fled to Botswana and then to London. He returned to Zimbabwe in August of that year. **********''Unfortunately, there was a rift early in our independence,'' Mr. Nkomo said. ''If we had come back together as a patriotic front, I think unity would have been achieved right on the day of our independence. That is why I believe that, if we can come back together again, this rift which is destroying unity of our people would be removed.'' **********Mr. Nkomo has reportedly been offered the position of vice president after a merger of the two parties.

But it agreed to an order to follow all accounting rules in the future. American Express recently reduced its interest in Fireman's Fund, which had been a wholly owned subsidiary, to 27 percent. **********Perhaps more important, American Express will not be forced to restate its earnings for 1981 and 1982, as often happens in such disputes over accounting practices. **********In future statements that give its 1981 or 1982 earnings, American Express will have to note the terms of its settlement with the commission but can still include its version of its earnings for those years. **********This point was critical to the company, which also faces a class action lawsuit over whether it mislead investors by reportedly overstating its earnings.

That way, the company would appear to be showing steady growth, rather than sharp swings in earnings. **********One of the two transactions, the commission said, ''was developed in reaction to criticism by American Express regarding Fireman's Fund's erratic earnings.'' **********''The transactions thus enabled American Express, through Fireman's Fund, to represent a favorable earnings picture to shareholders during the downward phase of the industry underwriting cycle,'' the commission said.

About half the strength expected of the economy this year has been drained away by Japan, Taiwan, Canada and other countries, as American consumers and businesses keep buying foreign rather than American. **********Economists had every conventional reason to expect the country to bound from its lethargy of late 1985, when it all but slipped into a recession. The declines in interest rates and the collapse of oil prices were expected to yield the healthiest economy the nation had seen in a couple of decades. **********They still could. But as the extra buying power these forces have generated continues to flow abroad, analysts have become wary of saying when they might. The established waves of growth and decline known as the business cycle are being distorted, they say, as foreign goods continue to displace domestic production. This makes projections difficult, they say. U.S. to Cut Forecast **********Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d said, in a television interview today, that the Administration would lower its 1986 economic growth forecast early next month, although he declined to specify how low. Early this year, the Administration predicted a 4 percent annual growth in G.N.P. for 1986. **********The sharp decline in the dollar, which would normally help the American economy by making American goods less expensive abroad and imports more costly, has produced disappointing results. Economists normally expect to see some improvement in trade figures six months or a year after a currency starts to decline. **********But the dollar started falling about 18 months ago, in February 1985, and the impact so far has been minimal. **********''As you look at the data, all I can conclude is that it's quit getting worse,'' said Beryl W. Sprinkel, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Trade Is Undertestimated **********Most analysts say they have been misreading the importance of the rest of the world to an economy that was once insular and self-sustaining. Trade ''is the thing that is more different than anything else,'' said Jason Benderly, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street brokerage firm. **********Now that the economists have identified the problem, they see no easy way out. **********Congress is writing protectionist legislation to slow the imports, but the President is threatening to veto any stringent measures. The Administration, like most economists, assumes that protectionist laws here will spawn protectionist laws abroad. **********Meanwhile, the nation's deficit in foreign trade, which reached a record $148 billion last year, could be about the same this year. In 1970, commerce with other nations represented 8 percent of the country's gross national product, and trade helped the country then because the United States ran a surplus from selling more goods abroad than it bought. Now, trade is almost twice as important to the economy as it was in 1970 - representing 14 percent of the G.N.P. - but there has not been a trade surplus since 1975. **********The expectations of declining imports and more American exports have been short-circuited, many economists say, because some countries are flouting the traditional rules and cutting costs and shaving profits to remain competitive here in the face of their own slow economies and dim prospects of increasing business at home. Weaker Appetite for Imports **********Meanwhile, with most other countries growing no faster than the United States, their appetites for imports are weaker than expected. And the world is producing more of some goods, among them food and steel, than it can use. **********Other developments have also slowed the economy. One was the speed with which the oil industry curbed investment and laid off workers when prices fell, although most of that impact has been felt by now. Another was the uncertainty over the course of the Government's effort to overhaul the tax system has discouraged business investment. **********The murkiness should end by Labor Day, by which time the President and Congress are expected to complete their work. **********A third factor is the Federal budget deficit. Government borrowing to carry the deficit keeps interest rates higher than they would be otherwise. The deficit could exceed last year's record of $212 billion because of the economy's sluggishness. But in relation to the overall economy, the deficit has begun to shrink, which is part of the reason why interest rates have dropped. **********Yet it is trade, economists say, that causes the most worry now. **********A few months ago, Mr. Benderly of Goldman, Sachs said he expected the economy to grow at the vigorous rate of 4 to 6 percent in the second half of this year. Largely because of the trade drain, he now expects it to grow 2 to 2 1/2 percent, he said. Mr. Benderly's lowered expectations are little different from those of most other economists. 'It's More Chronic' **********''Before there had been this constant expectation that 'the economy is going to speed up,' that 'we're going through a temporary phase,' '' said Robert Dederick, the chief economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''Lately the worry is that this is not so temporary, that it's more chronic.'' **********What worries economists most is that the catalyst for the business cycles they track - a phenomenon known as the ''multiplier effect'' -has either broken down or lost much of its usual drive. **********Interest rates are one of the important multipliers. The spark of interest-rate declines normally sets off a wave of borrowing and spending for the things usually bought on credit, particularly houses and automobiles. As those industries revive, they buy more supplies, hire more workers, pay more to their stockholders, and the effects of the rate decline begin multiplying through the economy. **********In time, the growth of spending by consumers cools off, but as more and more industries gear up to meet the demands of a richer economy, they increase their investment in new factories and more workers, keeping the economy rolling. Then, when interest rates rise in response to resurgent demand for loans throughout the economy, the borrowing declines and the economy slows. A Different Response **********This time around, lower interest rates have indeed induced consumers to borrow and spend, but industry has not responded as it usually does. It is using about 10 percent less of its capacity than at similar points in earlier cycles. At the start of this year, the Conference Board, a business research organization in New York, predicted that capital spending would rise 8 percent in 1986 as more capacity was used; now it predicts a rise of 1 percent. **********''The enormous volume of imports has the effect of a negative multiplier,'' said Albert T. Sommers, economist at the Conference Board. ''It displaces domestic production.'' He added, ''The trade deficit is a blanket on the whole system.'' **********What is especially worrisome to economists is that the reasons for the trade drain seem structural - built in to how the world economy has reshaped itself as the more encompassing cycle of industrial development unfolds. **********The dollar, for example, has not declined at all against certain currencies, some of which are pegged to the dollar. While it has fallen sharply against the powerful currencies of West Germany and Japan, the dollar is worth about as much as it was a year ago against the currencies of Canada, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore - all big exporters to the United States. Competition in World Markets **********And the industries of countries that established big stakes in the American market appear unwilling to give them up. In the past they would raise their prices in line with the decline of the dollar, but no longer. Now they are willing to shave profits to remain competitive here. **********Still another change is afoot as well. Countries that once bought American wheat, soybeans, steel, machines, computers and aircraft have built farms and industries that now sell those products to the United States or compete in world markets with American producers. Having invested in those industries, they will be slow to abandon them in the face of competitive pressure. **********Meanwhile American companies that once used American workers to make tractors, shoes and apparel have built factories abroad where they use foreign workers to produce the goods more cheaply for sale in the United States. It will take more than another dip of the dollar to persuade them to move the factories home. **********These changes, in turn, help explain a new feature of the once well-integrated American economy: It has become much more fragmented. Manufacturing industries are marking time, while service industries prosper. Agriculture, and the oil, timber and mining businesses of much of the Middle West, the West and the Southwest, are nearly moribund. **********What emerges from the confusion are new patterns, but economists assume that their theories of growth and interest rates still apply. The Fed is testing the theories again with last week's reduction in the discount rate, which it charges banks, to 6 percent, from 6 1/2. If that cut does not speed up the economy's growth, economists are betting that the Fed will make another cut later this year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 105, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** ALMI Group L.P said Michael Spiegler had joined the company as executive vice president, corporate development. *********** Alpha Micro, Santa Ana, Calif., a provider of computing and communications solutions, named Thomas Anthony senior vice president of sales and marketing. *********** Astrotech International Corp., Pittsburgh, a service and manufacturing concern for the aerospace industry, named Lawrence H.

Lorenzo's complex bid to acquire People Express Inc. illustrates his penchant to act boldly and bargain hard when opportunities arise to build his Texas Air Corporation, analysts said today. **********The offer is conditioned on numerous concessions from the creditors and employees at the embattled People Express and its bankrupt subsidiary, Frontier Airlines. In return, Mr. Lorenzo has offered the possibility of jobs for many Frontier employees who were laid off when the carrier was shut down last month and full repayment for creditors. **********''It's too early to say whether all of this holds water,'' said Robert J. Joedicke, an airline analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''There are so many ifs that have to come to pass before it is a fait accompli.'' **********Texas Air was already scheduled to challenge United Airlines' position as the nation's largest airline company, assuming it could persuade the Department of Transportation to approve its revised, $600 million offer to buy ailing Eastern Air Lines. **********Dominate Key Hubs **********The addition of People Express to the other carriers in Mr. Lorenzo's stable - Continental and New York Air - would put it far ahead of United. If both acquisitions are approved, Texas Air could dominate such key hubs as New York, Miami, Houston and Denver. **********Some analysts said the deal for People Express amounts to a bargain hunt for airplanes at low cost. People owns 217 aircraft. Analysts noted that the $125 million offer was an exchange of stock, the only way debt-burdened Texas Air could have made the bid. **********Mr. Joedicke said Mr. Lorenzo probably would have preferred not to bid for People Express while the Eastern offer was still unresolved. ''But he couldn't say to People: 'Wait around six months until I'm ready to take you into the family,' '' Mr. Joedicke said. ''Circumstances dictated that he had to move now.'' **********''It's a very savvy management,'' said Edward J. Starkman, who follows the airline industry for Paine Webber Inc. Mr. Lorenzo, he said, ''has been extremely creative in what he's been able to accomplish.'' Debt Load a Concern **********Nonetheless, some analysts are concerned about the growing debt load at the Houston-based Texas Air. The company's offer for Eastern included taking on the obligation to repay $2.5 billion in the airline's long-term debt. That was added to a debt load at Texas Air that, at 82 percent of total capital, already was much higher than the industry average, at 53 percent. **********Texas Air and Eastern together would have a combined debt of $3.7 billion. If it acquires People Express, Texas Air would take on an additional $700 million in debt. Analysts noted, however, that the uncertainties in the offer for People Express made it difficult for them to sketch how Texas Air's balance sheet might look if, indeed, the offer is completed. **********As part of the offer for People Express, Texas Air said it would pay $49.5 million in cash for 12 Boeing 727-200 aircraft, with $10 million advanced today. Texas Air will assign the planes to Continental, which will keep the planes even if the acquisition bid for People Express is scuttled. **********Texas Air also plans to buy all of Frontier Airlines' assets for $176 million, with $25 million to be paid in cash and the balance in notes and assumption of Frontier's debt. Over time, Frontier's total operations would be absorbed by Continental. Similarly, People Express would be managed as a separate subsidiary of Texas Air for a while but ultimately would be merged into one of its units. **********''When focused under the same umbrella, these assets bring to bear a tremendous mass'' of aircraft, people and ground facilities ''that we think is important for our future,'' said Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for Texas Air. He noted the several conditions in the People Express offer, saying, ''Texas Air is not taking a blind leap.'' Capital Available **********Mr. Hicks said Texas Air had more than $600 million in cash and short-term securities that it could tap. The deal for People Express is to be executed by Texas Air without the issuance of new debt. Each People Express share is to be exchanged for Texas Air common stock valued at $2.25, plus a new issue of preferred stock from Texas Air valued at $2.50. People Express has about 26 million shares outstanding. **********People Express placed Frontier into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization last month when United dropped its plan to buy the airline. Texas Air had offered to acquire People for $235.8 million in July, before United acquired rights to several Frontier gates at Denver's Stapleton International Airport. People rejected the offer. **********As part of its effort to win Federal approval for its acquisition of Eastern, last weekend Texas Air sold 14 takeoff and landing positions at Washington's National Airport, New York's La Guardia Airport, and Boston's Logan Airport to Pan American World Airways. Willing to Take on Battles **********Mr. Lorenzo seems willing to take on further antitrust battles in his bid for People Express. Texas Air units would control nearly 70 percent of the boardings at Newark International Airport, as well as significant although not dominant shares at La Guardia and Kennedy International Airport. **********''There will be enormous antitrust concerns with Texas Air trying to take on People Express,'' Mr. Starkman said. **********Yet, these are the kinds of battles Mr. Lorenzo has proved willing to fight in order to position Texas Air as a major airline in an industry that has been going through a rapid shakeout. **********Continental Airlines, which Mr. Lorenzo acquired in 1982 after a bitter takeover battle, has been the industry model in reducing costs. Mr. Lorenzo led Continental into a bankruptcy reorganization in August 1983, when he failed to win wage concessions from Continental's unions. Under Chapter 11, he canceled union contracts and reduced wages and fares. Continental, which continued to operate, attracted more passengers and its profitability steadily improved. **********''Mr. Lorenzo has an absolute commitment to build a structure, in terms of costs and routes, that is viable in the longterm,'' said Joseph L. Bower, a professor specializing in business strategy at the Harvard Business School who has studied the history of Texas Air. **********Airline analysts have long noted that five or six major airlines are expected to survive as deregulation enables more efficient and better managed airlines to acquire others. **********''A lot of managers are not tough enough on themselves to look at what is economically viable over the long term, and then turning around and fighting for it,'' Dr. Bower said. Mr. Lorenzo, he added, believes Texas Air has to have a large system to compete against American Airlines, currently the second-largest carrier, and United. **********In that regard, the Eastern acquisition would be more significant than People Express mainly because, for the first time, Texas Air would have the sophisticated, computerized reservation system it so far has lacked in its pricing battles, Mr. Starkman said. **********''No matter how good they got with Continental alone, they were at a size where they couldn't do much,'' Mr. Starkman said.

He was detained June 15 at 3 A.M., when the police raided a college hostel in Soweto, Johannesburg's sprawling black satellite, where he was staying with a friend, Khausi Radebe, according to Supreme Court testimony. **********Under the nation's emergency decree, proclaimed June 12, the actions of the police or the army may not be reported except when the Bureau for Information, the Government's propaganda arm, authorizes such reports. Court testimony, however, is exempted from the prohibition. **********Cassette Tapes and Calendar **********Miss Radebe, a student of social sciences at the University of the Witwatersrand, told the court that the police raided Glyn Thomas Hostel at 3 A.M. and searched her room. **********They found, she said, 38 cassette tapes, a calendar issued by a campaign seeking the release of Nelson Mandela, a poster depicting Mr. Mandela's wife, Winnie, and a notepad with the emblem of the American ABC network. **********Until they saw the television logo, she said, they had paid Mr. Mashiani little attention. **********But, when it became known that Mr. Mashiani worked for a foreign television company, she said, he was detained and that was the last she saw of him until he was freed two days ago, because a judge ruled that the police had acted in bad faith. Some Limitation Seen **********Mr. Mashiani was one of some 4,500 people who have been detained under the emergency decree from a variety of protest, labor and church groups. **********His release did not dent the powers of the state in ordering such detentions under an emergency decree that offers the police and the army virtually unlimited powers of arrest and search with warrant. But the release did hearten some lawyers and legal experts here. **********Justice R. Goldstone, when he ordered Mr. Mashiani freed on Monday on the ground that the officer who had arrested him did so in bad faith, said, ''The courts are here to administer justice to those who seek it - not to keep the peace of the land.'' **********The justice said if police officers, even under the emergency decree, ''abuse their powers, there are ordinary courts of the land which they can be summoned before to explain their actions.'' A Question of Faith **********Mr. Mashiani went free, in part thanks to Miss Radebe, who had argued in the court that no one could genuinely believe that his arrest was necessary for the maintenance of public order, the safety of the public, the safety of Mr. Mashiani himself or the termination of the state of emergency. **********The emergency regulations indemnify officers acting in good faith to enforce the decree. But, lawyers said, that indemnity does not hold if they act in what is deemed to be bad faith. Thus, some lawyers argued, in future police officers might be more hesitant about who they detain since the ruling - and the attitude of a judge - offered a kind of counter to the omnipotence assumed by the authorities. **********The ruling seemed to have wider connotations, since it followed actions in court earlier this year that inhibited the authorities' use of part of the nation's pervasive security legislation and forced the authorities to release or lift restrictions on political foes. **********John Dugard, an activist lawyer, said: ''What one is seeing is not a confrontation between the courts and the Government, but a growing distance, a growing assertion of independence from the executive.'' Unheard of in Previous Years **********That was not always the case in South Africa, he said. In the 1950's, the Government clashed with the judiciary, principally because many judges had been appointed by a previous administration, he said. But in the 1960's and the 1970's, ''it was virtually unheard of to hand down a judgment against the security police.'' **********What prompted the change, Mr. Dugard said, was mounting criticism of the courts from within the legal profession, and the rise to prominence of figures such as John Milne, the Judge President of Natal, the province with the most liberal judiciary. **********It was in Natal's capital, Pietermaritzburg, that state charges of treason against labor unionists and political activists were recently dismissed. **********Moreoever, some lawyers argue, some court rulings this years have encouraged others to view the courts as one of the few, available channels of challenge to white authorities armed with harsh security legislation. Like a 'Brick Wall' **********When the latest emergency decree was imposed on June 12, one prominent advocate said, ''It looked as though a brick wall had been put up, through which you could not penetrate and which the courts tended to consider themselves powerless to penetrate.'' **********Yet, the lawyer said, some - but by no means all judges - had tended ''to assume much more power than the courts previously thought they had'' so that ''suddenly there has been a feeling among people that the courts are much more accessible and one is much more likely to succeed.'' **********Thus, two prominent labor organizations - the militant Metal and Allied Workers Union and the Congress of South African Trade Unions - are pursuing legal action against the emergency decree. But that offers its own paradox: the courts administer the laws of the land, which are made by a Parliament dominated by the ruling Afrikaner elite, and which, in the past, could be modified. **********With the creation of a new, three-chamber Parliament embracing people of Indian and mixed racial descent - but excluding the black majority -such modifications, technically, became more difficult."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/27/world/secret-poll-is-said-to-have-found-gloom-in-poland-about-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Michael Kaufman", "pub_date": "1986-01-27", "snippet": "", "word_count": 666, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SECRET POLL IS SAID TO HAVE FOUND GLOOM IN POLAND ABOUT ECONOMY", "print_headline": "SECRET POLL IS SAID TO HAVE FOUND GLOOM IN POLAND ABOUT ECONOMY", "body_text": " **********Nearly three-quarters of the industrial workers and managers interviewed in a secret Government poll rated the Polish economy as unsatisfactory to hopeless, while virtually none of those questioned believe the Government's economic policies are correct. **********The poll was based on interviews with 800 workers and managers in steel mills, shipyards and smaller factories. In all, 49 questions were asked in the poll by interviewers from the Center of Public Opinion Research, which conveys its publicized and unpublicized findings to the highest levels of authority. **********In contrast to this selectively circulated data, the director of the opinion research group recently publicly outlined an end-of-the year profile of selected public opinion. **********The director, Col. Stanislaw Kwiatkowski, said at a news conference that the number of Poles interested in political issues was dropping, that the army had replaced the church as the country's most trusted institution, and that each month fewer and fewer Poles were admitting to poll-takers that they had been members of Solidarity trade unions before they were outlawed. He also said wages had replaced shortages or price rises as the country's dominant economic concern. Rising Apathy, Little Hope **********But the secret poll, which was distributed recently to a small group of Polish propaganda specialists, showed that amid the rising apathy there remained very little hope that Poland's economic policies could succeed. The responses were collated into nine categories, referred to as stereotypes of the economy, with the most positive choice that ''the official policy is the only correct path,'' and the most dismal assessment that ''things are bad and will get worse because nothing can be improved.'' **********None of the shipyard or factory workers and none of the decision makers at any of the enterprises had their responses registered in the most optimistic of the poll's nine categories, though 1.1 percent of the steelworkers did. **********On the other hand, 26.4 percent of the steelworkers, 31.3 percent of the shipyard crews and 43.6 percent of the workers in smaller factories had their responses classified in the ninth, or, most negative category. Moreover, 40.3 percent of the technical, or white-collar, staffs also gave the most pessimistic responses, as did 40 percent of the administration. **********As for the economic decision-makers at the shipyards, steel mills and factories, 48 percent fell into the third most positive category - ''things are not good, but surely they will soon improve.'' Another 24.5 percent of the managers' responses reflected the view that the ''economy had to be reformed,'' while 5 percent of their answers were in the category expressing the view that ''society had to be reformed.'' 'Full Disapproval for Realities' **********The sociologists at the public opinion center also analyzed responses in terms of three degrees of approval or disapproval for economic policies. By far the largest response came under the heading of ''full disapproval for economic realities and the whole social-political system.'' **********Of the workers in smaller factories, 58 percent registered this view, as did 50 percent of the steel workers and 38 percent of the shipyard workers. More than 50 percent of the technical staffs and 15 percent of the decision makers were also in this category. **********Widespread perceptions of a moribund economy almost doomed to decline extends to many economic experts. ''Awareness that the Polish economy may be in for a period of stagnation is widespread,'' wrote Ryszard Bugaj, a former Solidarity economic adviser. **********In an article entitled ''Why the Crisis Continues,'' which appeared recently in Tygodnik Powszechny, the influential and independent Catholic publication, Mr. Bugaj wrote: ''Many economists, but also many people who watch the economy as nonprofessionals have a premonition of danger. I cannot believe that people in decision-making centers do not have this feeling, and my impression is that this very often nourishes fatalistic attitudes which make people reconcile themselves to the prospecct of economic degradation.'' **********Government censors reportedly passed almost all of Mr. Bugaj's long critical article."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/world/c-corrections-480786.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 61, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Correction", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CORRECTIONS", "print_headline": "CORRECTIONS", "body_text": " **********Articles in Business Day on Saturday and yesterday about the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company incorrectly characterized the relationship between Sir James Goldsmith and the Crown Zellerbach Corporation.

Five shared-research centers capable of conducting theoretical experiments beyond the scope of their individual industrial members have been established on university campuses in the state, and two others are about to start up. The project's current budget is nearly double that of the last fiscal year, and entrepreneurship and venture capital are being stimulated. **********The program, which got under way last November after a yearlong study by a panel of experts and one more year of planning, aims to compensate for the state's loss of its ''smokestack'' industries, which has also affected other states. A major component of the project, initiated by the administration of Governor Kean, is to train people for jobs in technology-related fields that are expected to open up as a result of the program. Other, related goals are to attract top scientists to New Jersey colleges and universities and increase the capacity of industry for basic research. **********''We are moving with the rest of the world from the industrial age to the information age,'' said David M. Goodman, deputy director of the state Commission on Science and Technology, which oversees the transformation. **********Of the five operating ''academic-industrial resource centers,'' as the commission calls them, four are at Rutgers University campuses in New Brunswick and Piscataway, and the fifth is at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark. Their funding is shared by the state commission and by participating industries and universities. Though the centers are expected to expand to include more industrial members, research projects, scientists and students, they already offer unusual opportunities for students intent on scientific careers. Graduate students work in the center's laboratories performing basic research for industry as part of their degree requirements, while undergraduates serve as paid technicians. **********The commission's $16.1 million operating budget appropriated by the Legislature for fiscal 1986, which began last July 1, is almost double its $8.3 million budget for the previous fiscal year. In addition, the commission administers a $90 million bond issue approved in November 1984 to erect new buildings for the centers. In varying stages of development, they are operating temporarily in university buildings. Some of the money under the commission's jurisdiction is administered by the State Department of Higher Education. **********The most developed of these high-technology institutions are the Center for Ceramics Research at Rutgers in Piscataway and the Center for Research into Hazardous and Toxic Substances at the Institute of Technology. Both were initiated on a more limited basis in 1982 with grants from the National Science Foundation. **********Dr. John B. Wachtman, director of the ceramics center, said that only about a dozen universities throughout the nation offered programs in ceramics, a material that is being developed to withstand severe stress and heat for use in aerospace, computer, electronics and related industries. ''There are jobs available for good people at all levels,'' said Mr. Wachtman. ''Ceramics plays a large role in our industrial competition with other nations.'' Thirty-one industries, including the Allied Corporation, A.T.& T. Technologies and the Alcoa Company participate in the ceramics center. Each pays $35,000 a year for basic research into mutual problems that its own scientists don't tackle because the monetary rewards would not be available until the distant future. A fiber-optics program affiliated with the center charges participating industries $50,000 a year. **********One of the students pursuing projects at the ceramics center is Frank Kurchinski of Somerset, a Ph.D. candidate in ceramics engineering at Rutgers. He is working with university scientists to learn how glass reacts when it is used to store buried nuclear waste. ''The industrial uses of ceramics are increasing rapidly,'' he said, ''particularly in aerospace technology.'' **********The Center for Research into Hazardous and Toxic Substances explores new methods for cleaning industrial pollution from the environment. Though it is based at the Institute of Technology, it operates jointly with Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Rutgers and Princeton University, all of which use its facilities. More than 50 graduate students and about 10 undergraduates work there. **********Ronald Josephson of Bethesda, Md., a candidate for a master of science degree at the Institute of Technology, is one of those students. He is trying to find new ways to remove the water content from sewage and industrial sludge so that it can be transported more efficiently. ''I came here to study,'' he said, ''because hazardous-waste cleanup is a science of the future. Trained specialists in this area will be needed by corporations and regulatory agencies.'' **********The Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine will get under way officially in July, when its new director, Aaron J. Shatkin, currently director of the Department of Cell Biology at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley, takes the helm. It will be operated jointly by Rutgers University's Waksman Institute of Microbiology and the University of Medicine and Dentistry in a new building to be constructed on the Rutgers campus in Piscataway. Dr. Norman H. Edelman,the interim director, said students in this field would find jobs in New Jersey's vast pharmaceutical industry. **********Because of the state's concentration of pharmaceutical companies, the biotechnology center will receive $20 million of the $90 million bond issue. A $20 million revenue bond floated by Rutgers and the University of Medicine and Dentistry will make up the balance of the projected cost of the facilities. **********Dr. David Praner, director of the Waksman Institute, said that much of the institute's work would be transferred to the new center. Among its experiments is one using recombinant DNA techniques to study mutations in fruit-fly enzymes, headed by Dr. William Sofer, which is being funded by the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Energy. Dr. Edelman said that although the center would focus on a new doctoral curriculum in molecular genetics, the greatest need was not for scientists with doctoral degrees but for technicians to operate equipment in laboratories. **********Presley Martin of Clarksville, Ind., a Ph.D. and a postgraduate fellow at the Waksman Institute, is using recombinant DNA techniques to study the mutation of fruit flies lacking a necessary enzyme that lets them live off decaying fruit without becoming intoxicated on the alcohol that it generates. ''I came here because I wanted training in molecular genetics and DNA technology for future research,'' he said. **********At the Center for Computer Aid for Industrial Productivity, in Piscataway, Dr. Thomas D. Marshall, a faculty scientist, leads a team of researchers studying the use of computers in telecommunications. The work is being done for a range of companies including A.T.& T. Information Systems, the RCA Corporation, Allied Corporation and the Martin Marietta Company. **********David Homan of Belle Meade, a master of science candidate in electrical engineering at Rutgers and a researcher at the center, is studying parallel silicon chips that work together to improve computer speed and efficiency. ''This is the cutting edge of technology,'' he said. **********The Center for Food Technology develops new ways to process, package and store food, such as irradiating certain foods to prolong their shelf life. According to Dr. Myron Solberg, director of the center, the prepared-food industry as well as Federal regulatory agencies hire people with such training. The center is based at Cook College on Rutgers's New Brunswick campus. **********Gonzalo Villalobos of Sao Paulo, Brazil, is earning a Ph.D. in food engineering at Cook College. At the center he is studying dehydration and rehydration of foods. ''I came here to study new food technologies,'' he said, ''so that I could take them back to my country, where they are sorely needed.'' **********The sixth center, the John A. Newmann Center for Advanced Scientific Computing, being built in Plainsboro, will house the world's largest unclassified supercomputer when it opens in June.

On Tuesday, a Federal appeals court reversed a lower court's ruling and said that the Bankers Trust Company of New York might place commercial paper, short-term corporate debt. That means that Bankers Trust may line up buyers of commercial paper, but not actually own the securities. **********Underwriting is the process of buying securites from corporations, owning them for a short time, and then marketing them to investors. Until the Fed rules in April, the question of whether banks can underwrite remains unresolved. **********The Fed said it would hold a hearing in early February and decide the issue by the end of April. The Fed was responding to an application from three large New York bank holding companies, Citicorp, J. P. Morgan & Company and Bankers Trust, that they be permitted to underwrite commercial paper. The banks also want permission to package and resell municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities and consumer-related loans. **********Bankers took two views of the Fed's action. Morgan said it was ''gravely disappointed'' by the lack of a definitive decision, but Citicorp was more optimistic. It said that ''the issue of bank holding companies' securities and underwriting powers moves ahead significantly with this ruling and the appeals court finding.'' **********Fed officials indicated that they found merit in arguments that the 53-year-old barriers between investment banking and commercial banking were no longer valid. The Fed took the opportunity to make a new plea to Congress to overhaul the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, under which the division between commercial and investment banking was established. **********The Fed's chairman, Paul A. Volcker, in a statement accompanying the decision, said the old law ''urgently needs to be legislatively reviewed and updated.'' **********The Fed's action today ''makes as much good sense as is possible to draw from applying a statute, adopted a half-century ago, to a banking marketplace that technology and other competitive forces have altered in a manner and to an extent never envisioned by the enacting Congress,'' Mr. Volcker said. **********He asked Congress to let banks underwrite commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, revenue bonds and mutual funds. **********The securities industry opposes such changes. Commercial banks generally take deposits from customers and make loans. Investment banks raise funds on behalf of companies for a fee. Usually they do this by buying stocks or bonds from a company and reselling them to investors. Distinction Now Blurred **********In recent years, however, the distinction has become blurred. Short-term lending to businesses, once the mainstay of commercial banks, is now common among securities firms, while commercial banks offer basic securities services such as buying and selling stocks and bonds. **********However, commercial banks cannot underwrite new securities offerings from companies. That means they cannot buy the securities in a block from issuing companies and sell them in smaller denominations to investors through a public offering. **********Lewis T. Preston, Morgan's chairman, in saying the company was ''gravely disappointed'' that the Fed ''has failed to come to a substantive decision on Morgan's application,'' added that ''bank holding companies should be able to choose to pursue opportunities to serve clients by providing clearly appropriate services to diversify their sources of revenue and to strengthen themselves in competing against institutions - United States and foreign - that are less restricted in their business activities than United States commercial banks.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/business/finance-new-issues-296686.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 162, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;", "body_text": " **********The British Government began a $4 billion borrowing program today, the largest issue ever in the international bond market, setting off a hectic morning in the Eurobond market. **********An official at the Treasury said the offering of floating-rate notes due in 10 years was made ''to strengthen Britain's foreign exchange reserves at a time of exchange rate uncertainty.'' **********Although the notes carry one of the lowest interest rates ever seen in the Eurobond market, investor demand was strong enough that the size of the financing was increased from $3 billion.

After the cartoons have taken off, he said, ''then we'll follow up with book publishing and many items of merchandise which will be reaching into the market as early as next year.'' **********Chinese officials immediately put Donald and Mickey in some venerable company.

The golden monkey is a reference to the 16th-century Chinese novel ''Record of a Journey to the West,'' a tale of a monk's travels and magical adventures with demons aided by a wondrous golden monkey. **********Mr. Hong guessed that as many as 30 million children could tune in when Mickey squeaks out his first words in Mandarin. **********Under the agreement between Disney and Chinese television, the company will receive no profits from the showing of the cartoons in China. Instead, each episode will be punctuated by two minutes of advertising for Disney products. Later, Mr. Wells said, other advertisers would also be given access to the limited spots. Trademark Committment **********The company's president also said that he had won a commitment from the Chinese that they would begin enforcing Disney's trademark rights in China. Throughout the major cities of China, dozens of products, from coffee cups to pens, thermometers to children's books, all bearing the likeness of the Disney mouse and duck, are widely available. But none of the products are sold with the blessing of the Disney organization and no royalties are paid. **********Although China does not have a copyright law, it does have a three-year-old trademark law. Given the virtual absence of civil courts and the rarity of lawyers in China, however, it is unclear precisely how Disney could protect its rights. **********Neither Mr. Wells nor Mr. Eisner could explain how Disney would be able either to gain access to China's domestic market or repatriate profits from the sale of any merchandise. Chinese Reluctance **********The Chinese Government has been reluctant to let foreign companies penetrate the domestic market -the very thing that lures many companies here in the first place. And the Government has placed strict controls on foreign companies' ability to send home profits in the form of foreign exchange. **********Many companies that have invested in China have experienced tremendous difficulties in doing business here, and many signed contracts have been abrogated precisely because of companies' inability to generate profits from their ventures. **********These difficulties were brushed aside by the Disney executives.

American scientists speculated at the time that a landslide had dislodged the gas, presumed to have been mostly carbon dioxide. **********''The same thing may have happened at Lake Nios,'' Mrs. Russell-Robinson said, ''but we may never know.'' **********M. Peter McPherson, administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, said at a briefing that the disaster might have been caused by cyanide gas upwelling, bringing gas from the sediments of the lake bottom to the surface. **********But Dr. Joseph Devine, a specialist in volcanic chemistry at Brown University, said he considered carbon dioxide to be the most probable cause. Dr. Devine, who will be part of the American investigating team, said the cause would be speculative until water samples could be drawn from the lake. **********Scientists said that seismic activity had been reported recently in the Lake Nios area, and that a minor earthquake might have caused the upwelling of gases. The lake is in a volcanic crater with steep sides, on which a landslide, once started, could gain momentum and disturb the lake bottom. **********Dr. Anderson theorized that magma, or molten rock, underlying the lake might have warmed the water to cause upwelling. The gas might then have spread over a wider area. **********Scientists tended to discount the idea that hydrogen sulfide had been the principal agent. The gas is poisonous if inhaled in large doses, but its stench is so powerful that concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in air are often overestimated by people relying on smell. **********''One can smell the rotten-egg odor of hydrogen sulfide even at a level of only one part per million,'' Mrs. Russell-Robinson said, ''and the victims of lake gas or volcanic asphyxiation often assume that hydrogen sulfide was the killer. In fact, carbon dioxide, which comes up from lake upwellings and from volcanic vents along with hydrogen sulfide, is odorless, and it is often present at much more dangerous levels.'' **********Carbon dioxide is heavier than air and therefore hugs the ground and disperses slowly. High concentrations of the gas can kill; for example, brewery workers have died after entering fermentation vats filled with carbon dioxide. Gas Poisoning Not Uncommon **********Gas poisoning of volcanic origin has been reported at least since the time of the Roman rhetorician Lucius Annaeus Seneca, whose writings described the asphyxiation of sheep on the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius in the year 62 A.D. **********The most serious recent volcanic poisoning occurred in 1979, when carbon dioxide the Dieng volcano in Java took 142 lives. Casualties from volcanic gases are fairly common. **********Although carbon dioxide is probably the most common threat, other gases may also pose hazards. Methane, which can asphyxiate by excluding oxygen from the lungs, is produced by decaying vegetation. Volcanic vents may also produce carbon monoxide, an active poison that destroys the ability of blood to pick up oxygen from the air. Volcanic gases occasionally contain traces of hydrogen cyanide, another potent blood poison. **********The American investigators intend to identify the causes of death of the victims, thereby narrowing the field of geological inquiry."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/business/hotel-chain-rebuffs-trafalgar-bid.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 533, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "HOTEL CHAIN REBUFFS TRAFALGAR BID", "print_headline": "HOTEL CHAIN REBUFFS TRAFALGAR BID", "body_text": " **********Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the English conglomerate that purchased the Intercontinental hotel chain five years ago from Pan American World Airways, said it had rejected a $900 million cash offer for its hotel interests from Trafalgar Holdings Ltd. **********Trafalgar, an investment firm in Los Angeles headed by Charles W.

Prestowitz, counselor to the Secretary of Commerce, has been the chief coordinator on issues related to Japan and has built a reputation as one of the sternest critics of Japanese trading policy. **********Before joining the Administration, Mr. Prestowitz was a graduate student at Keio University in Tokyo, worked for multinational companies and started his own international consulting company. **********He has announced that he is leaving his post to join the Woodrow Wilson Center of the Smithsonian Institution and do some writing and lecturing. Q. What is the source of the Japan frictions? A. The U.S. is the world's leading industrial and technological power, and Japan is second. Japan has been reducing the U.S. lead and has overcome it in some areas. That inevitably brings frictions, which both sides have been struggling to contain. **********Q. Will we ever get back into any kind of equilibrium in our trading with Japan? **********A. I think it's going to be a long time before we have balanced trade with Japan. I think for the foreseeable future we will have very large deficits. Q. Is this politically acceptable?  A. We have an enormous deficit with Canada. We have a big deficit with almost everybody. We have frictions with Canada and the European Community, but they are not of the same nature as frictions with Japan. The difference is that American business feels that it can more or less compete in Canada on the same basis, but business does not have that feeling in Japan. This has given rise to dangerous protectionist pressures on the Hill. **********Q. How much of the $50 billion United States deficit with Japan is unfair trade? **********A. I don't like to discuss it in terms of fair or unfair. The problem is that the nature of Japanese society is very different from American society. It's not that the Japanese are trying to cheat. It's that they have a differently structured economy and society, making it difficult to penetrate. **********Q. Does the ''Ron-Yasu'' relationship (between President Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone) help or hurt in trade? **********A. In the States you often hear that the Ron-Yasu relationship has worked to the disadvantage of the United States. But in Tokyo the complaint is the other way around. When things are being criticized from both sides, they're probably not so bad. **********Q. Will the trade deficit be helped by the revaluation of the yen? **********A. I have been in the camp of those who believe that the other structural factors are at least as important as the exchange rate. Other nations have the same problems with the Japanese as we do. And the yen has not been out of whack with those other currencies, as it has with the dollar. They're more bitter than we are. Q. What impact has the rising yen had?  A. Statistics indicate that Japanese exports are still increasing and imports are down. The real crunch on the Japanese is not so much lost market share as lost profits. **********Q. What are the effects of the network of well-placed lobbyists, many of them former American officials, who work for Japan? **********A. The Japanese know the results of Cabinet meetings and interagency meetings almost instantly. The reason I know that is that on many occasions after attending such meetings I come back to my office only to receive telephone calls from the Japanese Embassy and they had recited to me almost verbatim the discussion I just attended. They are extremely well informed and that puts them in a position to influence our debates in their direction, and we do not have that capability to nearly the same extent in Japan. **********Q. Should we be threatening to ban imports from Japan to pry open markets? **********A. I hesitate saying we ought to ban imports. The question is what do you want to get. In any negotiation there are carrots and sticks. Once you have determined what your objective is then you want to have a few carrots and a few sticks and use a judicious mix of those to get your objective. So in some cases where our interests are being threatened by unfair trade activity, then I think it's legitimate to contemplate strong measures."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/business/us-petroleum-data.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "print_headline": "U.S. Petroleum Data", "body_text": " **********In millions of barrels except refinery utilization"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/world/bonner-fails-to-reach-moscow-as-she-pledged.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 280, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bonner Fails to Reach Moscow as She Pledged", "print_headline": "Bonner Fails to Reach Moscow as She Pledged", "body_text": " **********Yelena G.

All of the workers are nonwhite. **********The company, Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining concern, said it would not rehire those it had dismissed and would dismiss the remaining 10,000 workers if they did not return to their jobs on Tuesday. **********The mine affected by the strike, specialists said, yields about one-fifth of the platinum available to non-Communist countries. **********The miners, most of whom are not represented by a union, work in the nominally independent so-called ''tribal homeland'' of Bophuthatswana. South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers, the country's biggest and most powerful labor union, is not recognized in the homeland and therefore may not become embroiled in the dispute. Stoppage Began Jan. 1 **********The dismissals fitted a pattern in labor relations in South African mines, in which the law has allowed employers to dismiss strikers engaged in wildcat and some other stoppages. **********The mass dismissal seemed to further erode the so-called homeland's credibility, since it showed that labor practices that apply in South Africa also are in force in a fragmented chunk of land that Pretoria calls independent and black-ruled. **********The stoppage, at Gencor's Impala mine in Bophuthatswana, was called over wages and working conditions and began Jan. 1. Bophuthatswana is one of 10 so-called tribal homelands within South Africa's traditional frontiers. Along with Ciskei, Transkei and Venda, it is one of four to have accepted nominal independence from Pretoria. **********Gencor is an abbreviation for the General Mining Union Corporation, which is controlled by Afrikaans business interests. Mass Dismissals Common **********Mass dismissal of recalcitrant workers is common in South Africa. Last year, the Anglo American Corporation, the country's biggest mining company, dismissed 14,000 black workers at a gold mine west of Johannesburg. Later, however, it said it had rehired most of them. **********Such tactics are viewed by management figures as a way of weeding out particularly militant mine workers. **********At a news conference in Johannesburg today, Gary Maude, the acting chief executive at the mine affected by the strike, said that all but a few hundred workers employed there were on strike. **********The stoppage, he said, would affect production at the Impala mine significantly, but he declined to give further details. **********Mr. Maude said he believed that, with many black mine workers unemployed in Bophuthatswana, his company hoped to find replacements for those workers who had been dismissed. Many Are Migrant Workers **********Two-thirds of the work force at the Impala mine are said to be of Tswana ethnic descent. Therefore, under the laws of racial and tribal distinction underlying apartheid, they are deemed to be citizens of Bophuthatswana. **********Throughout South Africa the law stipulates that no more than 3 percent of a mine's labor force may live with their families close to a mine, so migrant laborers comprise 97 percent of the work force. **********In Bophuthatswana, specialists said, the homeland authorities have proposed more liberal labor laws but these have yet to become law. **********Black labor unions have been legal in South Africa since 1979, but their jurisdiction does not always extend to the so-called homelands. Some of the impetus behind the legalizaton of black unions came from mining companies such as Anglo American and others, which argue that tranquil labor relations can only be assured if the employers can address their employees as a coherent body. Poor Communication Cited **********At his news conference today, Mr. Maude acknowledged that part of the problem that had led to the mass dismissal was poor communications between workers and the management. **********''We would like to be able to deal with a representative trade union,'' he said. **********The creation of such a body, specialists said, is made difficult by Bophuthatswana's labor laws, which do not permit unregistered unions to compete for membership with established unions in individual industries. **********Edwill Phosisi, the leader of Bophuthatswana's National Union of Mine Employees, which represents only a few of the Bophuthatswana mine workers, said he would seek a commission of inquiry into black miners' allegations that they had been assaulted by whites. **********Throughout South Africa, white miners enjoy the nation's last employment privileges that are based on race and also enshrined in law, since black mine workers are not allowed to hold the blasting certificates that would enable them to prime explosives underground and thus compete for more lucrative work."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/business/cd-fund-returns-are-mixed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 401, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "C.D., Fund Returns Are Mixed", "print_headline": "C.D., Fund Returns Are Mixed", "body_text": " **********Average yields for six-month certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds moved higher for the week ended yesterday, while the average yield for bank money market accounts slipped lower. **********According to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index, the average yield for a six-month certificate of deposit was 7.64 percent, up one basis point from 7.63 percent last week.

But the decisions are still being made, and the report may be delayed a few days, the officials working on it said. **********''It is an extremely contentious issue, and is still being decided,'' one Administration official said. **********Publication of the report will serve notice on such nations as Spain, Portugal, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Jordan and Oman that their military assistance in the fiscal year 1987 will be cut by hundreds of millions of dollars from the 1986 levels. **********Deciding which nation's loans and grants to trim has confronted the State Department and the Defense Department with painful choices, the officials said. Either small amounts of available cash must be shared sparingly among recipients, including some nations accustomed to generosity, or some nations must be excluded entirely from military assistance. **********The decision has been looming since Congress last month cut the Administration's foreign aid budget request by more than $1.6 billion, granting only about $4.9 billion for military aid in the fiscal year 1987, which began Oct. 1. **********Despite the reductions, Congress set aside, for specific nations, nearly $4.3 billion of the total. Israel, for example, was assured $1.8 billion, Egypt $1.3 billion, and Turkey, Pakistan and Greece hundreds of millions each. **********The only way to provide substantial aid to nations not earmarked for assistance, the officials said, would be to exercise special authority contained in the law to disregard Congressional instructions and shift aid from those five countries to other nations. **********That is unlikely, one Administration official said. The Administration thinks Turkey and Pakistan deserve more aid. Politically, it is thought unfeasible to cut Greek aid without cutting Turkish aid. Reductions in aid to Israel and Egypt are considered out of the question for political reasons. Some Allies Must Sacrifice **********With several less favored nations qualifying for some amount of aid next year, and a few major countries seeking hundreds of millions each, it was clear that some allies would be asked to sacrifice. **********When it became evident last summer that Congress, while preserving aid to Israel, Egypt and a few other large recipients, would sharply trim foreign aid in general as a way of saving money in an election year without offending domestic constituents, the State Department objected strongly. Today, a senior Administration official said the situation had put severe strains on relations with close allies. **********Among the worst repercussions of the cuts, Government officials specializing in foreign aid said, would be the effects in such countries as Spain and Portugal, which rely on the assistance as compensation for providing military bases for American forces stationed overseas. **********Spain, for example, would have got $400 million in foreign military sales credits, which are low-interest loans for the purchase of American weapons, under the Reagan budget request. Portugal was to receive $66.5 million in loans, along with $75 million in direct grants under the related military assistance program. Concern on U.S. Bases Abroad **********Spain is about to resume negotiations with the United States over the renewal of agreements governing several United States bases there, including the naval base at Rota and three main air bases. The current agreement expires in 1988. As part of the agreement, the United States has pledged to ''use its best efforts'' to assist Spain's military development, in part by offering military credits. **********Similar pledges were made to Portugal for its continued permission for use of bases in the Azores until 1991. **********According to a recent report by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, ''Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey have expected increasing American security assistance in return for contuinued use of host country military facilties.'' **********The report, by Richard F. Grimmett, a researcher at the Library of Congress, said that ''a fundamental problem'' had been that the Administration, regardless of promises to members of the Atlantic alliance that provide bases, cannot bind the Congress to approve military aid. Effect on NATO Host Countries **********''If U.S. security assistance is sharply reduced for more than a short period of time, the supporters of close military ties with the United States in some of these NATO host countries may have their positions notably weakened,'' the report said. **********Other nations with close security ties to the United States, or with whom the State Department would like to cultivate such ties, would have to be frozen out of military aid to fund Spain and Portugal at full levels."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/business/pact-set-on-polish-debt.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 27, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Pact Set on Polish Debt", "print_headline": "Pact Set on Polish Debt", "body_text": " **********Polish authorities and Western bankers have signed an agreement for rescheduling more than $2 billion in debts due this year and next year."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/world/synagogue-victims-mourned-at-rites.html": {"writer_name": "Henry Kamm", "pub_date": "1986-09-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 655, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SYNAGOGUE VICTIMS MOURNED AT RITES", "print_headline": "SYNAGOGUE VICTIMS MOURNED AT RITES", "body_text": " **********In Neve Shalom Synagogue, which still bears the stains and scars of a massacre last Saturday, a funeral service was held today for its 21 victims.

They were said to have been refugees from Iran. **********The heavily guarded ceremony was attended by Interior Minister Yildirim Akbulut, and wreaths were sent by President Kenan Evren and Prime Minister Turgut Ozal.

Mr. Fituri is being held on charges of smuggling a gun into Italy. Arrest Warrant Issued **********Italy also issued an international arrest warrant against another former Libyan diplomat, Mussbah Mahmud Werfalli, who left here last year. **********Among the European Community countries, Italy has the most extensive relations with Libya, a former colony. Trade between the two countries totals about $4 billion, and Italy is the leading importer of Libyan oil. Because of the close economic ties between the two countries, Italy has opposed broad economic sanctions. **********According to the Foreign Ministry, there are 46 Libyan diplomats in Italy, 39 in Rome and seven divided between consulates in Milan and Palermo. The Prime Minister's office said last week that a total of 71 Libyans enjoyed some form of diplomatic status, a figure that includes spouses. **********The Foreign Ministry statement said Italy was also considering a reduction in its diplomatic force in Libya, which serves about 3,000 Italians there. The sharp reduction in the number of Italians in Libya - some 4,000 to 5,000 have left in recent months - will make it easier for Italy to reduce its Libyan ties.

He is the point man in her effort to lead the party to three consecutive general election victories, something none of her predecessors achieved. **********When the party is in the mood for a confident affirmation of Thatcherite values, Mr. Tebbit is seen as her natural successor as leader. When it starts feeling nostalgic for a more traditional kind of Tory leader - with a congenially fuzzy ideological stance and a softer way of putting things - Mr. Tebbit's stock falls. **********Recently the Tory chairman, who remains a senior member of the Cabinet with the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, has been taking his raps. The Times of London published a survey indicating that only 16 percent of the new Conservative members of the House of Commons elected in 1983 would back him in a leadership contest, compared with 52 percent when a similar survey was taken last year. After local election reverses, Cabinet colleagues sniped at him anonymously in background chats with Westminster political correspondents who duly registered Mr. Tebbit's decline. Seen as Lacking 'Class' **********Very occasionally the sort of reservations that may be expressed in dinner-table conversation break into print, as when Peregrine Worsthorne, the editor of The Sunday Telegraph, wrote with self-acknowledged snobbery that the Tory chairman had failed to be polished by a ''socializing process'' that turns self-made men into gentlemen. **********''He lacks that desirable touch of class,'' the editor wrote in reference to a politician whose route to the upper reaches of his party bypassed Oxford and Cambridge and went through the cockpits of what was still called the British Overseas Airways Corporation, where he worked as a pilot. **********Criticism of Mr. Tebbit seldom mentions his role as a lightning rod for the Prime Minister. But among the political judgments there is usually a question left dangling by anonymous sources about whether he has ever really recovered emotionally or physically from the trauma of the Irish Republican Army bombing at a party conference in Brighton in 1984, in which he suffered intestinal and leg injuries and his wife was made a paraplegic. **********In an interview at the party office, a short walk from Parliament, Mr. Tebbit dealt in a polished manner with the charge that he lacked polish. ''There is still a thread in English political life,'' he said, ''that expects the Conservative Party to be what it was years ago, and is struck with horror at the idea that the Duke of Devonshire is a supporter of the Social Democrats.'' **********''I've never taken that view,'' he said. ''The Duke of Devonshire doesn't even have one vote. Peers can't vote -peers and lunatics and convicted criminals in jail.'' **********Mr. Tebbit was not dismissing a particular duke so much as people who are impressed by dukes and all the shibboleths of class. 'Unashamedly Partisan' **********''I'm an unashamedly partisan politician and I believe in putting my point quite firmly and strongly,'' he said, addressing the further charge that he is too confrontational to suit many Tories. **********It was true, he acknowledged, that he once called Michael Foot, the former Labor Party leader, a fascist. ''But there are not many cases like that,'' he said. ''I play the game according to Hoyle, unless I notice the other guy is using a different set of rules. Then I play his rules.'' **********His deep-set eyes and bony physiognomy make him a target for caricaturists who show him in guises ranging from that of a leather-jacketed thug to a 17th-century Puritan. Speaking in an accent that Britons would type as belonging to a suburban salesman or trade union official, not a plummy Tory pooh-bah, he regularly inveighs against permissiveness. But he avoids pious poses. Asked by the writer John Mortimer whether he felt he had come close to God in his close brush with death in Brighton, he replied in a dry manner. **********''I would have to say quite honestly that I haven't met Him yet,'' he said. He also isn't jumping ''on a bandwagon to ban page three of the Sun,'' he said, referring to the most popular feature of Britain's best-selling tabloid, a large photo of a cheerfully unclad damsel. **********Asked whether the Brighton injuries had affected his stamina or his appetite for politics, the 55-year-old party chairman made a point of not seeming to claim that he had been ennobled or tempered by suffering. ''I've been able to get in an average 12- or 14-hour day six days a week, so I think as far as stamina goes, that's still there. I still love winning. I have a distinct aversion to losing.'' **********His gaze seemed only slightly more watchful as he took up the question of whether the experience had affected his character. ''No, no,'' he said. ''Let's face it. It is the sort of experience which lots of other people have had. An awful lot of people had that sort of experience between 1939 and '45.'' An Eye for Foes' Weaknesses **********Mr. Tebbit believes his party's greatest asset with the voters is the liabilities of its opponents. The voters may be tired of the Tories, he acknowledges, but that is because they haven't yet been made to concentrate on the defense policy of the Labor Party, which promises the removal of American nuclear weapons from Britain and ''the collapse of NATO,'' or on divisions in the Social Democratic-Liberal alliance, the would-be third force in British politics. **********Has Mrs. Thatcher ceased to be an asset to her party with the voters? Mr. Tebbit offered a professional's cool and guarded judgment instead of a partisan's lauding. ''That doesn't have to be true,'' he said, adding that it all depended on how clearly the Government was seen to be working on a well-defined program toward well-defined goals. **********Like Neil Kinnock, the Labor Party leader, Mr. Tebbit professes to see no possibility of a coalition government after the next election. ''What is required for the health of the British system is a government in office and a credible alternative government in waiting. That's the essential of the British parliamentary system,'' he said. **********He predicted that the next election, due in 1987 or early 1988, will force a realignment in the left-of-center parties, dispelling the uncertainties bred by three-party politics. He noted that only one thing has to happen for his forecast to come true: The Tories have to win. ''I'll put my money on it,'' the chairman said. ''Indeed, I suppose I already have.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/business/patents-a-device-to-prevent-oars-getting-loose.html": {"writer_name": "Stacy Jones", "pub_date": "1986-11-22", "snippet": "An oarlock that keeps oars safely in place on rowboats is the subject of patent 4,623,315, granted this week.", "word_count": 97, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PATENTS;\nA Device to Prevent Oars Getting Loose", "print_headline": "PATENTS;\nA Device to Prevent Oars Getting Loose", "body_text": " **********An oarlock that keeps oars safely in place on rowboats is the subject of patent 4,623,315, granted this week. **********The inventor is Christopher E.

We, too, want to negotiate seriously. We, too, think an arms control agreement is possible before the end of the President's term. We intend to pursue vigorously our discussions with the Soviets.'' **********In the view of some American specialists on the Soviet Union, the Russians are aware of President Reagan's commitment to the space-based defense program, which is known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly as ''Star Wars.'' Shulman Sees No Insincerity **********Marshall D. Shulman, a former adviser on Soviet affairs in the Carter Administration, said of the Russians: **********''They are conscious of the fact that the President has a thing about S.D.I. They are aware of the depth of his commitment to it.'' **********Therefore, he said, the Soviet Union may be trying to find a compromise that will allow an arms reduction agreement to take shape, limit research and ''enable the President to say he is not backing away from S.D.I.'' **********Mr. Shulman, who recently retired as director of Columbia University's Harriman Institute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union, said he would not interpret the failure of Soviet negotiators to put forward a specific proposal at Geneva as evidence of insincerity. **********He said that the Soviet Union had come to regard the Geneva talks as ineffective. Moreover, in his view, the Russians want something in return for their suggestions of flexibility, and are waiting for the United States to indicate a willingness to compromise. **********''They say they have never had any inquiry from the Administration on the hints of flexibility,'' Mr. Shulman said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/06/business/executives.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-05-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 35, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "print_headline": "EXECUTIVES", "body_text": " *********** Bristol-Myers Co. announced that Robert J.

The House committee, which will contain 15 lawmakers, will not be announced until Jan. 6, when the new Congress meets. **********Senator Byrd said in an interview tonight that ''nobody knows'' who his choice would be. ''Any public speculation about the leading candidate is not productive,'' he said. ''It's not fair to any senator, and it's not fair to me. I'm going to make that choice.'' **********Mr. Byrd added that he would pick a panel that ''will be tough, that will be fair, and that will reflect well on the institution.'' **********''I'm not out to make a President or break a President,'' he said. Served on Watergate Panel **********Senator Inouye, 62 years old, is a favorite in part because he is a former prosecutor who served on the panel that looked into the Watergate scandal in 1973. He served for a time as head of the Senate intelligence panel. **********In addition, he is close to Senator Byrd and holds the No. 3 job in the party leadership. He has frequently been mentioned as a candidate for Democratic leader, but he has declined to challenge Mr. Byrd for the post. **********Other potential candidates for the chairmanship of the Senate panel include George J.

A candidate for the Austrian presidency, Mr. Waldheim, who was the United Nations chief from 1972 to 1982, has vigorously denied any involvement in atrocities during the war. U.N. File Studied **********After the recent disclosure of details of Mr. Waldheim's war record, the Office of Special Investigations was granted access this month to a United Nations War Crimes Commission file on Mr. Waldheim. Mr. Sher's office is responsible for tracking down and deporting Nazi war criminals. **********Parts of the report were made available to a reporter by a former Justice Department official. **********In the report, Mr. Sher urged that ''Waldheim's name should be entered on the I.N.S. watch list,'' a list maintained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of deportable aliens. **********Mr. Sher asserted that war records showed Mr. Waldheim was a ''special missions staff officer in the Intelligence and Counterintelligence branch'' of the German Army's Group E, which was involved in reprisals against civilians in the Balkans. The army group was commanded by Gen. Alexander Lohr, who was hanged for war crimes in 1947. Mr. Waldheim has denied being a member of the counterintelligence service, known as the Abwehr. 'No Mean Feat' **********According to war records, Mr. Sher said, Mr. Waldheim obtained ''03'' status. This, he said, ''meant that Waldheim was the third highest-ranking special missions officer on General Lohr's staff, no mean feat for a young lieutenant.'' **********Officials said Mr. Sher's report was being considered by prosecutors in the Justice Department's criminal division, which oversees the special investigations unit. Officials cautioned that the report had not been approved by Stephen S. Trott, the head of the criminal division. **********If Mr. Trott forwards the recommendation, it would have to be reviewed by both D. Lowell Jensen, the Deputy Attorney General, and by Mr. Meese, one official said. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the report was ''at least days away'' from being sent to Mr. Meese. **********The recommendation ''certainly does not represent department policy,'' the official said. **********The department issued a statement today saying that ''no conclusions have been reached, nor has any review taken place at any decision-making level'' about Mr. Waldheim's status. Patrick Korten, a department spokesman, said reports that Mr. Meese had already decided to bar Mr. Waldheim from the United States were ''flatly untrue.'' **********Earlier this week, President Rudolf Kirchschlager of Austria said documents about Mr. Waldheim's wartime activities showed that he must have been aware of German reprisals against partisans in the Balkans. **********But the President said the documents offered no substantiation for other charges, such as that Mr. Waldheim took part in war crimes or knew about the deportation of Greek Jews to Nazi death camps.

Boesky, whose interests included a British investment fund, came just a few days after Geoffrey Collier, a former top stock trader at a leading London merchant bank, was forced to resign for improperly using confidential information for personal trades. **********The two cases have focused attention on the long-neglected problem of insider trading in Britain. Many here claim that the Collier case was merely the ''tip of the iceberg.'' and that the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to catch a big-time operator like Mr. Boesky shows the need to replace Britain's system of largely self-regulation with an American-style independent watchdog agency. **********In the past, the London securities market was a series of cottage industries, in which competition was restricted and job-hopping was rare. But the Oct. 27 burst of deregulation - the so-called Big Bang - has created a freewheeling environment that some say makes self-regulation almost impossible. **********''Under the old cartel arrangements, there may have been a case for self-regulation,'' said Ian Cooper, a professor at the London Business School. ''But now there has been a fundamental change in the London market that strengthens the case for an independent regulatory group.'' **********Moreover, a key part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's drive to make Britain a land of ''people's capitalism'' has been to increase the number of individual shareholders, partly through a program of selling off state-owned enterprises to the public. Since 1979, when Mrs. Thatcher took office, the number of British individuals directly owning shares has jumped from 1.8 million to nearly 6 million. **********In short, the old clubbish days when the City of London, the square-mile financial district here, was a preserve of the British elite are long gone. The domestic securities market has been opened up to foreign firms and to the British public. Accordingly, the regulation of the City takes on a wider significance as well. **********Insider trading became a criminal offense in Britain only six years ago. As recently as the 1970's, insider trading was regarded as one of the fringe benefits of working in the City. **********And since 1980, there have been only six prosecutions and four convictions of insider-trading cases by Britain's Department of Trade and Industry, though the stock exchange has referred about 100 instances of suspicious price movements to the Government. Those caught have been penny ante culprits, company directors and secretaries, trading on advance information of takeovers for a few thousand dollars' profit. Punishment has been lenient, mainly modest fines. In the most recent conviction last April, Maurice Naerger, former director of W.H. Smith & Son Ltd., a book and newspaper marketer, was fined about $1,300 for trading on advance information on a takeover bid involving his company. His profit on the illicit transaction was $4,200. **********Even Mr. Collier, former head of stock trading for Morgan Grenfell & Company, seems a small-time and unsophisticated operator compared with Mr. Boesky. Mr. Collier was caught within a few days of making an estimated $22,000 profit using confidential information on a takeover deal; Mr. Boesky made $50 million and it took months of investigation to nab him. **********The available evidence indicates that insider dealing in Britain may well be widespread. Acquisitions Monthly, a trade journal, found that in 19 of 78 takeovers it tracked this year, the price of the target companies' stock jumped by more than 20 percent in the month before a bid was announced. **********''Insider trading is rampant,'' said Philip Healey, the editor of Acquisitions Monthly. ''And the sooner we get an S.E.C.-type organization staffed by outside professionals, the better for everyone.'' **********The main stimulus to insider trading in Britain, as in America, has apparently been the explosive growth in takeover activity. In Britain, the value of announced bids so far this year has been more than $40 billion, far ahead of last year's record of $11.7 billion, according to Acquisitions Monthly. With a fast-growing community of bankers, brokers, lawyers and other advisers involved in the takeover field, the temptation of trying to make a quick profit with inside information is greater than ever before. **********Those familiar with the London markets are critical of Britain's policing of insider dealing. ''The record of prosecuting insider trading in Britain has been lamentable,'' said Jonathan Agnew, chief executive of the International Securities Regulatory Organization, a group of mainly foreign securities firms with operations in London. **********Like others, Mr. Agnew stressed the need for Britain to gain access to information in countries with banking-secrecy laws, including Switzerland, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. He noted that the S.E.C. detected Mr. Boesky's insider trading after catching the former investment banker Dennis Levine, whose illicit activities were in turn tracked by the American regulators through foreign bank accounts. **********In fact, the British department of trade has been holding discussions in recent months with nations that have banking-secrecy provisions, and in September it signed an information-sharing agreement with the United States, which has been helpful in examining the activities of British firms linked to Mr. Boesky. Moreover, British investigators are hopeful that legislation taking effect next year will improve their lackluster record of prosecutions. Then they should be free to pursue civil cases against insider trading, as the S.E.C. does. Civil actions require less hard-to-obtain proof of insider dealing for conviction than criminal actions. **********''We're hoping that will give us the freedom to prosecute more effectively without the need to build up a much larger bureaucracy like the S.E.C.,'' a British Government official said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/22/business/reindictment-sought.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 101, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Reindictment Sought", "print_headline": "Reindictment Sought", "body_text": " **********A deputy United States attorney said today that he would press for a reindictment of a former Continental Illinois Corportion executive on bank and wire fraud charges.

Brezhnev and President Nixon in Moscow in May 1972 after four years of negotiations. **********The ABM Treaty, which restricts research and deployment of antimissile systems, was ratified by the Senate. It is of indefinite duration and is still in effect. The treaty's provisions were tightened in a 1974 protocol. **********The philosophy behind the agreement was that defenses against intercontinental ballistic missiles needed to be limited to make it easier to achieve restrictions on offensive arms. Otherwise, it was reasoned, each side would try to increase its arsenal so that it could overwhelm the other side's defenses. **********These were among the key provisions: *********** Each nation was limited to one antimissile defense of one site, either the capital or elsewhere, to protect a missile field. *********** A limit of 100 was placed on the number of ABM launchers and interceptors at each nation's site. *********** Restrictions were placed on the development, testing and deployment of ABM systems. The treaty, for example, states that each side will not develop, test or deploy systems that are based in space, on airplanes, at sea or that are mobile systems based on land. The 1979 Arms Pact **********This comprehensive treaty emerged after the second series of strategic arms limitation talks, known as SALT II, and was signed in Vienna in 1979 by Mr. Brezhnev and President Carter. It set limits on the number of launchers for land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles and heavy bombers. It only indirectly limits the number of missile warheads. **********Although this treaty was not ratified after Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in late 1979, and it would technically have expired in December 1985, the two sides pledged not to undercut it as long as the other side observed its provisions. Washington has been accusing Moscow of not adhering to some of the treaty terms, and Moscow has denied this. President Reagan said recently that, in view of the purported Soviet actions, the United States would no longer be bound by the treaty. **********These were among its key provisions: *********** A ceiling of 1,320 on the number of launchers for missiles with multiple warheads and bombers armed with cruise missiles. *********** A ceiling of 1,200 on the number of launchers for missiles with multiple warheads. *********** A ceiling of 820 on the number of launchers for multiple-warhead land-based missiles. *********** An effective limit on the number of warheads on current missile types to the number already tested. *********** A ban on production and testing of a new type of ''heavy'' land-based missile. *********** A measure that restricts each side to the development of only one type of land-based missile. **********The 1972 interim agreement on the limitation of offensive arms was essentially a freeze on the number of missile launchers for land-based and submarine-based missiles. It was ratified and was to remain in effect for five years while the Soviet Union and the United States tried to work out the more comprehensive treaty on strategic arms limitation that was signed in 1979. **********The interim accord froze the number of missile launchers at 2,347 for the Soviet Union and 1,710 for the United States. The agreement did not prohibit the placing of multiple warheads on missiles and did not limit heavy bombers. Therefore, it left the United States with a lead in the total number of weapons. **********The expiration date of the agreement was 1977, but both sides pledged to keep abiding by the agreement's provisions as long as the other did. **********President Reagan recently decided that decisions on nuclear arms would in the future be guided by the United States' military needs and no longer by what he described as the flawed provisions of 1979 treaty."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/02/business/building-spending-rises-1.1.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-10-02", "snippet": "", "word_count": 364, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BUILDING SPENDING RISES 1.1%", "print_headline": "BUILDING SPENDING RISES 1.1%", "body_text": " **********Construction spending, powered by healthy increases in single-family homes and nonresidential building, jumped 1.1 percent in August for the fastest rise since April, the Commerce Department reported today. **********Building activity climbed to an annual rate of $382.2 billion in August, 8.2 percent ahead of the level a year before, the department said. **********But analysts cautioned that the building boom would soon end, a victim of high vacancy rates for offices and apartments and the adverse investment effects of the new tax law. **********'There Is a Glut' **********''There is a glut of private office space on the market,'' said Doug Handler, an economist with Wharton Econometrics.

The officials said that would be disastrous to American interests. **********But after the revelations of the last six weeks about secret arms sales to Iran, the latest disclosure was widely viewed as having further damaged the credibility of the Administration's claim to be neutral in the war. **********A Lesser Violation Is Seen **********The officials, in effect confirming the outline of a report today in The Washington Post, said that while the intelligence sharing may have skirted the Administration policy, it was not as much of a violation of the policy as the shipment of arms to Iran. The shipments occurred over the last 18 months while the United States was seeking a worldwide arms embargo against Iran. **********It was unclear whether the sharing of intelligence with Iraq would continue now that it has been disclosed. **********Officials said the United States had two major objectives in the Persian Gulf war - to bring it to an end as soon as possible, and to do so without a clear winner or loser. They acknowledged that this policy could be interpreted as contradictory, since by helping Iraq with intelligence to avoid defeat, it was in effect prolonging the war. No Change in Policy **********Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said today that the United States policy was essentially unchanged. **********''We seek the earliest possible end to the war, without victor or vanquished, and with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both Iran and Iraq intact,'' he said. ''To that end we welcome constructive diplomatic efforts for a settlement. We don't sell arms to either side, nor do we allow transfers by others of U.S.-sourced or licensed arms to either side.'' **********''We actively discourage shipments of arms from any source to Iran, which remains the intransigent party in the war,'' Mr. Redman added. ''Iraq, on the other hand, has indicated its willingness to cooperate with various efforts to bring the war to a negotiated or mediated end.'' **********His statement was consistent with President Reagan's reaffirmation, after the American arms shipments to Iran were disclosed, that the United States will try to prevent the supply of arms to Teheran. Policy Set in 1983 **********The American policy, set in 1983, has benefited Iraq because the United States has not tried to dissuade France or the Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms suppliers, from selling arms to Baghdad. At the same time, the United States urged others not to sell arms to Iran. **********Iraq has not asked for arms from the United States, officials said, because it can buy all it needs from the Soviet Union and France. **********The Iraqis have complained about the American sales to Iran, but not react as strongly as some officials here expected. Some of the officials indicated that the muted reaction might have been due in part to the intelligence-sharing arrangement. **********The Iraqi Ambassador to the United States, Nizar Hamdoon, said in an interview today that the intelligence sharing was ''a very sensitive matter.'' **********''I really cannot comment on it for the simple reason that we don't comment on our contacts with other governments,'' he said. ''It's very sensitive, and we are in no position to discuss such matters.'' **********A senior White House official said the American policy toward Iraq was intended not to create a stalemate in the war, but ''to bring about a cease-fire and eventually a settlement.'' 'A Great Destabilizing Effect' **********''Everyone understands that a victory by Iraq is unlikely,'' he said, ''because they have much smaller manpower resources. On the other hand, a victory by Iran could have a great destabilizing effect on the region.'' **********''I don't think it's in anybody's interest, any country in the world, to have either side win,'' he said. **********American officials have refused to provide all-out backing to Iraq for fear that if Iran were threatened with defeat, it might seek Soviet help. **********The White House official said the arms sold by the United States to Iran were worth $12.2 million - a tiny share, he said, of arms sold to Iran by various suppliers in the last six years, which he valued at $35 billion. **********''Our sales to Iran have had no meaningful impact on the outcome of the war,'' he said. Recently, another Administration official said Iran had been sold more than $9 billion worth of weapons by various suppliers during the same period. Sharing Is Called Limited **********Officials said the sharing of intelligence with Iraq was limited and was meant to alert the Iraqis primarily to large-scale ground buildups by the Iranians, who have been threatening an all-out attack for two years. **********''Because we could see the fact that Iran at various times clearly had the upper hand, and had the manpower to continue much further than Iraq could,'' the American assistance was necessary, he said. **********The intelligence sharing has been conducted primarily through the American military attache in Baghdad, and began after the two countries re-established formal diplomatic relations in November 1984, officials said. **********In late 1983, they said, a National Security Council study concluded that an Iranian victory would be a major setback to American interests, given the fear that pro-Western states in the region like Saudi Arabia would feel endangered. After the establishment of relations with Iraq, the United States began providing satellite photo reconnaissance to Iraq, the officials said. Concern Grows in Washington **********Earlier this year, concern in Washington was heightened by the Iranian breakthrough at Fao, inside Iraq. In April, Vice President Bush visited four countries in the region and affirmed the Administration's determination to keep the Persian Gulf open. He said the United States had ''common security objectives'' with the Persian Gulf countries, and he pledged to help them combat aggression. **********One official said he thought the Iraqis were also receiving information from the airborne early-warning system, known as Awacs, provided to Saudi Arabia. When the planes were first sold to Saudi Arabia in 1981, the Reagan Administration assured Israel's supporters that no third country would receive information from the Awacs, that it would be shared only by Saudi Arabia and the United States. **********State Department officials said that unlike the sale of arms to Iran, the intelligence sharing with Iraq was carried out with the department's knowledge.

Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, has met with Iraqi officials in this country, they said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/18/world/an-inquiry-into-election-violence-awaits-the-end-of-the-game.html": {"writer_name": "Francis Clines", "pub_date": "1986-02-18", "snippet": "", "word_count": 821, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "AN INQUIRY INTO ELECTION VIOLENCE AWAITS THE END OF THE GAME", "print_headline": "AN INQUIRY INTO ELECTION VIOLENCE AWAITS THE END OF THE GAME", "body_text": " **********As promised, a special investigation team sent by the Government to look into the slayings of political opposition figures in the Quirino region was in that area of northern Luzon Province this morning. **********The team's forensic pathologist and a colonel from Manila were on the barracks tennis court in Bayanbong. **********They were sweating through a game when Mariano Pimentel walked up to ask when they might head over to Quirino to begin looking into the killings of a dozen or so of his associates in the opposition. **********Mr. Pimentel, the local leader of Unido, the umbrella opposition group headed by Corazon C.

Laurel, the presidential running mate of Mrs. Aquino, bade him farewell with the respect due a hunted man. **********Three hours later, he was in the northern mountains, waking the roosters in Santa Fe as he knocked on the Mayor's window to inquire about the recent cadaver. **********''I think he was one of my men from Diffun,'' he said in the darkness. **********Mayor William Chenjay, bleary-eyed but polite, said it was too late to find out who the murder victim was; the burial had occurred. 'Thought You Were Dead' **********Mr. Pimentel continued northward to Solano, and at 5:40 he cautiously rolled up to the ''safe house'' of his fellow Unido party leader, Epifanio Galima Jr., searching for refugees or victims from what are now known as the killings of Quirino. **********After cautious inquiries, Mr. Galima's door was opened, and two men arose from the couch, came forward and embraced Mr. Pimentel. **********''I thought you were dead!'' he said to a man called Bernardo. **********''You're alive!'' said a man called Rolando. The group hugged beyond the threshold. Men on the Run **********The men were members of the families of the Quirino region, at least a dozen of whom have been reported on the run, from the mountains down to Manila. **********Darkness yielded outside to a hopeful hue, as if it truly were the beginning of what President Ferdinand E. Marcos has proclaimed as a period of post-election reconciliation. The fugitives laughed at the idea. **********''Reconciliation for the dead,'' said Mr. Pimentel, who had taken off his bullet-proof vest. **********At 6:50 A.M., Mr. Galima sat the happy group of visitors at his kitchen table for breakfast of eggs and rice. While four of his handsome dark-eyed children watched, he recited grace: ''We thank You for this breakfast gathering so that we might at least seek justice.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/25/world/us-hails-south-africa-for-easing-of-apartheid.html": {"writer_name": "Bernard Gwertzman", "pub_date": "1986-04-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1047, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. HAILS SOUTH AFRICA FOR EASING OF APARTHEID", "print_headline": "U.S. HAILS SOUTH AFRICA FOR EASING OF APARTHEID", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration said today that South Africa's pledge to allow freedom of movement for blacks throughout the country marked ''a major milestone on the road away from apartheid.'' **********It also said that the South African announcements ''promise perhaps the most conspicuous discarding of discriminatory laws in recent South African history.'' **********In its first reaction to the move announced in South Africa on Wednesday, the State Department tempered its praise of the Pretoria Government's decision by saying that South Africa's credibility depended on ''quick implementation'' of the program. **********It was clear from private and public comments by United States officials that the Administration was putting great store in the measures announced by President P. W. Botha. But as in the past, officials were also concerned that Mr. Botha move quickly and boldly to convince black leaders in South Africa that he was sincerely moving toward an end to the system of segregation known as apartheid. **********Call for Apartheid's End **********The Administration has repeatedly called for an end to apartheid and the start of a political dialogue between black leaders and the Government on new political system in which blacks, who make up the majority of the population, have some form of political power. Currently, blacks are not permitted to vote or hold office. **********On Wednesday, South Africa announced that it would abolish virtually all laws prohibiting blacks from moving freely within the country and from migrating into black sections of cities. The abolition of the regulations, known as ''pass laws,'' was the latest in a series of changes announced by the Government to ease the personal impact of apartheid. **********The Government said it would eliminate the small reference books all blacks in South Africa must now carry, replacing them with an identity booklet identical to those carried by whites, Indians and people of mixed race. The booklet would, however, indicate the race of the bearer. **********But the Government did nothing to end the system of segregation in housing or to provide political power for blacks, the State Department said. **********Nevertheless, the department's praise for the moves that were announced was quite pronounced. Chester A. Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, met in Geneva on Sunday and Monday with Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha of South Africa, who is said to have given Mr. Crocker an advance briefing on the Government plans. Discarding Discriminatory Laws **********''We regard the acceptance of freedom of movement to and within urban areas for all South African citizens on a nondiscriminatory basis as a major milestone on the road away from apartheid,'' said Charles E. Redman, a State Department spokesman. **********''Repeal of the 'pass laws,' issuing a common identity document, and other proposals announced by the South African Government promise perhaps the most conspicuous discarding of discriminatory laws in recent South African history,'' he said. **********''The effectiveness of these steps in lending credibility to the South African Government's stated policies of reform and encouraging political dialogue will now depend on such related matters as adequate provision of new land and humane treatment of squatters,'' he said. **********Mr. Redman said the new proposals are ''so far-ranging and complex that we must reserve judgment on their full implications for blacks, but it is clear that their intent is to widen the scope of freedom for all South Africans.'' **********The South African announcements did not apply, at least immediately, to the more than eight million blacks deemed citizens of the four nominally independent, so-called black homelands, Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei and Venda. Mr. Redman said Washington believed that they should also be included. **********''In sum, we regard these developments as an important step in the process of dismantling apartheid,'' Mr. Redman said. He said the United States believed that a commitment to freedom of movement should lead to an end to residential segregation as well. **********The Reagan Administration imposed limited economic sanctions on South Africa last year after repeated calls from members of Congress for even tougher measures. Part of the rationale for opposing stricter moves given by the Administration was that it was important to work with the Botha Government and encourage it on the road to change, and not to worsen relations. **********Representative Howard Wolpe, Democrat of Michigan, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said that the latest South African moves were a ''significant development,'' but that they did not address the need for basic change. **********Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the move ''is probably the single most significant step the Government of South Africa has taken in dealing with the problem of apartheid in South Africa, but it falls far short of what is needed.'' ----Move Is Hailed and Criticized JOHANNESBURG, April 24 (UPI) -President Botha said today that the abolition of the restrictions on blacks' movements would usher in ''a new era of freedom'' in South Africa, but a black leader called the move ''a minute step'' toward dismantling white supremacy. **********''Influx control has been abolished,'' Mr. Botha said in newspaper advertisments published across the country. ''The pass laws have gone. The prisons are emptied of the victims of this unhappy system. No South African will ever suffer the indignity of arrest for a pass offense again. A new era of freedom has begun.'' **********Jan Christiaan Heunis, Constitutional Development and Planning Minister, said at a news conference that the white paper reflected ''the indisputable right of all South African citizens to equal opportunities and treatment.'' **********He warned that authorities would not tolerate ''a period of chaotic growth of cities and towns.'' He said that blacks would no longer need permits to leave their birthplaces but that mobility would depend on the availability of housing. **********A spokesman for the black nationalist Azanian Peoples Organization, Muntu Myeza, said the housing condition was ''typical of the white regime -what it gives with the one hand it takes away with the other. **********''The removal of influx control is a very minute step towards the removal of the racist laws that entrench white supremacy,'' Mr. Myeza said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/business/us-criticizes-opec-agreement.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-08-06", "snippet": "", "word_count": 153, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "U.S. Criticizes OPEC Agreement", "print_headline": "U.S. Criticizes OPEC Agreement", "body_text": " **********The Reagan Administration yesterday criticized the OPEC agreement to increase oil prices by limiting production as unwarranted interference in the free market and a possible threat to national interests. **********Administration officials suggested that the accord raised the possibility of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries again controlling oil markets and exerting considerable influence over the world economy. **********''The re-establishment of the dominance of OPEC as it existed in the 1970's is unhealthy for Americans,'' said Energy Secretary John S.

And with no sign that the five leading industrialized nations that make up the group were planning to push the dollar down much further, currencies and financial futures traded in narrow ranges, except for the British pound, which dropped sharply against other currencies as the price for North Sea oil fell to less than $20 a barrel. **********Market participants described the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain as a ''non-event'' endorsing a status quo position on exchange rates and interest rates. Although it had been, in the words of one futures dealer, ''transparently improbable'' that the meeting would lead to a coordinated attack on interest rates, securities prices rose at the end of last week in the hope that Japanese and French calls for such a step would be heeded. **********Dollar Rises in Europe **********Currencies and financial futures adjusted to the meeting's noncommittal outcome during trading in the Far East before European and American markets opened. The dollar and money market interest rates rose in Europe. **********''We're back to looking at fundamentals and other technical considerations,'' said Richard B. Dickson Jr., vice president in the foreign exchange department at Salomon Brothers. ''The G-5 is not likely to be a factor unless the dollar moves up or down more than 5 percent.'' **********''We've essentially dropped back to where we had been trading last Wednesday when all the speculation about action on interest rates began,'' said Larry Morgan, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds's financial futures trading post at the Chicago Board of Trade. **********Trading was thin in all of the American markets, reflecting observance of the national holiday marking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. **********''Given the fact that the G-5 meeting was such a yawn, a lot of currency traders who had been prepared to come to work decided to take the holiday,'' Mr. Dickson said. Dollar Consolidation Expected **********In the wake of the meeting, the majority view in most markets appeared to be that the dollar would consolidate its current position and perhaps strengthen by a few percent. The recent firming of American interest rates, the release of economic indicators showing that the economy is performing better than expected, and the pressures on the British pound are all contributing to the dollar's bouyancy. **********Background reports from the Group of Five meeting have indicated that the United States would be happy to see a further, gradual decline in the dollar. A dollar decline improves the United States trade balance by making American exports less expensive and foreign imports more costly. **********However, both Japanese and French authorities would like to see exchange rates stabilize at current levels for now. **********The markets here and abroad had been hoping for joint action to cut interest rates in the belief that lower rates would encourage economic growth in the industrialized world, reduce the cost of financing budget deficits, and ease the debt burden of developing countries. **********''There was a glimmer of hope beforehand that there might be some action on interest rates,'' said Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Phillips & Drew, a London brokerage. **********The lack of a consensus by the Group of Five on a push to lower rates was seen as a sign that the United States Federal Reserve Bank and the West German Bundesbank were convinced that domestic economic conditions supported the current rate structure. Given that stance, according to market participants, only a sharp rise in the dollar would create the conditions in which interest rates might be cut. **********''The market had been hoping for near-term good news on interest rates from G-5,'' said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., head of portfolio strategy at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''I think attention will now shift to the uncertainty about the future of Gramm-Rudman,'' he added, referring to the legislation passed by Congress last year that requires that the United States move toward a balanced budget.

Earnings per share tumbled to 78 cents, from 99 cents, in line with analysts' expectations. **********Problems at Phibro Energy **********What caught analysts by surprise, though, were problems at Phibro Energy Inc., Salomon's oil trading and refining unit. Phibro Energy reported a pretax loss of $8 million after pretax earnings of $26 million the year earlier. **********Company officials said Phibro's traders bet heavily at the end of June that oil prices would rise, when in fact they took a dive.

Salomon Brothers reported several weeks ago that it had suffered heavy bond trading losses in May, a particularly difficult month in the markets.

In the last week Hutton hired three senior officials from the Citicorp Investment Bank to improve its bond-trading operations. **********Elsewhere, though, Hutton turned in a moderately strong performance. Commission revenues rose 46 percent, to $69.5 million, and asset management fees increased 55 percent, to $53.1 million, Hutton said.

''It's very discouraging.'' Although the Fed estimated that about half the decline was a result of strikes - stoppages occurred in business equipment, construction supplies and durable materials - the June result was still somewhat worse than most analysts had expected. **********The decline was broadly based, with only automobiles and transit equipment showing significant strength, the central bank said. 'Great Degree of Weakness' **********''It certainly does point up the great degree of weakness we've had over the past six months,'' commented Walter M.

Next week's report on the gross national product for the second quarter, he suggested, is likely to be well under the 2.9 percent annual rate recorded in the first three months. **********Another analyst, Bernard Schoenfeld, said he thought the growth rate for the quarter ended June 30 would be reported in the range of 2 to 2 1/2 percent, possibly less if the trade deficit failed to improve significantly. **********''We are burdened with large trade deficits, extremely weak capital spending and cutbacks in energy,'' observed Lawrence Chimerine, president of Chase Econometrics, a private forcasting firm.

This, he recognizes, is where the road probably ends. **********On June 26, 1943, Second Lieutenant Holguin was the only member of a 10-man crew to survive when a Japanese fighter shot down their B-17 bomber and sent it crashing into the thick South Pacific jungles of New Britain. Lieutenant Holguin, the navigator, had worn his parachute. When he accidentally tumbled through an open door of the crippled bomber, he was able to float away from death. **********But survival did not bring safety. Hobbled by a broken back and a leg wound, he was captured by the Japanese several weeks later and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in the New Britain city of Rabaul. There he endured through more than two years of malnutrition and disease that killed all but 7 of the camp's 64 captives. Still, Mr. Holguin survived. A Pledge to Live Up To He survived to retire from the Air Force in 1963 as a lieutentant colonel. He survived to become the assistant principal of a suburban Los Angeles high school. Most of all, he survived to live up to a pledge, made long ago to himself, to bring his crew home. **********Starting in 1981, he visited New Britain three times. **********In 1982, he discovered the sliced fuselage of his B-17, christened the ''Naughty but Nice'' and still bearing its hand-painted insignia of a half-naked calendar girl. Later, with the help of islanders, he learned that the bodies of five crew members had been buried in unmarked graves at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. **********At his prodding, the United States Army examined and identified those remains last year. Finally, four decades later, the five men were laid to rest with full honors in their hometowns. **********Now, Mr. Holguin says it is time for the other four to come back, too. Persistence Is Uncommon **********He sees himself, at the age of 65, as a common man with uncommon persistence. But he recognizes that, despite his past success, he has probably set himself an impossible goal this time. **********Hopping a space-available military flight, he came to Tokyo this week in search of clues to the missing crew members' whereabouts. **********He has, from memory, the names of half a dozen camp guards and officers who he hopes may know what happened to the missing men, or at least why they were not buried with the others. Perhaps, he says, he can locate crew members from the Japanese plane that shot him down. Maybe they saw something that could be of value. **********His mission, Mr. Holguin acknowledges, could be likened to the search for the needle in a haystack, except that the odds are not nearly so good. **********''It's been a long shot from the very beginning,'' he said. **********By coincidence, his journey comes when Japan, as usual this time of year, is consumed with its own wartime memories. This is a period of reflection, centered heavily on the Aug. 6 anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that helped bring an end to World War II and, in the process, liberated Mr. Holguin from his prison camp in 1945. 'No Point Feeling Resentment' **********Most of the talk here is of how Japan suffered, not how much pain it caused others during the war. But Mr. Holguin does not begrudge Japanese their recollections, no matter how they differ from his. ''There's no point feeling resentment,'' he said. ''War changes things for everybody.'' **********His lack of animosity is such that he held a reunion in Japan 15 years ago with two of his Rabaul captors, Shozo Kato and Zenichi Wakabayashi. There was death all around him in the prison camp, Mr. Holguin said, but some guards permitted civilities such as an occasional shower or cigarette. **********In a situation like that, even a kind word counts, he said. Mr. Kato especially wanted to make you feel like a gentleman. **********Now, he intends to seek out the two former camp officers once more in the hope that they can recall something, anything, that would shed light on the missing remains of the four Americans. In particular, he is looking for leads to five other Japanese who may have useful information. They were all assigned to Rabaul, several of them in intelligence work as members of the Sixth Field Kempeitai, the dreaded secret police. **********Mr. Holguin, a compact, solidly built man, discusses his wartime ordeal in a matter-of-fact voice, almost as though he were talking of someone else. But passion enters when he speaks about his long search, which has cost him some $15,000 in personal savings and required him to do virtually everything alone, with little help or encouragement from the United States military. 'That Day in 1943' **********''I made a vow that day in 1943 that I would leave them, but that if I made it I would come back for them,'' he said. ''My intentions were to bury them on the spot. But that changed to getting them out of there.'' **********It was not until 1981 that he actually started the hunt. ''Human frailty keeps pulling you away from what you've got to do,'' Mr. Holguin said. ''The thought of those guys still out there, though, was like a rumbling train. The noise just kept getting louder and louder.'' **********Mr. Holguin acknowledged that the chances of his learning anything of great substance were small. **********But he also felt he had no choice but to follow the road to its end. ''Who knows?'' he said. ''No one thought I'd find the other five fellows either.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/20/business/market-place-hawaii-banks-and-tourism.html": {"writer_name": "Vartanig Vartan", "pub_date": "1986-05-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 789, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Market Place; Hawaii, Banks And Tourism", "print_headline": "Market Place; Hawaii, Banks And Tourism", "body_text": " **********HAWAII's two major bank holding companies do not receive the intensive coverage that brokerage firms often accord regional banks on the mainland. But a handful of analysts are impressed, continuing to regard these Hawaiian shares as attractive, even after their stellar market performance so far this year. **********The two companies, which represent an estimated 75 percent of the banking business in the 50th state, are Bancorp Hawaii Inc. and its slightly smaller neighbor, First Hawaiian Inc. **********Among other things, ''these banks are prime beneficiaries of the boom in domestic tourism that has followed the recent acts of terrorism aboard,'' said Donald K. Crowley, senior vice president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in San Francisco. **********Fear of terrorism has led many Americans to cancel plans for travel in Europe and the Middle East. ''But just about all the hotel rooms in Hawaii are booked throughout the summer,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''And tourism, after all, accounts for about 30 percent of the Hawaiian economy. Another favorable factor for tourism is the recent strength of the yen against the dollar, which makes it cheaper for the Japanese, too, to come to Hawaii. **********''When this latest economic stimulus hit the islands, the Hawaiian bank stocks were already doing rather well, based on their improved earnings and improving credit quality.'' **********In the first four months of 1986, shares of Bancorp Hawaii rose 36.6 percent in over-the-counter trading, while First Hawaiian climbed 38 percent. This compared with an advance of 21.1 percent in the Keefe, Bruyette bank index, consisting of the nation's 24 largest banking companies, and with a gain of 11.5 percent in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which mirrors the broad equity market. **********In yesterday's trading, shares of Bancorp Hawaii were unchanged at 48 1/4. It is the holding company for the Bank of Hawaii, the state's largest commercial bank. In April the stock's price set a record at 50 - virtually double its 1985 low of 25 1/2. **********Shares of First Hawaiian, also traded over the counter, fell 1 1/2 yesterday, to 45 1/2. Earlier this month the stock sold at a high of 48, also about twice last year's low of 24 3/4. **********In 1985 Bancorp Hawaii earned $4.25 a share on a fully diluted basis. For its 1986 opening quarter, the profit rose to $1.21 a share from $1 a year earlier. Keefe, Bruyette estimates that earnings for all 1986 will increase to $4.90 a share. **********Daniel J. Donoghue, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago, carries a ''buy'' recommendation on the stock and projects earnings for 1986 at $5 a share. ''We feel that Bancorp Hawaii has some of the strongest investment characteristics, both near-term and long-term, of any of the regional banks,'' he said. ''Over the next five years, we think the company will show above-average performance and asset quality. We expect earnings to increase at an annual rate of 10 to 12 percent during this period.'' **********In a report on Bancorp Hawaii issued yesterday, Standard & Poor's said the strong earnings performance in 1985 reflected ''a relatively stable interest rate environment, lower levels of nonperforming assets, asset growth and the acquisition early last year of the Hawaiian Trust Company.'' **********First Hawaiian is the holding company for the First Hawaiian Bank, the oldest financial institution in the islands, and three non-bank subsidiaries. ''Earnings and dividends,'' according to Standard & Poor's, ''have maintained a long-term uptrend.'' **********The company earned $4.06 a share for 1985.

Accordingly, a growing chorus of politicians and economists is calling on the Fed to ''accommodate'' the cuts with an expansive monetary policy. **********But the degree of monetary stimulus needed to offset cuts of this magnitude would lead to a sharp reacceleration of inflation. At the same time, a more restrictive policy than the present money-growth rate of about 12 percent combined with the contractionary effect of large deficit cuts could throw the economy into a recession. Thus, the Fed's proper policy course - to do exactly what it is doing now - invites storms of criticism and, ultimately, blame for the adverse economic effects of the ill-advised Gramm-Rudman legislation. **********The Fed has already significantly eased monetary policy over the last year. At a rate of 12 percent, M1, the sum total of cash in circulation and in checking accounts, has grown at about double the targeted level of growth set in February 1985. **********In part, this growth has offset a sharp increase in the demand for money. It has also provided some stimulus to the economy, since we have seen some pickup of economic activity in the second half of the year, compared with the first half. This follows a well-established pattern: faster money growth leads to faster real growth, which is followed by a rise in inflation. **********What about fiscal policy? In a phrase, it has been too expansionary. Deficit reduction of about $30 billion would have a highly favorable effect on the economy, given the relatively loose monetary policy of the last year or so. Such a tightening of fiscal policy would result in lower interest rates and a further easing of the dollar. These, in turn, would help to increase aggregate demand for United States goods, both at home and abroad, and therefore help to offset the negative effect of a tightening of fiscal policy. **********After this, the salutary effects of deficit-reduction become more problematic. The $60 billion reduction called for in the next round of Gramm-Rudman cuts in fiscal 1987 is too large to be accommodated through monetary policy. The expansionary effect of lower rates and a resulting lower dollar would be insufficient to compensate for such a large direct cut in aggregate demand. Thus, pressure would rise for the Fed to ease monetary policy to a point where a sharp reignition of inflation would occur. **********Why would greater money growth lead to inflation? Once it became evident that the Fed was trying to pump up the economy with easy money, the dollar would collapse while interest rates rose. In effect, we would be repeating the experience of the late 1970's, when dollar depreciation and higher interest rates went hand in hand, because rising inflationary expectations were pushing up interest rates while pushing down the dollar. **********But a return to inflationary policies in the late 1980's would differ from the experience during the 1970's in one important way - inflationary expectations would increase much faster. Investors in fixed-income securities, having been burned once, would promptly demand higher interest rates to compensate for a rise in the prospective inflationary tax on their interest earnings. **********Some would argue for easier money on the grounds that falling oil prices and plenty of spare manufacturing capacity would dampen prices. While it is true that rates of capacity utilization are below peak levels of the late 1970's, rates for the Group of Five countries - the United States, West Germany, Britain, France and Japan - have risen sharply. By 1985, rates of capacity utilization had jumped to nearly 95 percent of their inflationary 1979-1980 levels. The sharpest rise has been in the United States where, from a trough in 1982-1983, the capacity utilization index jumped from 78 percent of the 1979-1980 peak to 92 percent in 1985. **********The sharp drop in oil prices is not typical of commodity prices, which rose worldwide at an average rate of 8.4 percent during 1985. The oil price drop is occurring because the OPEC cartel is collapsing into a sea of excess oil inventories. It is not a reliable guide for monetary policy. AS WE enter 1986, it is important to remember the sequence of events since 1981. Five years ago, in the spring of 1981, money growth slowed sharply to break inflationary expectations. A sharp recession ensued; taxes were cut and investment stimuli put into place in 1982. The economy responded in 1983 and 1984, and the Fed moved toward easier money to accommodate the growth. By 1985, the fiscal stimulus had worn off and the Fed eased money. **********In 1986, given the huge accumulation of debt that has accompanied this sequence of policies, the only sensible option is to keep money growth no higher than its current rate of 12 percent a year. There is a wide consensus among economists that budget cuts on the order of about half those prescribed by Gramm-Rudman would do the job. Going much further than that could throw the economy into shock or force the Fed to push inflation and interest rates back up to 1981 levels. If that happens, the fault will lie with politicians and with the few economists who try to tell them that any goal can be achieved through monetary policy."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/22/business/advertising-arnell-bickford-agency-on-the-move.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-07-22", "snippet": "", "word_count": 383, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Arnell/Bickford Agency on the Move", "print_headline": "ADVERTISING; Arnell/Bickford Agency on the Move", "body_text": " **********Do not expect traditional agency behavior or output from Arnell/Bickford Associates.

Under portraits of the President, other placards exclaimed, ''Mad Dog No. 2.'' **********Peering into the throng of demonstrators, a speaker warned benignly against the dangers of ''anti-Americanism.'' **********The scene was in Hyde Park, at a demonstration last weekend against the American bombing of Libya from bases in Britain, and the speaker who found it necessary to utter the caution was Tony Benn, the former Labor Party Cabinet minister and perennial campaigner for a military policy that would detach Britain from the Atlantic alliance. **********On this occasion, Mr. Benn was not only supporting his party's policy of removing all American nuclear missiles from Britain but also calling for the closing of all American bases. **********A New Acceptance **********Ten days after the American attack on targets in Libya, Mr. Benn's stance remains a far-out view in the opposition Labor Party, let alone in British politics. But in the backlash of British public opinion against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's decision to allow the use of bases here by American F-111's, the emotional and sometimes strident vocabulary long used by the far left has gained a new acceptance. **********''Anti-Americanism here is not low-key anymore,'' said Suzanne Birkett, a 17-year-old student, when she was interviewed in Cambridge. ''Just yesterday I saw an American flag being burned at a rally because of what they did in Libya. America seems to be like 'Starsky and Hutch' - hyperactive and filled with guns.'' **********It was entirely predictable that left-wing weeklies with minuscule readerships would denounce ''United States terrorism,'' as did News Line, the publication of a group calling itself the Workers Revolutionary Party. **********But the term was also turned against President Reagan in the letters column of The Guardian, a national daily, and in the House of Commons, where Eric Heffer, a member of the Labor Party, called the President ''one of the biggest international terrorists alive today.'' **********On both sides of the issue, the same familiar epithets and appeals to history have been used. Defending her stand in the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher warned against ''appeasement'' and the danger of being ''supine and passive'' in the face of terrorism. The Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, said she had been ''supine in her support of an American President.'' 'Appeasing of President Reagan' **********A letter writer to The Sunday Times drew a direct parallel between Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and the Prime Minister's response to Mr. Reagan. ''The appeasing of President Reagan,'' the headline declared. **********Also complaining of ''appeasement'' of the Americans was a retired merchant marine captain named Brian Mercer, who wrote to The Guardian to demand a boycott of American goods in protest of the actions of ''the celluloid gangster'' and ''the megalomatriarch of Downing Street.'' **********The intensity of the language, which often shocks Americans, can leave an impression that the vaunted ''special relationship'' is at risk. **********But the phenomenon of ''anti-Americanism'' in Britain can represent both more and less than that term connotes to Americans, including nationalist fears that this former imperial power is in danger of becoming a client state to a superpower and envy stemming from the unmistakable decline of British power and influence. Both the nationalist fears and the envy contribute to a general sense that Washington rides roughshod over British concerns and interests without noticing that it has done so. **********After the Libyan raid, these sentiments have not been confined to those who routinely question the usefulness of the military alliance or the United States role in the world. Indeed, it has not been uncommon for members of the Thatcher Government to complain with some asperity about the ''insensitivity'' of the Reagan Administration to its political problems, or about trade restrictions against European exports that were threatened within days after the F-111's returned to British bases. **********Some of the popular reaction to the raid itself starts with an impression that Britain was not really consulted, only used. A Predictable Reaction **********''Anti-Americanism' is a shorthand,'' an American diplomat said. ''It very inadequately describes what's going on.'' **********However the mood is finally interpreted, there was nothing particularly new in the fears and alarms vented here after the raid. **********The reaction was intense but predictable, on the basis of opinion polls that have consistently shown that a high proportion of Britons have come to believe that the United States in general and President Reagan in particular are inclined to the reckless use of military power. Early polls indicating that two out of three Britons disapproved of the raid and Mrs. Thatcher's decision to permit the use of British bases were consistent with earlier surveys. **********For instance, a Gallup Poll taken in January 1983 reported that 70 percent of those questioned had little, very little or no confidence at all ''in the ability of the United States to deal wisely with present world problems.'' **********Sixty-five percent said they thought President Reagan was ''not proving a good President.'' Mistrust a Constant **********Strikingly, mistrust of the United States has remained almost constant, even when Mr. Reagan's standing improved. By March of this year, more Britons (46 percent) thought he was proving a good President than those (43 percent) who thought he was not when Gallup put the same questions. **********But 65 percent still had little or no confidence in the ability of the United States to act wisely. As soon as the confrontation with Libya loomed, reinforcing old fears, Mr. Reagan's standing here slumped. **********Well before the raid, a poll taken in February by Market and Opinion Research International found that 54 percent of those questioned could agree to the proposition that the United States was either as great a threat to world peace as the Soviet Union or a worse threat. Sixty-seven percent thought the United States had ''too much'' influence on military policies in Britain. **********Yet, reflecting ambivalence rather than crude ''anti-Americanism,'' 66 percent of the same sample expressed a liking for Americans and 64 percent said they would like to vacation in the United States. ''I did not sense anti-Americanism so much as anti-American-Governmentism and anti-Reaganism,'' said Robert Worcester, an American, who is managing director of the polling organization. **********Such distinctions, however, are less obvious when people are finding their own words for their feelings rather than responding to a pollster's carefully phrased questions. Among the responses from young Britons interviewed at random in Cambridge was that of Peter Kirway, 21. 'A Taxi With a Sign' **********''Just the other day, I saw a taxi with a sign in it that said, 'No United States Air Force personnel welcome in this car,' '' Mr. Kirway said. ''I kind of understand that feeling. Americans don't know what it's like to be invaded. Their cultural penetration now goes hand in hand with their military penetration of us. And it is just as bad.'' **********Time Out, a glossy weekly that keeps a mainly youthful audience abreast of new movies and shows, has a section this week reflecting that sentiment called ''Occupied Britain,'' a World War II slogan summarizing what Britons did not like about Americans -Americans were ''overpaid, oversexed and over here.'' **********Trying to bring it up to date, Time Out's cover declares: ''Over Armed, Over Eager, Over Here.'' **********A British official offered a wry response when asked whether he feared anti-Americanism as a political force: ''I think you would find that there is one all-mighty cure for all this - if the Americans ever decide to retreat into their isolationist shell.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/26/world/bolivia-struggles-with-its-tin-mines.html": {"writer_name": "Shirley Christian", "pub_date": "1986-12-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 908, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "BOLIVIA STRUGGLES WITH ITS TIN MINES", "print_headline": "BOLIVIA STRUGGLES WITH ITS TIN MINES", "body_text": " **********Government efforts to curtail tin mining, for which Bolivia made its mark on the world in pre-cocaine days, have set off a dispute that goes to the roots of the country's political and economic life. **********It is highlighted by a battle of two titans of modern Bolivian history, each now in his eighth decade, who fathered the nationalized mining system over which they now confront each other. **********The Government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, 79 years old, says that in the face of low world prices for tin and production costs that are the highest in the world it has no choice but to close some mines and impose efficiency on others. And for future mining development, it intends to put its faith in private enterprise. **********Juan Lechin Oquendo, 72 years old, the king of Bolivian labor, says Bolivia's major tin mines can be made profitable again, prices will inevitably rise and the state should retain its dominance over mining and the rest of the economy. Once Side by Side **********Once, Juan Lechin and Victor Paz stood side by side in the upheavals that brought their political party, the National Revolutionary Movement, to power and produced revolutionary changes throughout Bolivian society. Mr. Paz, the party elder, assumed the presidency for the first time in 1952; Mr. Lechin, whose power base was the mineworkers' union, became Minister of Mining while also proceeding to organize the Bolivian Workers Federation, the labor umbrella group. **********On Oct. 31, 1952, they signed the decrees that nationalized the holdings of the so-called tin barons, the small group of men that controlled 80 percent of Bolivian mining and in World War II produced nearly all the Allied tin. **********Mr. Lechin's unusual dual role highlighted the revolutionary regime's identification with the mineworkers, effectively allowing the labor movement to step into the shoes the tin barons had filled as power brokers in Bolivia. Labor used that power to force a continually expanding role for the state in the economy in the coming years, with the concurrence of Mr. Paz and other political leaders. **********However, the Victor Paz who returned to the presidency last year brought sharply different views from those of 1952. He inherited an economy usually described as chaotic or anarchic, with inflation that exceeded 8,000 percent last year and cocaine exports as its most reliable component. Free Market Ideas **********President Paz surrounded himself with economists and businessmen with free market ideas, took drastic steps that have brought inflation this year into the low two-digits, and then turned his attention to mining. **********The most dramatic Government step was the closing in August of Catavi, the once-rich mining complex in Llallagua Mountain where the worldwide mining empire of Simon I. Patino, the most famous of the tin barons, had its beginnings at the turn of the century. **********The closing is part of a reorganization and downgrading of Comibol, the state mining corporation created after the 1952 nationalizations. The Government says it also intends to close several other mines run by Comibol and turn others over to cooperatives. It will cut employment at the remaining mines while seeking investors to modernize them and develop Bolivia's other mineral potential. Reduction in Labor Force **********Mining Minister Jaime Villalobos said the Government wanted to reduce the labor force in state mines to about 8,000, compared with nearly 30,000 at the beginning of 1985. He said 12,500 left in the last year because of Government inducements, and the Government is now trying to dismiss another 7,000. **********Comibol, made up of 23 separate mining operations, was responsible, until recent years, for 60 percent of Bolivia's exports, but the Government says it now costs far more than it produces and more than Bolivia can afford. Mr. Villalobos said that in recent years, ''the only thing Comibol has produced for the country has been losses and deficits.'' **********He said it was in bankruptcy even before world tin prices collapsed late in 1985. Company records show losses of $168 million in 1985 and losses since 1979 of nearly half a billion dollars. **********One of the reasons given for Comibol's failings is the decline in ore content. In the case of Catavi, content has fallen from 8 percent early in the century to less than one-third of 1 percent now. Other factors cited include the use of Comibol income in the past to finance other Government programs rather than reinvesting in exploration and modernization and, the Government says, too much union influence in management. Talks Were Begun **********The mineworkers' federation reacted to closing of Catavi in August with a mass march on the capital from the mining region of Oruro, only to be stopped en route by the police enforcing a state of siege. After mediation by the Roman Catholic Church, labor and the Government opened talks. **********Labor leaders contend that it is still possible to produce tin competitively at Catavi and other Bolivian mines, but much of the rank and file have accepted the inevitability of the closings and focused their attention on seeking larger settlements than those proposed by the Government. The Government, saying it has $46 million set aside for the settlements and can afford no more, has proposed payments averaging $3,300 a worker, with the actual amount based on years of service. Minimum wages in the mines are about $40 a month."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/10/world/135-crash-dead-still-unidentified-army-is-considering-mass-burial.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Halloran", "pub_date": "1986-01-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 873, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "ARMY IS CONSIDERING MASS BURIAL", "print_headline": "135 CRASH DEAD STILL UNIDENTIFIED; ARMY IS CONSIDERING MASS BURIAL", "body_text": " **********Military pathologists and dentists have so far been unable to identify the remains of 135 of the 248 soldiers who were killed in an airplane crash in Newfoundland Dec. 12, an Army spokesman said today. **********The spokesman, Maj.

The Army said the remains of 113 soldiers and 5 civilians had been positively identified, with death certificates written and families notified, for a total of 118. **********Canadian officials said 119 sets of remains had been identified. The discrepancy appeared to have arisen because one death certificate had not been prepared or the family not yet notified. Search Approved by Canada **********Major Prewitt said the new team of engineers had gone back to Gander to conduct another search with the consent of the Canadian Government. ''We don't want to wait for spring and the thaw to continue the investigation,'' she said. **********That team is seeking to recover any remains and personal effects or military equipment and to remove the rest of the wreckage from an area covered by snow, she said.

''Now they will apply also to Syria. This decision is in accordance with U.S. foreign policy, which opposes the prohibited use of chemical weapons.'' **********''We have known for several years that both Iran and Iraq have had active, ongoing programs to develop chemical weapons,'' he said.

'A Cause of Concern' **********Mr. Kalb added that ''the United States is concerned that Syria may have a chemical weapons capability and has assisted Iran in the Iranian war effort.'' **********''Iran has not used chemical weapons, but their continued use by Iraq and the potential for Iranian use is a cause of concern,'' he said. **********The United States has taken the lead in trying to persuade the world's nations to press for an end to the use of chemical weapons.

''The industry of Israel is over 70 percent dependent on national security,'' she said. ''And that makes us heavily dependent on the United States - and on arms shipments to many countries around the world.'' And she is afraid that cutting the military would aggravate unemployment. ''From an economic, moral, human point of view,'' she added, ''this situation is so dangerous.'' **********Mrs. Namir, who says she believes in a strong defense - she fought in the Israeli Army as a young girl during the war of independence - also believes that Israeli security ultimately will require negotiating with the Arab countries and extending equal rights within Israel to its Arab population. ''We live in an atmosphere of constant war,'' she said. ''If there is no peace, our young people will think our strength is physical strength. Many do not trust the Arabs, nor accept them as human beings.'' **********Prime Minister Shimon Peres appears to support the idea that Israel's security ultimately rests on reaching an accommodation with the Arabs. A significant sign was the appointment of Prof. Michael Bruno, a founder of Peace Now, as head of the Bank of Israel, the country's central bank. But Israel seems split down the middle between ''doves'' and ''hawks'' - though few Israeli doves are pacifists; they are only too aware of the dangers on their borders. **********During her visit to Jerusalem, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the first British Prime Minister to visit Israel since it became an independent state 38 years ago, was warmly welcomed for supporting the American air strike against Libya as a blow against terrorism. She responded with equal warmth, saying that no one who had been to Vad Yashem, the memorial to the Jews who died in the Holocaust, could ever doubt the special urgency to Israel of security. Yet she too talked of the impact of economics on efforts to get the peace process going again. **********Mrs. Thatcher said many Middle Eastern states were in economic difficulties, and that could help get peaceful negotiations going. Syria, the principal immediate threat to Israel, is in grave trouble. A two-year drought has ruined crops, and the fall in oil revenues of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait has forced them to cut their aid to Syria. Mrs. Thatcher saw a chance for using economic aid from the West as a means of helping the peace process along, but she did not overstate it. Economic aid, she said, is no substitute for the willingness to accept Israel's right to exist, and to cease terrorism, but could be a useful supplement. She urged her listeners not to give up hope, saying, ''Things do change.'' **********Similarly, the business executives and scholars who gathered for a meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Madrid were searching for a way to find an economic component in the restructuring of East-West relations. As three foreign policy specialists, William G. Hyland of the United States, Karl Kaiser of West Germany and Hiroshi Kimura of Japan, said in a key paper, ''If arms control policy has suffered from a lack of focus, East-West economic policy is near chaos.'' **********Western policy, they said, should have as its starting point a re-evaluation of Soviet policy toward economic relations with the outside world. They saw the Russians as ''clearly'' seeking outside assistance, particularly technology and grain. But, because of divisions within the West, the Russians have been gaining the benefits of trade without paying any political price. **********While the Soviet economy is in a quiet crisis, the experts regarded Mr. Gorbachev's five-year plan for 1986-91 as demonstrating that he does not intend to let his policies ''become a hostage to the West, opening the Soviet Union to blackmail.'' On the contrary, a pointed Soviet approach toward Japan seems likely, and, while its initial aim would be to improve relations for economic gain, it would also be aimed at creating a split with Washington. **********The economic strains between Japan and the United States on one side, and between the United States and Western Europe on the other, could provide Moscow with targets of opportunity. But there are severe strains within the Soviet bloc as well. Even Czechoslovakia, regarded as the most submissive of Soviet allies, is restive under Soviet pressures to chop its imports and expand exports to the East. **********While the Czechs have been tolerating the underground economy, Mr. Gorbachev apparently means to wipe out the Soviet underground economy, and that could intensify troubles at home. Mr. Gorbachev, to relieve domestic economic pressures, wants to make a deal with President Reagan on arms control. **********Thus, in all these economic strains, there are grounds for cautious hope that the nations will be nudged away from war. Mr. Gorbachev suffered a devastating blow at the start of his regime from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. But Chernobyl, which came up in conversation after conversation all over Europe, has also intensified the search for peaceful answers to East-West troubles."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/business/company-news-gas-stations-in-europe.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-05", "snippet": "", "word_count": 37, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Gas Stations in Europe", "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; Gas Stations in Europe", "body_text": " **********Kuwait's state oil company announced plans today to expand its European retail network.

The old Government resigned last Friday and 87-year-old President Gustav Husak appointed a new Government Monday morning, acting in behalf of the Communist Party and the National Front Central Committee. **********The change was timed to the seating of a new Parliament. The Parliament building sits on a hill between the Smetana Theater and the National Museum. In this country, which never lost its sense of humor, a favorite joke goes: ''The Parliament is something between a theater and a museum.'' **********But Prime Minister Lubomir Strougal played it straight at the swearing in. He thanked Mr. Husak for the trust bestowed on his Government, saying, ''We are entering a demanding period in regard not only to the interests and means of our people but those of the whole Socialist community.'' **********This seemed an oracular way of saying, ''Comrade Gorbachev is watching from Moscow, and may bang heads if we don't perform better.'' **********The Czechs, who are said to be the leading Kremlinologists in the world, are watching Mr. Gorbachev carefully and trying to figure out whether he really wants change or whether he would be satisfied with the usual lip service to the new party lines without personnel or policy changes. **********Thus far, there has been little change in personnel. In his first year in office, Mr. Gorbachev gave the Soviet structure a drastic overhaul, dismissing two-fifths of all Government ministers and state committee chairmen and nearly one-third of all party secretaries. But the Czech hierarchical structure, under President Husak, remains virtually intact. In the new Government there are just three new faces: Deputy Prime Minister Pavel Hrivnak, General Engineering Minister Ladislav Luhovy and Communications Minister Jiri Jira. Rumors that there would be a deeper shake-up, to include other ministers, proved wrong. **********The expectation here is that real change at or near the top will turn out to be a gerontological phenomenon, occurring as the old generation dies off. **********The main thing Czech leaders have delivered to the Russians is total obedience. And, if the Czech economy's growth rate and foreign trade performance fall short of what the Russians want, Czechoslovakia, unlike most other East bloc countries, makes no trouble for Moscow. **********The Czech leaders have no appetite for economic reform; indeed the very word reform is taboo in Prague. The Czechs like to remind the Russians that it was General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's call for change to stimulate the Czech economy that led to the ''Prague spring'' of 1968, under Alexander Dubcek, which Soviet forces, backed by East German, Polish, Hungarian and Bulgarian troops, ruthlessly extinguished. Since then, President Husak has run a tight and orthodox ship, probably the tightest and most orthodox in the Communist world. ''Do you want to risk changing all that?'' the Czech leaders appear to be asking Moscow. **********Yet new signals are coming from Mr. Gorbachev, and the Czech leaders intend to give him what he wants, or at least simulate giving him what he wants if only to keep their jobs. One thing Mr. Gorbachev apparently wants is self-criticism, and Prime Minister Strougal, at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Government, said: ''Under party guidance we have scored no small successes, though we do not cover up our weak spots. We regard our own work self-critically.'' **********He added that the ''new approach'' to the tasks facing the Czech Government concerned both foreign policy and the society at home - particularly the economic and technological jobs ahead. ''We should have more efficient control, be harder on ourselves and others, use all idle resources in conceptual and everyday work,'' the Prime Minister said. ''It is necessary to seek new ways, learn from Soviet comrades and comrades in other Socialist countries how to solve the most important tasks and problems under Czechoslovak circumstances. What we need is a creative, courageous approach to remove the causes of existing shortcomings.'' **********But Mr. Strougal did not say what those shortcomings were. How to solve Czechoslovakia's ''shortcomings,'' whatever they are, remains a problem for future discussion, here in Prague and in bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union and other countries. The set of solutions seems unlikely to be tried during the current five-year plan for 1986-90, which has already begun, but rather in the five-year plan for 1991-95. **********Life moves slowly in the Communist world; the Government's critics here speak of its ''death-like torpor.'' But neither the Government nor ordinary Czechs seem in a hurry to change. With their country cottages, cars and refrigerators, they have found a way of living comfortably with torpor. **********One of the mysteries of Czech economic life is how they live so well and work so little. The Czechs feel - and the data support them on this - that they and the East Germans have the highest living standards in the Communist world. Yet their economy is stagnating. We shall examine this mystery of Czech affluence and torpor in another column."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/world/around-the-world-bangladesh-schedules-an-election-april-26.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-03-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 123, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Bangladesh Schedules An Election April 26", "print_headline": "AROUND THE WORLD; Bangladesh Schedules An Election April 26", "body_text": " **********Lieut.

So we are exploring creative alternatives, mostly through multinational institutions.'' **********But other State Department officials said today that the Reagan Administration hoped to keep United States foreign aid for Africa at about $1 billion a year for the near future despite sharp cuts in overall foreign aid being ordered by Congress. **********This level, which represents an increase of about $100 million over the first years of the Administration, would be considerably less than the levels of the last two years, when American aid was almost doubled to meet the famine caused by the severe drought on the continent. **********But officials said that with the crisis caused by the drought now easing, a $1 billion level should be sufficient, even though it may be less than that sought by the African nations. 'Market Forces' Backed **********Even though Washington feels that budget-cutting pressures prevent a dramatic increase in aid, it is trying to demonstrate strong political backing for the African efforts, and, in particular, to the moves in some areas of Africa to give more scope to market forces and private initiative. **********''The United States firmly believes that our own development experience is a useful guide to productive economic policies,'' Mr. Shultz said. **********''What is the most fundamental lesson of that experience?'' he asked. ''That the talents of individual human beings are the greatest resource a society can bring to the tasks of national development. America has seen this truth at work in its agricultural era, in its industrial phase, and in its post-industrial development. And we have seen our dedication to that truth translated throughout our society into better opportunities for succeeding generations.'' **********He said that even Communist Governments were giving more weight to individual initiative, and that in Africa, there are ''historic changes'' taking place in the economic field. 'Rejecting Failed Orthodoxies' **********''The special session provides an opportunity for all of Africa to join in what is a worldwide movement by rejecting failed orthodoxies and giving greater scope to individual initiative,'' he said. **********He said that an effort must be made by African countries as well as those donating aid to create conditions favorable to foreign investment, and that programs should be designed to ''increase self-reliance and discourage dependency.'' **********He stressed that aid must be sought not only from individual nations, but from international groups. **********''Finally,'' he said, ''we must develop production technologies appropriate to the African environment -especially in the critical area of agriculture.'' 'Energies' of Private Sector **********The White House issued a statement in President Reagan's name praising countries that have adopted economic policies emphasizing ''market-orientation and which will release the energies of their indigenous private sectors.'' **********''These free-market policies can promote broad-based equitable development based on social justice, self-reliance and the proven skills of the African people,'' it said. **********Mr. Reagan said that ''the special session is an historic occasion when the world has come together to confirm a stronger partnership with Africa based on shared ideals, a renewed sense of purpose in commitment and hope for the future.'' **********''Working as true partners, the African people and the international community, thorugh both its public and private sectors, can lay the basis for a prosperous Africa in which the African people contribute fully to their own as well as their national well-being,'' the statement said. ''It is the prayer of the American people that peace will come with prosperity so that the great continent of Africa can realize its vast potential.'' **********Mr. Reagan said that a year ago, Americans ''were deeply moved by the famine and human suffering across the continent of Africa.'' **********''We demonstrated the strength of our free-enterprise system in meeting Africa's emergency needs through the great productivity of our farmers,'' he said. ''Americans and other donors in both public and private sectors can be proud of our role in saving African lives and inspiring hope for a better future.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/business/military-electronics-stocks-surge.html": {"writer_name": "James Mullins", "pub_date": "1986-07-11", "snippet": "", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MILITARY ELECTRONICS STOCKS SURGE", "print_headline": "MILITARY ELECTRONICS STOCKS SURGE", "body_text": " **********Leading a general rise in military electronics stocks, Sanders Associates' shares soared $5.125 yesterday, to $61.875, exceeding the $60-a-share takeover agreement announced Wednesday with the Lockheed Corporation. **********Traders interpreted the price rise as suggesting that Lockheed's agreement might not be the last word. **********Sanders was the volume leader on consolidated turnover of nearly 3.2 million shares.

Such fears were cited as one reason for the collapse in bond and stock prices earlier this month. **********''The inflation situation generally looks pretty good out to the end of the year,'' said William A. Brown, a vice president at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist for the Wells Fargo Bank, called today's report ''a very pleasant surprise.'' **********Same as Monthly Average **********Excluding food and energy, the department reported, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose three-tenths of 1 percent last month, the same as the average monthly increase posted for the first seven months of the year. The price of services also rose three-tenths, slightly higher than in July but only half as fast as in June. **********At the White House, Beryl W. Sprinkel, President Reagan's top economic adviser, said at a briefing that the general economic outlook remained bright and that an end to this year's huge oil price declines would not raise inflation to worrisome levels. **********''We do expect that the inflation rate is going to ooze up in the months ahead,'' Mr. Sprinkel added. But he predicted the rise would be only to the 3 to 3 1/2 percent range over the next year. If so, 1987 would be the sixth consecutive year in which the price level increased by less than 4 percent. Leeway for Federal Reserve **********Analysts said that today's favorable inflation report appeared to give the Federal Reserve, whose policy-setting Open Market Committee met this week, some additional leeway to continue its accommodative credit stance. **********As in the preceding month, the August price index was dominated by food and energy. In addition, apparel prices jumped. **********In food, which climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent after rising eight-tenths in July, the main factor was a 3.2 percent jump in the index for meat, poultry, fish and eggs. This, according to a Labor Department analyst, Patrick C. Jackman, reflected heavy slaughtering of livestock earlier in the year and heavy losses of poultry in this summer's heat wave. Recently, however, meat prices have turned down. **********A 4.7 percent decline in gasoline prices contributed importantly to a drop of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the heavily weighted transportation component. Housing prices edged up two-tenths of 1 percent as a 1.6 percent rise for natural gas more than offset further declines for electricity, fuel oil, coal and bottled gas. There was a 2 percent rise in the cost of home maintenance and repairs. **********Medical care, which has stubbornly resisted the disinflation trend, rose another six-tenths of 1 percent, about the same pace as has prevailed for much of this year. Another Rise for Apparel **********Apparel and upkeep rose seven-tenths of 1 percent, the second consecutive advance after falling every preceding month this year except for April. But this seemed to reflect tighter quotas on imports and the introduction of fall and winter merchandise rather than the inflationary effects of a depreciating dollar. **********Analysts noted that the dollar had fallen only against the Japanese yen and major European currencies and not against the currencies of countries from which large amounts of textiles and clothing are bought. **********The rise in the price index last month was actually somewhat less than the increase of two-tenths of 1 percent the Government published. Before rounding, the advance was 0.1831502 for the month, which translates to a seasonally adjusted compound annual rate of 2.2 percent. The index now stands at 314.4; this means a basket of goods and services that cost $10 in 1967 now costs $31.44.       $      Aug.'86   July '86   Aug.'85   July '86       ALL ITEMS        U.S.   328.6   0.2*   1.6   0.6        N.Y.   325.9   0.2   3.2   0.8        FOOD AND BEVERAGE        U.S.   314.4*   0.9*   4.2   2.7*        N.Y.   327.4   0.7   5.8   2.2        HOUSING        U.S.   361.1*   0.2*   2.7   0.9*        N.Y.   341.7   0.2   3.9   0.8        TRANSPORTATION        U.S.   300.8*   -0.9*   -6.0   -2.8*        N.Y.   330.2   -0.9   -3.9   -3.0        MEDICAL CARE        U.S.   437.4*   0.6*   7.6   2.4*        N.Y.   445.1   0.3   8.2   1.5        ENTERTAINMENT        U.S.   274.8*   0.0*   3.4   0.1*        N.Y.   294.4   0.2   7.8   0.5"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/09/business/debartolo-s-climb-builder-began-at-13.html": {"writer_name": "Albert Scardino", "pub_date": "1986-10-09", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1017, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEBARTOLO'S CLIMB: BUILDER BEGAN AT 13", "print_headline": "DEBARTOLO'S CLIMB: BUILDER BEGAN AT 13", "body_text": " **********Edward J. DeBartolo has never moved from the house he built in Youngstown, Ohio, in 1959 for himself and his family of four. But it is one of the few moves he has not made. **********In the last 27 years, Mr. DeBartolo has developed the longest chain of shopping centers in the United States, including 51 malls. He owns hotels and office complexes, major league sports teams, race tracks and land. And if he succeeds in his bid with Paul A. Bilzerian to buy the Allied Stores Corporation for $3.5 billion, he will become a landlord who swallowed his tenants. **********In the Allied offer, real estate plays an important part, as it has in many acquisitions and buyouts in recent months, including the leveraged buyout at Macy's and the liquidation of Gimbels. This time, however, it is the holder of the real estate who is acquiring the retailer, not the retailer shedding its real estate. **********Allied and the DeBartolo organization have worked closely together for years, negotiating leases for Allied's department stores and specialty shops in DeBartolo retail centers. Allied's board approved the sale Tuesday as a friendly merger to stave off a competing bid from the Campeau Corporation. Mr. DeBartolo praised Allied's management team and the company returned the compliments. Started in the Depression **********Mr. DeBartolo (born Parnessa) entered the construction business during the Depression when, at 13, he began preparing estimates for his stepfather, a master mason and general contractor who could not read English. **********In 1948, at the age of 30, he founded his own company, and, after a few years of building stores for others, decided to become a developer. In the early 1950's, he plunged into an uncharted business, building strip shopping centers in the suburban neighborhoods around Youngstown. When that worked, he gradually stretched to other areas of the Middle West. **********By the end of the decade, he was ready to try another idea, the enclosed shopping mall. Again, he started at home, building his first mall in the suburbs of Youngstown, a development that, more than 60 million square feet later, he still refers to as his favorite project. Race Tracks Acquired **********During the 1960's, Mr. DeBartolo made his first major foray into a new business, thoroughbred race courses, because of what he saw as an undervalued, underlying real estate asset. **********Track owners found few backers willing to finance their operations, so the companies were chronically short of cash, Mr. DeBartolo said. However, because they occupied such large acreage in urban areas, they were worth holding onto, he said. He bought tracks in Cleveland and Chicago, then later added Louisiana Downs in Shreveport. Now, they operate profitably, and Mr. DeBartolo is building a fourth track, this one in Oklahoma City. **********The race tracks were the first of Mr. DeBartolo's many involvements with professional sports, some of them spectacular successes and others just as dramatic failures. In fact, Mr. DeBartolo was a far more familiar figure to sports fans than to business people. A Super Bowl Winner **********He purchased the San Francisco 49ers football franchise for his son, Edward Jr., to run, and the team promptly won the Super Bowl. He then created another football franchise, the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League, and installed his daughter, Marie Denise York, at its head. But the Maulers failed, along with the rest of the U.S.F.L., and so did another Pittsburgh team he owned, the Spirits of the Major Indoor Soccer League. **********His worst failure involved not the two teams he folded but a team he never was allowed to buy, the Chicago White Sox. Mr. DeBartolo agreed in 1980 to purchase the White Sox for $20 million, but the deal was scuttled when the other American League club owners refused to approve the sale and admit him into the league. It was his race tracks, they said, and the fact that he would be an absentee owner. **********As Mr. DeBartolo said at the time, other clubs had been sold to absentee owners and to people who had interests in race tracks. Well then, said Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, maybe it was the high-pressure lobbying Mr. DeBartolo applied to try to persuade the owners to change their decision. Realty Holdings Grow **********Whatever its impact on Mr. DeBartolo's pride, his rejection by the baseball owners did little to slow his real estate plans. Since 1980, he has added office parks and downtown complexes of retail space, offices and hotels to his portfolio. **********He has two malls under construction in central Florida, in addition to the 20 he has built and operates there. Fifteen more are in the planning stages around the country. He is building a one-million-square-foot complex of hotel and retail space in downtown San Antonio and a development of similar size in New Orleans. **********His latest innovations involve financing. To reduce his borrowing costs, he sold $250 million worth of Eurobonds to refinance five of his malls and intends to introduce a credit card next year that can be used only in DeBartolo malls. **********A RUNDOWN OF DEBARTOLO HOLDINGS  Major properties of Edward J. DeBartolo, whose net worth has been estimated to exceed $600 million before announcement of his deal to buy Allied Stores. Many holdings are owned through the Edward J.

Col. Oliver L. North, then an official of the National Security Council, helped a conservative political action committee mount a campaign this year that was designed to defeat Congressional opponents of military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, people familiar with the effort said today. **********Law-enforcement officials reported, meanwhile, that the Federal Bureau of Investigation planned to look into allegations that some of the profits from arms sales to Iran were diverted to right-wing groups, including the one with which Colonel North cooperated, the little-known National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty. $5 Million Reportedly Involved The allegations were first made today in a Massachusetts newspaper, The Lowell Sun, which said White House officials, including Colonel North, knew about such a scheme. In a report by its Washington correspondent, Tom Squitieri, the paper said about $5 million from Iran arms sales had been involved. **********Efforts by The New York Times to confirm the report were unsuccessful. The Times reported on Aug. 7, 1985, that an official of the National Security Council had become deeply involved in helping plan strategy for the Nicaraguan rebels. The official also advised private individuals on how to donate funds to help the rebels. The account said the official's name was being withheld for security reasons, but he was identified in subsequent stories as Colonel North. **********Denies Receiving Arms Funds **********Carl R. Channell, who heads the Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, denied in an interview last week that his organization had received funds from the arms sales. But he said Colonel North, who was dismissed from his job on the National Security Council on Nov. 25, assisted in his group's multimillion-dollar publicity campaign on behalf of the rebels, known as contras. **********According to sources familiar with the campaign, Colonel North gave information to Mr. Channell, a 41-year-old West Virginian with a reputation as a skilled fund-raiser, and spoke to groups from which Mr. Channell was seeking contributions. Adam Goodman, political director of the Robert Goodman Agency of Baltimore, which produced television ads for Mr. Channell, said Colonel North had often appeared at fund-raising dinners to describe the situation in Central America. Meetings With North Reported **********The Miami Herald said today that Mr. Channell met with Colonel North ''5 or 10 times'' this year, and that Patrick J. Buchanan, the White House communications director, sat in on several meetings. **********Mr. Buchanan denied any knowledge of fund diversions in a television interview, saying, ''Since I was unaware of the arms sales to Iran, I certainly don't know what was done with the profits.'' **********A White House spokesman declined comment on all of the reports. **********Colonel North's involvement raises questions of propriety and perhaps of legality. Active-duty military officers and other Government employees are barred from partisan political activity. In addition, diversion of profits from arms sales to electoral campaigns would violate Federal election laws. **********Mr. Channell said that in the course of his efforts on behalf of the contras, he had ''several'' meetings with Colonel North. He said one of the things Colonel North did was to provide him with ample quantities of documents and other printed material about Nicaragua that had been translated and published by the State Department's Office of Public Diplomacy for Central America and the Caribbean. **********At another point in the interview, Mr. Channell said he had ''barely met'' Colonel North. He said two of their meetings had actually been group briefings organized by the public liaison office of the White House. **********According to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d, up to $30 million in profits from clandestine arms sales to Iran was diverted to the contras, but contra leaders have said they never received the money. Colonel North, who was dismissed as a result of the diversion, has refused to tell Congressional investigators exactly what he did. **********The Lowell Sun, which has a single correspondent in its Washington Bureau, is a family-owned newspaper with a daily circulation of 65,000. It is distributed in a 20-town area in northeastern Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. **********The Sun identified two Republican Senators and one G.O.P. Senate candidate as recipients of Iranian money funneled through Mr. Channell's organization and others. They were Senators Paula Hawkins of Florida and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama and Representative Ken Kramer of Colorado, who sought the seat being vacated by Senator Gary Hart. All three of them were contra supporters, and all three were defeated. **********Mr. Goodman's agency produced the television commercials for both Mrs. Hawkins and Mr. Denton. Congressman Complained **********In the Colorado campaign, a spokesman for Representative Timothy E. Wirth, the Democrat who defeated Mr. Kramer, complained bitterly about what he termed ''vicious, distorted commercials'' financed by a group called the American Conservative Trust. That is one of a pair of political action committees headed by Mr. Channell; his other is called the Anti-Terrorism America Committee. Mr. Channell is also listed in Federal records as head of a lobbying unit called Sentinel. **********Sentinel sponsored hard-hitting television commercials against Representative Michael D. Barnes of Maryland, an outspoken opponent of aid to the contras, during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic Senatorial nomination this year. Mr. Barnes said today that he would ask for a Congressional investigation of the possible use of profits from the arms sales against him and several other Democratic Representatives. **********''If it's true,'' he said, ''it would be an absolutely unbelievable outrage, but I obviously have no way of knowing if it's true.'' Other Reported Targets **********Among the other reported targets were Representatives Ed Jones, Jim Cooper and Bill Boner of Tennessee; Romano L. Mazzoli of Kentucky; Charles O. Whitley and W. G. (Bill) Hefner of North Carolina, and J. J. Pickle, E. (Kika) de la Garza and Albert S. Bustamante of Texas. All are Democrats, all opposed military aid for the contras, and all won their elections. **********Mr. Pickle said in a telephone interview from his home in Austin that ads used against him were ''reprehensible, offensive and distasteful.'' They tried to picture him as unpatriotic, he said, ''even though I spent three and a half years in the South Pacific and was on a cruiser that was torpedoed there during World War II.'' **********Mr. de la Garza said ''there was a very nasty negative commercial'' used against him in May, even though he had an opponent in neither the primary nor the general election. He added: ''It showed my face surrounded by Castro, Ortega, Gorbachev and other Communist leaders. We couldn't figure out where it came from.'' **********Mr. Bustamante said he was so offended by what he termed the ''underhanded tactics'' used in a television commercial against him that he had complained to the White House, which said that ''some group'' was responsible for it. If the commercial was financed with arms-sales revenue, he said, ''that further infuriates me.'' Says He Spent $4 Million **********In the interview last week, Mr. Channell, who could not be reached today, said that all the money he spent was contributed by wealthy Americans and that he would say ''under as many oaths as you prefer that I never received or asked for money from any foreign government or corporation.'' He said his organizations had spent about $4 million in trying to win backing for military aid to the rebels. **********At other times, he has put the figure as high as $6 million or $7 million. According to Mr. Goodman, $1.5 million was spent on pro-contra television commercials since January 1985 through his Baltimore agency. **********Most of the money, Mr. Channell said last week, was spent on television commercials urging people to write to their legislators in support of aid to the contras. He said the commercials were broadcast primarily in districts where members of Congress had opposed contra aid or had wavered on Central American issues. **********Congress approved $100 million last summer in aid to the contras, including $70 million in military assistance, and President Reagan signed papers in October to resume the flow of military supplies. **********Mr. Channell offered on Wednesday to show a reporter for The New York Times copies or records of checks received from contributors to his groups. He set an appointment for Friday to do so, but then postponed the interview on the ground that he had been too busy to tell his donors what he planned to do. **********But Mr. Channell said that he personally ''raised 77 percent of all the money'' received by his organization and that he knew most of his contributors well. **********Asked if it was possible that some of the individual contributors might be funneling money from elsewhere, Mr. Channell said he was ''100 percent clear of any fantasy like that.'' **********''When you see the names of my contributors,'' he said, ''you'll realize that is not the case.''

Said to Intercede With Pentagon **********According to The Miami Herald, Colonel North's involvement was considerably more far-reaching than Mr. Channell indicated. The paper said he had interceded with the Pentagon to get a copy of a videotape of Soviet helicopters in Nicaragua for use in television commercials and had sometimes grabbed the phone from Mr. Channell's hand to appeal directly to wealthy contributors to step up their support. **********Quoting a Washington consultant who has worked with both Mr. Channell and Colonel North on Nicaraguan projects, the Herald said Mr. Channell had worked ''directly with the White House'' on the commercials. **********Federal files contain no record of Sentinel's spending for advertising in the Barnes campaign, according to The Associated Press, even though it was listed as the sponsor of a commercial linking the Maryland Congressman with Fidel Castro of Cuba, Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua, Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. Lobbying groups are required to file spending reports with Congress. **********Mr. Channell worked from 1979 to 1982 for the National Conservative Political Action Committee, the best known of the so-called hard-right political organizations. Then he left to go into business for himself. In June, he said he was ''working on lists from the Forbes 400 to Palm Beach Life to find my people who will give $50 million'' to finance his operations in 1987. Several Laws Cited **********If any profits from the Iran arms sales were diverted to political campaigns, several Federal laws, including criminal laws, may have been violated. **********For instance, the Federal election and campaign laws require that political contributions be reported to the Federal Election Commission and publicly disclosed, and they provide criminal penalties for intentional violations. **********Also, Federal statutes making it a felony for anyone to defraud the Government, to steal Government property or to convert such property ''to his use or the use of another'' might apply if the profits from the arms sales were deemed to be Government property, about which there is some dispute. **********Moreover, Section 595 of the Federal Criminal Code provides a one-year prison term for any Federal employee ''employed in any administrative position'' who ''uses his official authority for the purpose of interfering with, or affecting'' a Federal election. **********Aside from criminal sanctions, the Hatch Act of 1939 provides dismissal or suspension for Federal employees, with certain high-level exceptions, who ''take an active part in political management or in political campaigns.'' **********Military personnel appear to be subject to some of the restrictions on political activities by Federal employees and would probably be subject to even tighter restrictions under military law, given the longstanding tradition against interference by the military in politics."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/16/world/lebanese-christians-oust-militia-leader.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1986-01-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 681, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "LEBANESE CHRISTIANS OUST MILITIA LEADER", "print_headline": "LEBANESE CHRISTIANS OUST MILITIA LEADER", "body_text": " **********Christian supporters of a Syrian-sponsored pact for peace in Lebanon were defeated today in fierce clashes that engulfed Christian areas north and northeast of here. **********The development was widely viewed as a major, and possibly fatal, blow to the Syrian-brokered accord, which entailed drastic changes in Lebanon's 42-year-old political system. It was based parity in sharing of power between Moslems and Christians. **********President Amin Gemayel, a Christian and leader of the Phalangist Party, opposed the main provisions of the pact, which was supported by another Christian leader, Elie Hobeika, head of the militia known as the Lebanese Forces. Mr. Hobeika signed the accord last month, along with the leaders of the mainstream Shiite movement, Amal, and the Progressive Socialist Party, a Druse organization. **********The dramatic defeat of Mr. Hobeika's forces by militiamen loyal to Mr. Gemayel came 24 hours after the President returned to Bikfaya, his family's home town, from two days of unsuccessful talks in Damascus with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. Mr. Gemayel was said to have held to his opposition to the peace accord. Objections to Pact **********Mr. Gemayel and other prominent Christian leaders complained that the pact was unfair to the Christians in general and in particular to the Maronite Catholics, the sect to which Mr. Gemayel and the majority of Phalange leaders belong. Mr. Hobeika, like Mr. Gemayel a Maronite, had argued that without adjusting the political order there can be no end to the civil war, now in its 11th year. **********The Phalangist Party issued a statement saying that what happened today was an internal Christian affair with no reflection on the Syrian role in Lebanon, but political commentators said the Damascus pact was the main casualty of the fighting and that Lebanon was back to the gloomy prospect of continuing civil strife. **********Mr. Hobeika was reported to have ordered his men to lay down their arms and was given safe conduct out of his headquarters at Karantina, a seaside neighborhood of Christian East Beirut, by the Lebanese Army. **********Within one hour of the news of Mr. Hobeika's defeat, fighting broke out on the Green Line separating East Beirut from the Moslem West, and artillery shells slammed into Bikfaya in the mountains of northeast of Beirut. Attack on Hobeika Strongholds **********Mr. Hobeika was beaten when his second in command, Samir Geagea, turned against him and joined hands with President Gemayel's Phalangist Party in a full-scale offensive that began at daybreak and was directed at all pro-Hobeika strongholds in the capital, the port of Juniye and the Christian heartland north of Beirut. **********Tanks, artillery and automatic weapons were used in the battles. **********The Phalangist Party, the country's mainstream Christian organization, founded by Mr. Gemayel's father 49 years ago, regained control of its radio and television stations and a daily newspaper, which had been taken from it earlier by Mr. Hobeika's forces. **********The Voice of Lebanon radio, now under Phalangist control, accused the pro-Damascus National Syrian Social Party of shelling Bikfaya. Militiamen of the National Syrian Social Party are entrenched in the hills above Bikfaya. Syrian troops, part of a force of 25,000 men stationed in northern and eastern Lebanon, are also deployed there. **********Druse fighters, followers of Walid Jumblat, leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, hold positions in the eastern hills overlooking the Presidential Palace in the Beirut suburb of Baabda. **********The Voice of Lebanon accused Shiite militiamen of firing into East Beirut from their positions on the Green Line in the Moslem part of the capital. The radio said one man was killed by sniper fire from West Beirut. **********Mr. Jumblat met here today with the Amal leader, Nabih Berri, to assess developments in the Christian sector.

France ordered the expulsion of two Libyan diplomats on April 5, the day that Libyans purportedly carried out the bombing of a West Berlin discotheque. **********According to the American officials, Libyans planned to toss grenades and open fire at those waiting on line at the visa office on Rue St. Florentin, near the Place de la Concorde. **********Mr. Reagan said Monday that ''with the help of French authorities, we recently aborted one such attack: a planned massacre using grenades and small arms, of civilians waiting in line for visas at an American embassy.'' Divulging of Intelligence **********The officials said the information divulged by Mr. Reagan and others about intercepted Libyan messages had raised problems for intelligence agencies because Libya was now likely to alter its communication methods. The officials said this was a calculated risk, taken so that Mr. Reagan could make as convincing a case as possible in justifying the raid on Libya. **********The most sensitive information revealed by Mr. Reagan dealt with the messages to and from the Libyan mission in East Berlin before and after the West Berlin discotheque bombing, which killed an American serviceman and a Turkish woman, and injured 200 people, including 50 Americans. **********On March 25, Mr. Reagan said, orders were sent from Tripoli to the Libyan mission in East Berlin ''to conduct a terrorist attack against Americans, to cause maximum and indiscriminate casualties.'' Reacting to Gulf of Sidra Clash **********American officials said similar messages had gone to virtually every Libyan mission abroad because of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's anger at the American use of force in the Gulf of Sidra that day. The messages were sent by the Libyan intelligence branch and not through the usual Foreign Ministry channels. **********On April 4, Mr. Reagan said, the East Berlin mission ''alerted Tripoli that the attack would be carried out the following morning.'' He said that on April 5, after the discotheque bombing, ''they reported back to Tripoli on the great success of their mission.'' **********American intelligence officials were pleased that Mr. Reagan did not say how the United States had gained that information. It is assumed that it came either from an intercepted radio message whose code was broken by the National Security Agency, which collects electronic intelligence, or from a spy in the East Berlin mission. **********In either case, Libya can now be expected to be on its guard, United States officials said. Qaddafi Likely to Seek Revenge **********American intelligence officials, in appraising the situation in Libya, said that Colonel Qaddafi was probably enraged by the attack, which Libyan officials said killed one of his children and wounded two others. **********''We can expect Qaddafi to go all out in seeking revenge,'' an official said. ''We have not seen the end of this.'' The State Department advised Americans to exercise caution in foreign travel. **********Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Monday that Libya had been conducting surveillance and planning attacks on about 30 United States embassies, of which 10 were said by other officials to have been in Africa. **********The information on surveillance came from American security people who had identified Libyans following diplomats or watching the movements of diplomats' children on their way to and from school. **********Security concerns focused on small American embassies in such African countries as Rwanda and Burundi. Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman, said three Libyan agents had arrived in one African country to bomb the American Embassy and kidnap the ambassador. Officials declined to identify the country. **********Members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were briefed today by the Central Intelligence Agency on the information collected about Libya. According to a participant in the closed-door hearing, the senators had no problem accepting the contention of the Administration that Libya was planning attacks and had been responsible for the West Berlin bombing. **********What concerns them, the participant said, is whether the divulging of information is compromising the intelligence agencies' ability to collect data.

Founded in 1946 **********The airline was founded in 1946 by Ray Wilson, a barnstorming pilot, with two planes and a handful of employees. It gradually replaced the passenger train as the main form of transportation in the West and before its demise knitted together 55 cities in 22 states and Canada. **********Even though it had grown to 4,700 employees, some said it was able to retain a homespun quality because many of the workers knew each other. **********Richard C. Kardell, a pilot and captain of one of Frontier's Boeing 737 airplanes, said that unlike those of larger carriers, Frontier's routes were short enough so that one went out in the morning and usually was back in Denver at night. **********''I know my mechanics and ground handlers,'' he said. He often flew with the same three crew members in the cockpit, which enabled them to develop an esprit missing at larger carriers. **********''There's more of a feeling that we are part of a family,'' he said. Employees Took Deep Cuts **********The members of the five unions -made up of pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, ground handlers and reservation workers - also dug deep into their pockets to help the airline cope with the competitive pressures of deregulation. **********Since 1983, when the airline began to have financial problems, they as a group have given up about 47 percent of their pay. They acted to enable the carrier to withstand the fierce fare wars that often began with distant carriers but which nevertheless swept over Frontier's routes. **********The unions also tried at one time to buy the airline through an employee stock ownership plan by using $265 million paid by United Airlines for 25 of Frontier's Boeing 737's. Unions Backed People **********The effort failed, however, and the unions played an important role in enabling People Express to take over the airline last November. They supported Donald C. Burr, the chief executive of People, and opposed an offer by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Texas Air. **********For a time, many Frontier workers and union leaders hoped that Mr. Burr could bring life and a coherent strategy to turn the airline around. **********Even though Mr. Burr had expressed his abhorrence of unions, many union workers in interviews said then that they had an open mind and would give him a chance. **********Mr. Burr had high hopes for Frontier. **********In a past interview, he said that his vision was to create a ''bridge'' between People's hub at Newark International Airport and Frontier's hub in Denver by using huge Boeing 747's. Large numbers of leisure travelers would be able to fly from Newark to Denver and then connect to vacation spots. **********Last February, People made a bold move and cut fares in the West, including a reduction in the fare between Newark and Denver from $99 to $69. Spartan Approach Failed **********People's no-frill strategy backfired, however. People could not get heavy traffic on its aircraft, and many Frontier customers who were used to getting free drinks, food and baggage check-in balked at People's spartan approach. **********Mr. Burr acknowledged in later interviews that the strategy had been ''a disaster.'' **********From that point, People had to begin to stem its own losses, and Frontier with its losses of $10 million a month became an albatross to Mr. Burr, Dan Kaspar, an aviation consultant for Harbridge House, a consulting firm, said that Frontier was already staggering by the time it was acquired and that People probably could do little to stem the losses. **********He said Frontier's management was not able to come up with a coherent, long-range strategy to cope with the pressure unleashed by deregulation. **********''It's a strategic failure. They never did figure out who they wanted to be,'' Mr. Kaspar said. Navigation Lore **********While the airline had thrived earlier, it had also gone through some turbulent times. **********Chick Stevens, a pilot for Frontier for 30 years who has written parts of the history of the airline, recalled that when Mr. Wilson started the airline in 1946 with two pilots and two DC 3's, the airline could not fly at night or in bad visiblity. That was because the Federal Aviation Administration had not put in navigation facilities in the mountainous region. This caused many flight cancellations. **********Mr. Wilson decided to buy navigational beacons and put them along the airline's routes, enabling it to fly at night and in bad weather. **********Another problem that almost bankrupted the airline was that the DC 3 took about 15 minutes to reach the altitude of 13,000 feet needed to get through many of the passes in the Rockies. As a result, pilots had to make many turns to reach the altitude, running up huge fuel bills. Buyout in 1949 **********Mr. Stevens said the airline almost went bankrupt in 1949, but Harold Darr, a wealthy industrialist from Chicago, injected new money by buying 51 percent of the stock and becoming president. **********Since the airline operated in often treacherous weather and rough terrain, Mr. Stevens recalled that pilots had to know roads, landmarks, rivers and railroad tracks so they could navigate in bad weather."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/13/world/syrians-in-lebanon-said-to-carve-a-trench-system-closer-to-israel.html": {"writer_name": "Thomas Friedman", "pub_date": "1986-05-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 896, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SYRIANS IN LEBANON SAID TO CARVE A TRENCH SYSTEM CLOSER TO ISRAEL", "print_headline": "SYRIANS IN LEBANON SAID TO CARVE A TRENCH SYSTEM CLOSER TO ISRAEL", "body_text": " **********In the last few months the Syrian Army has been building forward artillery and tank trenches in southern Lebanon that are closer to the Israeli border, Israeli and Western military sources said today. **********So far, the Syrians have not installed any military hardware in the trenches, which have been carved to provide earthen protection to fit both armor and long-range artillery pieces, the Israeli and Western sources said. **********Nonetheless, there is considerable concern among Israeli military and political leaders about what they call the Syrian ''creeping'' to within 10 to 15 miles of the Israel-Lebanon border, and only 5 to 10 miles from the strip that Israel has declared a ''security zone'' in southern Lebanon. The development accounts in part for the current tension between the two countries. **********'They Aren't Just Gardening' **********''We know they aren't just gardening,'' said a senior Israeli military analyst. ''The emplacements could absorb a sizeable armored unit and launch it forward.'' **********Deploying artillery and tanks in the trenches, which could be done at short notice, would enable the Syrians to threaten Israel's security zone in Lebanon and greatly enhance their ability to hit targets in northern Israel with artillery, the Israeli analyst said. **********Moreover, Israeli officials view the move as a potential violation of an unwritten understanding between Israel and Syria that after most Israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from central and southern Lebanon last year, Syria would not move forces into the void. **********The Syrian move is believed to have prompted a discussion within both the Israeli Cabinet and the army general staff over how Israel should respond. Diplomatic Options Explored **********Some Israeli officials have argued that the move is not yet strategically significant enough to merit any Israeli action, while others have argued to the contrary. **********For now, Israel appears to be trying to exhaust all diplomatic options to get the Syrians to pull back. At Israel's behest, the American Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, Richard W. Murphy, twice brought up the issue with the Syrians, but to no avail. **********What makes the Syrian action especially troubling to Israeli decision makers is that it comes after Syria decided last November to move long-range surface-to-air missile batteries closer to the Lebanese border. That move made it impossible for Israel to fly reconnaissance missions over southern and central Lebanon without the risk of being hit by Syrian missiles, and Israel's reconnaissance of some areas has been hampered somewhat as a result, Israeli military sources said. Israelis Fear Erosion of Position **********The move also follows an attempt, which Israeli officials have linked to Syria, to blow up an El Al Israel Airlines jetliner flying from London last month. **********Defense sources said there is now a considerable body of opinion in the Israeli military establishment that believes the Syrian President, Hafez al-Assad, is trying to nibble away at Israel's overall defense position with bites small enough not to automatically trigger an Israeli response. **********''Assad apparently believes that the Israeli public is not prepared to go to war,'' an Israeli military source said, ''and that he can make small gains by operating just below the threshold that would trigger Israel's deterrence mechanism. It's a dangerous game.'' **********The Syrians apparently see aggressive intentions on the Israeli side as well. The Syrian decision to redeploy their missile batteries was made after the downing on Nov. 19, 1985, of two Syrian MIG-23's by Israeli fighter jets in Syrian airspace. It also followed the interception last February by Israel of a private Libyan executive jet flying from Tripoli to Damascus on which Israel suspected incorrectly that a senior Palestinian leader was flying. The plane was allowed to continue to Damascus after Syrian officials aboard were questioned. Syria vowed at the time to retaliate. **********According to Western sources, beginning in late March, when the winter in Lebanon ended, the Syrians sent unarmed army engineers into southern Lebanon. **********Working with local Lebanese laborers, the Syrians began digging clusters of trenches and emplacements that could hold tanks or artillery. One cluster was dug south and north of a line running from the southern Lebanese village of Rasheiye to the southern tip of Lake Karun, the Western sources said. The other cluster was dug into hillsides around the southern Lebanese village of Shabaa, in an area once used extensively as a staging ground by Palestinian guerrillas. **********The trenches south of Rasheiye and in Shabaa are farther south than the southernmost Syrian position before the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982, Western sources said. **********''They have returned to their old lines and then a little bit more,'' an Israeli military analyst said. ''I think they are trying to tell us something.'' **********The bulk of Syrian forces in Lebanon are stationed along the Beirut-Damascus highway and in the north. Even before the summer of 1982, Syrian troops did not venture in number into southern Lebanon, and certainly did not set up positions south of Lake Karun, which Israel considered a ''red line'' and which Syria largely respected as such.

The newspaper Pravda Ukrainy said in October that compensation for each family affected by the disaster ranged between 15,000 and 30,000 rubles, depending on the belongings lost. #2 Reactors Started The most obvious signal of the Russians' desire to show their ability to recover from the disaster has been the quick start-up of two undamaged reactors in the Chernobyl plant and the assignment to work of more than 600 people, including about 500 who worked at the plant before the explosion and fire April 26. **********Yet it seemed clear on a recent trip to the area by Western correspondents that firsthand access to the plant and the evacuated area about 18 1/2 miles around it is still tightly restricted. **********Moreover, for all the information offered by the Russians about the causes and consequences of the accident, they still appear to find it difficult to confront some aspects of the disaster, particularly the potential long-term consequences to those exposed to the radioactive fallout. **********Other long-term consequences of the accident are evident in the Ukrainian capital. Nikolai V. Lavrukhin, a Kiev city official, said that, while cold weather prevents washing the city streets, they are still being vacuumed to keep them free of radioactive dust. **********The fall leaves have been buried in nuclear waste dumps. For three months the city did not draw water from the Dnieper, its age-old water source, but from its secondary source, the Desna, and from a network of hastily dug artesian wells. Mr. Lavrukhin said that in December Dnieper water was again flowing through city pipes. Environmental Radiation **********A United States Government study issued in September estimated that the Chernobyl accident sent as much long-term radiation into the environment as all previous nuclear tests and bombs combined. Anatoly Y. Romanenko, Health Minister of the Ukraine, said Thursday that the average radiation level in Kiev's atmosphere is twice what it was before the accident, though well within safe limits. **********Aside from the 31 people who died after the accident, most of them from radiation exposure, and 209 others who were reported to have suffered radiation exposure, he said: ''We haven't had a single case of radiation disease. We hope and are sure that there will be no such diseases.'' No Cancer Estimates **********Mr. Romanenko and a Ukrainian radiologist both shied away from any direct estimate of the number of additional cancer cases that may develop among the people exposed to Chernobyl's fallout. **********Two of the engineers now back at work at the plant made no reference to any worries about radiation. In fact, they said, while they wear protective suits and hats, they no longer wear anything over mouth and nose while working in the main building at the four-reactor complex. **********Gennady A. Duk, the shift supervisor at the newly restarted Unit 1 reactor at Chernobyl, said he works an 8- to 12-hour shift at the plant for a 15-day stretch, commuting to and from the new workers' settlement at Zeleny Mis. He added that he spends 5 to 10 days a month in his Kiev apartment. **********''We make good money,'' he said, but he would not be specific, other than to say his monthly salary exceeded 500 rubles, more than double the normal Soviet monthly wage. **********Mr. Duk, who is 49 years old, said he and his family have recently moved into a new apartment in Kiev, where, according to Ukrainian officials, 8,000 apartments were turned over to former residents of Pripyat, the town adjacent to the plant where most Chernobyl workers lived before the accident. Sleeping on a Boat **********Mr. Duk said that for three months after the accident, while continuing to work at the plant, he slept on a passenger boat moored on the Dnieper north of Kiev. **********This fall, like other Pripyat residents, he was able to go back to his apartment and retrieve some of his belongings. **********Like Leonid Vodolazhek, another Chernobyl engineer now working on the plant, Mr. Duk expects to go back to Pripyat in the spring or summer of next year - by which time, Soviet authorities have predicted, the settlement will have been decontaminated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/world/unicef-says-fund-for-africa-is-at-only-3-percent-of-goal.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-20", "snippet": "", "word_count": 92, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Unicef Says Fund for Africa Is at Only 3 Percent of Goal", "print_headline": "Unicef Says Fund for Africa Is at Only 3 Percent of Goal", "body_text": " **********The United Nations Children's Fund has received only $3.2 million of the $102 million in voluntary contributions for which it has appealed to fund its 1986 emergency programs in 16 African countries, a spokesman at the agency said today. **********The spokesman, Kristina Schellinski, said Unicef programs in Ethiopia had received $60,000 of the $17 million needed to fund them this year and might shut down soon. **********Only Japan, Sweden and the Soviet Union have contributed to the appeal so far, she said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/world/the-un-today-july-8-1986.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-08", "snippet": "", "word_count": 26, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "Schedule", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "The U.N.

Yet the most important defendant is not a person, but the Mafia itself. **********The prosecution will try to prove how individual acts were part of a vast criminal conspiracy born centuries ago and now able to reach from Bangkok to Brooklyn. Much of this effort will rest on the first testimony in Italy by Mafia members who in confessions have detailed how a well-organized command structure runs the modern Mafia. **********Without expecting this one trial to knock out the Mafia, many law enforcement officials and political leaders here hope it will both weaken it and reinforce efforts to attack its deep roots in Sicilian society. Fear of Harmful Effects **********The broader impact of the trial is is already the subject of a muted but sensitive controversy. Public figures as prominent as Salvatore Cardinal Pappalardo of Palermo and the city's Mayor, Leoluca Orlando, have voiced concern that such a huge and highly publicized proceeding could harmfully enlarge the Mafia's mythic status. **********The 8,607-page indictment conveys the scope of the undertaking in its first sentence: ''This is the trial of the Mafia organization called Cosa Nostra, a very dangerous criminal association, which, with violence and intimidation, has sown and sows death and terror.'' **********In a trial expected to last more than a year, the single most important crime to be explored is the assassination on Sept. 3, 1982, of Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, the top law-enforcement officer in Sicily and the Prefect, or regional governor, of Palermo. **********''The Dalla Chiesa killing is one of the Mafia's great blunders,'' said Pino Arlachi, of Parliament's Anti-Mafia Commission, ''and in this trial his assassination will be used to show how a highly organized Mafia defended its economic interests.'' **********The indictment charges that the entire leadership of the Sicilian Mafia agreed to commission the killing because the general had discovered ties between Mafia bosses and some of the island's most successful businessmen. To Cover Many Other Killings **********The trial will also cover the assassinations of several other officials, along with about 90 killings of Mafia members that occurred in a three-year war between two Mafia factions. **********The three-year investigation leading to the trial took advantage of a 1982 anti-Mafia law that allowed substantial access to bank records. By tracing finances and other evidence, prosecutors say they can reveal the breadth of Sicilian involvement in the international heroin trade and its enormous profitability. The records of one Swiss bank account purportedly show the Tomaso Spadaro faction collecting an average of $20 million a year from drug sales in the United States. **********Much of the prosecution's indictment rests on charges of delinquent association, similar to continuing criminal conspiracy under United State Federal law. Both laws allow the state to jail individuals by showing they associated with one another to commit crimes. **********''In the past we looked at individual crimes like single pieces of a jigsaw puzzle with no clear idea of the connections between them,'' said Judge Justo Sciacchitano of the Palermo criminal court. ''Now we have found the connections, and instead of looking at pieces, we are going to look at the whole puzzle put together.'' Informers Were the Key **********The Sicilian magistrates were able to see the big picture only after informers provided what the indictment calls the key to reading many facts already collected. Chief among the informers is Tomasso Buscetta, who last fall testified in the New York trial of 22 defendants in a heroin-smuggling conspiracy. **********As in New York, Mr. Buscetta's primary role here will be to describe the functioning of the cupola or commission that he says was the Mafia's senior decision-making body. All 12 men suspected of being members of the group have been indicted, but 7 of them are among the more than 200 defendants who are fugitives. **********Magistrates in the case say Mr. Buscetta's testimony and that of about 30 other informers might have the greatest impact outside the courtoom. **********''In addition to breaking the Mafia's code of silence,'' Judge Sciacchitano said, ''Buscetta is sending a message to his people that he had contact with the state and that he has put his trust in the state. We can hope others like him will follow because his acts undercut the very foundation of the Mafia's relationship with society in which the Mafia substitutes for the state.'' Economic Needs Cited **********Mayor Orlando said: ''For too long Sicilians have first gone to the doctor, the state, looking for a cure and been turned away, and so then they went to the witchdoctor.'' He argued that trials must be combined with economic development in Sicily to be effective. **********Some, like the Mayor, are worried that such development might be retarded by a spectacular trial to which hundreds of journalists have been accredited and which is taking place in a specially built bunker-courtroom. **********Cardinal Pappalardo, who has repeatedly denounced the Mafia, has argued in recent statements that all Sicily will suffer guilt by association. **********''You'll see, it will be said, 'You are all the same, for you there is no hope,' '' he said in an interview. ''Then so many projects and so many generous efforts might be nullified.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/29/world/shamir-denies-israelis-raid-near-beirut-was-retaliatory.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 79, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SHAMIR DENIES ISRAELIS' RAID NEAR BEIRUT WAS RETALIATORY", "print_headline": "SHAMIR DENIES ISRAELIS' RAID NEAR BEIRUT WAS RETALIATORY", "body_text": " **********Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli Foreign Minister, denied yesterday tha Israel bombed Palestinian sites near Beirut to retaliate for the terrorist bombing of an Istanbul synagogue. **********''Our methods of fighting against terrorism are not in the line of retaliation,'' Mr. Shamir said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.'' **********Asked whether Israel had a policy of retaliating after terrorist acts, Mr. Shamir said that was ''in the past,'' adding, ''Now, we are taking the initiative.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/24/business/president-plans-sharp-cutbacks-in-farm-budget.html": {"writer_name": "Robert Pear", "pub_date": "1986-12-24", "snippet": "", "word_count": 866, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRESIDENT PLANS SHARP CUTBACKS IN FARM BUDGET", "print_headline": "PRESIDENT PLANS SHARP CUTBACKS IN FARM BUDGET", "body_text": " **********President Reagan's new budget will propose sweeping changes in farm programs designed to save more than $16 billion over the next five years, Administration officials said today. **********James C. Miller 3d, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the proposals were based on the assumption that current farm programs, which cost more than $25.5 billion in the fiscal year 1986, had become politically unsustainable. **********Referring to members of Congress, he said, ''A lot more people represent nonfarm districts than farm districts.'' Support for Some Proposals **********Because key concepts in some of the proposals resemble ideas contained in legislation introduced last year by Senators Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, a Republican, and David L. Boren of Oklahoma, a Democrat, the Administration says some of its proposals may receive a favorable reception in Congress. But other proposals, especially those that would cut farmers' income most sharply, are sure to face opposition on Capitol Hill. **********Mr. Miller and other officials described three proposals that they said would be in the budget for the fiscal year 1988 that Mr. Reagan will send to Congress on Jan. 5. **********First, they said, the Administration seeks to break the link tying Federal income support payments to farmers' production. This link gives farmers ''incentives to overproduce,'' according to a report by the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Payments Linked to Crops **********Under the current system, the Government has separate programs for major commodities. Under most of these programs, farmers must grow particular crops to receive direct income support payments from the Government. In general, farmers who grow more receive larger payments. **********Under the Administration's new proposal, farmers could still get substantial payments from the Government when market prices fell below specified ''target prices.'' But farmers would not have to grow crops specified by the Government; they could grow nothing, or a crop of their choice, responding to the market. **********Second, the Administration is proposing to reduce payments to farmers by lowering the target price for each commodity by 10 percent a year through 1991. The Government sets target prices for wheat, corn and other feed grains, as well as rice and cotton. When market prices fall below these levels, the Government makes special payments to farmers who have signed up to participate in its programs. Strict Limits to Be Proposed **********For example, the target price for corn this year was $3.03 a bushel, but the estimated market price was $2 a bushel. Thus, farmers can expect to receive ''deficiency payments'' of about $1.03 a bushel. **********Finally, according to Mr. Miller and other officials, the Administration will propose strict limits on the amount that any farm family can be paid by the Government. Some farmers legally circumvent the current $50,000 limit by dividing their farms and putting them in trust for minor children. **********The Administration has estimated that the cost of farm programs will drop to $17.3 billion in the fiscal year 1992 if its proposals are adopted. Little Savings in 1988 **********The projected savings for the fiscal year 1988, which begins next Oct. 1, are $200 million. Budget officials said it was too late to achieve bigger savings in 1988 because farmers would start signing up for these programs next month and the Government would then have contracts requiring payments to farmers at specified levels. Terms of the contracts are set by law.  But budget officials envision bigger savings in later years: $4.3 billion in 1989, $4.2 billion in 1990 and $3.9 billion each in 1991 and 1992. **********The savings represent the difference between proposed spending levels and the amount that the Government would spend under current law. Even under current law, Federal spending for farm programs is expected to decline, but not nearly so fast as under the President's proposal. **********Mr. Miller said one purpose of the proposal was to ''wean marginal farms off'' Government subsidy programs. Under the Administration proposal, farmers could receive Government payments based on their production in past years. They would not have to plant crops and could leave agriculture for other occupations if they wanted. Some Questions to Be Answered **********Administration officials acknowledged that the proposal made farm programs seem more like welfare because farmers would no longer be required to grow crops. But the officials said there was no reason to continue the fiction that the United States needed all the wheat and corn it produced. **********The officials said there were some questions that had yet to be resolved. For example, they said, Mr. Reagan must decide how to treat farmers who withdraw from Government commodity programs and start growing other crops, such as beans, which are not subsidized by the Government. **********In theory, under Mr. Miller's proposal these farmers would be entitled to payments based on their historical production of wheat, corn, rice and cotton. **********But Agriculture Department officials said such payments would, in effect, provide unintended subsidies for the production of beans and other crops. Farmers receiving Government payments would then have an unfair advantage over unsubsidized producers of beans and might drive them out of business, the officials said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/business/prospects-a-stay-at-home-economy.html": {"writer_name": "Pamela Hollie", "pub_date": "1986-05-25", "snippet": "", "word_count": 742, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A Stay-At-Home Economy", "print_headline": "PROSPECTS; A Stay-At-Home Economy", "body_text": " **********This weekend signals the start of the summer holiday season, and - with more tourists expected to vacation on American shores - it may also herald an improved economy by Labor Day. **********As foreign travel to the United States rises by about 10 percent this year and Americans' overseas travel falls by roughly 25 percent because of fears about terrorism, ''the economy will get a boost of about one-half of 1 percent in the third quarter,'' said Martin Mauro, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics, who predicts third-quarter annual growth of real gross national product will be 4 percent. **********The rise in domestic tourism will also help reduce America's net export deficit, which weighed in at an annual rate of $130.3 billion in the first quarter. Last year, says Mr. Mauro, Americans spent $17 billion in foreign lands. This year, he estimates, the tendency to stay home could shave $6 billion from the deficit in the third quarter. **********Bankers Branch Out **********Big banks are more worried today than ever about their nonbank rivals. And more and more bankers say they plan to defend themselves by branching out into nonbank businesses. According to a 1986 survey by Egon Zehnder International, an executive recruiting firm, 80 percent of 840 executives at the biggest banks plan to buy or develop businesses outside traditional banking. ''This is up from 55 percent last year,'' said Samuel H. Pettway, who directed the survey. **********''The largest banks, with more than $5 billion in assets, are likely to pursue investment banking and leasing,'' said Mr. Pettway. Medium-sized banks, with assets of at least $1 billion, are eyeing mortgage banking; small banks want to expand into insurance. **********Most of the bankers said they must diversify to compete with brokerages and retailers, for example, moving into financial services. ''Some 88 percent said they expected Sears to be their principal competitor by 1991, followed by Merrill Lynch and American Express,'' said Mr. Pettway. And there is much worry about takeovers from outside financial services or banking. ''Some 64 percent of bankers expected non-financial institutions to try to acquire commercial banks,'' he said, ''up from 1 percent a year ago.'' A Taste for Champagne **********At least 250,000 couples will marry next month, according to Bride's magazine. Most will want to celebrate with champagne, but the bubbly may not flow as freely this year. **********As demand soars for both French champagne and the domestic variety, poor weather in France and California has raised prices and reduced supplies. **********''Most firms are selling more champagne than can be replenished,'' said Marvin R. Shanken, publisher of Impact, a spirits publication. Since 1980, United **********States consumption of imported and domestic champagne has risen more than 50 percent, to 19.2 million cases in 1985, says Mr. Shanken. That growth may level off this year, he adds, as prices rise. California champagne, at about $10 a bottle, is about a dollar higher than a year ago. In France, ''producers have raised prices 10 to 20 percent,'' said Mr. Shanken, and the weaker dollar has also pushed up prices. French champagne now sells for about $20 or more. Ambulances Go Private **********Ambulance services used to be run by local governments. But that is quickly changing, says Charles Clark, executive vice president of the American Ambulance Association in Sacramento, Calif., which represents 800 ambulance companies whose revenues total more than $1.5 billion. ''There is a definite trend toward private ambulance service,'' said Mr. Clark. **********In the past 10 years, 55 percent of the nation's towns and cities have drawn up contracts with private ambulance services. And 15 more areas, including Fort Worth, Tex.; Bridgeport, Conn., and Orange County, California, are planning to switch. ''It's a matter of economics,'' said Mr. Clark, who added that Riverside, Calif., for example, is saving $650,000 a year by using private ambulance service. **********What makes some private services less costly? For one thing, says Mr. Clark, many municipally run services have their fire or police departments respond to 911 emergency medical calls - alone, or along with an ambulance. ''It is expensive for a fire truck with six or eight people, one of whom is a paramedic, to rush to a medical emergency,'' he said. For another, many ambulance companies are better than local bureaucracies when it comes to collecting bills."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/business/consumer-rates-most-yields-fall-again.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 376, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Most Yields Fall Again", "print_headline": "CONSUMER RATES; Most Yields Fall Again", "body_text": " **********Yields on certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts declined for the week ended yesterday.

He also ordered an intensified search for a former soldier called Boy Muslim who is a suspect in the shooting. **********Opposition leaders charged earlier this week that supporters of President Marcos had started a post-election wave of killings to cripple their rivals' provincial organizations. **********In the announcement today, the opposition clearly was trying to focus on General Ramos as a figure of possible hope. Some opposition officials, however, noted that in the past he had shown limits to his willingness to challenge the political cronyism that critics say afflicts the Marcos military. **********The general, a West Point-trained officer, is considered a potential leader for the changes in the military long promised by Mr. Marcos. Link to Marcos **********But General Ramos also owes his high position in part to a special relationship with the President by way of his father, Narciso Ramos, who was said to have been colleague of Mr. Marcos during World War II. Mr. Ramos died Feb. 3. **********Critics of General Ramos noted that he had said it was self-defense when 27 farmers were shot dead by the constabulary as the farmers marched in a human rights rally in Escalante last September. **********President Marcos later cited the Escalante incident as a reason he was unable to accede to demands that Gen. Fabian C. Ver, the armed forces Chief of Staff and Mr. Marcos's palace ally in controlling the military, be removed and replaced by General Ramos. General Ver had been indicted in connection with the 1983 assassination of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., Mr. Marcos's chief opponent, but was cleared of all charges last December."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/world/plaintiffs-press-inquiry-on-us-support-for-nicaragua-rebels.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-02-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 362, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PLAINTIFFS PRESS INQUIRY ON U.S. SUPPORT FOR NICARAGUA REBELS", "print_headline": "PLAINTIFFS PRESS INQUIRY ON U.S. SUPPORT FOR NICARAGUA REBELS", "body_text": " **********Attorneys for the plaintiffs in a civil lawsuit asked an appeals court here this week to lift an order that has delayed an investigation of the Reagan Administration's support for Nicaraguan rebels. **********The request before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit came more than two years after a Federal District Court Judge ordered the United States Attorney General to investigate charges that American support for the rebels violated the longstanding United States Neutrality Act. **********The neutrality law makes it a criminal offense punishable by three years in jail and $3,000 in fines to furnish money or prepare for a military enterprise against a country with which the United States is at peace. **********The lawsuit was originally filed under the Federal Ethics in Government Act in July 1983 on behalf of Representative Ronald V.

Sometimes that meant shipping new products that had not yet been perfected. Other times it meant forgetting to include floppy disks, or other vital parts. **********Last year the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a machine tool company based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., recognized that delays in orders might push down its profits in the quarter ending Dec. 31. It took part of its well-funded reserve for bad credit and added it to earnings. Presto, the quarter's income was up from a year earlier. **********Convinced that it cannot earn a decent return soon enough, the United States Steel Corporation has decided not to invest in new furnaces for its plant in Geneva, Utah. Instead, it will import semifinished slabs from South Korea to feed its West Coast finishing mills. Instead of spending its investment dollars on plant and equipment, it is using them to acquire companies, like Texas Oil and Gas. CONCERN is mounting throughout the country over Corporate America's preoccupation with quarter-to-quarter profit increases. America's industrial giants, many say, are too worried about pleasing Wall Street over the next quarter, and not worried enough about competing with Japanese, German and Korean companies over the next decade. Companies in those countries, far more so than those in the United States, are willing to forgo short-term profits in order to build market share or increase productivity. **********American management's concern with the short term can take the form of ''creative accounting,'' which misleads shareholders into believing that profits are better than they are. Or worse, it can mean that research and plant modernization projects will not get done because they will drain cash for a couple of years - even though the projects might be vital to the company's long-term interests and the country's long-term growth. **********''Everything is pegged nowadays to immediate earnings,'' said Andrew C. Sigler, chairman of Champion International, the forest products company. ''It costs us a billion dollars and takes three years to build a paper machine. I'm always criticized that I should use that money to buy back my stock to boost earnings per share. There's a pressure there that you can't ignore, and it's counter to whatever is good for the country.'' **********If it hurts the economy as a whole, it can nearly cripple individual companies. Daisy Systems found that out the hard way. Its quality problems finally hit home last week. Its rush to ship products may have pumped up earnings for a few quarters, but it soured customers. Many stopped buying - and last week Daisy said it had moved into the red. Its stock lost one-third of its value. **********Executives of other companies say such lessons are repeated again and again. ''It's easy to create a state of euphoria for three months,'' said Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of the Archer Daniels Midland Company, the giant grain processor based in Decatur, Ill. ''But if you emphasize short-term earnings and neglect long-term planning, then the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train.'' **********Mr. Andreas has an easier time than most, in that his family and a few others own a controlling interest in his company, and are interested in seeing it grow. For example, no one balked when Mr. Andreas invested in soybean crushing and corn milling equipment that might not pay for itself for years. **********Most executives are not so lucky. For example, Last year Procter & Gamble made some expensive long-term investments in hopes of increasing market share for Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste. Even though the investments made sense and were sorely needed - and, in fact, have already resulted in higher market shares and earnings -shareholders reacted sourly. P.&G.'s stock took a temporary plunge, to slightly above $50 a share, from $60. (Last week it was hovering in the mid-$60's range.) The Cincinnati giant's experience is by no means isolated. The number of times the average share of stock is traded has increased fivefold since the early 1960's, a sure sign that investors are not holding onto stocks through thick and thin. Even in the hot market of recent months, when investors have forgiven write-offs and other one-time actions that momentarily depress earnings, many have still shown little willingness to put up with stagnant - let alone dropping -earnings for more than one quarter. **********Although it is certainly not a new phenomenon, the pressure on managers to generate good quarterly earnings is growing more intense. The reasons are many. Pension fund managers, generally more fickle than individual investors, handle more than $1 trillion in investments, more than double the level five years ago. They and other institutional investors now account for about 80 percent of all equity trading. Most of them have access to almost instantaneous stock price data, and can dump a stock literally moments after bad quarterly news is issued. **********Moreover, the recent merger fever has made managers fear that if their quarterly results are weak, their stock prices will drop so much that their companies will become ripe targets for acquisition. **********But while a lot of the blame for the corporate myopia must go to the investment community, much of it must be borne by management itself. Many corporate executives do not take their eye off quarterly results because their bonuses are pegged to near-term jumps in earnings or stock prices. Moreover, the same executives who complain about pressure for short-term results often apply such pressure to their own pension fund managers. **********''It's ironic that the same corporate executives who complain about the short-term outlook of financial analysts and capital markets will review their pension fund managers every quarter and perhaps fire any that seriously underperform the market,'' said Robert S. Kaplan, a professor of industrial administration at the Harvard Business School and former dean of Carnegie-Mellon University's business school. **********The fact that the number of money managers in the country has ballooned to 11,000 does not ease the pressure. The competition for clients is intense. ''People have a tendency to go to the latest winner,'' said Martin D. Sass, who runs an investment company that manages $2.3 billion in assets. ''I'm subjected to pressures not dissimilar to those that the head of a public company faces. I have clients to report to, clients who are often the presidents of companies.'' **********Money managers insist that they would be derelict if they did not pay close attention to - and act upon -short-term results. And, of course, they insist that they are not fooled by corporate numbers-juggling. **********''Analysts and investors are always looking forward,'' said Lee Seidler, managing director of Bear Stearns, who says that quarterly data are vital for forecasting earnings. ''The more current the information, the better shot you have of correctly estimating the future.'' **********Some experts insist that Wall Street does, indeed, pay attention to the long term. Says William Beaver, an accounting professor at the Stanford Business School: ''If management announces the right decisions, the market tends to reward it based on what the long-term impacts on earnings will be, even though the short-run effects on profits may be poor.'' **********Not surprisingly, takeover artists, who are often blamed for many economic ills, also say that the concept of the tyranny of quarterly earnings is specious. For example, T. Boone Pickens, chairman of the Mesa Petroleum Company and a raider extraordinaire, insists that good managers have little to fear from him or from any activist shareholder. ''If management has done a good job for stockholders, they can report their earnings every Monday morning,'' he said. ''If you do the best job you can, both the short- and long-term will be taken care of.'' THE problem would be moot, of course, if Congress were to repeal the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That law requires public corporations to report revenues, earnings, debt and other financial data every quarter. **********But no one predicts that this will happen - nor do many critics of quarterly earnings even agree that it should. Decades ago, George O. May, who founded the American branch of Price Waterhouse, said, ''Short-period income determination would be indefensible if it were not indispensable.'' Today, any number of academics echo his ambivalence. **********''Given the quick pace of the marketplace, there is no alternative really for quarterly reports,'' said Abraham J. Briloff, a professor of accounting at Baruch College. Added Sidney Davidson, who teaches accounting at the University of Chicago Business School: ''For the markets to work efficiently, we need as much up-to-date information as we can get.'' **********Access to that information has become truly instantaneous. Quotrons and other machines that enable users to call onto a screen up-to-the-second financial data are almost ubiquitous among money managers and analysts. **********The irony, though, is that the easy availability of data in no way insures that the data are reliable indicators of the company's future - or even its present - performance. **********''As the period covered by a financial report grows shorter, the significance of various uncertainties grows greater,'' explained John C. Burton, dean of Columbia University's School of Business. ''A relatively small number will affect the bottom line more in a short period than if you are looking at a longer period.'' **********For example, take a company that reported $1 million net income for the year. Say that company assessed its inventory at $2 million at current market value. If its estimate of market value is off 5 percent, that means a $100,000 error, one that will throw off the reported annual income by 10 percent. But assuming the company had $250,000 in quarterly income, The quarterly figures would be off 40 percent. **********Quarterly statements are rife with judgment calls and those calls can often be wrong, warned Donald P. Kelly, the former Esmark chairman who has joined an effort to take the Beatrice Companies private and will soon be named its chairman. Mr. Kelly, who says that if he had his druthers he would ''like to report earnings once every 15 years,'' plans to take Beatrice private in part because he is tired of quarterly pressures. He said a system of semiannual earnings would probably work far better for management. **********''It seems to me that we're not serving our shareholders well with these quarterly reports. We're confusing them,'' he said. **********Some executives avert the threat of a down quarter by deferring costs -say, putting off an advertising campaign for a few months, or waiting a quarter to write off receivables or bad loans. **********''Suppose you have a period where sales are lower than expected or operating costs higher, you have some discretionary areas to boost current income,'' said Professor Kaplan. ''You can reduce maintenance, reduce employee training, slow down process improvements or reduce R.&D. The financial accounting model will say your profits have gone up, but I think the value of the firm has decreased because the firm becomes more vulnerable to competition, if not in this country, then overseas.'' BUSINESS professors increasingly are questioning whether business schools are sending out the right messages to the next generation of managers. ''I often discuss with my graduate students to what extent is there an excessive emphasis in our business schools on gamesmanship, games plans and the aggressive pursuit of the bottom line,'' said Professor Briloff of Baruch College. ''Shouldn't we rather challenge students to think through their role as leaders in the business profession and to what extent can we collectively coordinate our efforts to try to solve our nation's competitive problems?'' **********Many experts say these problems are destined to worsen, as Japan continues to gain ground in international markets. Japanese shareholders are far less troubled by blips in earnings and stock prices, provided that the company's competitive position gets demonstrably better on an ongoing basis. **********The investing community in Japan is certainly different from that in the United States. Japanese corporations often buy long-term positions in companies that are their own customers or suppliers. Moreover, Japanese banks are allowed to invest their own money in companies. ''In this sense, Japanese institutional investors can be much more long-term oriented than ones in the United States,'' said Taka Sumitomo, chairman of Sanyo Securities America. **********To be sure, there are American companies that join the Japanese in eschewing the short-term mentality. For instance, the International Business Machines Corporation has never hesitated to invest heavily in research and development or in marketing new products. And I.B.M. shareholders have often been willing to weather temporary drops in earnings. For example, I.B.M.'S stock remained strong even though the company reported lower earnings for three quarters last year. Although the company's stock dropped last week in the wake of some bad earnings projections, few people expect it will drop very far or very long. I.B.M. officials ''often take a more visionary view of things,'' said Thomas H, Bruggere, chairman of Mentor Graphics, a fast-growing computer-aided engineering company in Beaverton, Ore. NUMEROUS academics are trying to persuade business executives that if ever there was a time to stand up to the pressures for short-term orientation, it is now. Merger fever has cooled off a bit. Interest rates are down, making it easier for corporations to invest. And the stock market has jumped to all-time highs. **********''A lot of companies that were undervalued and subject to takeovers before are in much better shape,'' said Robert H. Hayes, a professor of management and technology at Harvard Business School. ''Thus we ought to see less concern from managers about what quarterly reports will do to the price of their stock.'' **********Mr. Hayes says that it will take more than eased pressure from Wall Street to make corporate America more long-term oriented. In addition, the cost of capital would have to fall, he says, and corporations would have to stop penalizing managers when their performance falls below budget expectations. **********By contrast, Dean Burton of Columbia suggests that managers could make Wall Street overreact less to near-term developments by doing a better job of explaining the reasons behind quarterly numbers. ''What management has to do is meet with analysts to put those numbers in perspective,'' he says. **********Professor Kaplan has perhaps the most subtle suggestion of all: put less emphasis on net income in quarterly reports and start measuring such factors as improvements in productivity, market share and the rate of product defects. ''There is a whole variety of quantitative nonfinancial data that provide much better feedback than net income on how well a company did in the most recent quarter,'' he said. **********But Robert N. Noyce, vice chairman of the Intel Corporation, counters that none of this will make much of a difference unless savings rates go up, thereby ending the shortage of capital. ''I would like to see us take a long-term focus,'' he said. ''But given the shortage of capital, I think the current focus is proper. We cannot afford the luxury of investing inefficiently. It is easier to see the result of investing on the short term than on the long term. You're less apt to make a mistake if you're measuring quarter by quarter.'' He said that a higher savings rate and a capital surplus might cause a short-term drop in the standard of living, but would increase productivity and individual prosperity in the long run. **********But even if that were to happen, Mr. Noyce suggests, the often adversarial nature of the relationship between investors and corporations would still continue. And that, he and many others say, may not be so bad after all. ''American management has a job to do and Wall Street has a job to do,'' he said. ''Thank God, they're different.'' AN OBSESSION WITHQUICK PAYBACKS Even though United States interest rates have dropped mightily in the last few years, the cost of money here is still high relative to Japan and many other countries. What is more, it is still high enough in absolute terms so that American managers feel pressure to make funds go a long way in a short time. And that, perhaps as much as the perceived need to show high earnings each quarter, has prevented American corporations from investing in projects that offer not a quick fix, but a long-term payoff. **********Richard R. Ellsworth, a professor of management at Claremont Graduate School, cites studies that show that the after-tax cost of capital in the United States in 1983 was 13.4 percent. That compared with 5.2 percent in Japan. Even today, with lower interest rates, capital is far more expensive here than there. **********Professor Ellsworth also noted that American manufacturers enjoyed an after-tax return on investment that is 63 percent higher than in Japan and double that in Germany. While that may be wonderful for investors in the short-term, the preoccupation with high returns can cause problems in years to come. German and Japanese companies have access to lower cost capital, and do not make similarly stringent demands as far as return on capital goes, he points out. In fact, he says, Japanese managers are happy with investments that give them enough of a return to pay two or three percent in dividends to shareholders. **********''If foreign managers are willing to invest at lower rates of return, they can do a number of things that we can't do,'' he cautioned. ''They can cut prices. They can invest in R&D. They can build plants. They can invest in market share. They can do a whole range of things to make them more competitive.'' **********The obsession with quick paybacks in this country also interferes with the ability to come up with new products and production techniques. Most important innovations take 7 to 15 years to become profitable. American managers cannot easily justify the wait to shareholders, and may drop products too soon. **********Other academics complain that American managers are too quick to spend money on buying existing facilities or companies - investments that may do good things for their own balance sheets, but do little for the nation's economy. **********''American companies aren't using their enormous resources to increase production and productivity,'' complained Abraham J. Briloff, Emanuel Saxe Distinguished Professor of Accountancy at Baruch College. ''They are using their billions of dollars instead to acquire existing resources.'' **********He cited steel companies that have made nonsteel acquisitions, yet have been slow to invest in equipment that increases quality and productivity. ''We're not moving our resources aggressively to meet the competitive challenges,'' he said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/17/world/saudi-kidnapped-and-freed-in-2-hours-in-lebanon.html": {"writer_name": "Ihsan Hijazi", "pub_date": "1986-07-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 647, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "SAUDI KIDNAPPED AND FREED IN 2 HOURS IN LEBANON", "print_headline": "SAUDI KIDNAPPED AND FREED IN 2 HOURS IN LEBANON", "body_text": " **********A Syrian-sponsored security plan in Moslem West Beirut helped save a Saudi kidnapping victim today. **********The abducted man, Soleiman Mohammed al-Mubarak, was freed two hours after he had been seized by gunmen.

In the long-term market, however, the Treasury's 7 1/4 percent issue due in 2016 lost 1/2 point and was offered at 100 5/8, to yield 7.20 percent, up from 7.16 percent. **********Henry J. Gailliot, senior economist and chief investment strategist at the Federated Research Corporation, a Pittsburgh-based investment advisory firm, noted that before the Fed's latest cut in the discount rate ''we expected inflation of 5 percent or 6 percent in 18 months, and bond yields of 7 1/2 percent or less do just not compensate you for the risks in the future.'' **********While admitting that cuts in short-term rates were likely in the near future, Mr. Gailliot noted that Federated Research has shortened the average maturity of debt portfolios it manages since March. ''The fourth year of an economic expansion has never been a time to make money in bonds, '' he said. **********''There will be another discount rate cut by Columbus Day,'' said H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, ''but the bond market seems to be concerned about the long-term implications of what the Fed is doing.'' **********The initial reaction to the most recent easing in Fed monetary policy is similar to the pattern that has prevailed since April, when the Fed cut the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent, from 7 percent. In mid-April, just a few days before the Fed acted, three-month Treasury bills were at 5.77 percent, while the 9 1/4 percent Treasury bonds due in 2016 were offered at 126 14/32, to yield 7.10 percent. The 9 1/4 percent issue, which was replaced in May by the 7 1/4 percent bonds as the bellwether issue in the Treasury market, was offered yesterday at 120 22/ 32, to yield 7.50 percent. **********Despite predictions that Treasury bond yields will fall to 7 percent or lower, the market seems to stumble each time yields fall to around 7 1/8 percent. The reasons that bond yields have not come down include the fear that inflation will rise once again, the heavy supply of long-term issues and the preference of investors for higher-yielding corporate and mortgage-backed securities. **********Mr. Heinemann acknowledged that the Federal Reserve's willingness to promote rapid growth in bank reserves and money supply has not produced the rise in inflation and economic activity that monetarist economists have expected. ''People are not spending the money now, but once the liquidity has been provided, it stays in the system,'' he said. He added that inflation will rise once the effects of lower oil prices are past and that the economy will improve substantially once the drop in the value of the dollar improves the terms of trade for American companies. Rapid Money Supply Growth **********The latest reminder of rapid money supply growth was the Fed's late afternoon announcement of a $5 billion increase, to $684.9 billion, in M-1, consisting of currency and all kinds of checking accounts. Including the latest week's increase, M-1 has grown at a more than 13 percent rate over the past year, well above the Fed's maximum growth objective of 8 percent. **********With inflation low, Fed officials have focused their attention on stimulating the economy and attributed much of the money supply growth to a build-up in bank accounts of funds that represent savings. **********The willingness of Fed officials to reduce the discount rate yesterday and in July also shows, analysts said, that they are more concerned about the health of the economy than about the possibility that lower interest rates in this country would cause the dollar to weaken further. **********Earlier this year, Fed officials warned that too great a drop in the dollar would cause inflation to rise, as the price of imported goods rises and foreign demand for American products increases. So far, however, the lower dollar has not caused much reduction in imports or expanded exports. **********In recent weeks, American officials have sought to coordinate interest rate cuts with West German and Japanese authorities, so that the economy might be stimulated without too steep a drop in the dollar. West German authorities have not cut their interest rates since March, and Japanese authorities have not cut their rates since April. There is speculation, however, that they may agree to lower rates at next month's meeting of the International Monetary Fund. **********Leonard Santow, an economist at the advisory firm of Griggs & Santow, said Treasury bond yields have not declined so much as other maturities, ''because the risk-reward balance favors issues with shorter maturities.'' **********So long as the Fed continues reducing the discount rate, he noted, such issues as two-year Treasury notes will offer the prospect of price appreciation that will attract investors. **********The heavy supply of corporate securities might also be siphoning off some of the investor demand that otherwise would flow into the Treasury market. More than $4.1 billion of corporate issues have been offered this week, including more than $1.1 billion yesterday."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/23/world/cairo-seems-to-lose-a-chance-to-prosper-in-a-time-of-peace.html": {"writer_name": "Christopher Wren", "pub_date": "1986-08-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1500, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CAIRO SEEMS TO LOSE A CHANCE TO PROSPER IN A TIME OF PEACE", "print_headline": "CAIRO SEEMS TO LOSE A CHANCE TO PROSPER IN A TIME OF PEACE", "body_text": " **********Egypt has frittered away the chance for basic economic and social change that peace with Israel brought, experts on the Middle East agree, and the country seems to be in more desperate shape today than before it signed the treaty in 1979. **********An end to three decades of war offered the Government time to try to bring about the kind of fundamental changes that could lead to prosperity, while cushioned by international good will and huge amounts of American economic aid. **********Egypt ranks after Israel as the second largest recipient of American foreign aid, totaling $18 billion in civilian and military assistance over the last decade. Instability Is Feared **********Although Egyptians have ridden out lean periods before, many are pessimistic that the latest crisis, dramatized by a foreign debt approaching $36 billion, may presage domestic instability. ''The likelihood of things remaining as they are is very thin,'' an Egyptian journalist said. **********Egypt's slide toward the brink of bankruptcy has been widely attributed to three setbacks beyond its control: the sharp drop in world oil prices; a decline in tourism because of the fear of terrorism and regional tensions, and fewer remittances from Egyptian expatriates whose jobs are drying up in other Arab countries. **********The decline in these key sources of hard currency - President Hosni Mubarak anticipated a loss of $1.2 billion in oil revenue alone - has been partly offset by an increase in revenues from Suez Canal fees, which have risen to more than $1 billion a year. Still, a squeeze is being felt because foreign loans taken out in the mid-1970's are starting to come due. No Contingency Plans **********Although Mr. Mubarak asserted in July that ''we are doing more than could be expected,'' Egypt had no contingency plans for the decrease in hard currency, which one official said was predictable. **********As a major political influence in the Middle East, Egypt has grown accustomed to living beyond its economic means. While it sought relief from creditors, Cairo recently donated $1million to African rebel movements through the Organization of African Unity. **********''The problem of Egypt since the end of the Second World War is that there is a contradiction between the economic prospects of Egypt and the political value of Egypt,'' Hazem el-Beblawi, the chairman of the Egyptian Export Development Bank, said. ''If Egypt lived within her economic resources, it would have done an injustice to her political and strategic potential.'' **********Abdel Aziz Hegazi, another respected economist, took note of some changes since he stepped down as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1975. The country's foreign debt, he said, has grown from $1.7 billion to well above $30 billion. Inflation has risen from 5 percent to 11 percent officially and closer to 30 percent in fact. The number of Government employees, including the military, has increased from one million in 1970 to 4.5 million today. **********''I don't think that the economy in Egypt is very poor, like Chad, but it needs an active type of action,'' Dr. Hegazi said. ''You can't revive it in a regular program.'' **********The Government has reacted with patchwork solutions to the same domestic problems glossed over by President Anwar el-Sadat while he focused on his peace initiative with Israel. **********Mr. Mubarak, who became President when Mr. Sadat was killed by Islamic extremists in October 1981, has encouraged democracy and free speech to a degree unknown since the revolution that ousted King Farouk in 1952. But Mr. Mubarak has been hesitant to take equally bold economic action. **********The Government bureaucracy, which employs a third of Egypt's labor force, too often seems paralyzed by the hodgepodge of ideological policies accumulated since independence - Arab nationalism, socialism, wartime austerity and now encouragement of Western capitalist investment. Cosmetic Changes **********''This is not a government which was elected directly by the people to implement an economic program, so they don't have a mandate,'' Dr. Beblawi said. **********There have been improvements in the last five years, but for the most part they have been cosmetic. **********In downtown Cairo, for instance, ragged sidewalks have been refaced with new paving stones. Raw sewage from broken pipes no longer floods the major intersections. The traffic jams have been alleviated, if only slightly, by new overpasses. There are far fewer power failures, and the telephones finally work. **********Out in the countryside, where red brick houses are replacing traditional mud homes, peasants are acquiring washing machines, refrigerators and television sets from relatives working abroad. A Growing Population **********Nevertheless, the causes of Egypt's vulnerability, which led Mr. Sadat to make peace with Israel, have become more glaring. This summer the population reached 50 million, increasing by one million Egyptians in eight months. Four years ago a baby was born every 27 seconds; now a birth occurs every 21 seconds. **********The population is expected to exceed 70 million by the year 2000. But Maher Mahran, the secretary general of the National Population Council, offered an even more sobering projection. He calculated that Egypt's population was doubling every 25 years and that there could be 800 million Egyptians in another century. **********A family planning campaign introduced in the late 1970's has faltered for lack of vigorous official support. Birth control, which challenges Egypt's tradition of big families, is ignored by 70 percent of couples capable of having children. Cities Gobble Up Prime Land **********Agricultural output has lagged behind population growth, which is 2.7 percent a year. Less than 4 percent of Egypt's land is arable and while some desert has been reclaimed, prime land along the Nile has been gobbled up by the growth of cities. **********Egypt, once a net exporter in agriculture, now imports 60 percent of its food, including 75 percent of its grain, at a cost of more than $9 million a day. Meanwhile, according to one estimate, more than a third of the domestic crop is lost through sloppy handling. Because half of the tomatoes spoil before they get to market, the country imports some tomato-based products. **********The burden that is most debated is a program of huge subsidies for food and other commodities that has cost more than $1.5 billion a year. Prime Minister Ali Lutfi has said the subsidies would be gradually reduced, but the Government is still traumatized by riots that broke out in 1977 when Mr. Sadat tried to raise the price of bread. Bread Is Fed to Chickens **********Mr. Mubarak has resorted to subtler tactics, introducing a better loaf of unleavened bread for two piasters, equivalent to about 1 1/2 cents, while phasing out a one-piaster loaf. A newer five-piaster loaf has also been introduced, but even so, bread remains so cheap that farmers feed it to their donkeys and chickens. **********The Government has quietly nudged up other prices, leading a few officials to conclude that Egyptians would tolerate a reduction in state control. Gasoline went up 25 percent in July, but at 75 cents a gallon it is still cheap by world standards. **********Critics argue that subsidies benefit the wealthy as much as the poor. There is so much speculation in subsidized commodities that The Egyptian Gazette, an English-language daily, complained that middlemen and black marketeers are the primary beneficiaries. **********Under one proposed solution, food subsidies would be replaced by increases in wages or pensions for the needy. But Mohammed Sid Ahmed, a journalist who opposes the Government, said that under this system salaries would go up only once while prices would keep rising. **********Rioting last February by paramilitary policemen, who earn only $6 a month, caused 107 deaths, but did not touch off wider violence, partly because the police were unpopular with many Egyptians. ''There was no rupture of the social tissue,'' a Western European diplomat said. Pressure From the I.M.F. The International Monetary Fund, which estimated Egypt's debt repayment obligation at $3.7 billion this year, has told it to eliminate the subsidies in order to qualify for debt rescheduling and new standby credits of up to $1 billion. **********Mr. Mubarak warned that the resulting increase in prices could set off violence. His Government has trimmed back subsidies by nearly 15 percent to $1.3 billion in the new budget, but it has become common practice in Egypt to spend more than the budgeted amount. **********The Government moved toward another I.M.F. demand, for a unified exchange rate, by dropping one of four rates used for the Egyptian pound. The disparities have promoted excessive use of imports, confused foreign investors and prompted a flow of private capital to banks abroad. **********An American aid specialist estimated that the money that nervous Egyptians have placed out of Government reach could pay off the country's foreign debt of $36 million."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/business/tax-reform-act-1986-measure-came-together-tax-bill-for-textbooks.html": {"writer_name": "David Rosenbaum", "pub_date": "1986-10-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 3122, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Chronology", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A TAX BILL FOR THE TEXTBOOKS", "print_headline": "THE TAX REFORM ACT OF 1986: HOW THE MEASURE CAME TOGETHER; A TAX BILL FOR THE TEXTBOOKS", "body_text": " **********For years to come, students of politics will look to the odyssey of the new tax law as a prime example of how the American system of government gets things done. **********The process was a peculiarly American annealing. Few other measures have been shaped and reshaped by so many conflicts and by so much cooperation. Few have reflected so many political trade-offs by so many politicians with such different styles and viewpoints. No other legislation in years has survived so many narrow escapes. **********The following account describes the most important mileposts in the arduous course, from the time nearly three years ago when the historic legislation was but a gleam in the President's eye until he triumphantly signed it into law today. **********Jan. 25, 1984: In his State of the Union Message, President Reagan announces he has directed his Treasury Secretary, Donald T. Regan, to develop a plan ''to simplify the entire tax code so all taxpayers, big and small, are treated more fairly.'' When the President says he wants the plan delivered after the November election, he is forced to pause momentarily while the laughter from his audience of senators and representatives dies down. The almost uniform view among politicians and political commentators is that the President's aim in his announcement is to remove tax revision as an issue in the election campaign. The President's political advisers feared his Democratic opponents would seize on the public dissatisfaction with the existing tax system and embrace a proposal worked out by Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri to reduce tax rates and eliminate preferences. (As it turned out, the eventual Democratic candidate, Walter F. Mondale, rejected the Bradley-Gephardt idea. But a team of Treasury Department tax specialists worked throughout the year to prepare a plan.)  Nov. 27, 1984: Three weeks to the day after the election, the Treasury presents its tax revision plan, which becomes known as Treasury I. It is the kind of plan academic tax specialists have advocated and politicans have spurned for years, reducing tax rates and abolishing almost all deductions, including the business tax breaks that had been a fundamental part of the Reagan Administration's tax initiative in 1981. The response from the White House is unenthusiastic. Treasury Secretary Regan is careful to say that it is a Treasury proposal, not an Administration plan. ''This thing was written on a word processor,'' the Secretary says. ''It can be changed.'' Most analysts call Treasury I a trial balloon that will burst as soon as it enters the rarefied atmosphere of practical Washington politics. Senator Bob Packwood, chairman of the Finance Committee, says, ''I sort of like the tax code the way it is.''  Jan. 8, 1985: The White House announces that Mr. Regan will change jobs with the White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d. The effect of the switch on the question of tax changes is twofold: It puts Mr. Baker, the Administration's most accomplished political and legislative strategist, in direct charge of the tax bill, and it delays Administration work on the measure for several months while the new Treasury Secretary becomes familiar with the issues.  Feb. 6, 1985: In his State of the Union Message, the President mentions ''tax reform'' before any other domestic or international issue, including the budget deficit and relations with the Soviet Union. (Similarly, it was the first issue mentioned in his Inaugural Address Jan. 21.) The idea that the President is serious about the matter gradually sinks in. Two key leaders in the House of Representatives - Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker, and Dan Rostenkowski, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee -conclude that, rather than oppose the President on taxes, they should join him and try to win some of the credit for the Democratic Party. Mr. Rostenkowski announces he will begin preliminary hearings in a few weeks, and a staff member says the chairman will make tax revision ''his mission in 1985.''  Feb. 7, 1985: In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the President demonstrates unfamiliarity with the issues involved in the tax legislation. Informed that the Treasury plan would raise business taxes more than 30 percent, the President at first disputes the questioner. Then he says he has not ''made an attempt to study that bill in detail that much to know that'' and makes the familiar argument that ''only people'' and not corporations pay taxes.  Feb. 20, 1985: Meeting with reporters, Senator Packwood is cool to the idea of ending tax preferences and says a law change would be ''more palatable'' if Congress coupled it with a new tax on energy consumption.  May 28, 1985: After months of delay, President Reagan introduces his tax plan in a prime-time television address, calling on Americans to support the transformation of an ''un-American'' tax system into one that is ''clear, simple and fair for all.'' The plan follows the basic outline of the Treasury's proposal, although he suggests retaining more business tax advantages. Mr. Rostenkowski, in the best speech of his long political career, follows the President on television, endorses the principles of what Mr. Reagan has proposed and urges viewers to ''write Rosty'' with their support.  May 30, 1985: In the first of several trips around the country to stump for his tax plan, the President visits Oshkosh, Wis. As in the trips to follow, Mr. Reagan is received warmly, but his tax plan stirs little enthusiasm. (Over the summer, Mr. Reagan's attention and that of the country are diverted by terrorism abroad and the President's cancer surgery, and the trips on behalf of tax legislation are abandoned.)  June 4, 1985: The House Ways and Means Committee begins formal hearings on tax legislation. The chief executive officers of six giant corporations, specially selected because of their views, open the hearings with testimony in favor of such legislation. The split in the business community is an important factor in the eventual enactment of the law. (The Ways and Means Committee hearings continue throughout the summer, taking testimony from more than 450 witnesses. The Senate Finance Committee also holds 33 days of hearings.)  Sept. 26, 1985: The Ways and Means Committee, meeting in closed sessions, begins drafting a tax bill. At the outset, Mr. Rostenkowski presents his own tax plan, which follows the structure of the President's proposals but is more favorable to poor and middle-income taxpayers and less advantageous to business and wealthy individuals.  Oct. 15, 1985: After days of nibbling around the edges, the committee takes its first vote on a controversial issue and approves an important tax break for banks. **********Lobbyists shout for joy and congratulate one another in the hallway. Mr. Rostenkowski is furious. Some analysts say that the bill is dead, that the vote on banks shows Congress does not have the will to take on powerful interests.  Oct. 23, 1985: Mr. Rostenkowski, reasserting control over his committee, begins to trade favors for votes. He tells key members he will support retention of Federal tax deductions for state and local income tax and sales tax payments. He says he will not advocate taxes on fringe benefits such as medical insurance premiums. He promises particular members support on small issues important to their constituents. In return, he demands their support on the overall bill. The committee votes to overturn its decision of the previous week on the tax break for banks, and the legislation is back on track.  Oct. 26-27, 1985: On a sparkling autumn weekend, with the sun blazing and the leaves resplendent outside, Mr. Rostenkowski locks his committee members in a windowless room and continues to wheel and deal. At the end of the weekend, he announces he has 19 solid votes, a majority of the 36-member committee. ''It's unbelievable what's been happening,'' says Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat. ''A week ago people were saying tax reform was dead. Now, it's completely shifted.''  Nov. 23, 1985: Just before dawn the Ways and Means Committee approves the legislation. It provides a top rate of 38 percent for individuals and increases business taxes by $140 billion over five years. All Democrats on the panel support the bill, but most Republicans oppose it. **********''We have done what many people thought could not be done,'' says Mr. Rostenkowski, sipping beer from a can after the lobbyists went home.  Dec. 4, 1985: After nearly two weeks of silence about the Ways and Means Committee's bill, President Reagan issues a statement of lukewarm support. House Republican leaders say they will work to defeat the measure.  Dec. 9, 1985: Belatedly, the President sends a letter to all Republican representatives urging them to vote for the bill - not, he says, because he likes the legislation but because defeat would ''doom our efforts to achieve real tax reform.'' He also telephones about a dozen wavering Republicans, apparently the first real lobbying he has done on the bill. PICK UP FIRST ADD CHRONO **********Dec. 11, 1985: In a striking setback, the House votes, 223 to 202, to reject a procedural resolution that must be adopted before the legislation can be brought up for debate. Democrats support the resolution by a margin of better than 3 to 1. But only 14 Republicans support it, and 164 vote against it. Overconfident before the vote, the White House and Democratic leaders are clearly taken by surprise. If the President ''cannot deliver the votes in a forthwith manner,'' says Speaker O'Neill, ''the bill is dead.''  Dec. 16, 1985: Mr. Reagan makes an extraordinary trip to Capitol Hill to lobby personally for the tax-revision legislation. He promises Republicans that he will veto the bill if it arrives on his desk without significant changes, but he urges them to vote for the measure ''to keep the process alive.''  Dec. 17, 1985: The House approves the bill in a voice vote after a motion to kill it is rejected, 256 to 171. Thirty-five Republicans switch their position from the previous week, the difference between victory and defeat.  Jan. 25, 1986: After an overnight retreat with Finance Committee members and Treasury Department officials at a country inn in West Virginia, Senator Packwood says, ''I know we can get a bill of some kind that will be acceptable to 14 to 16 members of the committee.'' The panel has 20 members.  March 18, 1986: In preparation for the Finance Committee's bill-drafting sessions to begin the following day, Mr. Packwood proposes his version of tax revision legislation. It retains many tax breaks for business that had been rejected by the House, including, notably, those for the timber industry in his home state of Oregon. A central element of the package, the disallowance of business deductions for excise taxes and tariffs, is immediately rejected by a majority of the committee. Another proposal, to subject interest from municipal bonds to a minimum tax, paralyzes the bond market until the committee agrees to abandon the idea.  April 16, 1886: At a luncheon in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, a top White House official, not allowing his name to be used, calls tax revision legislation ''moribund.'' The statement was prompted by a month of Finance Committee drafting meetings in which nearly every effort to restrict one tax break or another was rejected and in which dozens of breaks for businesses and individuals were approved. The official's remark illustrates a rift between the White House staff, which believes the President has staked too much on an issue he cannot win, and the Treasury Department, which believes a satisfactory bill can still be enacted.  April 18, 1986: Saying he does not want ''to run the risk of killing this bill,'' **********Senator Packwood adjourns his committee just before the key votes he was bound to lose and postpones further voting indefinitely. **********The Senator and his chief of staff, Bill Diefenderfer, repair to the Irish Times, a Capitol Hill pub. Over two pitchers of beer, they decide to try a new tack. In the Senator's words, they want tax rates ''low enough that the political difficulty of deductions is lessened.'' He also says further meetings will be behind closed doors, out of sight of reporters and lobbyists.  April 24, 1986: Mr. Packwood presents the bare bones of a new plan to cut the top tax rate to about 25 percent and end almost all tax preferences, including those for capital gains and for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts. Obviously not sure what the reception will be, Mr. Packwood, at an odd news conference, denies authorship of the plan and attributes it to David H. Brockway, staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation.  April 29, 1986: After two long private sessions, Finance Committee members say tax revision has been revived by the new plan, which Mr. Packwood is now calling his own. ''I walked over there,'' said Senator David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, ''thinking I was going to see the eulogy delivered for the tax bill of 1986. I walked out realizing there's some life left in the old corpse.''  May 3-4, 1986: With President Reagan on a trip to the Far East and with reporters, lobbyists and other senators having been assured there would be no tax activity over the weekend, Senator Packwood and five other senators (Republicans John C. Danforth of Missouri and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Democrats Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and George J. Mitchell of Maine) meet secretly and put together all the main aspects of a tax package with a top individual rate of 27 percent. A central aspect, pushed by Mr. Moynihan, would abolish tax shelters by denying taxpayers the capacity to deduct paper losses against income from salaries, interest and dividends. The seven senators (including Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, whose staff attended the secret meeting) agree to stick together to fight changes in the package. They have no word whether President Reagan will support them.  May 7, 1986: Just after midnight, after two marathon, closed-door sessions, the Finance Committee approves the bill, 20 to 0. The unanimous vote is illusory. **********Until a last-minute change allowing an extra advantage for oil and gas exploration, there had not even been a majority for the bill. From Tokyo, Mr. Reagan says, ''I think that very likely I could find myself supporting the Senate committee's version.''  June 4, 1986: The Senate begins debate with an agreement to require all amendments to be revenue-neutral. In other words, if senators propose to lose revenue by adding a deduction, they must find an equal amount of revenue by either raising rates or eliminating another deduction. That provides an unusual amount of discipline to the normally unruly Senate. Mr. Packwood says he believes he has a majority committed to defeat all significant changes.  June 11, 1986: By the narrow margin of 51 to 48, the Senate rejects an amendment to allow continued deductions for contributions to I.R.A.'s. Had the amendment passed, the entire package might have come unraveled. After this vote, all other amendments are defeated handily. ''Everybody has religion now,'' says Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana.  June 24, 1986: After three weeks of floor debate, the Senate approves the bill, 97 to 3. Only Democrats Carl Levin of Michigan, John Melcher of Montana and Paul Simon of Illinois vote against it. ''The Cinderella team came out on top,'' says an elated President Reagan.  July 17, 1986: In a room overflowing with lobbyists from every conceivable commercial interest, 11 senators and 11 representatives begin the conference to write the final version of the legislation. The conference immediately breaks up into separate caucuses, and little is accomplished for weeks.  Aug. 12, 1986: The morning conference meeting degenerates into a shouting match. After lunch, the conferees return, conclude they cannot reach agreement as a group and instruct Mr. Packwood and Mr. Rostenkowski to try to find an accommodation in man-to-man negotiations.  Aug. 16, 1986: After four days and nights of negotiations, the two chairmen are within a hairbreadth of agreement. With the rest of Congress on a three-week recess, the conferees convene on a Saturday morning and spend all day trying to resolve the final differences. Finally, close to midnight, the conferees adopt the bill, none of them knowing all its details. ''We were absolutely of the view that if we waited three weeks, we would not have had a bill,'' says Senator Moynihan.  Sept. 9, 1986: Returning from the recess, lawmakers report they heard almost nothing favorable about the legislation at home and were inundated with complaints from those who would lose tax advantages. Still, the prevailing view among leaders is that nothing can stop the bill now.  Sept. 24, 1986: Gun-shy from their experience in 1985 when they were surprised by the extent of opposition, the White House and Democratic leaders make careful nose counts of how representatives plan to vote on the final bill. They are not confident they have sufficient votes until Representative Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader, asserts himself to blunt an attempt by a band of Republicans to scuttle the measure.  Sept. 25, 1986: The House approves the final version, 292 to 136, with a majority of both parties in support.  Sept. 27, 1986: After two days of debate, the Senate votes final Congressional approval, 74 to 23. President Reagan promises to sign the measure, calling the Senate vote ''the last legislative hurdle for the American people, who finally have a tax code they can be proud of.'' Senator Packwood says: ''It was a very real question whether we would achieve tax reform. Well we have. We did something good for America.''  Oct. 22, 1986: Surrounded by instrumental lawmakers from both parties, President Reagan signs the bill into law in a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House. He calls it ''the best antipoverty bill, the best pro-family measure and the best job-creation program ever to come out of the Congress of the United States.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/mayor-masters-the-art-of-walking-safe-line-between-rebels-and-army.html": {"writer_name": "Fox Butterfield", "pub_date": "1986-03-04", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1143, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "MAYOR MASTERS THE ART OF WALKING SAFE LINE BETWEEN REBELS AND ARMY", "print_headline": "MAYOR MASTERS THE ART OF WALKING SAFE LINE BETWEEN REBELS AND ARMY", "body_text": " **********Unlike most local Filipino politicians, Mayor Emiliano Forbes has no bodyguards. After dark in this town on the Bataan Peninsula, along the route of the infamous World War II death march, he even personally greets strangers at his gate. **********But what makes Mr. Forbes's lack of security precautions truly striking is that Samal, by his own calculation, is a ''hotbed'' of activity by the New People's Army, the military wing of the Philippine Communist Party. **********In front of the whitewashed City Hall and outside the 16th-century Roman Catholic cathedral, there are bright red slogans on the walls proclaiming ''Long live the N.P.A.,'' accompanied by drawings of the hammer and sickle. **********Just last Tuesday a barrio captain -a chief of one of the villages that make up this town of 40,000 people - was shot to death by the paramilitary Philippine Constabulary when he was seen riding on a motorbike with a suspected N.P.A. agent. And rebels conduct nightly teach-ins around town and collect taxes from the residents. Somewhat Casual Attitude **********In the face of these troubles, Mr. Forbes's casual attitude toward his safety reflects what some knowledgeable Filipinos and Americans believe is an accommodation the Mayor has made with the Communists. **********''The Government flag is still flying, but someone else is in charge,'' said an American official with experience in Vietnam. **********''It is not yet a shadow Government, but it is something pretty close to that,'' said the Rev. Tony Dumaual, the parish priest in the neighboring town of Orani. ''The mayor is quite affected by all the N.P.A. activity, and he has to make certain compromises.'' **********The Mayor denies there are such accommodations on his part. **********The situation in Samal particularly concerns Government officials and American diplomats because it is literally within sight of the capital, 30 miles across Manila Bay. It is also just 25 miles from the large American Subic Bay Naval Base and about the same from Clark Air Base. Growth of Insurgency **********The Communists' ability to infiltrate Samal, and a string of other towns along this rugged, mountainous peninsula jutting into the South China sea, is one of the clearest indications that their insurgency has grown well beyond the early stages of a simple guerrilla jungle war. **********Whether they will be able to capitalize on their position here after the ouster of Ferdinand E. Marcos and his replacement by the new Government under President Corazon C. Aquino, is unclear. **********Father Dumaual said he believed that ''the left has been a bit derailed by the recent events, at least for the moment.'' The Communists' decision to boycott the presidential election that led to Mr. Marcos's downfall and then sit out the enormous popular demonstrations that kept Mr. Marcos from using military force against his opponents cost the Communists influence, Father Dumaual said. **********''It has now come out that the majority of the people want peaceful change, not armed struggle,'' he said. Policy Under Review **********In fact, one ranking Communist said today that the party's leadership had met over the last few days near Manila to determine a policy toward Mrs. Aquino. A decision, and possibly a public announcement of that policy, are expected by the end of the week, the source said. **********In Samal, Mayor Forbes, a slight, balding man of 60 years, does not acknowledge any compromises with the rebels. ''This is not true, I was for President Marcos,'' he said, sitting on the patio of his ranch-style house facing Samal's main street. **********But he does take pride in having been the first Bataan mayor to publicly join demonstrations against a nearby nuclear power plant that Mr. Marcos ordered built and that Communist-led organizations have been protesting for several years. ''It is an enormous waste of money at a time when so many of our people are poor,'' Mr. Forbes said of the $2.1 billion plant. ''If there is an accident, we will be the first victims.'' **********Last summer, guerrillas blew up 40 of the plant's steel transmission towers just south of Samal. Opposed to Military Abuses **********Mayor Forbes also says, ''I have always stood for the rights of my people to be free of abuses by the military.'' Before he became Mayor in 1979, he said, the constabulary troops in Samal stole rice, chickens and clothes from the poor, and Government soldiers sometimes shot innocent civilians. **********''Now I have told them, they must first get permission from me before arresting anyone,'' he said. For Filipinos, accustomed to an unchecked military, that is an almost unheard of action. **********But his policy has not stopped killing by the rebels. Last week a military doctor and a civilian Government employee were assassinated by guerrillas in a Samal village while giving a lecture on drug abuse. **********Samal is too close to Manila for the guerrillas to have yet started many of their own policies, such as communal farming, as they have in some other areas, said a local Communist Party member. Rebels Aid Tenant Farmers **********But Mr. Forbes noted that the N.P.A. did actively intervene ''to protect the rights of the small tenant farmers against the large landlords whenever there is a conflict.'' Rebel propaganda teams also openly campaign in the town for the closing of the two American bases, which they regard as part of the ''American imperialism'' controlling the Philippines. **********Government agents have had a hard time trying to infilitrate Samal, Father dumaual said. Recently a military intelligence officer, dressed as an ice cream vendor, began asking the children who followed him questions about where certain people lived. Father Dumaual said the children reported their suspicions to the guerrillas, and the next time the vendor appeared, he was shot. **********In Abucay, the town just south of Samal, Mayor Maxima de la Fuente conceded, ''It is very hard to be Mayor in an area like this. On one side you have the army, on the other the N.P.A. You have to be very careful how you act.'' **********Until last summer, when the Government sent in a detachment of 36 marines who have built an outpost in front of her house, the Mayor said she often had to cooperate with the Communists. **********''If they asked me for help when one of their men got arrested,'' she recalled, ''I would help get him out.'' **********Now the rebels have sent her a warning to get rid of the marines, who have slowed down their activities, she said. **********''It was only a first warning,'' Mrs. de la Fuente said. ''If they were really serious, they would send a second warning, with a black ribbon around it. Then the third warning is fatal.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/15/world/white-house-crisis-dollars-traveled-iran-money-flow-tracing-complex-steps.html": {"writer_name": "Jeff Gerth", "pub_date": "1986-12-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1852, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "THE IRAN MONEY FLOW: TRACING THE COMPLEX STEPS", "print_headline": "THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS: HOW THE DOLLARS TRAVELED; THE IRAN MONEY FLOW: TRACING THE COMPLEX STEPS", "body_text": " **********Investigators are still trying to map the complex flow of money used in the Iranian arms transactions, but they have concluded that the operation had three main reasons: The arms sales themselves required secrecy; the relationship among the participants was politically sensitive, and the disposition of the proceeds may have involved illegalities. **********At this point in the investigation, according to Congressional and other government investigators, both ends of the financial chain remain unclear: the source of the money used to pay for the American arms shipped to Iran and the disposition of the extra profits left over, which Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d has estimated at $10 million to $30 million. **********Although Mr. Meese has said these profits were diverted to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, many questions have been raised about whether this amount of assistance actually reached the contras and where else it might have gone. **********For at least some of the sales, in 1986 when the diversion took place, the money flow went essentially like this: *********** Since the Iranians declined to pay for the arms in advance, the original funding came from and through a Saudi Arabian businessman, Adnan M. Khashoggi, who acted as a guarantor for Iran. He deposited $25 million to $30 million in advance in a Swiss bank account controlled by Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North. It is still not clear where all of Mr. Khashoggi's money came from. *********** That $25 mllion to $30 million was the price established by the United States and apparently agreed to by Iran. This price substantially exceeded the American cost of the arms as accounted for on Pentagon books, which was $12 million. The $12 million was paid back to the United States via another Swiss bank account controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency. The C.I,A,, in turn, reimbursed the Defense Department. *********** The rest of the money remained under the control of Colonel North and his associates. These associates included Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, retired, and his business partner, Albert Hakim. The three are known to have had joint control of at least one Swiss account, which the Justice Department has asked Swiss authorities to monitor. *********** Some of this leftover money was apparently used by Colonel North and his associates to supply the contras. Part may also have gone for commissions to arms dealers, though all the participants have denied any such fees. In addition, it has been reported that some of this money may have gone for American political activities. Public and Private **********This account suggests that although the sale of arms was between two Governments, the financial details were largely handled by private individuals. Some of these individuals, like Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Hakim, have a history of using Swiss bank accounts to divert money and make questionable payments, according to public records. **********Had the finances of the arms sale been handled by the United States Government, various laws and regulations would have prevented or limited the deal. For example, the C.I.A. would have needed Congressional authorization to spend any of its money on the deal, and military laws and regulations would have prevented any diversion, limited any comissions to $50,000 and possibly required disclosure to Congress. **********No one involved in the deal has yet to testify under oath. Nor have any bank records been subpoenaed or examined, a crucial step in any financial investigation. It could take years to gather all the evidence - for example, it took the Securities and Exchange Commission more than two years to get Mr. Khashoggi to testify under oath during its investigation in the 1970's into questionable payments by American military contractors in the Middle East. Testimony and Interviews **********But some information has been developed. Mr. Meese questioned Colonel North and examined some documents at the National Security Council, which led the Attorney General to announce last month that $10 million to $30 million had been diverted for the contras from 1986 arms sales to Iran. William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, and others have testified before Congress. **********Furthermore, Mr. Khashoggi and the Iranian middleman in the deal, Manucher Ghorbanifar, gave limited interviews last week to ABC News. Other accounts and documents support some of their statements to the network, although contradicting others. Both Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Ghorbanifar were experiencing cash-flow problems during the time of the sales, according to documents, which show, among other things, that checks to Mr. Khashoggi from the Iranian middleman went uncollected for as long as six weeks. **********A partial reconstruction of the finances of the deal, based on these various sources, begins chronologically in August 1985, when the first shipment of arms took place, with the help of various Israelis. The Israelis appear to have played a minimal financial role in the 1985 deals and no financial role in those this year. A $1 Million Advance **********In August 1985, Mr. Khashoggi advanced $1 million to the Israelis to pay for the first shipment and was paid back by Mr. Ghorbanifar, acting on behalf of the Iranian Government, that same month. Mr. Ghorbanifar's check, drawn on the Geneva branch of Credit Suisse Bank, was deposited in Mr. Khashoggi's account at the Monte Carlo office of the Banque Libano Francaise, copies of bank records show. **********Mr. Khashoggi immediately transferred the $1 million to an account at Credit Suisse, records show, but it is not clear who controlled the account or where the money went from there. **********In September 1985, another shipment of arms occurred, again with the assistance of the Israelis. Mr. Khashoggi advanced $4 million and was repaid that month by Mr. Ghorbanifar. **********By early 1986, when the next shipment took place, the Israeli arms dealers were no longer involved with Mr. Khashoggi and Mr. Ghorbanifar. Mr. Khashoggi has said he advanced $10 million in March to an account at Credit Suisse controlled by Colonel North. The account was in the name of Lake Resources. **********Lake Resources was organized as a Panamanian Corporation in May 1985 by Swiss accountants tied to Mr. Hakim. The company's address in Fribourg, Switzerland, is the same as that of Mr. Hakim's company, Stanford Technology . Lake Resourcrs was dissolved last month, soon after the first disclosure of the arms sales. U.S. Request on Accounts **********The Lake Resources account is one of the two accounts that the Justice Department has asked the Swiss Government to monitor. This is the same account Colonel North used earlier this year when he sought money from a Texas businessman, H. Ross Perot, to possibly ransom some of the American hostages in Lebanon. **********Copies of bank records show that an account at the Monte Carlo office of the Saudi-connected Bank of Credit and Commerce International, apparently controlled by Mr. Khashoggi, advanced $12 million to an unknown destination on Feb. 7, 1986. **********The records further show that Mr. Ghorbanifar wrote four checks of $3 million each on Feb.26 to pay back the $12 million. The $12 million, however, was not fully collected until April 11, the records show, suggesting that Mr. Ghorbanifar was experiencing a cash-flow problem. **********Mr. Khashoggi himself was experiencing financial difficulties at the time. He has said that he borrowed money from investors in Canada and the Cayman Islands to finance the Iranian-connected advances in 1986. Role of 2 Canadians **********Congress has been told that two Canadian businessmen who are close associates of Mr. Khashoggi, Donald Fraser and Ernest Miller, were two such lenders, according to a Government official. Mr. Fraser and Mr. Miller are closely tied to two Cayman Island companies that lent Mr. Khashoggi and one of his companies tens of millions of dollars in early 1986, according to public records. Where Mr. Fraser and Mr. Miller got their money is not clear. A Canadian paper reported that Mr. Miller received tens of millions of dollars earlier this year from a bank in Hong Kong. **********The overlapping financial dealings suggest that Mr. Khashoggi's financing of the arms sale was an extension of his other commercial activities. **********It was also around this time, beginning in February, that Mr. Casey has told Congress that the C.I.A. received four checks from an unknown number of accounts totaling about $12 million, according to Government officials familiar with the testimony. The corporate names of one of these accounts is Lake Resources. **********The next shipment of arms took place in May of 1986. Mr. Khashoggi has said he advanced $15 million to the Lake Resources account, to guarantee payment for the Iranian purchase. Both he and Mr. Ghorbanifar, however, have said that the Iranians repaid only $5 million of the advance, leaving a shortfall of $10 million, plus an additional $1.5 million in interest due to Mr. Khashoggi's lenders who advanced him the $15 million. #2 Transactions Scrapped Facing financial difficulty, Mr. Khashoggi apparently did not finance two subsequent arms shipments last summer and last fall, and it is not known how these transactions were structured. Mr. Khashoggi apparently repaid the $11.5 million to his associates at a later date, avoiding a dispute that might have exposed the secret Iran dealings. **********It is not known if he recovered the $11.5 million, but a Khashoggi associate said a Saudi bank closely linked to the ruling Saudi royal family provided Mr. Khashoggi with $35 million last summer. The bank, the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, is the only Saudi bank not regulated by the Saudi monetary authority, the Khashoggi associate added. **********Mr. Khashoggi has said he was not aware of the diversions to the contras. Mr. Ghorbanifar did ask him to help finance the contras, an offer Mr. Khashoggi said he refused. But one of Mr. Khashoggi's associates in the deal, Roy Furmark, came to suspect that money was being diverted, Congressional officials said they were told. **********The Justice Department has named Mr. Hakim and General Secord as the other two people besides Colonel North suspected of being involved in the diversion. There are a series of circumstantial ties linking the men. Swiss Company Bought Planes **********At least one of the Swiss accounts controlled by Colonel North was also controlled by General Secord and Mr. Hakim, according to Swiss officials. A Swiss company linked to Mr. Hakim, Compagnie de Services Fiduciaries, paid for the purchase of aircraft for use on behalf of the contras, according to sources familiar with the transaction. **********General Secord directed the purchase of the craft, the sources added. General Secord and Mr. Hakim are joint owners of the Stanford Technology Trading Group International, according to public records. Officials of the company, including General Secord, have been tied to support for the contras, based on accounts of pilots and phone records. Finally, Stanford Technology had the same address in Geneva as C.S.F., the Swiss company suspected of acting as a conduit through which some of the diverted Iranian arms money flowed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/29/business/people.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Dougherty", "pub_date": "1986-10-29", "snippet": "", "word_count": 57, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "People", "print_headline": "People", "body_text": " *********** Stephen Badenhop has been named senior vice president, account services; Robert E.

Wilson, is riding high among his prognosticating peers. **********Mr. Wilson, who is 48 years old, was awarded the sixth annual Silbert Economic Forecasting Award yesterday for the accuracy of his projections about the economy in 1983, 1984 and 1985. He was chosen from among the 51 forecasters who participate in a widely followed survey conducted monthly by the economist Robert J. Eggert for his ''Blue Chip Economic Indicators'' newsletter. **********''I do make some use of econometric models; that's the starting point,'' said Mr. Wilson, who accepted the $5,000 award from Lawrence R. Klein, a winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, who pioneered work with econometric models. ''However,'' Mr. Wilson continued, ''anybody who focused solely on models for the past two years would have missed the mark and will miss it again in 1987 because of the major structural changes taking place in the American economy.'' **********Mr. Wilson said those changes include lower inflation, a huge increase in the Federal budget deficit, a sweeping overhaul of the tax laws and the increasing interdependence among the economies of the United States and its major trading partners. ''Nineteen eighty-seven is a critical year, one that will tell us a great deal about our future and whether we can absorb all these changes and move into a new era of sustained economic growth,'' he said. **********As it happens, Mr. Wilson's forecast last year of a 2.7 percent increase in gross national product for 1986, which is not included in the period for which he received the award, looks like it will be right on target. His award-winning forecast for 1985, which is weighted twice as heavily as those for 1983 and 1984 in the judging, got a bull's-eye on the unemployment rate and was off by only a tenth of a percentage point for G.N.P. and four-tenths of a percentage point for inflation. **********The forecasting award, which is sponsored by the Sterling National Bank and Trust Company of New York, went last year to Timothy J. Sullivan, economist and vice president for the Wall Street firm of Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder Inc. At that time, Mr. Sullivan was projecting a 2.0 percent increase in G.N.P. for 1986. **********All things considered, Mr. Wilson said, the outlook for 1987 is ''reasonably good.'' He sees growth of 2.2 percent, slightly lower than the current consensus, and expects the Consumer Price Index to rise by 3.6 percent next year, compared with a rise of about 2 percent in 1986. Mr. Wilson sees little change in the current 6.9 percent unemployment rate. **********In addition, Mr. Wilson expects the trade deficit to improve, debt-burdened consumers to continue spending and the Federal Reserve to lower the discount rate another half a percentage point following a very weak first quarter in 1987."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/world/paris-said-to-seek-deal-with-syrians-to-curb-terrorism.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Bernstein", "pub_date": "1986-10-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1274, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PARIS SAID TO SEEK DEAL WITH SYRIANS TO CURB TERRORISM", "print_headline": "PARIS SAID TO SEEK DEAL WITH SYRIANS TO CURB TERRORISM", "body_text": " **********There were signs today that France was moving toward closer cooperation with Syria in an effort to curb terrorism in Paris, less than a week after Britain severed diplomatic ties with Damascus, also over terrorism. **********The French moves, disclosed by officials and in news reports here, were said to be aimed at winning Syrian cooperation in halting terrorist bombings in Paris and in obtaining the release of French hostages in the Middle East. **********At the same time, France reached a settlement today with Iran on a major cause of friction between the two nations, a dispute over a $1 billion loan made to France by Iran before the present Iranian Government came to power.

The Syrian Government, he said, is trying to demonstrate not only that ''it was not implicated in these incidents, but also that it is ready to do everything to help us.'' Rejected British Request **********France was among several European nations that rejected a request by Britain at a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday for collective punitive measures against Syria. British officials cited was they said was Syria's role in an attempt in April to blow up a London-to-Tel Aviv Israeli jetliner carrying 375 people, about 200 of them Americans.

He also said deliveries remaining on arms sales contracts signed by the Socialist Government in 1982 and 1984 had been suspended. **********Some officials here said Syrian embarrassment over British charges of terrorist involvement - and Syrian concern that other European nations might eventually accept British demands for punitive measures - might have helped France gain Syrian help in curbing terrorist activities, even though the Syrian intelligence service might have provided help carry out terror attacks in the first place. **********The Le Monde report that the Government was seeking close cooperation with Syria was bound to produce controversy in this country, where many have argued in recent weeks that France has mistakenly compromised with Middle East radicals.

But the divestiture, if it occurs, might also enable the concern, based in Akron, Ohio, to remain independent of an investment group put together by Sir James Goldsmith, the British-French investor. **********Last Friday, Sir James disclosed that his group owns 12.5 million shares of Goodyear, equal to 11.5 percent of the stock outstanding, and has considered taking over the company. **********Late last month Goodyear said it was studying the possibility of a restructuring. ''We expect to have the restructuring plan ready to announce to the public within the next two weeks,'' Robert E. Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement issued yesterday. **********''One key element under consideration is sale of the Celeron subsidiary, including its oil and gas facilities, reserves and the west-east crude-oil pipeline now nearing completion, and we are contacting potential buyers at this time,'' Mr. Mercer continued. **********Other assets that the company might decide to sell include its aerospace business and its chemical operations, analysts said. Goodyear, however, made no mention of these operations in its statement. **********Goodyear would presumably use the proceeds from the sale of assets to repurchase its own stock. The company has also tripled its bank credit lines in recent days, to $3 billion, according to a banking newsletter. Rich Stock Price **********By repurchasing its shares, the company would aim to make its stock price too rich for the Goldsmith group, which has said that the shares had already appreciated too much for it to make a tender offer. The stock closed yesterday at $48.25, down 37.5 cents, on volume of more than 3.8 million shares, making it the second most active issue. Less than two months ago, the company's stock traded for as little as $30 a share. **********Goodyear purchased Celeron for $822 million worth of stock in 1983, proclaiming then that the move would help it become less dependent for its profits on the volatile automotive industry. The purchase of Celeron for stock, ironically, had much to do with the depressed price of Goodyear's shares, which in turn, led to its attractiveness to Sir James. **********''Ever since they purchased Celeron in 1983, they've been criticized because they issued a lot of common stock to do it and it diluted the earnings,'' said Donald F. DeScenza of Nomura Securities International, who believes Celeron could now fetch between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion from the right buyer. **********And the purchase of the energy business produced a double whammy, as declines in oil and natural gas prices pulled down the earnings for the company as a whole. Celeron's Attractiveness **********Still, Celeron could be attractive to a company looking for oil and natural gas reserves as well as an efficient pipeline system. ''This is a very well conceived pipeline,'' Mr. DeScenza said, referring to the company's nearly completed crude-oil pipeline connecting offshore California wells to Texas refineries. **********It was confirmed yesterday that Hanson Trust, a British company with a war chest of $5.5 billion in cash, was a 20 percent partner in Sir James's group. **********While Hanson's name did not appear in the official documents filed on Friday, Sir Gordon White, head of Hanson's United States operation, said in a telephone interview yesterday that his company was a passive investor in Sir James's group. **********Goodyear made its statement about Celeron in a news release that confirmed details of Sir James's filing, including the fact that a meeting had taken place Thursday between the British investor and Mr. Mercer. **********''Our discussion centered on Mr. Goldsmith's purpose in acquiring our stock,'' Mr. Mercer said in his statement. The company said its officials were not available for elaboration. Sir James's Statements **********Sir James had previously disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that his discussion with Mr. Mercer focused on returning Goodyear to its core tire business. **********''Our views somewhat diverged on the desirable degree of focusing on the core business,'' Sir James recounted in a letter sent to Mr. Mercer a day later, which was included in the S.E.C. filing. ''I believe it is fair to say that you felt that the growth of Goodyear's other businesses created a good equilibrium for the corporation as a whole, whereas I, admittedly without inside knowledge, felt that a greater concentration on the core business would be more beneficial.'' **********''It is in the core business that the company has its particular knowledge and strength,'' said Sir James's letter, which specifically ruled out his accepting ''greenmail'' in return for the stock he holds. **********According to Wall Street sources, Merrill Lynch proposed the Goodyear takeover to Sir James, who controls the Crown Zellerbach Corporation and a number of other companies. Banque Paribas is handling the financing of his group's purchases of Goodyear stock. **********Sir James ended the letter by saying, ''I look forward to speaking with you again next week when you've received your investment bankers' report.'' But Goodyear, which is being advised by Goldman, Sachs & Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that no meetings with Sir James are scheduled for this week. Directors Meeting Tomorrow **********Goodyear's board of directors, however, is due to meet tomorrow, although no significant developments are expected at that time. **********The company reported net income of $236.9 million, or $2.18 a share, in the first nine months of the year, a 27 percent drop from the corresponding period last year. The figures reflect a $110.8 million after-tax write-down for gas and oil reserves in the first quarter. Sales in the period increased to $7.58 billion, from $7.1 billion. **********Despite the lower earnings this year, Goodyear is not struggling in the manner of many companies engaged in heavy industries. Since 1980, the company's capital spending has totaled nearly $4.5 billion - $1.5 billion of that in the last year alone. It has worked to modernize its tire-making plants around the world. At the same time, the company will have invested $300 million in research and new product development by the end of the year. The result, analysts say, is a leaner company with upgraded operations that are the envy of others in the industry. **********Still, Goodyear's prospects for future profitability rest largely on the success of its diversification away from its tire business, many analysts insist. Goodyear is easily the dominant company in the tire business, but industry experts say there is little growth opportunity left in tires. **********''Diversification away from their tire business has been extremely sensible,'' said W. Dudley Heer, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. ''They want to reduce their dependency on the auto industry, which is a cyclical business. There is no growth in the tire industry, which is a dead business, and so it has made sense for them to get into energy and these other areas.'' **********That diversification would have worked better, however, if energy prices had not plummeted within the last year, analysts said.

Both courts said that Texaco did not have to post a $12 billion bond, as required by Texas legal procedure, or face the possibility of Pennzoil attaching liens to its property. **********Imposition of such requirements ''would rapidly produce a catastrophe of major proportions, causing substantial harm to Texaco itself and to thousands of others throughout the United States, including stockholders, customers and suppliers,'' United States Appeals Court Judge Walter R. Mansfield wrote. **********Texaco had argued that it would face financial disaster and possible bankruptcy, and would not have a chance to mount a meaningful appeal in the Texas courts, if it was denied Federal protection. **********The focus of the case will now shift back to the Texas courts, which will decide on the merits of the dispute between the companies over Texaco's acquisition of the Getty Oil Company two years ago. Texaco is expected to file its appeal soon of the state district court's ruling to the Texas Court of Civil Appeals. Eventually, the case could be appealed to the Texas Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court. **********Analysts and lawyers following the case called the decision a significant victory for Texaco. They said Texaco will not only find it easier to appeal in the Texas courts, but also will get leverage in any negotiations aimed at settling the case out of court. ''It puts them in a considerably stronger position,'' said Calvert Crary, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company 'We Win' **********''The net effect is, we win,'' said David Boies, Texaco's lead lawyer, seconds after being informed of the decision while in a conference room at one of the company's law firms in Houston. Members of the legal team cheered in the background. **********John K. McKinley, Texaco's chairman, said in an interview last night that the ruling was ''a very positive step.'' He said the company continued to believe it would succeed in reversing the Texas court's ruling that it must pay $10.53 billion plus interest to Pennzoil for interfering with Pennzoil's plan to acquire three-sevenths of Getty more than two years ago. Texaco subsequently acquired all of Getty for $10.1 billion. ''We're in an upbeat mood, and there's a feeling we'll now be able to carry out a realistic appeal,'' he added. **********J. Hugh Liedtke, Pennzoil's chairman, said Pennzoil probably would not appeal the latest ruling. ''We're interested in getting on with this case,'' he said. ''This is a step in the right direction, because it ends all of the talk that we're going to put them in bankruptcy or try to blackmail them'' into a settlement, he added. **********Separately, the Texas state court judge who tried the original case refused yesterday to hold a hearing on Texaco's motion for a new trial, effectively denying that motion. **********The Federal appeals court affirmed the preliminary injunction granted on Jan. 10 by United States District Judge Charles L. Brieant in White Plains, and left in place Judge Brieant's requirement that Texaco post $1 billion in security to insure that Pennzoil's interests are protected during an appeal of their tangled legal battle. Texaco posted that security on Feb. 5. 'Unconstitutional as Applied' **********In a 60-page unanimous opinion written for the three-judge panel by Judge Mansfield, the appeals court said that the Texas bond and lien requirements are ''unconstitutional as applied'' to this case. The other judges involved were Lawrence W. Pierce and J. Edward Lumbard. **********The appeals court said that Texas bond and lien rules violated Texaco's Constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the law. **********''The undisputed facts indicate that the automatic enforcement of the Texas lien and bond requirements against Texaco's property to the extent of $12 billion lacks any rational basis, since it would destroy Texaco and render its right to appeal in Texas an exercise in futility,'' Judge Mansfield wrote. **********But the appeals court rebuked Judge Brieant for raising questions about the fairness of the Texas trial. **********''Many of the judge's conclusions with respect to the merits of the Texas action, despite his lip-service disclaimer, constitute what amounts to an impermissible appellate review of issues that have already been adjudicated by the Texas court,'' Judge Mansfield wrote. **********Lawyers had watched the case closely, saying that its outcome could establish a precedent on the ability of the Federal courts to intervene in a state court proceeding. But the appeals court, while asserting that the Constitutional concerns outweighed any harm to Texas procedures, sought to minimize the chances that its ruling could be construed as giving sweeping authority to Federal courts to overrule state procedures. **********''Our exercise of Federal jurisdiction . . . does not open any floodgates,'' Judge Mansfield wrote. ''On the contrary, ours is a narrow holding limited to the unusual circumstances of this case.'' **********Some lawyers were not so sure. ''It's a dangerous precedent,'' said Martin Klein, of New York.

Texaco's lawyers said the request for a new trial would not effect their efforts to have the judge disqualified. **********''That still being your position, this court then is going to let the law take its course and you all are excused,'' Judge Casseb said. The judge then rose to leave the bench, ending a 90-second session. Texaco's motion for a new trial would automatically be denied on the deadline Monday if Judge Casseb does not issue a ruling. **********''I am astounded and flabbergasted,'' said Richard Miller, a Texaco lawyer, following the proceedings. ''He goes off on a pout'' because of the challenge to his qualifications, Mr. Miller said. A Texaco spokesman said the company was ''gravely concerned'' by the development. **********Texaco had sought to have Judge Casseb disqualified from issuing a ruling in the case on the ground that he was not a retired judge, as Judge Casseb claimed."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/business/new-farm-belt-crop-industry.html": {"writer_name": "Steven Greenhouse", "pub_date": "1986-06-26", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1366, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "NEW FARM BELT CROP: INDUSTRY", "print_headline": "NEW FARM BELT CROP: INDUSTRY", "body_text": " **********This east Iowa community is sharing in the misery of the farm crisis, but its 6,300 residents can boast of one thing that will make other farm towns envious: During the last year, three companies have decided to open factories here. **********''We have a lot of problems with agriculture at the moment,'' said Edward L. Tubbs, chairman of the Maquoketa State Bank. ''Our only chance to survive is to diversify.'' **********Like hundreds of farm communities throughout the Middle West, Maquoketa has seized on diversification as the best way to weather this farm crisis - and future ones. With this in mind, towns from North Dakota to Nebraska and Indiana to Iowa are straining not only to attract out-of-state industry but also to plant the seeds for home-grown industry. **********''The message is getting across to a lot of people: diversify your economy,'' said Rodney L. Bates, director of Nebraska's Department of Economic Development. ''Don't doubt that anymore, if you want to preserve your town.'' Stress on Low Taxes **********Town after town in the farm belt has formed economic development commissions to recruit industry by boasting of low taxes, central location and a dedicated and ample supply of workers, many of them farmers who lost their farms. Although rural economists note that there will not be enough new businesses to go around, they argue that diversification can make a significant difference for hundreds of farm communities. **********''Many towns were sitting fat, dumb and happy during the farm boom of the 1970's, thinking they had it made,'' said Kenneth E. Stone, a professor of economics at Iowa State University. ''But what's happened the last two years in many communities, with the epidemic of stores going out of business, woke up a lot of towns.'' **********Mark Drabenstott, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, added: ''As mainstream agriculture has gone through its traumatic adjustment, we've seen small farm towns first try to assess blame for what's happening and then try to stop what's happening. Now they're finally coming to grips with it and are trying to take control of their own destinies.'' **********Although a few farm towns have had development commissions for years, that number has mushroomed recently - to more than 300 in Iowa alone - and the recruitment efforts have already begun to pay off. **********Officials in Ellsworth, a central Kansas town of 2,800, have persuaded a Maryland company to open a 50-employee warehouse that distributes children's toys. Hastings, Neb., has attracted a 55-employee plant that produces ethanol fuel from corn, and a precision-instruments plant with 175 workers. And Guttenberg, a town in northeast Iowa, has lured an electronics plant that employs 200 and an auto parts factory with 25 workers. 'We Had to Get Involved' **********''A farmer called me one day and wanted to know if there were any jobs in town for his son, and there weren't,'' said Karen Merrick, the Mayor of Guttenberg. ''That's when I realized we had to get involved in economic development. If we lose people like that farmer's son to Chicago or Minneapolis, our economic problems will be compounded.'' **********In Maquoketa, some 20 miles west of the Mississippi, people worried that the farm crisis would cause the town's jobless rate to soar over 10 percent and cause retail sales, already 15 percent below 1979 levels, to deteriorate further. Thus, residents of Maquoketa (pronounced muh-COKE-et-a) banded together with an almost religious fervor to focus on economic development. **********Several dozen store owners donated $104,000 to hire a full-time business recruiter. The town put together an eight-minute video that tells companies why they should set up shop here. In addition, when Iowa authorities give leads to town officials about companies that want to build or relocate factories, Maquoketa sends out emissaries to sell them on this pastoral, picture-postcard town. **********''We can't control what's happening in Washington regarding farm programs and we can't control what's happening with farm exports,'' said Patrick Callahan, Maquoketa's city manager. ''All we can try to do is attract industry.'' #26 Jobs, 600 Apply So far Maquoketa has had more luck than most. Two months ago, Chess Line, a Wisconsin-based boat trailer company, decided to open a factory here. A year ago, Hoof Industries, a Chicago-based company, opened a new 50-employee factory here that makes automobile oil pumps. And just down the street, Jackson Industries recently opened a car radiator parts plant that received 600 applications for 26 positions, most of which start at $5 an hour. **********''Eastern Iowa is a depressed area right now, and they're really willing to deal to get a factory in,'' said Ronald Bohn, manager of the Jackson Industries plant, a division of the New York-based Handy & Harman. **********Jackson Industries and others were attracted by Maquoketa's low-interest industrial revenue bonds. (The use of such bonds would be restricted by the tax legislation nearing final approval in Congress.) Another draw was that Maquoketa constructed several hangar-like buildings for manufacturers to use immediately. Labor Force Is Praised **********But what persuaded Addison Hoof, president of Hoof Industries, that Maquoketa was for him was the quality of the labor force. ''The difference was the attitude of the people, the work ethic,'' he said. **********''When these people were farming, they used to work from sun-up to sundown and then milk the cows,'' said Mr. Bohn of Jackson Industries. ''So they have no complaints about putting in an eight-hour day.'' **********What is more, after struggling for years to make ends meet, farmers forced to seek work in factories appreciate a regular paycheck. Fred Schnipkoweit, a muscular machinist at Hoof Industries who gave up farming after 20 years, said, ''Here I'm getting paid for my work, but on my farm it seemed like you were paying out money when you worked.'' **********Farm belt states are assisting the development efforts of their towns. Iowa pays half the salaries of new employees while they are trained. Adopting a program similar to those in other states in the region, Kansas has invested $10 million in a venture capital company - an amount matched by that state's bankers - to help entrepreneurs start companies. And Nebraska has financed a Food Processing Institute that does research - and aims to create industrial jobs - in that field. Some Economists Cautious **********But some economists say it would be foolhardy for every farm town to think that attracting industry is the answer, particularly since basic industry in America is in a weakened condition. **********''A lot of agricultural communities are smokestack-chasing, and they are recognizing increasingly that this is not a viable alternative for everybody,'' said Rex Campbell, a professor of rural sociology at the University of Missouri. ''When something comes along like G.M.'s Saturn project, everyone and his dog goes after it. They realize that there's only a small possibility of winning it.'' General Motors decided to build its $3.5 billion Saturn car plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., last year following a seven-month contest involving 25 states. **********Recognizing the long odds, farm communities have adopted strategies other than ''smokestack-chasing.'' Several towns are trying to attract financial services companies, for example, but they are finding it hard going because those companies often favor much larger communities. **********In other towns, officials have concluded that it would be wise to try to process foodstuffs locally instead of shipping their crops elsewhere for processing. Many towns are also giving tax abatements and technical assistance to local entrepreneurs. **********''There is an increased realization that communities can help themselves with some leadership and some luck,'' said Professor Campbell of the University of Missouri. **********But some farm towns still hold out little hope. **********''We're trying, everybody's trying to diversify,'' said Virgil Miller, Mayor of Verdigre, Neb. ''But out here we're in a bad situation. We're 120 miles from the Interstate and that makes it hard for getting materials in. We're also far enough away so that electricity rates are higher here than in bigger towns. There isn't a heck of a lot we can do.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/10/business/week-in-business-a-surprise-partner-for-goldman-sachs.html": {"writer_name": "Merrill Perlman", "pub_date": "1986-08-10", "snippet": "", "word_count": 920, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SURPRISE PARTNER FOR GOLDMAN, SACHS", "print_headline": "WEEK IN BUSINESS; A SURPRISE PARTNER FOR GOLDMAN, SACHS", "body_text": " **********Sumitomo wants to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs, and has offered to pay $500 million for a 12.5 percent stake in the big securities firm.

They say competing suburban newspapers and unions are likely to oppose the merger on the ground that the resulting mega-daily would represent an economic monopoly that would thwart suburban competition and eliminate jobs. **********The proposed merger is also likely to rekindle the controversy over whether the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970, which allows joint operating agreements that otherwise would be illegal under antitrust law, preserves competition as was intended, or stifles it. **********A Free Press-News merger is likely receive special scrutiny from the Justice Department because both newspapers are among the largest in the nation and their merger would create the nation's largest joint operating agreement. Approval Expected **********But historically, no application for a j.o.a. has ever been denied by the courts, and with both newspapers able to show a history of unprofitability, newspaper analysts predict the merger will be approved. **********''It will have an awful lot of opposition, but I think it will go through,'' said John Morton, a newspaper analyst for Lynch Jones & Ryan in Washington. **********The Newspaper Preservation Act legalized joint operating agreements to preserve a failing newspaper as an editorial voice in a competitive market. The law was passed as an antidote to the trend for one newspaper in a city to become dominant, driving its competitor into unprofitability and, ultimately, out of business. **********To qualify to become a j.o.a., at least one of the newspapers must be unprofitable, and unlikely to change that status. **********Critics of the j.o.a. concept argue that it creates anti-competitive legalized monopolies that make it almost impossible for a genuine competitor to enter the market, and that a dominant newspaper enters into a j.o.a. only if it is afraid of competition. Otherwise, it would let its weak competitor leave the market. **********''In Washington, D.C., Cleveland, and Buffalo the owner of the dominant newspaper refused to enter a j.o.a.,'' said Stephen R. Barnett, a professor of law at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in newspaper antitrust matters. Key Question **********He said the key question in Detroit would be whether Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc., which owns The Free Press, has the responsibility to offer it for sale to a buyer who might be able to operate at a profit, eliminating the need to claim special antitrust protection under the Newspaper Preservation Act. **********This argument was made regarding an effort to stop a proposed j.o.a. in Seattle, which a Federal appeals court ultimately approved. But Professor Barnett said that the court did not directly address the question. **********Supporters of the j.o.a. concept argue that most newspapers operating within such agreements have a vigorous editorial competition, and that the weaker newspaper would have long been silent without the protection offered by a j.o.a. And they say there is no basis for believing a new competing newspaper would have successfully entered the market if there had been no j.o.a. **********''Since the end of World War II, no daily has been able to start up successfully in a metropolitan situation against existing competition,'' said Morris J.

Shultz told the Prime Minister of New Zealand today that as a result of their Governments' rift over nuclear policy, the United States no longer felt bound to come to New Zealand's defense under the 35-year-old Anzus treaty. **********But the Prime Minister, David Lange, minimized the seriousness of the American decision, insisting that it was meaningless since New Zealand faced no threat from anyone, and because the wording of the treaty made it clear that even in the case of a genuine threat to New Zealand, there was no automatic guarantee that the United States would help. **********He added that if New Zealand was faced with a concerted Soviet invasion, he doubted that no one would come to its aid. **********The suspension of the alliance was disclosed after Mr. Shultz and Mr. Lange, in their first meeting in two years, failed to make any progress in avoiding a rupture in relations that will become official in August. 'We Part Company' **********''We part company as friends, but we part company, as far as the alliance is concerned,'' Mr. Shultz said. **********A senior State Department official said formal written notification of the American decision not to be bound by the Anzus treaty to come to New Zealand's defense would probably await the passage by Mr. Lange's Government in August of a ''no nuclear'' law. **********The Reagan Administration made its decision because of New Zealand's insistence on banning visits by nuclear-armed and nuclear-powered ships. Washington regards that as a repudiation of Wellington's obligations under the accord, Mr. Shultz said. **********''I'd hate to see the New Zealand policy spread,'' Mr. Shultz said at a news conference this afternoon, ''because it would basically cripple the ability of the United States and our allies to defend the values that we and New Zealand and others share.'' **********Washington warned in April that it would take this step as a signal of its concern that a ban on visits by its Navy ships could lead to efforts by antinuclear activists to block such transit stops by American nuclear-armed ships and planes in other countries. Not Contagious, Lange Says **********Prime Minister Lange, however, ridiculed the contention that his Government's actions might be contagious. **********He said that since 1984, the deployment of American nuclear missiles has continued without letup in five European countries. **********''We have not seen the fragmentation of civilization as we know it,'' he said. ''We have been a responsible member of the Western community. We have discharged our obligations in the Pacific.'' **********''It is not as if we slipped somewhere between Albania and Nicaragua,'' he said. **********Mr. Lange also seemed confident that his Government would not lose domestic support over the rift with the Americans. Two-Year-Old Dispute **********The dispute between the two longtime allies over the nuclear ship issue has strained the Pacific alliance between Australian, New Zealand and the United States for the last two years. The treaty name, Anzus, is an acronym from the names of the three nations. **********The rift between Washington and Wellington has put pressures on Australia's Labor Government, which has sought to remain on good terms with both its Anzus partners. Foreign Minister Bill Hayden of Australia, who was here for the meeting of foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, stressed that Australia would maintain military ties with both the United States and New Zealand. **********This means that in practice, instead of one three-nation Anzus alliance, there will be two separate military arrangements in the region for the foreseeable future, one between the United States and Australia, and the other between Australia and New Zealand. **********The United States, Australia and New Zealand signed a mutual defense treaty for the Southwest Pacific in September 1951, originally to guard against a possible new attack by Japan, their common enemy in the war that ended six years earlier. **********Under the treaty, naval and air exercises were carried out routinely in the region. But the accession of the Lange Government in July 1984 created deep strains in relations because of Mr. Lange's commitment to banning all nuclear activities from New Zealand. Won't Confirm Nuclear Arming **********The United States has followed a policy of never confirming or denying that a particular ship or plane was carrying nuclear weapons. Many countries, such as Japan, Denmark, and Norway, profess nonnuclear policies but have not sought to make the United States disclose whether a ship or plane was carrying such weapons. The Administration sought to persuade Mr. Lange to adopt a similar passive policy, but he refused. **********Mr. Lange said the legislation that would be enacted by his Government in August ''will require that we do not have in New Zealand ships which are nuclear armed or propelled, and that's where the problem lies.'' **********He said Washington feared that his Government would carry out the anti-nuclear policy ''with a rigor that does not characterize other countries that purport to exclude nuclear weapons.'' **********In discussing his fruitless talks with Mr. Shultz, Mr. Lange said: ''The Secretary has said that the United States will withdraw its security guarantee. The Secretary said the security relationship is terminated.'' Essence of Alliance Cited **********Mr. Shultz, in confirming this at a separate news conference later, blamed Mr. Lange's Government for refusing to shift away from its antinuclear policy. ''New Zealand, in taking a position, in effect, that United States naval ships cannot call on New Zealand's ports, has taken away one of the essences of the military alliance that constitute Anzus,'' Mr. Shultz said. **********''In light of that, the United States considers that the treaty, at least as it has been understood, doesn't apply in the sense of the responsibility of the United States to extend its responsibilities to New Zealand,'' he said. ''At least that is the prospect of it as it is unfolding.'' **********The United States has responded so strongly, according to Mr. Shultz, because of American concerns that if New Zealand could prevent nuclear-armed Navy ships and Air Force and Navy planes from using New Zealand as a transit point, despite the commitments in the Anzus treaty, this could touch off efforts by antinuclear groups in other allied countries. **********''We don't have ships with nuclear weapons on them because we like it,'' Mr. Shultz said. ''We have them because the United States has a responsibility to deter aggression, and that comes from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has very large nuclear stockpiles, and if we don't have nuclear weapons and have the capability to deter their aggression with them, then we subject everyone, including ourselves, to nuclear blackmail from the Soviet Union.'' **********''So it would be a tragedy for freedom and Western values for the policy of New Zealand to spread,'' he said. Lange Reacts Nonchalantly **********Mr. Lange, when asked what the impact of the American move might be, reacted nonchalantly. **********''The practical meaning is that it will have an impact which I suppose will be very short and spectacular,'' he said. ''It will have a nine-day wonder effect.'' **********''Does the Anzus treaty determine through what eyes the United States sees a defense strategy throughout the Pacific?'' he said. ''Or is there a collective interest by people broadly of Western orientation to see that there is no physical molesting of smaller nations by huge countries?'' **********Mr. Shultz said the United States hoped that with the Anzus framework left intact, New Zealand at some point in the future would decide to alter its policies and allow the alliance to be revived."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/world/pretoria-signals-new-press-curbs.html": {"writer_name": "Alan Cowell", "pub_date": "1986-12-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 735, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "PRETORIA SIGNALS NEW PRESS CURBS", "print_headline": "PRETORIA SIGNALS NEW PRESS CURBS", "body_text": " **********An alliance of civil rights movements and activists, many of them whites, opened a campaign this week for the release of young blacks from detention. **********In a similar vein today, white women in Durban floated helium-filled balloons over a prison, with the names of detained youths emblazoned on them. **********A campaign is thus building for the release of young people held under the nation's emergency decree. **********After a public meeting in central Johannesburg, Matthew Molefe, an unemployed black driver, amplified on what he called ''a little story'' to explain why the campaign was needed. #13-Year-Old Daughter Detained On Sept. 24, at 4 A.M., he said, the policemen - two blacks, two whites -came to his home in Kagiso township near Krugersdorp and took away his 13-year-old daughter, Cleopatra. ''They just told us they are going to question her and bring her back,'' he said, ''but they never brought her back.'' **********Instead, she became a detainee -one of thousands of young people under the age of 18 said to have been seized under the emergency decree, proclaimed June 12 to curb protest. The decree permits indefinite detention without charge or trial, and the authorities are not required to say whom they have detained or why. **********It took a month to gain access to his daughter for prison visits, Mr. Molefe said, but even now he and his wife may visit her only twice monthly. And they may not visit her together, he said, because they need separate permits that allow only one visitor at a time. **********Mr. Molefe's plight mirrors that of thousands of parents across South Africa whose teen-age children are in detention without charge or trial. **********In a church hall in the city center, members of many civil rights groups and other foes of the Government - including the novelist Nadine Gordimer and the legislator Helen Suzman -gathered to denounce the arrests of young people and to demand their release before Christmas. 'Symptom of Sick Society' **********The detention of children, Ethel Walt of the Black Sash women's movement said, were ''a symptom of a sick society.'' The point of the campaign, Mrs. Walt said, was to signal to the authorities ''that we are no longer prepared to tolerate children behind bars.'' **********Sheenah Duncan, the former president of Black Sash, said supporters believed that between 1,300 and 1,800 people under 18 were now in detention, 400 of them in the Witwatersrand industrial area around Johannesburg. ''More than 50 children on the Witwatersrand are missing,'' she said. ''They have simply disappeared.'' The authorities, she said, do not acknowledge or identify young detainees. **********Black Sash estimates that since the emergency was imposed, 6,000 people under 18 have been detained - some of them to be released later - and many were held in overcrowded cells in which there were reports of sexual and physical assault by adult detainees. Some groups have higher estimates. Last week, the Detainees' Parents Support Committee, a group that monitors detentions, said that of the estimated 22,000 people detained under the emergency, 8,000 were under 18, of whom 4,000 were still in detention. **********''No one is going to pretend that all those detained are all little angels,'' Mrs. Duncan said, referring to the role some youths have played in the brutal conflicts of segregated black townships that have claimed over 2,300 lives in the last 27 months. **********''But civilized countries do not put their children in prison,'' she said. 'Treatment Is Very Bad' **********That view seemed to be shared by others at the meeting, including Mr. Molefe. **********''I don't have much to say,'' he said. ''I have just got a little story to say. We really don't know if they will be released or not. They do not get enough food. The treatment there is very bad.'' **********In a interview later, he said that on the night his home was raided, six other homes were raided and children were detained in Kagiso township. Twice, he said, the authorities rejected his application to visit his daughter. **********His daughter, he said, was not a political activist. Such activism is the reason cited sometimes by the authorities for detaining teen-agers. **********And when he visits her, he said, ''we can't hold hands - we are talking through glass.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/23/business/key-rates-450886.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-04-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 110, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "Statistics", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Key Rates", "print_headline": "Key Rates", "body_text": ""}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/15/business/finance-new-issues-auction-rates-up-at-citicorp.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 58, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Auction Rates Up at Citicorp", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Auction Rates Up at Citicorp", "body_text": " **********At its weekly commercial paper auctions, Citicorp yesterday sold $50 million of 91-day paper at an average rate of 7.874 percent, up from 7.673 percent the previous week. **********The bank holding company also sold $50 million of 182-day paper at an average rate of 7.869 percent, up from 7.550 percent a week ago."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/business/money-fund-assets-fall.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-01-03", "snippet": "", "word_count": 65, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Money Fund Assets Fall", "print_headline": "Money Fund Assets Fall", "body_text": " **********Assets of the nation's money market mutual funds fell $335.5 million, to $208.05 billion, for the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday.

Heatherly, acting administrator of the S.B.A., said in an interview that President Reagan's proposal to transfer its operations to the Commerce Department had been abandoned. **********''The transfer proposal is dead, and I don't expect it to be resurrected in this Administration,'' Mr. Heatherly said. ''The reality is that the small-business community wants an independent agency, and we accept that.'' **********An Emotional Campaign **********Mr. Heatherly's statement marked the end of a highly emotional two-year effort by the Administration to phase out the agency. In its campaign, the White House found only five Republican Senators to support its position, and it encountered widespread bipartison opposition. **********The Small Business Administration is of practical and symbolic importance to small business. The agency makes direct loans to small enterprises, and guarantees some bank loans. **********Beyond that, the small-business community values the agency as its official voice in the Government. The Administration's decision will leave the agency's voice role intact. Critical of Loan Losses **********At the same time, however, the S.B.A. administrator said he was considering increasing the fees charged to small businesses that seek loan guarantees and consulting services. **********Although the White House has ended its campaign to abolish the agency, it has not abandoned its goals of reducing the agency's size and of getting rid of S.B.A. programs it feels are wasteful. It has said the agency's loan losses are excessive. **********Some people's reaction to the change in White House policy, therefore, was tempered with caution. **********''I am pleased that the Administration has seen the wisdom expressed in Congress of maintaining the valuable asset of the S.B.A.,'' declared Senator Alan J. Dixon, Democrat of Illinois and a member of the Small Business Committee. Wary of Change in Fees **********But some members of Congress and small-business spokesmen said the contemplated increase in fees left them uneasy that the White House might seek to weaken the agency from within by raising the cost paid by small business for services. **********''This is just another way of reducing the agency's usefulness and effectiveness - by gradually dismantling its programs,'' warned Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan. ''If they can't do it directly, they will try to do it indirectly.'' **********Mr. Heatherly said the higher fees would be part of an effort to make the agency ''more self-sufficient.'' He said he was also considering ways of ''tightening up the eligibility standards'' for businesses that qualify for loan guarantees in an effort to reduce the program's losses, averaging about 11 percent a year. **********A small business is defined as any company with fewer than 500 employees. Such companies account for more than 40 percent of the gross national product. However, their influence as a lobbying force in Washington has been modest. A Variety of Programs **********In addition to the S.B.A.'s loan guarantee program - it assures repayment of principal and interest on a bank's loan to a small business - the agency also makes direct loans to businesses owned by minorities, veterans and disabled people, as well as providing consulting services for small businesses. **********When the Administration faced a budget-cutting challenge in early 1985, it proposed to liquidate the S.B.A.'s $9 billion portfolio of outstanding loans and merge the agency into the Commerce Deparment. **********That idea was immediately opposed by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Connecticut Republican who is chairman of the Small Business Committee. But it was not until early this year, when Mr. Heatherly was appointed acting administrator, that resistance from the small-business community solidified. **********On his first day, Mr. Heatherly dismissed six of the agency's 10 regional directors, asserting that they did not agree with the Administration's efforts to phase out the agency. That action galvanized support against the Administration's campaign. An Administration Mistake **********In the interview today, Mr. Heatherly acknowledged that it was a mistake to recommend at the same time both abolition of the S.B.A. as an independent agency and S.B.A. budget cuts of $2.5 billion over three years. **********''Transferring it to the Commerce Department really had nothing to do with budget savings, and I think the Administration realizes that now,'' Mr. Heatherly said. ''Everyone thought it was an attack on small business. We are just trying to drop that issue now and talk about the more pressing matters, such as the future of the loan programs.'' **********Mr. Heatherly underscored his determination to continue to examine the S.B.A.'s lending, loan guarantee and educational programs. He said he would consider imposing user fees throughout the agency's consulting programs as a way to lessen the agency's reliance on taxpayer funds. **********But G. Thomas Cator, legislative counsel for Small Business United, a trade association, questioned whether the agency could raise user fees without Congressional approval."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/15/world/white-house-expressing-our-outrage-imposes-several-sanctions-against-syrians.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-15", "snippet": "", "word_count": 622, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "WHITE HOUSE, EXPRESSING 'OUR OUTRAGE,' IMPOSES SEVERAL SANCTIONS AGAINST SYRIANS", "print_headline": "WHITE HOUSE, EXPRESSING 'OUR OUTRAGE,' IMPOSES SEVERAL SANCTIONS AGAINST SYRIANS", "body_text": " **********The White House announced several economic and political sanctions against Syria today, saying they were ''to express our outrage'' against reported Syrian involvement in an attempt to blow up an Israeli airliner in London. **********''These measures and our own actions will send a clear and unequivocal message to Syria,'' said Larry Speakes, the White House spokesman.

a Barrel", "print_headline": "FUTURES/OPTIONS; Prices for Crude Oil Fall Below $11 a Barrel", "body_text": " **********Prices for crude oil plummeted below the $11-a-barrel level yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and those of petroleum products also sank sharply. **********Crude oil contract prices for West Texas Intermediate, the major American blend, closed at $10.42 a barrel, down $1.02 from Thursday. (The market was closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.) Crude oil prices on the open market fell to their lowest levels since 1978. The West Texas crude oil closed at $10.35 a barrel, off 95 cents, on the open market, while the British Brent blend fell 90 cents, to $10.40. **********Futures contracts for heating oil fell a cent, to just under 43 cents a gallon, and those for leaded and unleaded gasoline fell 3 and 4 cents, to just under 37 cents a gallon, respectively. **********Yesterday's fall means that crude oil prices have lost nearly $2 from last week's high of $12.25 a barrel, and product prices have fallen about 6 cents. **********Analysts said the plunge basically stemmed from pessimism about oil prices. That sentiment was deepened by remarks of Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, oil minister of the United Arab Emirates and a key official of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, that oil prices could fall as low as $5 a barrel. **********''The market refocused fully today on the huge oversupply of oil in the world, and Otaiba's comment just reinforced the concern,'' said Peter C. Beutel, assistant director of Rudolf Wolff Futures Inc. **********''He said $5 a barrel could be the low,'' Mr. Beutel continued. ''But in fact any number between $12 and $2 a barrel could be a number to which prices could sink and from which they could recover.'' **********Nauman Barakat of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company said the comment by Sheik Otaiba indicated that the Persian Gulf producers in OPEC ''want to drive prices as low as possible between now and April 15,'' when the next OPEC conference is to be held. The bearish sentiment was underscored by the fact that the Brent blend broke $10 for the first time in eight years, closing at $9.70 a barrel for July delivery on the open market yesterday. **********He said it was significant that Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, repeated yesterday that the cooperation of non-OPEC producers, particularly Britain, was essential in stabilizing the oil market, and that Saudi Arabia itself would not reduce its output of 4.4 million barrels a day."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/world/hijacking-in-karachi-6-suspended-at-karachi-airport.html": {"writer_name": "Richard Witkin", "pub_date": "1986-09-07", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1249, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "6 SUSPENDED AT KARACHI AIRPORT", "print_headline": "HIJACKING IN KARACHI; 6 SUSPENDED AT KARACHI AIRPORT", "body_text": " **********At least six members of the Karachi airport security force have been suspended for negligence in allowing the hijackers of a Pan American World Airways jumbo jet to drive onto the tarmac in a van disguised to look like an official security van, official sources at the airport disclosed yesterday. **********According to reports there, three of the hijackers wore security personnel uniforms, consisting of light blue shirts and dark blue trousers. They were also apparently able to obtain security badges or stars in a marketplace in Karachi, the informants said. **********In addition, officials said the Suzuki van the hijackers rented had apparently been painted the same blue color of the official van used by the airport security force. There was an unconfirmed report that they had added a light and a siren on the roof to help complete the disguise. **********Systems Are Vulnerable **********The hijackers' success in slipping past one or more checkpoints underscored the accepted belief of security experts that even the best screening systems are vulnerable to inventive violators. **********In another development, a little more information became available on the hijackers yesterday when it was disclosed that one of them had arrived Aug. 17 with a Bahrain passport and checked in at an expensive Karachi hotel, The Taj Mahal, where he apparently made preparations for the hijacking. **********Several issues are still to be resolved: What precise instructions did the checkpoint guards have for verifying the validity of plates on vans and identification documents of their occupants? Were the instructions inadequate? Did the guards fail to follow proper procedures? **********Another issue raised was whether one or more of the guards might have been in collusion with the hijackers. But a senior airport security official said that the hijackers definitely had no confederates at the airport. He said that the suspension of six or more guards, pending a full inquiry, had been for negligence in allowing the hijackers onto the tarmac. **********Specialists in airport security emphasize that human factors limit the effectiveness of even the most sophisticated protection system. This is true, they say, of metal detectors for screening passengers, and of various mechanical systems for screening carry-on bags, or luggage and cargo destined for an aircraft's hold. **********These experts continue to push for development and deployment of the most advanced detection mechanisms. But they warn that it is vital to make sure that fully qualified people are used to operate the equipment. **********''There's no point spending a lot of money on high-tech equipment if it's going to be used by low-tech people,'' said Rodney Wallis, security chief of the International Air Transport Association. The organization has a membership of 144 of the world's airlines. **********The general consensus is that controlling access to airport ramps remains the weakest part of the array of measures meant to insure that hijackers or saboteurs cannot act against airliners. **********Steady if uneven progress, it is felt, has been made in tightening the process for screening passengers and luggage as they go through boarding procedures. This has been accomplished by providing double screening systems in many cases, by upgrading the qualifications and background checks of personnel doing the screening, and by refining profiles of what types of passengers to suspect. **********About a week ago, a suspect was picked up in this way as he was preparing to board a flight in Miami. An extra search of his bags turned up paraphernalia he had planned to use to hijack the plane. **********What specialists most worry about is the screening of many types of employees who continually move from nonoperational areas onto the airport ramp and runway areas where planes are deployed. These employees - mechanics, caterers, luggage handlers - generally have to pass checkpoints and show proper identification. To be employed, they should have had their backgrounds checked. But the procedures vary from airport to airport. Partners of Hijackers **********Until the hijacking in Karachi, the main concern was that people with access to planes on ramps could be partners of hijackers who would board the plane through the normal screening process. The confederates on the ramp could plant weapons or explosives in prearranged locations on the plane, to be picked up by the hijackers on board. **********The dominant view of the experts is that what is needed most are stronger commitments by governments to carry out measures to minimize the threat. But because of past experience with the operations of security systems and with the follow-through on a series of international treaties, many officials express limited confidence that that significant progress in countering the hazard will be made readily. **********Several conventions for diplomatic sanctions against nations that encourage or harbor hijackers have been adopted since a quarter century ago when an epidemic of hijackings to Cuba put a constant spotlight on the problem. **********The wave of contemporary hijackings are deemed much more critical. Most of the early Cuban incidents were carried out by Americans who wanted to escape conditions at home with which they could not cope. The worst that awaited the rest of the passengers was a diversion of a few hours at the Havana airport and a quick return to the United States. Hijackers Are More Violent **********In recent years, the airlines have increasingly had to cope with hijackers prompted by more deep-seated political motivations and readier to resort to measures that would end in a blood bath. **********Three international conventions aimed at halting air terrorism hijackings were worked out in Tokyo, the Hague and Montreal. They required signatories either to punish or extradite hijackers and to return planes and passengers to their points of origin without delay. **********In the late 1970's, the seven major non-Communist powers approved the Bonn declaration designed to take concerted measures - such as interruptions of air service - against nations failing to live up to the conventions. But implementation of sanctions generally has been meager and the Bonn pact has been invoked in only one comparatively minor case. A declaration to make it more effective was approved at the Tokyo summit last spring. **********The hijacker who checked into the Taj Mahal Hotel was originally identified as Gomer Hussein, but yesterday hotel officials identified him as Bomer, showing that he had signed several checks with printed English letters with this name. According to hotel records he was last seen at the hotel Thursday evening, the night before the hijacking. The records also show that he ran up a hotel bill of nearly 15,000 rupees or nearly $1,000, and that he paid a little less than half of this sum. Hotel officials also said he had originally used his passport as a deposit at the hotel, but then retrieved it last week and put down 400 American dollars as a deposit at the hotel. **********Investigators said it was Mr. Hussein who rented a van from a private car rental agency to carry out the hijacking. **********The front office manager at the hotel said that Mr. Hussein went out in the morning and came back in the evening, wore jeans and a shirt, and that he often ordered meals of hamburgers and spaghetti from room service. **********Pakistan newspapers reported yesterday that three people who had dealings with Mr. Hussein had been taken into custody for questioning,"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/world/dealing-with-iran-how-experts-see-it.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-11-16", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1232, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "World", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "DEALING WITH IRAN: HOW EXPERTS SEE IT", "print_headline": "DEALING WITH IRAN: HOW EXPERTS SEE IT", "body_text": " **********President Reagan's decision to authorize unpublicized talks with Iranian officials and send them some weapons and spare parts has touched off a major dispute involving United States foreign policy and has prompted a heated debate that has transcended the usual partisan divisions in Washington. Mr. Reagan has angrily denied reports that he traded arms for American hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militants. Many of his critics challenge this assertion. Some experts who have followed the United States-Iran relationship, ranging from former Directors of Central Intelligence to scholars, were asked these questions: Is it good or bad to trade military supplies for hostages? What are the pros and cons of making such overtures to the Iranians? And what are the prospects for the United States to restore and improve its ruptured relations with Iran? Here are excerpts from their replies:  SHAUL BAKHASH  Professor of Government George Mason University **********For the U.S. Government that has made the foundation of its policy not to bargain with hostage-takers, trading arms for hostages is not a very wise policy. It encourages further hostage-taking; it sends the wrong signals to America's allies, and it suggests that the U.S. Government has not been straightforward with its own people. **********The policy of slow pressure, denial of arms and technology, attempting to give the specific country a bad name abroad has worked. The evidence is the small signs of moderation in Iran's foreign policy, including recent attempts to secure for itself a better reputation abroad. **********The U.S. has always posed a special problem for Iran because of the history of relations and because the current domestic strains working against the normalization of relations are very considerable.  R. K. RAMAZANI  Professor of Government University of Virginia **********The greatest concern I have is that this is going to prejudice our chances of an improving relationship in Iran in nonstrategic areas, because it has put egg on the face of the moderates, and now the moderates will go out of their way to distance themselves from us. **********The possible benefits one could think about are establishing some modicum of contact with the so-called pragmatists, and therefore pre-positioning ourselves for the postwar and post-Khomeini period. **********If indeed it is not in the United States interest for either of two belligerents in the Iran-Iraq war to win, then to the extent this maintains the balance of power, it is consistent with American policies to give arms. **********From Iran, we have perhaps seen exaggerated statements that this kind of deal might reduce our credibility with friends in the gulf region. These countries have their own reasons to maintain the dialogue with Iran.  WILLIAM QUANDT  Acting Director Foreign Policy Program Brookings Institution **********I would make a distinction between a one-time exception where you might get all the hostages for one dirty deal of spare parts to Iran and say that's it. What is particularly dangerous is to get into a more open-ended thing where, one by one, we get hostages out. It provides a perverse incentive to Iran to keep some hostages. **********The dangers are that, in setting up this pattern, it sends some signals to countries with whom you have been pursuing a different policy, You appear two-faced. **********The potential benefits are, I suppose, if you get the hostages out, it is worth something. It's harder for me to buy on to the argument that you gain serious entree to political circles in Iran that will benefit you in the future. In today's Iran, any Iranian will take arms where he can get them. I doubt he will feel any warm sentiments of gratitude.  RICHARD HELMS  Former C.I.A. Director Ex-Ambassador to Iran **********It depends a bit on the extent to which we have been sending spare parts. If it is, as I expect, a few spare parts, I would think this was not an unfair exchange. **********The danger in such a practice is that if one is prepared to pay for hostages, there may be no end to the number of hostages taken. **********On the other hand, it is reasonable to say that if this policy of trying to get back the hostages does not work, one can always jettison it. **********The benefits are simple. It gets back American citizens who have been taken by individuals or groups who have their own agenda. **********In this case, we're dealing with a Lebanese splinter group which wants to get back from Kuwait some of its members arrested in that country, but it is a splinter group not directed by any foreign state, be it Iran, Syria, or Lebanon.  WILLIAM COLBY  Former C.I.A. Director **********I have no objection to secret diplomacy and communication with anyone. It is particularly important to communicate with those who are opposed to us. On the other hand, this does not include providing weaponry. **********The danger is a strengthening of Iran in the gulf region. This could lead to pressure on Saudi Arabia and the gulf states in the short term. It could result in a surge of Islamic fundamentalism in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan, obviously Libya, Jordan, and nations all the way from Morocco to Indonesia. **********With the present Government, I have strong doubts. They have indicated total hostility. Their cause is fundamentally an ideological cause against the ''great Satan'' - the United States - and against modern culture and society.  STANSFIELD TURNER  Former C.I.A. Director **********It undermines our ability to lead the rest of the world in an anti-terrorist crusade, which we badly need to do. We had been telling other people not to deal with Iran. What the rest of the world has to perceive this as is a selfish, contradictory, hypocritical move on our part to do what we told others not to do. **********I am persuaded that this was primarily a swap of arms for hostages. It is asking people to be gullible to believe otherwise. **********Nobody in the Khomeini Government is going to cozy up to the United States. I think it is a very slim chance as long as Khomeini is in power, or even when Khomeini is gone. We would be well advised to stay in the background and let other free-world nations, such as Britain, Japan and France, be the point people for bringing Iran back into the community of nations.  ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI  National Security Adviser To President Carter **********If we had been able to obtain the release of all of the hostages for a single, self-contained shipment of arms, the arrangement would have been distasteful but palatable. Unfortunately we were were drawn into a situation in which armed shipments were apparently traded for hostages almost on a one-by-one basis. **********That creates two negative consequences: The Iranians can string us along and even take more hostages in order to keep the arms flow going. It creates the impression that the United States is siding with Iran against Iraq in the war. **********The effort to establish some links with some potential successors to Khomeini is justified by the geostrategic importance of Iran. I do not believe, however, that this need entail a continuing arms-supplying relationship. There are other ways in which such subtle relationships could have been cultivated."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/business/china-gets-a-30-second-message.html": {"writer_name": "Philip Gutis", "pub_date": "1986-01-12", "snippet": "", "word_count": 2206, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "CHINA GETS A 30-SECOND MESSAGE", "print_headline": "CHINA GETS A 30-SECOND MESSAGE", "body_text": " **********ON a Sunday late in February, right after the evening news, some 300 million residents of the People's Republic of China - 40 percent of its total population - are expected to watch the premiere of ''One World'' - a series of 15-minute international documentaries that is the first TV program produced in the West specifically for China. **********The Chinese Government and experts on Chinese culture have little doubt that almost everyone with access to a television set will tune in. ''There is a hunger in China for this kind of thing,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, a specialist in Chinese politics at the University of Michigan. ''It's going to be an overnight success.'' **********The General Foods Corporation, one of the sponsors of ''One World,'' has a lot riding on that success. It wants to develop a taste for coffee in China, a country of tea-drinkers. And it is making the debut of ''One World'' do double duty as the Chinese advertising debut of Maxwell House Coffee and its famous ''good to the last drop'' slogan. **********General Foods is joining a burgeoning club of blue-chip American corporations - including the Procter & Gamble Company, Coca-Cola, the International Business Machines Corporation, Boeing, Eastman Kodak and Colgate-Palmolive - that are trying to promote their products and corporate images in China through advertising. **********''We want to make Boeing synonymous with aviation in China,'' said Edward S. McLellan, advertising manager of the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company. ''If we can achieve that, we've got one hell of a marketing edge.'' **********Many companies say this is the time to establish a beachhead. ''Right now it's a seller's market in China,'' said Charles J. Diodosio, vice president for China development at the Beatrice Companies, which has been making soft drinks there for a year, and has plans for marketing ice cream and instant noodles. ''People have money to spend but nothing to spend it on.'' **********Unlike Americans, the Chinese do not tune commercials out - or off. ''People sit still for advertising because they are not saturated with it. It is viewed as a way of getting more information,'' said Scott D. Seligman, coordinator of China affairs for Burson-Marsteller, the public relations agency. **********Until the advent of ''One World,'' American companies generally presented their commercials on CBS reruns that China Central Television, the country's sole TV network, acquired in 1984. Shows included sports events, segments from ''60 Minutes'' and made-for-television movies. **********''The Chinese didn't pay for the shows,'' said Jayne Ferguson, CBS account executive for China sales. ''It is a barter arrangement in which we provide the programs and they give us the advertising time.'' **********The one-hour programs - which generally appear on Thursday evenings during ''golden time,'' the Chinese version of prime time that runs from 7 P.M. to 11:30 P.M. - contain 5 minutes of commercial time. A year's worth of advertising, or 32 minutes, costs each sponsor $300,000, Miss Ferguson said. **********The Chinese have bought another batch of reruns to show in 1986, and Miss Ferguson has signed up seven corporate backers: Boeing, Kodak, Stauffer Chemical and the Weyerhaeuser Company have each agreed to renew their agreement with CBS; Colgate-Palmolive, International Hydron and Philips Electronics Instruments are signing on for the first time. I.B.M., which had sponsored the CBS programs last year, declined to renew. **********American corporations can buy time from China Central Television for shows other than the CBS reruns, but they cannot specify when they will appear. The Chinese network airs commercials on randomly selected shows, and the American spots appear in competition with local ads and commercials from several other countries, primarily Japan and Hong Kong. **********Corporations thus generally prefer the CBS arrangement because it gives them some control. ''We knew exactly when our commercials would appear and that they would be highly watched,'' said George Conte, director of international marketing communications for Kodak. FOR foreign companies to be able to advertise at all in Communist China is a relatively new occurence. For a decade during the Cultural Revolution, product advertising was banned as a ''Western gimmick'' and a ''capitalist poison.'' **********But now, millions of Chinese are wearing Western clothing, dancing to disco music and tasting fast food. About 50 million students are learning English and 40,000 of the country's most able college graduates have gone abroad to continue their studies. **********In 1978, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, in a harbinger of future ''open door'' policies, permitted product advertising to return. And now ads blanket China's 305 newspapers, 633 magazines, 155 radio stations and 57 television stations. **********Indeed, according to Government figures published in the English-language newspaper China Daily, more than 4,000 Chinese and foreign companies were advertising in 1984, compared to only 100 two years earlier. Companies that want advertising space in The People's Daily, the main Communist Party newspaper, or on China Central Television, reportedly must sometimes wait up to four months. **********The products and corporations being advertised keep growing more diverse. As part of his program of the ''four modernizations'' - developing science and technology, agriculture, industry, and national defense - Mr. Deng has committed his country to obtaining up-to-date equipment and skills. Since 1979, the modernization program has included an all-out effort to promote foreign investment. **********Direct investment in China by American companies now stands at $1 billion, most of it in the last two years, while exports to China were about $3.6 million in 1985, up 20 percent from a year earlier, according to John J. Callebaut, director of development for the National Council for U.S.-China Trade. **********Joint ventures between foreign companies and Government business organizations are becoming more common, particularly in consumer goods production, where China wants to cut back on imports. Coca-Cola, for example, has joint ventures in four Chinese cities. Eric Riggle, a Coke spokesman, says the relationship is ''a standard franchise agreement -we sell them syrup and concentrate and they, in turn, sell the beverage.'' **********At the same time, the new economic freedom has led to rising consumer expectations. Before Mr. Deng's reforms, Chinese families dreamed of purchasing the ''three bigs'': a bicycle, a wristwatch and a sewing machine. Today, the upgraded ''three bigs'' are a washing machine, a refrigerator and a television set (preferably color). **********The China Business Review estimates that 13 million to 15 million television sets will be sold in China this year. If accurate, that would increase the total number of television sets to 67 million - which would mean an even larger audience for programs such as ''One World.'' SO FAR, General Foods and **********Procter & Gamble are ''One World's'' only official sponsors. But Yue-Sai Kan, the New York-based Chinese cable television entrepreneur who is producing and acting as host for the series, is looking for four more companies willing to pay $450,000 for a 30-second commercial to run twice a week for a year; the price is set by the Chinese Government. **********In a parallel with the CBS arrangement, the Chinese Government is not paying Miss Kan to produce the 15-minute show. Rather, in the one-page official agreement with China Central Television, signed by Wu Fung, director of CCTV, Miss Kan is guaranteed the right to sell the commercial time for her series. **********After production costs, Miss Kan said, any amount remaining from the $2.7 million in advertising revenue will be equally divided between herself and CCTV. **********''I think either she will break even or she will make a lot of money,'' said Mark Goodson, of Goodson-Todman Productions, who has known Miss Kan for several years. ''She will not lose money.'' **********Still, commercial success stories of companies that advertise in China continue to be based more on anecdotal evidence than statistical proofs. It will take many more years before the country's infant advertising industry reaches the sophistication of its Western counterparts. **********For example, Stauffer Chemical, a subsidiary of Chesebrough-Pond's, has promoted Ordron, its rice field herbicide, in China since 1980. The commercials, says Stassen Song, market development manager of the Pacific Basin, have made the Stauffer name ''very famous.'' But there are no market surveys to back up his claims. No company has that kind of information. **********''When you talk to the Chinese about viewer information,'' explained Mr. Seligman of Burson-Marsteller, ''they say only that they can promise a 'group of cadres of the highest level.' '' **********John Eger, senior vice president, CBS Worldwide Enterprises, says that CBS hired a Hong Kong market research firm to do limited testing on the effectiveness of advertisements on its shows. The random survey, carried out in Peking, Shanghai and Canton, questioned 400 people. **********''When asked what company makes film for cameras,'' Mr. Eger said, ''close to 70 percent of the people responded Kodak.'' Yet Mr. Conte of Kodak commented, ''We don't know who is watching, when they are watching, where they are watching from.'' **********Advertising in China is ''like using a shotgun rather than a .22,'' said Professor Lieberthal. ''You are hitting a lot of people who have nothing to do with your product - and some who do.'' YUE-SAI KAN: AMUSING AN 'UNTOUCHED' AUDIENCE **********Yue-Sai Kan is comfortably curled in a sleek black leather chair in her small apartment, a gentle blend of contemporary design and Chinese art in a fashionable section of Manhattan's East Side. Flipping through a sheaf of newspaper clips from mainland China's press, she translates some of the more colorful references. **********One article, for instance, labels her a ''Chinese princess from the screen'' who sends out ''subtle fragrance.'' **********Miss Kan is the producer and host of ''One World,'' the made-for-China series scheduled to premiere on China Central Television on Feb. 26. And the press attention is the Chinese Government's primary way of publicizing the show. **********''This is only the beginning of a major print campaign,'' Miss Kan said. ''The Chinese Government promised to promote my show the best way they know how - and believe me, they know how.'' **********Miss Kan, who is 37 years old, is a slender, dark-eyed woman with a taste for quality - Valentino dresses, silk upholstery, state-of-the-art audio equipment. ''Yue-Sai is a strange combination of classically oriental in the sense of politeness and tradition, and also absolutely hard working and ambitious in a very capitalist and entrepreneurial way,'' remarked Mark Goodson, the television producer, who is a close friend of hers. **********Miss Kan suggested ''One World'' to Chinese officials who had consulted her for advice about filming in this country for programs that are produced in China. In December 1984 the Chinese Government sent her a letter of agreement in which they gave her the right to produce the series and sell advertising on it, and promised her their full support in the endeavor. **********Last year, she traveled to nine countries on what she calls a ''blistering'' schedule. Filming, production, and promotion of the series consumed at least 16 hours a day, said Miss Kan, who works with a staff of about 20. **********The first segment of ''One World'' depicts the United States as a land of immigrants, with New York as an ethnic enclave. It shows the owner of a Polish sausage factory in Brooklyn dancing the polka, Indian women selling saris on the East Side and scenes from lower Manhattan's neighborhoods - Little Italy and, of course, Chinatown. **********A later segment of ''One World'' will show a filmed message from Pope John Paul II. The Pope offers encouragement for China's ''commitment of modernization and progress,'' then adds, ''I pray that Almighty God may abundantly bless the Chinese people and their worthy aspirations for progress and peace.'' Other segments take a look at the Bastille Day celebration in France, and towns and cities in Egypt. **********''The show is designed to entertain, to amuse and, lastly, to educate. I have an audience that is untouched,'' Miss Kan said. ''What China needs is new information, good information.'' **********Miss Kan was born in western China to a well-to-do family that fled to Hong Kong after the Communists came to power. She left the crown colony to attend the University of Hawaii, then came to New York in 1970. She and a sister started a textile importing business that eventually developed into a multimillion dollar trading company. **********Miss Kan, who had also been doing translations for cable TV, sold her share of the business to start ''Looking East,'' an earlier cable TV program that focuses on Asian topics for Occidentals and appears on 500 cable systems in 47 states. **********Acquaintances say that Miss Kan has a unique opportunity to make history. ''Whatever she says is going to have a tremendous impact on Chinese thinking,'' said Birabhongse Kasemri, the Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations from Thailand. ''Her show augurs well -not only for China and the United States, but also for the rest of the world.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/30/business/offer-for-safeway-may-be-delayed.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-07-30", "snippet": "", "word_count": 168, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Offer for Safeway May Be Delayed", "print_headline": "Offer for Safeway May Be Delayed", "body_text": " **********A $69-a-share, $4.25 billion tender offer for Safeway Stores Inc. may not begin officially until Friday, sources close to Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company said.

Pope Pius VI agreed to leave the choice to them, which was not unusual at the time. **********The story of Bishop Carroll underlines the unusual role that America has played in the Roman Catholic Church and the fact that conflicts today between Rome and elements of the American church are not new. Genuine Conflicts **********The recent struggles have been bitter, however, dividing the American church itself. And despite the insistence of some American bishops that differences between Rome and American Catholics are exaggerated, Vatican officials say the conflicts are genuine and have an importance that transcends the United States. **********The most dramatic cases have included the Vatican's decision to take away some of the powers of Archbishop Raymond G. Hunthausen of Seattle and to strip the Rev. Charles Curran, who has dissented from official teaching on sexuality, of his right to teach as a Roman Catholic theologian. **********These cases are only part of a broader questioning of Rome in the United States that includes sharp attacks on the all-male, celibate priesthood, the church's teachings on homosexuality, birth control, abortion and divorce. **********According to a New York Times/ CBS News Poll in November 1985, a majority of American Catholics favored permitting Catholics to get divorced and marry someone else (73 percent), favored the use of artificial methods of birth control (68 percent), favored letting Catholic priests marry (63 percent) and favored letting women become priests (52 percent). **********The dissent on sexual questions, and especially birth control, offers the most dramatic and widespread example of diasaffection among many of America's 52 million Catholics. Here, in the view of the Vatican, is where modernity has made great, and dangerous, inroads. **********''The major problem the hierarchy faces may be that Catholics simply don't believe in hell and eternal punishment the way they used to,'' said Prof. Monika Hellwig of Georgetown University, president of the Catholic Theological Society of America. **********''The American laity, especially the college-educated,'' she said, ''is well aware that the hierarchy doesn't have many sanctions against them. It's harder to frighten them.'' **********If the changes wrought by the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) produced ferment and turmoil all over the world, the American church went through additional transformations. **********Old ethnic enclaves slowly broke up, and millions of American Catholics were shorn from roots. Parochial schools tied to the ethnic parishes declined. **********Throughout this century, moreover, the educational levels of American Catholics have dramatically risen, leading to a more inquisitive and, in some cases, more skeptical flock. **********Above all, there were the cultural and sexual revolutions of the 1960's, which coincided with the Vatican Council. **********The Rev. Thomas Herron of Philadelphia, an official of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican body charged with safeguarding orthodoxy, argued that the Vatican Council's liberalizing effects are often confused with the far broader upheaval in American society. **********''People tend to blame the council for many things that had far more to do with the counterculture,'' he said. ''We are still dealing with the effects of an enormous revolution that we still do not fully understand.'' **********''What is clear,'' he said, ''is that the 1960's involved a revolt against authority, and few institutions had such a powerful sense of authority as the Catholic Church. So the rebellion in the church may have been much stronger than against almost any other institution.'' U.S. Catholics: More Faithful? **********Even Vatican officials who see serious problems facing the American church today acknowledge its continued strength and the enormous energy of its members. **********''We understand that the Catholic Church in the United States is one of the most dynamic churches in the world,'' said Archbishop Jan Schotte, a Belgian who is secretary general of the Synod of Bishops and a key Vatican official. **********Pope John Paul II, who will visit the United States next year, shares this view, said Joaquin Navarro Valls, the chief Vatican spokesman. ''The Pope gets labeled as an anti-American, and it's simply not true,'' said Mr. Navarro, a Spanish layman. ''He doesn't dramatize the problems in the American church.'' **********In a formal sense at least, American Catholics are unusually faithful compared with their counterparts in many Western European countries. **********The American church never suffered from the reactions against state-imposed Catholicism that swept many nations in Europe, where the church was frequently allied with monarchy and absolutism. **********This is one reason that the mass attendance rates among American Catholics, despite a decline in the 1960's and early 1970's, are still among the highest in the world. Some estimates show that about half of the Catholics in America attend mass on an average Sunday. **********At the same time, the donations of American Catholics have helped to create an extraordinary network of institutions - schools and hospitals, universities and publications. **********Yet the very dynamism of the American church helps fuel the controversies within it. As descendants of an immigrant minority that struggled to preserve the faith on sometimes hostile territory, American Catholics are unusually fierce in holding on to their Catholic identity. **********''Being a Catholic is like being a member of a family,'' said Lisa Sowle Cahill, a liberal Catholic who is an associate professor of Christian ethics at Boston College. ''You have to be pushed out in order to break with it. It's not like any other voluntary organization.'' **********James P. McFadden, president of the National Committee of Catholic Laymen, a conservative group based in New York, agrees, albeit from an entirely different perspective. He argues that one of the church's gravest problems is that dissidents refuse to leave. **********''You don't need to be Catholic to be Catholic anymore,'' he said. ''If you dissent, you don't get out. That's the problem. Martin Luther looks like a prince compared to these people because he knew when it was time to go.'' **********Traditionalists have been heartened - and liberals worried - by John Paul's appointments to the hierarchy of the American church, symbolized by New York's Archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor, and Boston's Archbishop, Bernard Cardinal Law. The ''John Paul bishops'' now number about 90, and the steady appointment of more like-minded bishops is expected to push the American church in a more conservative direction. However, a moderate to liberal coalition led by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago still holds a substantial majority in the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. **********One result of strong loyalties is that anger and hurt are pronounced on both sides of the battlelines in the American church. Traditionalists like Mr. McFadden complain that those who are less than orthodox are trying to hijack the true church; liberals like Ms. Cahill complain that traditionalists want to throw them out altogether. **********Such talk underlines one point of agreement between Vatican officials and their critics in the American church: that the conflict is not only between liberal American Catholics and the Vatican, but also within the American church. The internal divisions are clear within the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as at the grass-roots level. An American Answer: Write to Rome One priest who is a close aide to the Pope chuckled recently about a letter the Vatican received from an American Catholic. The correspondent reported that his parish priest had urged parishioners to protest recent Vatican actions by boycotting the Peter's Pence collection that goes to support the Holy See. **********''He sent a check for $100 directly to us,'' the priest said, ''because he was afraid his priest wouldn't pass it on.'' **********Perhaps because of the United States' tradition of activism and democracy, Vatican officials say, traditionalist Catholics in the United States are far more likely than the faithful elsewhere to write to Rome and urge a crackdown against various forms of dissent. **********''Americans are used to writing their Congressman and getting action,'' said the Rev. Diarmuid Martin, an Irishman who is an official of the Pontifical Coucil for the Family. ''So American Catholics who are angry write the Vatican for action.'' **********The Vatican has acknowledged that a ''high volume of complaints'' were a factor in its actions against Archbishop Hunthausen. **********Liberals, skeptical of centralized authority and without much hope of finding a sympathetic ear in the Vatican, tend to write fewer missives, though there has recently been a flow of letters of protest. **********Some liberal Catholics worry that the traditionalists' love of letter writing has given the Vatican what Ms. Cahill called a ''distorted'' view of the American church, because the traditionalists often focus on the most extreme and bizarre forms of dissent. **********One Vatican official, a European who reads many of the letters of complaint, said he believed there was some truth to this assertion. But he added that he was nonetheless surprised ''at some of the amazing things that seem to go on in American church.'' **********He cited the example of a book used by an American diocese for preparing couples for marriage. Its section on the spiritual lives of couples, he said, began with the question, ''Have you ever thought of praying in the nude?'' **********''Is that really central to the spiritual lives of couples?'' he asked. ''Did it really have to be the first question?'' Dealing With Dissent: What Are the Limits? **********The root question in nearly all the disputes involving the American Catholics is the nature of church teachings and the extent to which the church can permit dissent and disobedience. **********The Rev. Richard A. McCormick, a professor of Christian ethics at the University of Notre Dame, warned against a static view of orthodoxy, which he said amounted to ''faith in formaldehyde.'' **********In an important statement of the liberal theological position in America, the Jesuit weekly, in November, Father McCormick wrote, ''One of theology's most important roles is a critical one, a distancing from past formulations and the proposal of new ones more adequate to the circumstances and insights of the time.'' **********Because of the United States' democratic tradition, and because Roman Catholics have always been a religious minority in a predominantly Protestant nation, Catholics in the United States have been among the stoutest defenders inside the church of the idea of ''freedom of conscience.'' **********The Second Vatican Council's ''Declaration of Religious Liberty'' bore a heavy American imprint, notably that of the Jesuit theologian John Courtney Murray, who before the council had been virtually silenced under Pope Pius XII. **********Today, liberal American Catholics like Bishop James W. Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, a former president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, are at the forefront of the battle for ''collegiality,'' a diffusion of responsibility to the bishops and the national churches. And theologians like Father Curran are leading the battle for the rights of theologians to dissent. **********''The Catholic tradition has always emphasized that human reason can reflect on faith,'' said Father Curran, a professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington. ''Any tradition that says that faith and human reason can't contradict each other has the tools to deal with these problems.'' **********But to some Vatican officials, as well as to many conservative Catholics in the United States, the American liberals often seem intent on watering down the church's more unpopular teachings. **********''The problem in the American church is a problem about the structure of the church and where authority comes from,'' said Mr. Navarro, the Vatican spokesman. ''The Catholic Church says the bishops get their power as successors to the Apostles and the Pope as successor to St. Peter. That is the central issue.'' Rocco Buttiglione, an Italian who is one of the leading thinkers of Communione e Liberazione, a group that strongly supports John Paul's approach, echoes the private comments of many Vatican officials when he says Americans often confuse political structures with the church. **********''Democracy is a wonderful formula for political society, but the church is not a democracy,'' he said. ''Sometimes the church simply has to say unpopular things.'' The Battle Over Sexuality Certainly some of the things that the church has been saying about sexuality and the role of women are unpopular among many American Many Catholics cannot understand why a more ''modern'' attitude toward women's roles would shake the foundations of the church, or why the birth control pill - invented, as it happened, by a Roman Catholic - should necessarily undermine the entire structure of Catholic moral teaching. **********The question of women's rights has special resonance in the United States, not only because of the strength of its women's movement but also because women - particularly nuns - have played an unusually large role in building American Catholicism. The American bishops have encountered difficulty in drafting a pastoral letter on the subject, not only because of divisions among them but also because of fears of appearing to move beyond Vatican teaching. **********The sexual revolution may have shaken the Catholic Church more than most other American institutions because the church's members cleaved so faithfully - and for so long - to traditional morality, especially on birth control. **********In a study published in 1963, the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the American author and sociologist, found substantial acceptance among Catholics of the church's birth control teaching. But between 1963 and 1974, astonishing changes took place: opposition to birth control, for example, fell from 52 percent to 13 percent, to divorce from 46 to 25 percent. **********The revolt against the church's sexual teaching was paralleled by a decline in church attendance, and Father Greeley argues that the church's ban on contraception was the major cause of this disaffection. **********In a carefully worded speech at a bishops' synod in Rome in 1980, Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco said he supported the church's teaching on birth control, but added a pointed reference to widespread dissent. ''Unless one is willing to dismiss the attitude of all these people as obduracy, ignorance or bad will,'' he said, ''this widespread opposition must give rise to serious concern.'' **********But most Vatican officials, and especially the Pope, argue that American Catholic dissenters are merely deceiving themselves by claiming that sinful acts are somehow not sinful. **********''Man commits sin without calling by name what he does,'' the Pope said in his Easter sermon this year in a typical passage. ''But this is not the way of liberation. This is only the way of falsifying the truth.'' **********A Vatican official added that the Vatican understood the deep cultural revolution that had taken place in the United States, but that this only underlined the fundamental question: the extent to which church is prepared to resist trends in society that it thinks are wrong. Even if this involves some losses in formal allegiance, the official said, ''it might be worth some losses to preserve the church.'' **********But more liberal American Catholics, fierce in their identity and accustomed to due process and open debate, are not likely to go quietly - if at all. ---- NEXT: A more universal church.  SOME CATHOLICS CALL FOR CHANGE  Some say that the official position of the Catholic Church on sexual morals should bot be changed. Others say that this position should be changed to reflect trends in the modern world. Which point of view more closely reflects your own opinion?

Because it is sponsored by the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, it is considered certain to pass and become law. **********A new Mexico City Attorney General has been named by President Miguel de la Madrid and instructed to end to the use of torture by the Attorney General's agents, under whose jurisdiction the prisoners were being detained when the earthquakes struck. **********Human rights activists in the opposition parties see the anti-torture bill and the appointment of the new Attorney General as an effort by the Government to forestall criticism abroad. **********Members of the ruling party say the bill represents the Government's continuing effort to improve human rights conditions. A Reputation for Torture **********Although public attention has generally focused on torture of political prisoners, torture of ordinary criminal suspects is common by police throughout Latin America. Torture is used to obtain confessions and information, or sometimes to extort money. **********The Mexican police have a reputation for torturing prisoners. Police torture of prisoners is a common theme on the radio program ''Inocente o Culpable'' - Innocent or Guilty -broadcast by the journalist Paco Huerta on a Mexico City radio station. Mr. Huerta goes into prisons and interviews convicts and then broadcasts their stories. He said almost everyone he interviews describes receiving some form of torture at the hands of the police. **********''There has always been torture in Mexico,'' said Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, Mexico's leading human rights activist and the presidential candidate of the Revolutionary Workers Party in 1982. **********''Torture is not only for political activists or drug traffickers,'' she said. ''Whatever citizen falls into the hands of the police becomes a victim of maltreatment.'' **********''I acknowledge that some public servants, police agents, do commit or have committed acts of torture,'' Renato Sales Gasque, the new Attorney General for Mexico City, said in a recent interview. But he emphasized his belief that torture was not ordered by senior law enforcement officials or part of the Government's policy. Prisoners Were Colombians **********The anti-torture movement gained strength in the aftermath of the great earthquakes Sept. 19 and 20 that destroyed hundreds of buildings in Mexico City, including the Attorney General's office building. Rescuers found the bodies of eight Colombians in the rubble, killed when the structure collapsed. **********The discovery was quickly followed by reports that the bodies showed signs of torture and that the Colombians, detained in connection with drug trafficking and bank robberies, had been illegally detained and tortured by members of the Attorney General's investigatory police. **********An investigation ordered by the Attorney General at that time, Victoria Adato de Ibarra, concluded that the Colombians had not been tortured or detained illegally. **********Opposition members in the Chamber of Deputies attacked the investigation and demanded that Mrs. Adato come before them to answer questions. She appeared before the chamber's justice committee, and committee members later said she admitted the use of torture and illegal detentions by her office's police force. **********In mid-December, after three months of attacks from newspapers and opposition politicians, Mrs. Adato stepped down and was named to Mexico's Supreme Court. President de la Madrid then appointed Mr. Sales Gasque as Attorney General. Comparison to Chile **********Mexico's Constitution forbids human rights abuses. Changes in Mexican law providing penalties for those who commit torture had been under consideration before the earthquake by the Senate Human Rights Committee. **********But after the discovery of the Colombians, the committee's president, Senator Gonzalo Martinez Corbala, introduced a new bill that would provide jail terms of from two to eight years for anyone convicted of torturing a prisoner and contains other provisions forbidding either physical or mental coercion. **********Senator Martinez was Mexico's Ambassador to Chile during the overthrow of the leftist Government of Salvador Allende Gossens and the establishment of the military Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. **********''I was a witness there to indescribable torture, and since then I have been concerned about power structures like Pinochet's based on torture,'' he said. ''We don't want Mexico to be anything like what has happened there.'' A Show of Resolve **********Although some groups have questioned how rigorously the Government will enforce a law banning torture, Mr. Sales Gasque said torture will no longer be permitted. **********''I have warned all the public servants of this office that anyone who commits an act of torture will be prosecuted,'' he said.

No one has reported seeing the former Cambodian leader in China. **********But Cambodian exiles close to the resistance coalition to which the Khmer Rouge now belong, say Mr. Pol Pot's organization is split between the followers of Son Sen, who is now the group's military leader, and Ta Mok, a notorious former regional commander thought to be responsible for many of the deaths that took place under the Khmer Rouge regime. **********Resistance fighters say the dispute between the two groups has turned to armed combat on several recent occasions. They say the Chinese, who have backed the Khmer Rouge because of Mr. Pol Pot's willingness to battle the Vietnamese, will have to sort out the organization's leadership crisis before any announcements can be made about its future. **********Reports about Mr. Pol Pot's health have circulated on several other occasions in recent years. But the new information is drawing more attention because it comes at a time of considerable diplomatic activity, raising questions about whether some movement may be about to take place in the long-stalled issue of how to end the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. **********The future of Mr. Pol Pot would be central to any settlement of the eight-year-old war between Hanoi's troops and Cambodian nationalist guerrillas. **********The Chinese have been under pressure from non-Communist Southeast Asians to remove him from active involvement in Cambodian affairs. His announced ''resignation'' in 1985 may have been a step in that direction. On Chinese Contacts **********Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who leads a three-part Cambodian resistance coalition that includes the Khmer Rouge, said earlier this year in Bangkok that increasing Chinese contacts with the West have made Beijing more aware of the repugnance with which Pol Pot is regarded abroad. **********But officials say China has persisted in believing that only a sustained Khmer Rouge threat could force the Vietnamese to negotiate. In opposition, Pol Pot has continued to be a potent force inside Cambodia, despite the presence of about 140,000 Vietnamese troops. Hanoi's army has been unable to defeat the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in eight years of war. Two noncommunist armies are also growing. **********Now, however, seemingly disparate events in Communist Indochina as well as in Moscow, Bejing and possibly even Washington may be coming together to change attitudes on the Cambodia issue, some Southeast Asian officials suggest. **********Vietnam, which has occupied Cambodia since 1979, when Hanoi overthrew the Pol Pot regime after failing to exert any control over it, is preparing for an important Communist Party congress Dec. 15. **********The country is in very serious economic trouble, and there have been strong hints in recent speeches by its leaders that Moscow, which gives Hanoi nearly a billion dollars a year in support for its economy and its war in Cambodia, is not happy with its ally's performance on either front. **********China has steped in to offer Vietnam aid, but only in return for a withdrawal from Cambodia. **********At the same time, the Soviet Union, seeking to improve its relations not only with Southeast Asia and the Pacific, but also with China, has been told in almost every regional capital that Moscow will first have to stop backing the Vietnamese in Cambodia. **********With little fanfare, Hanoi recently proposed to Prince Sihanouk through an Austrian intermediary, a meeting of the various Cambodian factions, both resistance groups and the leadership in Phnom Penh. On Pol Pot Influence **********The Vietnamese-installed Government there is led by Heng Samrin, the Communist party leader, and the increasingly powerful Prime Minister, Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official. In meeting foreign guests, Mr. Hun Sen makes a point of saying that only the ''Pol Pot'' clique must be ''eliminated.'' Other Khmer Rouge cadres are welcome to return. **********As the dry season along the Thai-Cambodian border begins - the months when the Vietnamese normally attack the Cambodian resistance forces that strike from the frontier -there has been an unusual amount of diplomatic activity between Thailand and the Indochinese nations. **********A high-level Thai delegation has just returned from talks with Laotian leaders about bettering the atmosphere between these two culturally similar nations. Laos, where there are 40,000 Vietnamese troops, has also said it is preparing to open talks with China. Thailand has now removed a ban on the sale of strategic goods, including explosives and combat aircraft, to Laos. **********Thai military leaders have been playing down fears of Vietnamese intrusions along on the border with Cambodia, and Thai Government negotiators have agreed to pay Vietnam about $400,000 in fines and expenses to free Thai fishermen who were caught in Vietnamese waters. **********Hanoi, for its part, has just sent to Bangkok as Ambassador one of its most experienced diplomats, Le Mai.

Although investment professionals have varying views of the Bank of America's long-term prospects, they agree on one point: The bank will make another huge provision for loan losses - anywhere from $400 million to $500 million - and it is expected to write off an equal amount of loans. The bank has said it would have no comment before issuing the report. **********This would bring the total amount of loans written off by the bank for 1985 close to $2 billion. The figure is not the most ever written off by a bank but is nonetheless alarming, even for a financial institution as big as the Bank of America, according to analysts. The bank is the nation's second-largest, after Citibank. **********The continued high level of loan losses is expected to cause BankAmerica to report only a modest fourth-quarter profit. **********The First Boston Corporation estimates the earnings at $60 million, or 40 cents a share. Shearson Lehman Brothers predicts $30 million, or 20 cents a share. Most analysts say BankAmerica would be reporting a net loss if it had not sold FinanceAmerica, a finance company, to the Chrysler Corporation and listed the gain from the sale in the fourth quarter. **********''The nonperforming loans will continue to depress earnings until the companies they have lent to turn around,'' said Andrew M. Aran, who follows BankAmerica for the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ''They have made progress in the last year or so, but the benefits are slow in coming.'' **********Moving to reverse its problems, BankAmerica is closing part of its branch network, introducing money-saving automatic tellers and offering early retirement to bank managers. Meanwhile the bank faces little, if any, risk of a run: A lot of the deposits were made by tens of thousands of individual savers, whose deposits are insured, as opposed to uninsured large deposits placed by institutional investors. **********''Depositors cannot perceive any difference in their daily dealings with this bank,'' said Richard Bove of Shearson. ''You cannot convince them that they will ever lose a nickel from the Bank of America.'' **********A nagging problem, however, is that BankAmerica has lent heavily in three depressed sectors: farming, real estate and the third world. **********Moody's Investors Service announced Friday that it was lowering its ratings on the bank holding company's senior debt and commercial paper and on debt of the bank itself. Although the changes are slight, they underscore the fact that BankAmerica faces some pressing questions. **********For one thing, directors must decide whether to keep BankAmerica's quarterly dividend at 20 cents a share. The dividend has already been cut once, and Wall Street has heard rumors that the directors will reduce it again in early February. **********Another issue concerns the job of Samuel H. Armacost, BankAmerica's chief executive officer. Many analysts have said he would be asked to step down if he could not restore the Bank of America to solid profitability in 1985. Since this was not achieved, his future may be unclear. **********''It amazes me how long Sam has stayed, but his support still seems strong,'' said an analyst who asked to remain unnamed. **********Insiders say Mr. Armacost has the support of virtually all the BankAmerica directors. One exception is Charles Schwab, who sold his discount brokerage house to BankAmerica three years ago. As a result of BankAmerica's problems, Mr. Schwab's holdings in the company have slumped in value.

His latest accord, for Rollins Communications Inc., will make Heritage a major force in the highly competitive cable TV industry, according to industry analysts. **********Mr. Hoak, who is 42 years old, recently completed a complex agreement with the Rollins family that gives Heritage the option to buy Rollins Communications for about $600 million. Rollins, which has 206,000 cable subscribers in 43 cities, owns four TV stations, six radio stations and an outdoor advertising company. **********Fred Seegal of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment bankers that represented Heritage in the Rollins deal, said that it was Mr. Hoak's ''people skills'' that made the deal work.

''Now, I hear about a sighting, I jump in my Peugeot to where they're beached, help with the killing and selecting and I'm back in an hour or two. The idyll doesn't exist anymore.'' **********That is exactly the point of the environmentalists who have congregated here like missionaries in recent years, brandishing science as much as righteousness as they condemn the modern kill as a gross act of leisurely, hedonistic waste. A Fixture for Centuries **********Critics who have stalked the hunters stalking the whales have described numerous incidents of gratuitous brutality and bravado with gaffs and high-speed motorboats. **********They measure the turmoil and communicative squeals of the pilot whales herded in for the traditional open slaughters. The kills, a community fixture for centuries, make a pink froth of the shoreline and a macabre haven of the picturesque Faeroese coves as villagers drop their regular occupations to get whale meat for their tables and freezers. **********''The whales' cries as they are slaughtered have caused some hunters to stop taking part in the kills,'' observed Allan Thornton, director of the Environmental Investigation Agency. This is a private group sponsored by the International Fund for Animal Welfare that infuriated Faeroese villagers a year ago by darting ahead of the hunters and sounding horns to herd some doomed whales back toward sea. **********Kjartan Hoydal, a Faeroese who savors his right to kill and eat whale, is a scientist who is director of the Government's fisheries department. He patiently defends the Faeroese record in the hunt from the persistent environmentalists, whose power has been considerably demonstrated to the west in Iceland. **********There, in a different confrontation involving fin whales, Government officals have yielded to Washington's threats of economic sanctions because of wasteful slaughter under the standards of the International Whaling Commission. In remedy, Icelanders have begun temporarily consuming larger amounts of whale meat until the existing surplus is gone. 'Not Some Simple Sport' **********Mr. Hoydal said there was no such waste here. Even in these high-income times rooted in the islands' booming, modernized fishing industry, the whale hunt still serves the same subsistence need of harder-pressed inhabitants as it did after the Norsemen sailed in a millenium ago, he insisted. **********''It's tied to a whole way of life and involves a great deal of labor, not some simple sport,'' said Mr. Hoydal, who took part in a kill last month not as a scientist but as a native raised in the tradition. A herd of 138 whales was beached and ''dispatched'' in nine minutes under new and more humane regulations, he said. **********The Faeroes is a chain of 18 islands magnificently isolated in the North Atlantic, rising in vertical green triumph from the often omnipotent sea. Proud of their independent, home-rule relationship within the kingdom of Denmark, the Faeroese speak a language derived from Old Norse. **********With no kills abroad on a sunny weekend, the islands offered the serenity of space travel. The people reflected the peace of those who live in a kind of hilly ocean pasturage set hard amid the elements, equidistant from the coasts of Scandinavia, Scotland and Iceland. **********The new whaling regulations might be measured within this nation's canny history of adapting to outside challenges. They include the requirement that before a whale's spinal cord is severed its carotid artery must now be cut to speed death as in an abattoir. Mr. Hoydal says antiquated spears have now been banned and clumsy gaffs restricted more, with more effective beaching of the whales required where the slaughter can be more lamb-like than in the frenzy of an armada of hunters hacking about the open bays. Changes Seen as Cosmetic **********Environmentalists like Mr. Thornton feel these changes are cosmetic and unenforceable amid the passions of a crowd taking to the kill. He is pressing the question of whether the slaughter of any whales should be tolerated. The average lately is 2,400 slain a year in the islands, which have a human population of 46,000. **********''An escalation in the opposition to the pilot whale hunt appears inevitable,'' Mr. Thornton wrote earlier this year as other critics threatened a boycott of Faeroese fish products - an alarming possibility for a $375-million annual industry that produces 97 percent of the islands' export trade. **********Mr. Danielsen, in regretting the lost idyll of his boyhood hunt, is most sensitive to the boycott threats since he is director of Faeroese Seafood, a cooperative of 160 major fish producers. ''I don't love all the environmentalists, but in a way we owe them a bit of thanks,'' he said. ''It is time to show the world we can change.'' **********He proposes research for a better killing tool, much stricter enforcement of humane beaching procedures, and a fairer, less wasteful sharing of the meat among the population. Need Is Called Negligible **********The environmentalists arrive now as determinedly as the pilot whales that eat the squid fleeing their own predators to coastal sanctuaries. Critics calculate the islanders' protein need of whale meat is negligible in this fish-eating nation.

For the last two decades, it has signified Tokyo's relentless conquest of foreign markets. Today, it could be the soaring yen, a serious threat to global economic stability. **********When Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker and their Japanese and European counterparts announced agreement to jack up Japan's currency and push down the dollar last September, the yen began its 35 percent rise against the greenback. Both Washington and Tokyo wanted the same thing: better trade balances. The trick was to do this without producing recession in both economies. But the plan isn't working, and a bolder initiative to manage currencies and trade is needed. **********For the United States, the biggest risk is that the dollar falls too much and too fast, causing panicky foreigners (who now fund some 45 percent of our budget deficits) to reduce their investments here. A drying up of this money would put severe pressure on the supply of domestic capital, raising interest rates, rekindling inflation, forcing the dollar up and again clobbering exports. **********For Japan, the strengthening yen has caused the first quarterly contraction in growth in 11 years and major downward revisions in 1986 growth projections. It has reduced by 15 to 20 percent the reported profits of such companies as Mazda, Toray, Hitachi and other major export industries. It has led to widespread bankruptcies of small exporters and to serious unemployment. **********For the rest of East Asia, where most local currencies are pegged to the dollar, there are new opportunities to underprice Japanese products in the United States and in Japan itself, but the resulting export surges are bound to spur new trade restrictions in Washington. Countries like Indonesia and Burma, whose external yen debt is between 20 percent and 30 percent of overall obligations, are now squeezed to repay Japanese creditors. **********The most significant problem, however, is Washington's dashed expectations about how the new yen-dollar parity would improve America's trade balance. For the result has been the opposite: We continue to run record deficits, which could exceed last year's $148 billion, while Japan racks up record surpluses, now expected to surpass last year's $56 billion by nearly 50 percent. **********The biggest cause for disappointment is overreliance on the exchange rate itself to right the enormous imbalances. It will take much more - a narrowing of our budget deficit, faster growth in Japan, a more sustained campaign to raise Japan's imports. The disparaties between Japan, the world's largest creditor, and the United States, the largest debtor, are too great to be handled with price changes in currencies. **********An impatient Administration, egged on by a Congress under the pressure of this November's election, is now sure to press hard for an even stronger yen and a much weaker dollar. Indeed this is a ready-made political expedient, since the yen-dollar ratio is so easily displayed and explained in daily newspapers or on the evening news. **********What's wrong with current policies to manage the yen-dollar relationship? The Bank of Japan has been buying dollars to prop up the American currency and keep the relative value of the yen from rising too fast. There is no supportive American intervention, however, and the more frequent Tokyo's single-handed interventions become the more blase is the market reaction. **********America has lowered interest rates to reduce the attractiveness of holding dollars. But these moves are not synchronized with Japanese policies, and every time our rates go down a notch, a free fall of the dollar becomes more likely. Both Japanese and American officials try to ''talk'' each other's currency ''up'' or ''down,'' but the remarks appear uncoordinated, and this tactic, too, will soon be discounted by currency traders. **********The stakes are so high for the United States, Japan, Asia and the world trading system that a more formal monetary arrangement is urgently needed. The following principles should govern: FIRST, the yen-dollar relationship should not be left to the current type of improvisation - instead, it should be deliberately managed. Beginning with the existing yen-dollar values, both Governments should agree on where exchange rates should go in the future. The currencies would then move within a pre-agreed range - a band with a ceiling and floor - that itself could be adjusted upward or downward. Guidelines would be set for joint intervention and coordinated interest-rate movements. To keep currency speculators off guard, details of the agreement should be kept secret. **********Second, exchange rates themselves should not be the only lever to influence the trends. For example, Japan's tax policies should be revamped to allow more rapid domestic growth; give Ricoh and Sony more reason to produce for the home market and Mr. and Mrs. Saito more income to buy A.T.&T. phones or 20th Century-Fox movies. For its part, the United States must commit to specific fiscal deficit targets while maintaining relentless pressure on Japan to increase its imports. **********Third, given the broad political and economic impact of currency movements, targets for the yen and the dollar cannot be left just to treasuries and central banks, as is now the case. Trade ministers and foreign ministers have a role also. One major benefit of a new pact would be to unify the positions and views within each of the two governments. Washington, for example, is like a tower of Babel when it comes to the dollar. Factional politics in Tokyo made coordination there almost impossible. **********A monetary agreement would be unprecedented for the United States, which has historically pretended that a free market for currencies does or should exist, even while governments simultaneously manipulate fiscal, monetary and trade policies - all of which vitally affect currencies. It would be a fundamental change for Japan, too, which has never liked to be bound by accords, preferring instead the freedom to make vague, unilateral concessions while following through half-heartedly. **********Ideally, monetary reform would include many more countries, particularly West Germany. But governments have jawed about grand schemes for years and progress is painfully slow. Moreover, while much of the world's economic elite is preoccupied with dollars, sterling and Deutsche marks, the yen is moving on to center stage as fast as Toyota did in autos or Nomura did in securities. Two years ago, for example, 40 percent of Japanese exports were invoiced in yen; today it is over 50 percent. In 1982, Euroyen bond issues totaled $374 million; last year the amount exceeded $6.5 billion. Trade across the Pacific now exceeds that across the Atlantic, and marks and pounds sterling will not play much of a role there. **********If the United States and Japan can synchronize their trade and currency policies, the way would be paved for similar agreements involving other major industrial nations. If they cannot, there is no hope."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/business/business-people-president-promoted-at-bankers-trust.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-06-19", "snippet": "", "word_count": 342, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "President Promoted At Bankers Trust", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; President Promoted At Bankers Trust", "body_text": " **********Charles S.

No Clear Sides **********''There aren't any clear sides, there are perhaps half a dozen groups shifting all the time,'' he said. ''It's impossible to see exactly how this works.'' He added that the groups were ''all waiting'' for the Ayatollah to die. **********Referring to the charismatic style of Iranian politics, he said: ''Its more a question of individual persons. Each of the leading set of personalities will have a following.'' **********The diplomat was asked about reports in the Western press that the United States hoped, by secretly supplying arms to Iran in its more than six-year-old war with Iraq, to support a faction described as composed of military men and the intelligentsia against militant religious figures. **********''I don't think this is the main grouping,'' the diplomat said. **********Indeed, all of the main political debate in Iran is carried out in religious terms, with rival groups claiming the correct line of Islam and nationalism, with the United States and, to a slightly lesser extent, the Soviet Union, as targets of the oratory. Religious Leaders Compete **********A number of experts on the area have suggested in recent years a general formulation that pits one set of religious leaders, or mullahs, who might be described in Western terms as populists, against another group who represent older landed, semifeudal wealthy classes. **********While both sides hew to their vision of Islamic fundamentalism - mounting patrols, for example, to insure that women are fully veiled - each also has a class interest. **********By this interpretation, the mullahs -often inspired by the preachings of Ayatollah Khomeini during and after the time when he was exiled by the Shah in the 1960's - often came from poor backgrounds and attended the relatively plebian theolgical seminaries in the holy city of Qum. **********The other faction, tending to come from wealthy, established, religious families, often major landholders, attended the more prestigious religious school in Meshed, site of the gold-domed shrine of the Imam Riza, the only one of the 12 Shiite imams buried in Iran. **********''That formulation is still the most valid,'' the diplomat said. ''You do have these more socially radical people like Montezari and Khomeini and the more conservative ones centering on the old Grand Ayatollahs.'' Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montezari has been designated as the successor to Ayatollah Khomeini. Power of a Council Cited **********The diplomat noted that the Council of Guardians, a 12 member body of older religious judges, was still able to block legislation enacted by Parliament for land redistribution and for nationalization of imports proposed by the more socially radical clergy on Islamic grounds, thus favoring the interests of wealthy landholders and major merchants in the bazaar. **********Reviewing the political players, the diplomat described the Speaker of Parliament, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, as having a powerful base in the legislature. **********One of the more mysterious aspects of the current situation, the diplomat said, is Ayatollah Montezari's position. **********Ayatollah Montezari's political power came into question recently with the arrest of one of his chief aides, Mehdi Hashemi, who is his son-in-law. Mr. Hashemi had managed Ayatollah Montezari's office, including the committee in charge of exporting the fundamentalist Islamic revolution to Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. **********''This brings us back to the power struggle,'' the diplomat said. **********''There have been rumors that Montezari was opposing the big offensive in the war, and somebody on the more extreme side was unhappy about this, but it's probably more complicated,'' . **********He added: ''It could look like an attack on the committee to export the revolution, but more likely someone wants to take it over. But all the time Montezari has been a protege of the old man, so when you attack him, you attack Khomeini. It would be a typical devious Iranian way.'' **********Ayatollah Khomeini, in the speech today monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, brushed aside the thought that his demise would end Islamic rule in Iran. ''Every day there are rumors that this and that has happened,'' he said, ''that so and so has had a heart attack, that so and so is on his death bed.'' **********He continued: ''Of course death comes to everyone and me too. They should not rejoice. This is something that happens, and you will see that, God willing, the Islamic Republic will remain, whether or not I stay.''"}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/business/the-executive-computer-a-short-cut-to-the-best-solution.html": {"writer_name": "Erik Sandberg-Diment", "pub_date": "1986-07-13", "snippet": "", "word_count": 1026, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "A SHORT-CUT TO THE BEST SOLUTION", "print_headline": "THE EXECUTIVE COMPUTER; A SHORT-CUT TO THE BEST SOLUTION", "body_text": " **********''WHAT if?'' was the question that launched a million micros. Personal computing in the business world came of age with the spreadsheet, first VisiCalc legitimizing the Apple II, then Lotus 1-2-3 driving the I.B.M. PC to stellar success. **********''What if?'' was a catchy marketing phrase, too. It gave the uninitiated a quick insight into some of the things that microcomputers could do, supplying them with that much vaunted reason to buy. But after they had been using the product for a while, it became obvious that the real question for which answers were being sought was ''What's best?'' It is not surprising, then, that someone has introduced a product named precisely that. **********Before proceeding any further, let me hasten to add that What's Best! (available for the I.B.M. PC and compatibles in three versions, each offering increased power, for $149, $695 and $995, respectively, from General Optimization Inc., Chicago, 60614, (800) 441-BEST) is not merely another spreadsheet clone or a simple template. It is a spreadsheet add-on to be run with Lotus 1-2-3, that transforms this familiar software tool from one capable of finding the merely satisfactory solution, into one capable of finding the optimal answer. **********The method employed by What's Best! to achieve this end - here comes the dirty word - is linear programming. Don't stop reading, please. **********When all is said and done, probably the best move General Optimization made in releasing What's Best! was one of omission, namely, never mentioning linear programming. Advertisements spoke of ''the previously arcane world of mathematical optimization,'' and there was only a passing reference to linear programming in the first chapter of the manual. **********The fact is that anyone familiar with Lotus 1-2-3 can put What's Best! to considerable use without ever knowing that linear programming is at its core. Had the term appeared prominently where any potential buyer might have seen it, chances are that no one would ever have even glanced at the program, which would have been a real shame. The very term ''linear programming'' makes my eyes and those of most ordinary people glaze over. **********If one is fortunate enough to have never encountered the concept of linear programming or tried to struggle through, say, Roger D. Eck's ''Operations Research for Business,'' so much the better. One need not know that ''the objective function can be expressed in the form z - c#1x#1 + c#2x#2 + . . . c1.5 >nxn, where c#1, c#2, . . . cn are constants that can have any real value,'' as Mr. Eck launches his discussion of the concept. **********What one does need to appreciate is that in determining, say, the best product mix for a company that makes a number of different items, the best choice may not be the intuitive one. The first assumption underlying linear programming is that one wishes either to maximize something - profit, maybe, or market share - or to minimize something -cost, or perhaps the time needed to complete a project. The second assumption is that the factors leading to such optimization can be strung together algebraically to yield alternative solutions, one of which will prove to be the very best of all. A BASIC corrollary of linear programming is that one or more identifiable variables influence the result for which one is striving, usually referred to as the objective. Furthermore, it is assumed that these variables can be quantified. The number of widgets on hand, for example, can be stated with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, employee attitude during overtime fits less neatly, if at all, into any kind of an equation. **********Essentially, there are three possible types of answers to most business questions. First, there are cases where only one answer is feasible, as in the issue of whether or not to pay the I.R.S. Secondly, there are cases where there simply is no viable solution to a problem, as happens when, say, a company has a negative net worth, no cash on hand and the banks demanding that a $1.3 million loan be paid within 24 hours. **********Third are the situations where there are any number of possible answers - all of which could be correct in the sense of being workable alternatives. There might, in fact, be such an array of them that determining which one is the most correct becomes a seemingly unmanageable task. This is where linear programming shines. **********Consider a farmer who has 300 acres of tillable land. Let's say the crops among which he is trying to choose are corn, soybeans and hay. His objective is to maximize profits. If an acre of corn yields $60 profit at current market prices, an acre of hay $50 and an acre of soybeans $40, the obvious course to success is to plant corn. **********However, there are certain factors, called constraints, which limit otherwise feasible values. The most obvious of these in the case of our farmer is the 300 acres. Growing 600 acres of corn would certainly be more profitable than growing 300. But that is not possible under the given circumstances. A less obvious constraint would be a government price support program prohibiting the total acreage planted to corn from exceeding twice that devoted to the cultivation of soybeans. **********Another potential constraint lurks in the fact that the money realizable from such a price support program would not be available for a considerable time to come. On the other hand, payments for a hay crop would be cash on the barrel head as soon as it was baled in the field, and it could be unreported income, at that. **********All in all, there could easily be enough variables in even such a seemingly simple set of alternatives to keep the most dedicated spreadsheet aficionado in a tailspin trying to work through all the choices before planting time. It is in tackling such endlessly interacting choices that What's Best! does its best. The agility of the program's operations in this respect will be covered next week."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/17/business/finance-new-issues-japanese-studying-bond-investments.html": {"writer_name": null, "pub_date": "1986-09-17", "snippet": "", "word_count": 254, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Japanese Studying Bond Investments", "print_headline": "FINANCE/NEW ISSUES; Japanese Studying Bond Investments", "body_text": " **********The Japanese Finance Ministry is in the last stages of a study that would allow Japanese banks to increase their holdings of foreign currencies needed for investment in foreign bonds, ministry sources said. **********The study is in line with Finance Minister Kichi Miyazawa's instructions that ministry officials study various measures to encourage larger capital outflows from Japan that would help stop a further increase in the value of the yen. **********The yen, which has traded at a rate of about 155 to the American dollar recently, has appreciated so sharply in the last year that large Japanese exporters are suffering, and growth in the domestic economy has been sharply reduced. **********The ministry is looking at the volume of extra exchange holdings per bank, foreign exchange hedging of bond holdings and terms of the bond investments, the sources said. **********In the past, foreign exchange holdings for normal foreign exchange trading operations and for investments in foreign securities had been limited, depending on each bank's capitalization and other factors. **********Banking sources said details of the ministry's plan were not known, but they expected that proposals to allow increased holdings of foreign exchange were designed for pure yen asset investment in foreign securities over one year without foreign exchange hedging. **********Because of high risks from fluctuating interest rates and foreign exchange rates, commercial banks may be wary of greatly increasing their investments in foreign securities, the banking sources said."}, "https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/23/business/business-people-steiger-tractor-s-chief-confident-despite-woes.html": {"writer_name": "Daniel Cuff", "pub_date": "1986-06-23", "snippet": "", "word_count": 340, "score": null, "source": "The New York Times", "section_name": "Business Day", "type_of_material": "News", "document_type": "article", "main_headline": "Steiger Tractor's Chief Confident Despite Woes", "print_headline": "BUSINESS PEOPLE; Steiger Tractor's Chief Confident Despite Woes", "body_text": " **********Irvin E.

For months, only intermittently did they rise above the level of a year earlier. In May, however, some positive signs of life were found in sales of consumer electronics, refrigerators, laundry equipment, furniture and related products. **********Analysts say the pickup in durables could bode well for the earnings and equities of a number of major retail companies. **********They point out that department stores have moved aggressively into apparel in recent years because of higher markups while discontinuing some of their home furnishings departments. But durable goods remain important for many stores. **********In typical department stores, durables still account for about 32 percent of sales while soft lines represent 68 percent. As for profitability, however, the ratio is different: Soft lines contribute at least 90 percent to most department stores' profits. **********Yet shoppers seem to be attracted by stores with a full line of merchandise. And even if they do not buy the big-ticket items, they are apt to purchase something else in the store. Durables also help pay for general overhead even though they require more costly salespeople and attention than soft goods do. While the price-cutting competition keeps profits on durables low, the total sales in dollars raise the stores' revenue. **********''Our stores are really too big just to sell soft goods if we were to close all our hard-lines departments,'' one retail executive said. **********If the trend of durable sales improves, the outlook for retailing could change. Last week when several major retailers - Sears, Roebuck & Company, Montgomery Ward and several other chains - noted a pickup in durables, merchants and analysts expressed optimism about a possible improvement in total retail sales. **********''The durables improvement is skewed to housing turnover and new housing starts, which experienced a meaningful acceleration in the last half of 1985 and especially in the 1986 first quarter,'' said Gerald Farber, a partner at Weiss, Peck & Greer, the New York investment management firm that also operates the Tudor Fund. ''We already see the results at such home-improvement firms as the Home Depot, Lowe's Companies and Payless Cashways. Sears had an uptick in durables, too.'' **********Goldman, Sachs & Company recommends purchasing shares of the Dayton-Hudson Corporation and Dillard Department Stores as well as May Department Stores, K Mart Corporation and J. C. Penney Company. Buying Sears, Roebuck stock is recommended by L. F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. Penney's also has a supporter in Shearson Lehman Brothers, which recently raised its 1986 estimate of the retailer's earnings. **********At Sears headquarters in Chicago, a spokesman commented, ''May sales of durables, particularly those that are housing-related, were exceptionally strong compared with a year ago.'' **********A spokesman for Montgomery Ward, also based in Chicago, said, ''Furniture and air-conditioners were really strong last month, although microwave ovens were weak.'' **********However, even with the advance in durables, overall retail sales in May were mostly only modestly higher than in April and a year before. **********A cross section of year-to-year gains included: Sears, 3.9 percent; K Mart, 4.9 percent; Federated Department Stores, 3.8 percent; Dayton-Hudson, 9 percent; May Department Stores, 11.3 percent; Allied Stores, 7.9 percent, and Montgomery Ward, 1 percent. **********Mr. Farber of Weiss, Peck & Greer predicts that retail sales in the next six months will be ''a fits-and-starts'' affair, although the second half should show a ''modest improvement'' over the first half. ''We think that as the year progresses,'' he said, ''business will benefit as a function of an increasing after-tax discretionary income.'' **********But American consumers' confidence declined in May for its biggest drop in a year, according to the Conference Board. This business-sponsored research organization said its May consumer confidence index fell to 96.1 from April's 99. **********Reporting on the survey of 5,000 households, Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, said: ''For months now, the economy has been waiting for consumer spending to provide the thrust for accelerated growth. Latest readings, however, suggest that this moment has not yet arrived.'' **********For the last year, the high rate of consumer debt has been viewed as the culprit in holding down retail sales, particularly of such big-ticket durable items as automobiles and household goods. But Joseph Ellis, senior analyst for Goldman, Sachs, declares that, ''given the disparity between mortgage rates and interest charges on revolving credit,'' an increasing portion of installment buying may find its way into consumer spending for general merchandise. And retail sales, he added, should grow with a likely upturn in average hourly earnings. **********Durable goods could provide the first sign.

Felipe!'' they chanted, and after the obligatory warm-up speeches, Spain's Prime Minister mounted the speaker's stand. **********''If we don't win, I just want to say thanks for the four years you have given me,'' he said, but he then changed tones and added, ''If we win, we're going to make sure Spain is first - first in Europe and first in the world.'' **********The bullring erupted in cheers, and Spain's election campaign was under way. Mr. Gonzalez, running for his second four-year term, opened his race in this sunny Mediterranean region known for its sweet oranges, lusty rice dishes and Socialist leanings. **********Socialists Heavily Favored **********Polls and political analysts say Mr. Gonzalez and his Socialists are heavily favored to win the June 22 vote here and in the country at large. The opposition to his right and left is badly divided. Mr. Gonzalez moved the elections up from October to exploit that and his momentum after winning a referendum in March to keep Spain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. **********Opposition leaders concede a Socialist victory, but are fighting to at least deny the Socialists another majority in Parliament on their own, as the early polls predicted. The Socialists hold 202 of the 350 seats in Parliament. **********The opposition charges that a second Socialist majority will undermine democracy by giving the party too much power. Mr. Gonzalez responded this weekend by calling the more than 10 opposition parties an ''alphabet soup'' of initials and adding, ''I would prefer a right-wing government with a stable majority than a weak government that can't make decisions to solve problems.'' **********Behind the Socialist strength is a disciplined party machine and the popularity of the 44-year-old Mr. Gonzalez, whose youthful style and moderate policies have led to his being seen in polls as Spain's most trusted leader. Among his accomplishments are the consolidation of Spain's young democracy and the country's entry into the European Economic Community, ending centuries of isolation. Unemployment Rate High **********Jobs, however, are his greatest failure and the target of all the opposition campaigns. The official unemployment rate hovers at more than 20 percent. **********Here in Murcia, an arid region, citrus and vegetable growing are thriving but the region's shipbuilding and petrochemical plants have declined and unemployment is just under the national average. **********Disarmingly, Mr. Gonzalez conceded today that he had been mistaken in promising to create jobs four years ago. But he said inflation and a bloated budget deficit had been cut, the balance of payments put into surplus and the ailing financial and industrial sectors largely overhauled. The economy is now beginning to grow on solid ground, he said. **********The main opposition comes from the Popular Coalition, a three-party conservative bloc led by Manuel Fraga Iribarne, who was a minister under Francisco Franco. **********But in addition to being internally divided, the coalition faces a growing challenge from two center-right parties for the conservative vote. Center Group's Slogan **********''At last, the alternative,'' is the campaign slogan on posters that have been slapped up around the country this weekend by Miguel Roca, a Catalan who has sought to cobble together regional and centrist parties in a coalition called the Democratic Reform Party. The party, however, is only starting up in regions such as Murcia. **********Former Prime Minister Alfonso Suarez is seeking a comeback as head of the Social and Democratic Center. Polls project he will win a handful of seats based on widespread respect for his role in leading Spain through the transition after Franco's death 11 years ago. Mr. Suarez lacks an organized party but has great confidence. ''It is inevitable that I will again be president of the government,'' he said. **********The centrist parties and a number of regional parties, especially in the Basque country, could become important if the Socialists fail to win a majority and have to seek coalition partners. **********To the left of the Socialists, the situation is hardly more stable. A coalition of Marxists, pacifists and other forces that had joined together in an anti-NATO campaign have formed a coalition called the United Left. It is overwhelmingly dominated by the Spanish Communist Party. **********The Communists, however, are divided into a number of factions. One of them, led by Santiago Carrillo, the party's former leader and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, is outside the coalition. The Communists promise to pull Spain out of NATO if they win. **********Political advisers to Mr. Gonzalez are concerned that the predictions of victory could lead to Socialist voter apathy. Few young people were evident today in the bullring, for example. **********Adding to the fears of the Gonzalez campaign team is that the campaign coincides with the World Cup soccer championship in Mexico. The Spanish team opened against Brazil today, and Spaniards are such avid fans that even Mr. Gonzalez told reporters that he had asked one of his sons to videotape the first part of the game as he hurries back to Madrid to catch the end."}}
